In the final of the first {{monument}} of the year, Milan–San Remo, he was the strongest rider during the descent of the Poggio, but was outsprinted for victory by Simon Gerrans.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} little coverage the United Kingdom and elsewhere internationally, with its promotion being {{little more than}} a featured advert in the NME. <b>Closing</b> <b>Time</b> did not chart upon its release although in 2000, the album peaked at number 28 in the Irish Albums Chart. The album was certified Silver in the United Kingdom in 2004 with shipments of over 60,000 copies and was later certified Gold in 2012 with shipments of over 100,000 copies.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Closed</b> <b>time</b> is {{possible}} in several senses of ‘possible’. One might like to know, therefore, whether <b>closed</b> <b>time</b> {{is possible}} {{in the sense that}} it is compatible with standard metaphysical theories of time. In this paper I am concerned with whether <b>closed</b> <b>time</b> is compatible with A and/or B theories of time. A common enough view amongst philosophers is that B theories do but A theories do not allow <b>closed</b> <b>time.</b> However, I show that prima-facie neither approach allows <b>closed</b> <b>time,</b> but that with a little work standard versions of both approaches do. This shows that there’s no special problem with the notion of eternal return...|$|R

This was true even after adjusting for socio-demographic factors.|$|R
5|$|Until 1999, Metro ended {{service at}} midnight every night, and weekend service began at 8 am. That year, WMATA began late night service on Fridays and Saturdays until 1 am. By 2007, with {{encouragement}} from businesses, that <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> {{had been pushed}} back to 3 am, with peak fares in effect for entries after midnight. There were plans floated to end late night service due to costs in 2011, but they were met with resistance by riders.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation. He felt {{he had become a}} journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few of his teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his career}} with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until <b>closing</b> <b>time.</b> He later admitted that he was in the early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E

50|$|Legal {{restrictions}} on bars are {{set by the}} Canadian provinces and territories, {{which has led to}} a great deal of variety. While some provinces have been very restrictive with their bar regulation, setting strict <b>closing</b> <b>times</b> and banning the removal of alcohol from the premises, other provinces have been more liberal. <b>Closing</b> <b>times</b> generally run from 2:00 to 4:00 a.m.|$|R
5|$|New Jersey {{regulations}} for liquor stores and bars are extensive. Licensed establishments may not offer nudity. It {{is illegal to}} sell liquor below cost, charge a flat fee for unlimited drinks (except for private parties and on New Year's Eve), offer any promotion that is contingent on drinking {{a certain amount of}} alcohol, allow patrons to remain after <b>closing</b> <b>time,</b> or sell liquor at a drive-through window. Bars and clubs are prohibited from having a 'ladies' night' or any pricing which is regarded as discriminatory. Police officers are prohibited from working for licensed businesses in the same town where they are employed, and some municipalities require fingerprinting for all liquor store and bar employees.|$|E
5|$|Trains {{originally}} ran until 01:00, but {{following the}} privatisation {{of the service}} through concession to Metrovías, the company temporarily moved the <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> back two hours in 1994 to carry out works on the lines, a change which was never reverted even after the works were completed. There have been numerous petitions {{as well as a}} campaign by the City Ombudsman to extend services to 1:30 on weekdays and 3:00 on Fridays and Saturdays. These proposals have been rejected by Subterráneos de Buenos Aires, which stated in 2015 that the reduced schedule is needed in order to carry out infrastructure modernisation works across all the lines while they are closed.|$|E
5|$|Verran {{called an}} {{election}} in February 1912, and the ULP were defeated by the Liberal Union, although Denny was again returned first in the seat of Adelaide with 15.8 per cent of votes cast. He {{became a member of}} the University of Adelaide Council in April 1912, as a representative of the Parliament. In 1913, a referendum to fix the <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> of licensed premises was proposed by the ULP. Even after the governing Liberal Union agreed to the conduct of the referendum at the next state election, Denny attacked them, claiming that they had no intention of implementing the outcome of the referendum if they were re-elected. Denny was returned unopposed at the March 1915 state election.|$|E

5|$|Polling {{stations}} {{are set up}} in public buildings throughout the country; voters may only vote at their assigned polling station (according to their permanent residence), but voters deployed abroad in the armed forces, voters on Croatian-flagged ships and imprisoned voters are allowed to vote elsewhere. Other voters residing in Croatia, but traveling abroad on election day may vote at Croatian diplomatic missions. Polling {{stations are}} open from 7:00am until 7:00pm, but all voters present at the polling stations at <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> are allowed to vote. Polling stations may be closed early if all registered voters have voted. Presidential election ballots contain a list of candidates verified by the State Electoral Commission, in alphabetical order. This entails the name and PIN of each candidate, {{and the names of}} political parties endorsing the candidate (or a note that the candidate is running as an independent. The names are preceded by ordinal numbers. Parliamentary election and European Parliament election ballots contain the name of the slate {{and the name of the}} person heading the list, in addition to candidates, who is not necessarily a candidate on the particular list, but may be included as a figurehead symbolizing specific political party or a coalition putting forward the list—usually head of the party of coalition at the national level. The lists are in alphabetical order and preceded by an ordinal number. Voting is done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate. Ballots marked otherwise (but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast) are also considered valid. Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled (or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated) are invalid. Official results are announced and published by the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
5|$|Skopje has {{a diverse}} nightlife. There {{is a large}} {{emphasis}} on casinos, {{many of which are}} associated with hotels, such as that of the Holiday Inn. Other casinos include Helios Metropol, Olympic, Bon Venon, and Sherry. Among young people the most popular destinations are bars, discos, and nightclubs which {{can be found in the}} center and the City Park. Among the most popular nightclubs are Midnight, Hard Rock, Maracana, B2, Havana and Colosseum where world-famous disc jockeys and idiosyncratic local performances are frequent. In 2010, the Colosseum club was named fifth on a list of the best clubs in Southeastern Europe. Armin van Buuren, Above and Beyond, The Shapeshifters are just some of the many musicians that have visited the club. Nighttime concerts in local, regional and global music are often held at the Philip II National Arena and Boris Trajkovski Sports Center. For middle-aged people, places for having fun are also the kafeanas where traditional Macedonian food is served and traditional Macedonian Music (Starogradska muzika) is played, but music from all the Balkans, particularly Serbian folk music is also popular. Apart from the traditional Macedonian restaurants, there are restaurants featuring international cuisines. Some of the most popular cafés in Skopje are Café Ei8ht, Café Trend, Drama Café, Lex Café and Blue Café. The Old Bazaar was a popular nightlife destination in the past. The national government has created a project to revive nightlife in the Old Bazaar. The <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> in shops, cafés and restaurants was extended due to the high attendances recorded. In the bazaar's restaurants, along with the traditional Macedonian wine and food, dishes of the Ottoman cuisine are also served.|$|E

40|$|Small-conductance Ca-activated K+ {{channels}} play {{an important}} role in modulating excitability in many cell types. These channels are activated by submicromolar concentrations of intracellular Ca 2 +, but little is known about the gating kinetics upon activation by Ca 2 +. In this study, single channel currents were recorded from Xenopus oocytes expressing the apamin-sensitive clone rSK 2. Channel activity was detectable in 0. 2 μM Ca 2 + and was maximal above 2 μM Ca 2 +. Analysis of stationary currents revealed two open <b>times</b> and three <b>closed</b> <b>times,</b> with only the longest <b>closed</b> <b>time</b> being Ca dependent, decreasing with increasing Ca 2 + concentrations. In addition, elevated Ca 2 + concentrations resulted in a larger percentage of long openings and short closures. Membrane voltage did not have significant effects on either open or <b>closed</b> <b>times.</b> The open probability was ∼ 0. 6 in 1 μM free Ca 2 +. A lower open probability of ∼ 0. 05 in 1 μM Ca 2 + was also observed, and channels switched spontaneously between behaviors. The occurrence of these switches and the amount of time channels spent displaying high open probability behavior was Ca 2 + dependent. The two behaviors shared many features including the open times and the short and intermediate <b>closed</b> <b>times,</b> but the low open probability behavior was characterized by a different, long Ca 2 +-dependent <b>closed</b> <b>time</b> in the range of hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. Small-conductance Ca- activated K+ channel gating was modeled by a gating scheme consisting of four closed and two open states. This model yielded a close representation of the single channel data and predicted a macroscopic activation time course similar to that observed upon fast application of Ca 2 + to excised inside-out patches...|$|R
