Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys might try to conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers' base to be identified.

Dalek Sec explains that they cannot open the Ark because it is stolen Time Lord technology. He demands that Rose open it, but she refuses and mocks the Daleks until the Doctor arrives. The Doctor realises that these Daleks are the enigmatic Cult of Skaro, and uses his sonic screwdriver to allow the Cybermen into the sphere chamber. As the Cybermen attack the Daleks, Mickey accidentally activates the Ark while escaping. The Daleks battle the Cybermen and Dalek Sec takes the Ark outside. The Doctor and his companions flee into the tower. Along the way, Pete saves Jackie from the Cybermen and the two embrace. The Doctor then takes everyone to the control room where they witness the Genesis Ark open and millions of Daleks that were imprisoned during the Time War pour out and begin engaging the Cybermen firing on them from below, though humanity is <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crossfire</b> and many are killed while running for cover.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} seemed {{unable to}} stop the violence in Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi. Indira Gandhi ordered the army to storm the temple complex in Punjab. Operation Blue Star was a mixed success. A variety of army units along with paramilitary forces surrounded the temple complex on 3 June 1984. The army kept asking the militants to surrender, using the public address system. The militants were asked to send the pilgrims out of the temple premises to safety, before they start fighting the army. However, nothing happened till 7 PM. Reports of Indian Army Soldiers tying up civilians with their turbans and shooting them in their backs were not uncommon. The attack also took place on a Sikh Holy Day, when there were an extra 150,000 -200,000 civilians. The army had grossly underestimated the firepower possessed by the militants. Thus, tanks and heavy artillery were used to forcefully suppress the anti-tank and machine-gun fire. After a 24-hour firefight, the army finally wrested control of the temple complex. According to the Indian Army, 136 army personnel were killed and 249 injured. while insurgent casualties were 493 killed and 86 injured. Unofficial figures go well into the thousands.

5000|$|The film follows Ri Koran's {{life from}} {{childhood}} to adulthood, portraying her tragic identity crisis and internal cross-cultural conflict. Born as Yamaguchi Yoshiko in 1920 to well-educated Japanese expatriates in increasingly Japanese-dominated northeastern China, {{she was raised}} in a multiethnic, transnational social circle consisting of various Chinese, Japanese and European acquaintances, many of whom hail from an intellectual or artistic background. The film details her friendship with Lyuba, the daughter of a Russian aristocratic family exiled by the Russian Revolution and learned music from the Italian soprano Madam Podresov, who was married into exiled Russian aristocracy. Her father was an expert in Chinese history and literature, and belonged to a group of transnational Japanese intellectuals who wanted to build a pan-Asian utopia through Sino-Japanese cooperation. While her family was very fond and close to Chinese culture, as a child, she witnesses the brutalities of Japanese colonialism and imperialism against Chinese people firsthand, epitomized in a violent scene where her friendly Chinese neighbour was tied to a tree and bloodily beaten by Japanese soldiers for suspected anti-Japanese activities. These traumatic episodes cause her to internalize her Japanese heritage as a marker of oppression, inducing guilt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young child. <b>In</b> 1931, Japan invades northeastern China and establishes the pro-Japanese puppet state Manchukuo. At this time, Yoshiko was enrolled in a Beijing high school under the Chinese name Pan Shuhua, and was assumed to be Chinese by most of her peers. At a student gathering passionately denouncing Japanese aggression, Yoshiko was asked what she would do if Japanese troops reached Beijing. She replies, [...] "I want to stand atop Beijing's city walls and have bullets pierce through my body." [...] Her classmates enthusiastically applaud her, assuming she meant she would use her own body to defend Beijing against Japanese invasion. However, as visually represented through a fiery dream sequence where Chinese and Japanese bullets shatter her from both sides, she was really expressing her helplessness <b>in</b> being <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crossfires</b> of two nations she loved dearly. As she blossoms into a beautiful young lady, the Manchukuo Film Association, or Man'ei for short, recruits her, and she swiftly rises to fame as a popular singer and film actress. She uses the Chinese name Li Xianglan or its Japanese pronunciation equivalent Ri Koran as her stage name during the Manchukuo era. However, in that highly politicized era, becoming a pop cultural icon entailed becoming a propaganda tool for powerful forces beyond Ri Koran's control. Ri Koran starred in many Man'ei films that promoted Manchukuo's official ideology and multiethnic unity policy. Ri's rise to fame {{was one of the most}} successful projects that sought to embody the theme of ethnic harmony in Man'ei films. She represented the pan-Asian imaginary rather than a fixed singular ethnic figure, typically involving a non-Japanese female character falling in love with a Japanese male. She was named the [...] "Goodwill Ambassador for Manchukuo-Japanese Friendship," [...] a title she cherished and truly believed in. However, even as a renowned celebrity, she faced racism; on a trip to Japan, Ri Koran was dressed in a qipao, and was stopped by a Japanese soldier. Upon checking her papers, the soldier angrily reprimanded and insulted her, shouting that a superior Japanese should not wear the fashion of the inferior races. These episodes slowly made Ri Koran realize the hypocrisy of the official rhetoric, and she feels guilty of representing propaganda characters.|$|R
40|$|Portland and Seattle {{are often}} {{considered}} to be divergent in character, partly because civic leadership in each city has a different vision. The adoption of contrasting downtown core plans, projects, and policies in each city allows {{us an opportunity to}} understand the nature of each city 2 ̆ 7 s regime. As defined by Elkin, an urban regime is the community 2 ̆ 7 s governing coalition, those who exercise public authority in a legal sense and those private actors able to act collectively and bring concerted influence to bear. The time frame for this study begins with the first modern planning document, the 1972 City of Portland Downtown Plan. During this period, both central business districts were transformed, simultaneously losing some retail, commercial and industrial functions while gaining further control of regional economies. Portland perfected the entrepreneurial urban regime. The linkage among the land use alliance (property owners, investors and private professionals); the bureaucracy; and politicians was established by the success of the 1972 Downtown Plan. There is little conflict in Portland. Systemic bias is masked by overly extensive citizen involvement processes; city subsidies and grants which influence activists 2 ̆ 7 positions; and use of tax increment money to hire consultants who reinforce the business point of view. Seattle never perfected the entrepreneurial regime. The business community was fractured into conservatives and progressive camps.
