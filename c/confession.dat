5|$|A <b>Confession</b> of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of the <b>Confession,</b> it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The <b>Confession</b> was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the <b>Confession,</b> which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the <b>Confession</b> with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the <b>Confession</b> without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{provided}} many of {{the foundational}} documents for reformed churches, including documents on the catechism, the liturgy, and church governance. He also produced several confessions of faith in order to unite the churches. In 1559, he drafted the French <b>confession</b> of faith, the Gallic <b>Confession,</b> and the synod in Paris accepted it with few changes. The Belgic <b>Confession</b> of 1561, a Dutch <b>confession</b> of faith, was partly based on the Gallic <b>Confession.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive <b>confession</b> stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive <b>confession,</b> the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive <b>confession</b> means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive <b>confession</b> is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a <b>confession,</b> and speaking it brings it into reality.|$|E
5000|$|Wood {{was also}} {{responsible}} for the <b>Confessions</b> series of novels and their film adaptations, written under the pseudonym Timothy Lea. They are <b>Confessions</b> of a Window Cleaner, <b>Confessions</b> of a Driving Instructor, <b>Confessions</b> from a Holiday Camp, <b>Confessions</b> From a Hotel, <b>Confessions</b> of a Travelling Salesman, <b>Confessions</b> of a Film Extra, <b>Confessions</b> From the Clink, <b>Confessions</b> of a Private Soldier, <b>Confessions</b> From the Pop Scene (adapted into the movie <b>Confessions</b> of a Pop Performer), <b>Confessions</b> From a Health Farm, <b>Confessions</b> From the Shop Floor, <b>Confessions</b> of a Long Distance Lorry Driver, <b>Confessions</b> of a Plumber's Mate, <b>Confessions</b> of a Private Dick, <b>Confessions</b> From a Luxury Liner, <b>Confessions</b> From a Nudist Colony, <b>Confessions</b> of a Milkman, <b>Confessions</b> of an Ice Cream Man and <b>Confessions</b> From a Haunted House. Wood told an interviewer for The Independent in 2013: [...] "The books, and later the films, got terrible reviews, but they were successful, and success was its own currency".|$|R
5000|$|Wood {{also created}} a female counterpart, Rosie Dixon, and these were {{likewise}} written {{in the first person}} perspective and published pseudonymously under the name [...] "Rosie Dixon". Although nine Rosie Dixon novels were published, only the first—Confessions of a Night Nurse—was made into a film, Rosie Dixon - Night Nurse (1978). The other titles were <b>Confessions</b> of a Gym Mistress, <b>Confessions</b> From an Escort Agency, <b>Confessions</b> of a Lady Courier, <b>Confessions</b> From a Package Tour, <b>Confessions</b> of a Physical WRAC, <b>Confessions</b> of a Baby Sitter, <b>Confessions</b> of a Personal Secretary, and Rosie Dixon, Barmaid.|$|R

British sex comedy film series as Sidney Noggett between 1974 and 1977. These were <b>Confessions</b> of a Window Cleaner, <b>Confessions</b> of a Pop Performer, <b>Confessions</b> of a Driving Instructor and <b>Confessions</b> from a Holiday Camp.|$|R
5|$|As Zwingli {{was working}} on {{establishing}} these political alliances, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to present their views {{so that he could}} make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg <b>Confession.</b> Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau produced the Tetrapolitan <b>Confession.</b> This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the Burgrecht cities to produce a <b>confession</b> of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private <b>confession,</b> Fidei ratio (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the Apostles' Creed. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, Johann Eck, counter-attacked with a publication, Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|As the Ottoman Empire did {{not force}} Muslim {{conversion}} on its conquered western territories, reformed ideas were quickly {{adopted in the}} two-thirds of Hungary they occupied (the Habsburg-ruled third part of Hungary remained Catholic). A Reformed Constitutional Synod was held in 1567 in Debrecen, the main hub of Hungarian Calvinism, where the Second Helvetic <b>Confession</b> was adopted as the official <b>confession</b> of Hungarian Calvinists.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} {{included the}} Westminster <b>Confession</b> of Faith, {{together with the}} Larger and Shorter Catechisms, as the church's subordinate standard (i.e. subordinate to the Bible) {{in addition to the}} (substantially altered) Westminster Directory. The Westminster <b>Confession</b> was modified to bring its teaching on civil government in line with American practices.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Confessions</b> series {{consisted}} of four sex comedy films released during the 1970s starring Robin Askwith. The {{films in the}} <b>Confessions</b> series—Confessions of a Window Cleaner, <b>Confessions</b> of a Driving Instructor, <b>Confessions</b> of a Pop Performer, and <b>Confessions</b> from a Holiday Camp—concern the erotic adventures of Timothy Lea and {{are based on the}} novels of Christopher Wood, writing as Timothy Lea.|$|R
5000|$|Reformed {{doctrine}} {{is expressed in}} various <b>confessions.</b> A few <b>confessions</b> are shared by many denominations. Different denominations use different <b>confessions,</b> usually based on historical reasons.|$|R
40|$|<b>Confessions</b> are people’s way {{of coming}} clean, sharing {{unethical}} acts with others. Although <b>confessions</b> are traditionally viewed as categorical—one either comes clean or not—people often confess to {{only part of}} their transgression. Such partial <b>confessions</b> may seem attractive, because they offer an opportunity to relieve one’s guilt without having to own up to the full consequences of the transgression. In this article, we explored the occurrence, antecedents, consequences, and everyday prevalence of partial <b>confessions.</b> Using a novel experimental design, we found a high frequency of partial <b>confessions,</b> especially among people cheating to the full extent possible. People found partial <b>confessions</b> attractive because they (correctly) expected partial <b>confessions</b> to be more believable than not confessing. People failed, however, to anticipate the emotional costs associated with partially confessing. In fact, partial <b>confessions</b> made people feel worse than not confessing or fully confessing, a finding corroborated in a laboratory setting {{as well as in}} a study assessing people’s everyday <b>confessions.</b> It seems that although partial <b>confessions</b> seem attractive, they come at an emotional cost...|$|R
5|$|Throughout the denomination's existence, {{theological}} battles were {{fought over}} how the <b>Confession</b> of Faith would be interpreted. During the 19th century, Old School Presbyterians insisted that the <b>Confession</b> be interpreted according to strict Calvinism, while the New School Presbyterians favored a looser interpretation. From 1910 to 1927, the <b>Confession</b> of Faith was officially interpreted with reference to five fundamental beliefs: biblical inerrancy, the virgin birth, substitutionary atonement, the bodily resurrection, and the miracles of Christ.|$|E
5|$|When Philip of Hesse {{formed the}} Schmalkaldic League {{at the end}} of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan <b>Confession</b> joined {{on the basis of a}} Lutheran {{interpretation}} of that <b>confession.</b> Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Zurich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining. However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan <b>Confession</b> with his own beliefs and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito. This offended Philip to the point where relations with the League were severed. The Burgrecht cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts.|$|E
5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} <b>confession</b> gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the <b>confession</b> was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the <b>confession</b> was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E

5|$|After Flores' {{murder on}} 30 May 2010—five {{years to the}} day after Holloway's disappearance—Van der Sloot fled to Chile, where he was arrested and extradited back to Peru for {{questioning}} regarding the murder. On 7 June 2010, he confessed to bludgeoning Ramírez. He later tried to formally retract his <b>confession,</b> claiming that he had been intimidated by the National Police of Peru and framed by the FBI. A Peruvian judge ruled on 25 June 2010 that the <b>confession</b> was valid and on 13 January 2012, Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment for Flores' murder.|$|E
5|$|After Jack Bauer {{fails to}} obtain a <b>confession</b> from Logan, she screams in public {{that he is a}} murderer during Palmer's funeral. Afterwards, President Logan hits her, and threatens to put Martha in an asylum for life. During his tirade, Logan {{acknowledges}} all of his misdeeds, unaware that there is a small listening device on his pen. The <b>confession</b> quickly reaches the Attorney General, who orders the U.S. Marshals to arrest Logan. As Charles is escorted away by agents, he turns to stare at Martha, who smiles at him in triumph.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Michael Peers {{apologized to}} {{residential}} school survivors, {{on behalf of}} the Anglican Church of Canada, on August 6, 1993, at the National Native Convocation in Minaki, Ontario. The following year the Presbyterian Church in Canada adopted a <b>confession</b> at its 120th General Assembly in Toronto on June 5, recognizing its role in residential schools and seeking forgiveness. The <b>confession</b> was presented on October 8 during a ceremony in Winnipeg.|$|E

5|$|Church members {{reported}} that Father Feit's <b>confession</b> line moved slowly {{that night and}} that he was away from the sanctuary several times. When the canal at the crime scene was drained several days after the discovery of Garza's body, Feit's photo slide viewer was found in the canal. Fellow priests noticed scratch marks on Feit's hands after midnight mass, and they said it was irregular for Feit to have taken Garza to the church rectory to hear her <b>confession.</b> The McAllen Police Department initially said that Feit passed polygraph tests, but the tests were later said to be inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Due to Calvin's {{missionary work}} in France, his {{programme}} of reform eventually reached the French-speaking provinces of the Netherlands. Calvinism was {{adopted in the}} Electorate of the Palatinate under Frederick III, {{which led to the}} formulation of the Heidelberg Catechism in 1563. This and the Belgic <b>Confession</b> were adopted as confessional standards in the first synod of the Dutch Reformed Church in 1571. Several leading divines, either Calvinist or those sympathetic to Calvinism, settled in England (Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr, and Jan Laski) and Scotland (John Knox). During the English Civil War, the Calvinistic Puritans produced the Westminster <b>Confession,</b> which became the confessional standard for Presbyterians in the English-speaking world.|$|E

5|$|During late 1536, Farel {{drafted a}} <b>confession</b> of faith, and Calvin wrote {{separate}} articles on reorganizing {{the church in}} Geneva. On 16 January 1537, Farel and Calvin presented their Articles concernant l'organisation de l'église et du culte à Genève (Articles on the Organization of the Church and its Worship at Geneva) to the city council. The document described the manner and frequency of their celebrations of the Eucharist, the reason for, and the method of, excommunication, the requirement {{to subscribe to the}} <b>confession</b> of faith, the use of congregational singing in the liturgy, and the revision of marriage laws. The council accepted the document on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28 April 2012, Martínez Pérez was murdered inside her home in Xalapa after being {{severely}} beaten. A suspect was arrested in October 2012 and publicly confessed to the murder, while the Mexican authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was theft. But the suspect later retracted his <b>confession</b> and stated that he had been tortured and threatened by officials to lie and admit to the murder. Investigators have relied solely on the suspect's <b>confession</b> to incriminate him; the DNA and fingerprint samples collected at the murder scene did not match the suspect's according to sources close to Committee to Protect Journalists.|$|E
5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's <b>confession</b> in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that he had broken his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to <b>confession.</b> Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to climb into the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
