2500|$|Police {{questioned}} the Degnan family's neighbors, but few had seen anything unusual. Someone later telephoned police anonymously, suggesting that police {{look in the}} sewers near the Degnan home. Police did, and discovered the young girl's head in a storm-drain sewer that was in an alley {{a block from the}} Degnan residence. In the same alley, they discovered the girl's right leg in a <b>catch</b> <b>basin,</b> her torso in another storm drain and her left leg in a drain in another alley, each location progressively further from her home. Her arms were found a month later in a sewer {{on the other side of}} the Howard elevated train line more than three blocks from the Degnan residence. All the drains were capped with circular cast-iron manhole covers, yet no one had heard them being lifted or replaced. Searches of an apartment building near where her head was found uncovered a basement laundry room with four tubs that contained evidence indicating she had been dismembered there. The killer had mopped the floor, but blood was found in the drains of all four tubs. The press called it the [...] "Murder Room" [...] although the autopsy showed that she had been alive when taken from her home, murdered at a second location that was never identified, and then taken to the laundry room.|$|E
2500|$|Although the City of New York {{had come}} {{under the control of}} the English in 1674, no serious discussions as to the {{founding}} of a university began until the early eighteenth-century. This delay is often attributed to the multitude of languages and religions practiced in the province, which made the founding of a seat of learning difficult. Colleges during the colonial period were regarded as a religious, no less a scientific and literary institution. The large gap between the founding of New York province and the opening of its first college stands in contrast to institutions such as Harvard University, which was created only six years after the founding of Boston, Massachusetts, a colony with a more homogenous Puritan population. Discussions regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, when Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college. The lands on which Morris had initially designed the college to be built, known as [...] "King's Farm, were vested to Trinity Church by Lord Cornburry, and nothing came of the proposition to form a college in the provence until almost fifty years later. The founding of Harvard in 1636 and Yale in 1701 had set no competitive juices flowing among New York’s merchants. But the announcement in the summer of 1745 that New Jersey, which had only seven years before secured a government separate from New York’s and was still considered by New Yorkers to be within its cultural <b>catch</b> <b>basin,</b> was about to found the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, demanded an immediate response.|$|E

We evaluated the dynamics and persistence of Bti and Lsph spores released through their concomitant application in urban <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> in southern Switzerland. Detection and quantification of spores over time in water and sludge samples from <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> were carried out using quantitative real-time PCR targeting both cry 4 A and cry 4 B toxin genes for Bti and the binA gene for Lsph. After treatment, Bti and Lsph spores attained concentrations of 3. 76 (± 0. 08) and 4. 13 (± 0. 09) log ml(- 1) in water, then decreased progressively over time, reaching baseline values. For both Bti and Lsph, spore levels in the order of 10 (5) g(- 1) were observed in the bottom sludge two days after the treatment and remained constant for the whole test period (275 days). Indigenous Lsph strains were isolated from previously untreated <b>catch</b> <b>basins.</b> A selection of those was genotyped using pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA, revealing that a subset of isolates were members of the clonal population of strain 2362. No safety issues related to the use of this biopesticide in the environment have been observed during this study, because no significant {{increase in the number of}} spores was seen during the long observation period. The isolation of native Lysinibacillus sphaericus strains belonging to the same clonal population as strain 2362 from <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> never treated with Lsph-based products indicates that the use of a combination of Bti and Lsph for the control of mosquitoes does not introduce non-indigenous microorganisms in this area...|$|R

50|$|Process: The {{evaporation}} surface (1) suctions {{water out}} of the capillary basin (6), puts the capillary pump (8) for the flooding process in action and quickly fills the surface from top to bottom. Then it drips into the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> (2). The water evaporates and sets the air circulation into motion. The drained water closes the hose (3) below. Here, air which flows via pipe into the water tank (5) is interrupted. The water in the tank can no longer flow out because under-pressure occurs. The residual water in the capillary basin (6), on the upper part, is evaporated by the evaporation surface (1). The residual water in the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> (2), on the bottom, is suctioned out by the lime separator (7) and evaporated. As soon as the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> is empty, air then flows again through the hose (3); water from the tank flows back to the capillary basins (6) and thereby begins the process again. The alternating filling levels for the catch and capillary basins suppress the creation of germs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background An {{important}} {{determinant of}} mosquito-borne pathogen transmission is the {{spatial distribution of}} vectors. The primary vectors of West Nile virus (WNV) in Illinois are Culex pipiens Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) and Culex restuans Theobald. In urban environments, these mosquitoes commonly oviposit in roadside storm water <b>catch</b> <b>basins.</b> However, use of this habitat is inconsistent, with abundance of larvae varying significantly across <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> at a fine spatial scale. Methods We tested the hypothesis that attributes of the biotic and abiotic environment contribute to spatial and temporal variation in production of mosquito vectors, characterizing the relationship between terrestrial vegetation and aquatic chemistry and Culex abundance in Chicago, Illinois. Larvae were sampled from 60 <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> from June 14 to October 3, 2009. Density of shrubs and 14 tree genera surrounding the basins were quantified, as well as aquatic chemistry content of each basin. Results We demonstrate that the spatial pattern of Culex abundance in <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> is strongly influenced by environmental characteristics, resulting in significant variation across the urban landscape. Using regression and machine learning techniques, we described landscape features and microhabitat characteristics of four Chicago neighborhoods and examined {{the implications of these}} measures for larval abundance in adjacent <b>catch</b> <b>basins.</b> The important positive predictors of high larval abundance were aquatic ammonia, nitrates, and area of shrubs of height Culex during the fruit-bearing periods and early senescent periods in August and September. Conclusions This study identifies environmental predictors of mosquito production in urban environments. Because an abundance of adult Culex is integral to efficient WNV transmission and mosquitoes are found in especially high densities near larval habitats, identifying aquatic sites for Culex and landscape features that promote larval production are important in predicting the spatial pattern of cases of human and veterinary illness. Thus, these data enable accurate assessment of regions at risk for exposure to WNV and aid in the prevention of vector-borne disease transmission. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Explanation:Water {{runs from}} the top over the surface (1), and the {{hydropneumatic}} controller takes {{over control of the}} water flow. The water, which runs over the surface, is collected in a <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> (2). In order to make running fresh water out from a closed tank (5), it requires air. The water pressure suctions the air from the <b>catch</b> <b>basin</b> via a hose (3). Here the dripping water can close the hose and thereby, through under-pressure in the water tank (5), stops running out of the water tank. The filling process is stopped immediately and is restarted in relation to the humidity of the air. Contamination is once more suppressed, because dripped water immediately evaporates in the lime separator and, if necessary, in the humidity poster.Humidification posters: ...|$|E

40|$|Environmental context. Recognising {{that road}} flares and air bags may {{contribute}} perchlorate to road runoff, we analysed perchlorate in runoff from two accident-prone suburban highways {{during a period}} of five rain events. This runoff reaches recharge basins where it then infiltrates into the groundwater. The concentrations of perchlorate averaged ∼ 2 µg L− 1, high enough to be of concern if the drinking water standard for perchlorate were in the low µg levels. Abstract. First flush samples of road runoff were sampled in April 2006 corresponding with five rain events at 12 <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> and two recharge basins in Suffolk County, NY. Most runoff here is directed into recharge basins or sumps that drain directly into the sole source aquifer. Thus, contaminants from road runoff can contaminate groundwater. In addition to ClO 4, we present data for Cl, Na, Br, Sr, and nitrogen as nitrate (N-NO 3) as they are the dominant ions in the most probable sources of ClO 4 to road runoff, presumably road flares, road salt, air bags and road-side fertilizers. Correlations between the ions indicate that road salt elevates concentrations of Na, Br and Cl in road runoff. The average ClO 4 value is 2. 18 ± 0. 66 (standard error of the mean) µg L− 1 for the <b>catch</b> <b>basins</b> and 2. 98 ± 0. 87 µg L− 1 for the two recharge basins.
