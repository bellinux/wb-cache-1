40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{pathogen}} {{associated with}} <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> brinjal {{was identified as}} Sclerotium rolfsii (Sacc.). The present investigation was carried out for ecofriendly management of the disease, it includes various practices i. e. summer ploughing, soil solarization, biocontrol agents, green manuring and soil amendments. The soil and seedling dip treatment with Trichoderma viride (T 5) @ 4 g/kg of seedling and 50 mg with 5 g FYM/m 2 respectively was found most effective in reducing the per cent disease incidence followed by summer ploughing. Key words: Brinjal <b>collar</b> <b>rot,</b> S. rolfsii, ecofriendly management Among the vegetables, brinjal (Solanum melongena L.) is an important vegetable crop grown in India. The <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> brinjal caused by Sclerotium rolfsii affects the plant population yield {{and quality of the}} crop. The disease was first reported in India by Rao (1969) in Vijaywada district of Andhra Pradesh. During the middle of the 20 th century, this disease was controlled to some degree by fumigation or application of fungicides to the soil. Often these chemicals are too expensive and too toxic for many situations and future uses of these fumigants are being restricted due to environmental concerns.

A polyphasic approach, including morphological and cultural observations, sequencing the ITS-rDNA region, the Pheca and the mitochondrial coxI genes, multiplex PCRs with primers specific for P. nicotianae or P. cactorum, {{as well as}} random amplified polymorphic DNA–polymerase chain reaction, was used to characterize these isolates. On the basis of morpho-cultural and molecular analyses, the isolates from Stoechas lavender were identified as Phytophthora × pelgrandis, a natural hybrid of P. nicotianae × P. cactorum previously reported in other European countries, the Americas, and Taiwan, as a pathogen of ornamentals and loquat plants. In pathogenicity tests using potted plants of Stoechas lavender, the P. × pelgrandis isolates, similarly to the parental species P. nicotianae, induced the symptoms observed on plants with natural infections and were reisolated only from artificially inoculated plants.

5000|$|<b>Collar</b> <b>rot</b> is a symptomatically {{described}} {{disease that}} is usually caused by any one of various fungal and oomycete plant pathogens. It is present where the pathogen causes a lesion localized at or about the collet between the stem and the root. The lesions develop around the stem eventually forming a [...] "collar". Observationally, <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> grades into [...] "basal stem rot", and with some pathogens is {{the first phase of}} [...] "basal stem rot" [...] often followed by [...] "root rot". <b>Collar</b> <b>rot</b> is most often observed in seedings grown in infected soil. The pathogens that cause <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> may be species or genera specific. But generalist pathogens such as Athelia rolfsii (aka Sclerotium rolfsii) are known to attack over 200 different species. While bacteria caused <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> is not common, trees infected with Fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) may develop <b>collar</b> <b>rot.</b> Non-parasitic <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> may be caused by winter damage.|$|R

Groundnut shells were superior to sorghum straw, sand-maize meal, and potato dextrose broth in supporting the growth and formation of sclerotia of the pathogen. Soil infested with sclerotial inoculum developed on groundnut shells was used to study the reactions of 12 chickpea cultivars to the <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> pathogen. There were significant differences in their susceptibility to seed rot, damping off, and <b>collar</b> <b>rot.</b> Seed treatment with Rizolex(R) or a mixture of Thiram(R) + Rizolex(R) was effective in controlling seed <b>rot</b> and <b>collar</b> <b>rot...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Crossandra is an {{important}} flower plant of our country earning a lot of revenue and trade. Of different diseases affecting crossandra cultivation, <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> induced by Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. is {{an important}} soil borne disease causing devastating losses. In the present study, the sensitivity <b>of</b> the <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> pathogen was investigated. Also the compatibility of fungal biocontrol agent, Trichoderma spp. with these fungicides was worked out to for further devising Integrated Management strategies for <b>collar</b> <b>rot</b> disease. Four fungicides, viz. ...|$|R
40|$|Rhizoctonia solani {{anastomosis}} group AG- 4 HG-I {{is reported}} {{for the first time}} from the Lao PDR. It was isolated from gai lan (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra) affected by <b>collar</b> <b>rot,</b> seedling death, root <b>rot</b> and stunting <b>of</b> older plants from the Paksong area of Champasak province. The anastomosis group was confirmed by sequencing and Koc's postulates were fulfilled...|$|R
40|$|Interaction between arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi as a bio-agent and Rhizoctonia root <b>rot</b> disease <b>of</b> common <b>bean</b> {{plant was}} investigated in this study under natural conditions in pot experiment. A mixture of Egyptian formulated AM (Multi-VAM) in suspension form (1 x 10 (6) unitL(- 1) in concentration) was used at dilution of 5 mlL(- 1) water. The results demonstrated that colonization <b>of</b> <b>bean</b> plants with AM fungi significantly increased growth parameters, yield parameters and mineral nutrient concentrations and reduced the negative effects on these parameters as well as both disease severity and disease incidence. Different physical and biochemical mechanisms {{have been shown to}} play a role in enhancement of plant resistance against Rhizoctonia solani, namely, improved plant nutrition, improved plant growth, increase in cell wall thickening, cytoplasmic granulation, and accumulation of some antimicrobial substances (phenolic compounds and defense related enzymes) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Collar</b> <b>rot</b> that {{is caused}} by the oomycete Phytophthora is causally called Phytophthora <b>collar</b> <b>rot,</b> and is a common disease of fruit and nut trees, as well as other flowers and crops. Phytophthora species remain in the soil, as spores, and in {{infected}} plant tissue, as mycelia, so absent contol measures (sterilization, toxic applications) the disease continues so long as susceptible plants are grown in that soil.|$|R
