Aerodynamic performance of the wing with low Reynolds in different altitude and drag performance of air cell fuselage with different generating line were analyzed, which change regulation were summarized. Aerodynamic configuration was tested in wind tunnel by <b>cable</b> <b>mounting</b> testing technology as well, results of aerodynamic coefficient from numerical simulation method and wind tunnel in different Reynolds number were according well, verified the reliability of design results from the numerical simulation method.

40|$|Some seven {{different}} configurations of the NSI and other cables {{were tested in}} the NASA-MSFC Hot Gas Facility (HGF). The tests were conducted to study {{what happens to the}} cables when they are exposed to hot flow {{as was the case in}} the first two Shuttle flights, the STS- 1 and STS- 2. Protection of these components is vital for various functions especially to attain proper nozzle separation. The tests in the HGF demonstrated the severity of the aerodynamic forces combined with aero heating environment on the test cables and helped, in general, to evaluate the cable wrap materials and <b>cable</b> <b>mounting</b> hardware and technique. Blastape 2 cable wrap which is adequate for thermal protection of the cables must be properly clamped at its ends. The nylon clamps (or ties) used to secure cables to metal components inside the skirt could not withstand the heating.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first {{assessment}} of feasibility and clinical usefulness of an imaging wire. The device used is a 0. 018 " flexible <b>cable</b> <b>mounting</b> a 30 MHz piezoelectric crystal at the end. The only possible application of the wire in its current configuration is the assessment of balloon expansion with over-the-wire balloon catheters. In this study, 17 lesions were examined in 14 patients. Despite careful removal of the air, no image could be obtained with the balloon deflated or through the shaft of conventional balloon catheters. When the balloon was inflated to 1 - 4 atm the circular echo-free cross-section of the balloon became visible, surrounded by the dense line of the balloon membrane and by the vessel wall. By examining the stent area at different balloon pressures, {{it was possible to}} determine the stent recoil between maximal balloon expansion and lowest balloon pressure allowing a readable ultrasound image. These encouraging preliminary observations confirm the feasibility of the use of an ultrasound guidewire for monitoring balloon expansion during stent implantation. After high pressure inflation, a moderate reduction of the stent lumen was observed during deflation, compatible with the small recoil predicted for the stainless-steel mesh stent used...|$|E

40|$|A full-span F/A- 18 E/F <b>cable</b> <b>mounted</b> {{wind tunnel}} model {{is part of a}} flutter {{clearance}} program at the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. Parametric analysis of this model using GRUMCBL software was conducted to assess stability for wind tunnel tests. Two configurations of the F/A- 18 E/F were examined. The parameters examined were pulley-cable friction, mach number, dynamic pressure, cable geometry, center of gravity location, cable tension, snubbing the model, drag, and test medium. For the nominal cable geometry (Cable Geometry 1), Configuration One was unstable for cases with higher pulley-cable friction coefficients. A new cable geometry (Cable Geometry 3) was determined in which Configuration One was stable for all cases evaluated. Configuration Two with the nominal center of gravity position was found to be unstable for cases with higher pulley-cable friction coefficients; however, the model was stable when the center of gravity moved forward 1 / 2. The model was tested using the <b>cable</b> <b>mount</b> system during the initial wind tunnel entry and was stable as predicted...|$|R

40|$|Based on researching into WDPSS- 8, after {{analysing}} {{and comparing}} 3 support systems in wind tunnel including the strut suspension system, <b>cable</b> <b>mounted</b> system and wire-driven parallel suspension system, the following {{conclusions can be}} acquired. 1) 	Till now the strut support systems and rotary balances can be used in measuring the dynamic derivatives of the aircraft in low-speed wind tunnels successfully, wire-driven parallel suspension system has a great potentiality, but it is still under investigation. 2) 	The <b>cable</b> <b>mounted</b> system is one of suitable method for measuring the static derivatives of the aircraft in LSWT. Though it allows a large supporting stiffness, small interference of the streamline flow and a high measuring precision for large attack angle, it can not be used in measuring the dynamic derivatives. 3) 	Wire-driven parallel suspension system has opened a new horizon for measuring the static and dynamic derivatives of the aircraft in LSWT. Using the same system based on position control and force control in robotics, it allows to realize the free flight of the aircraft model and to obtain the static and dynamic derivatives. However, the results given in this Chapter can only be considered as a preliminary step in establishing feasibility，although the wire-driven parallel suspension system is a very interesting design, and it may be sufficiently developed into a routine practical system...|$|R

By combining a coupled map lattice wake model with a linear wave equation cable model, both the free response of the cable as well as the resulting wake structures are examined. This represents an extension of earlier coupled map lattice models that only modeled the wake of forced cable vibration. The validity of the model is assessed through comparisons with both Computational Fluid Dynamics models (NEKTAR spectral element code) and wake experiments.
