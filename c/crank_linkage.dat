25|$|A major problem, afflicting early {{production}} Typhoons in particular, was {{a series}} of structural failures leading to loss of the entire tail sections of some aircraft, mainly during high-speed dives. Eventually a combination of factors was identified, including harmonic vibration, which could quickly lead to metal fatigue, and a weak transport joint just forward of the horizontal tail unit. The loss of the tailplane of R7692 (having only 11 hours of flight recorded) on 11 August 1942, {{in the hands of an}} experienced test pilot (Seth-Smith), caused a major reassessment which concluded that the failure of the bracket holding the elevator mass balance bell <b>crank</b> <b>linkage</b> had allowed unrestrained flutter which led to structural failure of the fuselage at the transport joint.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{simulation}} analysis {{and research on}} <b>crank</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism, which is the core part of the engine, are of important significance. Based on related theory, this paper introduces a {{simulation analysis}} method for <b>crank</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism, which is using Pro/E. First of all, the 3 D model of the mechanism is build; all the components are modeled and assembled. Then dynamic simulation for the <b>crank</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism by using PRO/Mechanism is carried on, the result of characteristics of motion, stress, etc of the mechanism are shown. A more effective method about the simulation analysis of <b>crank</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism is introduced in this paper...|$|E
40|$|JumpSport, {{a company}} that designs and sells {{trampoline}}s and trampoline accessories, has sponsored this senior project team to design, build, and test a trampoline fatigue test machine. The machine must simulate a person jumping on the trampoline to test the life of JumpSport’s fitness trampolines and kids’ trampolines. Partway through the design process, the objectives were altered and this senior project team was tasked with merging with another Cal Poly senior project group to create an all-inclusive test machine to accommodate both full-trampoline testing and individual bungee cord testing. The final design is centered on a slider <b>crank</b> <b>linkage</b> driven by a servomotor. A load cell is bolted {{to the end of}} the slider crank for force measurements. An impactor subassembly is in turn bolted to the load cell. The impactor acts as the interface between the power system and the trampoline mat and is designed with running shoes attached to more closely mimic a person jumping. The linkage is supported by a gantry spanning the width of the supporting base plate. The base is mounted on leveling casters for transportation purposes. Some linkage and structure components are adjustable to account for varying strokes. This report documents the Phase 1 design process including conceptual designs, research and analysis, the final design, the manufacturing process, and testing. This report focuses heavily on the processes leading up to choosing the slider <b>crank</b> <b>linkage</b> as the final design, and the analysis focuses on the impactor. Analysis of the linkage, gantry and frame, and motor will be included in the other senior project group’s report upon completion in Fall 2013 (students Chris D’Elia, Andrew Brock, and Ryan Murphy). Additional objectives of Phase 2 will be adding individual bungee cord testing functionality and applying the power system...|$|E
50|$|When {{a magnet}} moves in {{relation}} to an electromagnetic coil, this changes the magnetic flux passing through the coil, and thus induces the flow of an electric current, {{which can be used}} to do work. A linear alternator is most commonly used to convert back-and-forth motion directly into electrical energy. This short-cut eliminates the need for a <b>crank</b> or <b>linkage</b> that would otherwise be required to convert a reciprocating motion to a rotary motion in order to be compatible with a rotary generator.|$|R

This paper {{focuses on}} the {{kinematic}} analysis of rectangular path generating adjustable four-bar <b>crank</b> rocker <b>linkage.</b> One of the ground pivots of rocker side of the adjustable mechanism is subjected to continuous adjustment while the crank arm is given uniform angular velocity. Variations of coupler and rocker position, velocity and acceleration are computed for continuously changing phases of the adjustable four bar linkage. These kinematic parameters are compared with non-adjustable four-bar mechanism. Effect of the continuous adjustment on transmission angle and torque ratio are presented. The above procedures are implemented successfully in MATLAB environment and graphical results are presented...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: page 71. This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} into the application of the hybrid Otto-Atkinson cycle, as a means of improving the part load fuel efficiency of spark-ignition engines. The primary objective of this thesis was to investigate the technical feasibility of the modified Atkinson cycle as a spark-ignition engine concept and thus to quantify the associated potential for greater fuel efficiency. The modified Atkinson cycle is a hybrid cycle which approximates the Otto cycle at full load but tends to emulate the Atkinson cycle at part load, and therefore it {{is referred to as the}} Otto-Atkinson cycle. In order to fulfil this objective, a single cylinder engine which operated on the Otto-Atkinson cycle, was designed and constructed. This unusual cycle was achieved by a <b>crank</b> <b>linkage</b> which allowed the power output to be controlled by varying the inlet and compression strokes rather than by the more conventional method of throttling the induced fuel-air mixture. Thus the pumping losses associated with throttled part-load operation are eliminated. Furthermore, the expansion stroke is always greater than the compression stroke, the difference being greatest at part loads. This results in a cycle which approximates the Atkinson cycle for part-load operation. A simplified thermodynamic simulation of the cycle was formulated. Theoretical predictions were made based on this simulation...|$|E

50|$|Burmester {{began with}} a set of locations, often called poses, for the {{floating}} link, which are viewed as snapshots of the constrained movement of this floating link in the device that is to be designed. The design of a <b>crank</b> for the <b>linkage</b> now becomes finding a point in the moving floating link that when viewed in each of these specified positions has a trajectory that lies on a circle. The dimension of the crank is the distance from the point in the floating link, called the circling point, {{to the center of the}} circle it travels on, called the center point. Two cranks designed in this way form the desired four-bar linkage.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: An active {{trailing}} edge flap system, actuated utilizing Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs), is developed in this study. PAMs were chosen as the actuation method because of several attractive properties, including: high specific work and power output, an expendable operating fluid (air), and robustness. Because of their performance, PAM are a potential enabling technology {{for a variety of}} next-generation aerospace systems. The actuation system developed here is sized for a full-scale active rotor system for a Bell 407 scale helicopter. This system is designed to produce large Trailing Edge Flap (TEF) deflections (20) at the main rotor rotation frequency (1 rev 1) to create large amplitude thrust variations that enable primary control of the helicopter. Additionally, the TEF actuation system is designed to produce smaller magnitude deflections at higher frequencies, up to 5 rev 1 (Nþ 1 rev 1), to provide vibration mitigation capabilities. The PAMs are mounted antagonistically in the root of each blade. A bell <b>crank</b> and <b>linkage</b> system transfers the force and motion of these actuators to a {{trailing edge}} flap on the outboard portion of the rotor. A reduced span wind tunnel test model of this system was fabricated and tested in the Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel at the University of Maryland at wind speeds of up to M 0. 3, which is the maximum test wind speed of the facility. The tes...|$|R
40|$|The {{equation}} Z = (cos 2 m) - 1 = 0, where m is {{the transmission}} angle of an R-S-S-R four bar linkage, {{is shown to}} be a fourth order polynomial in t (the tangent of the half of the input angle). It is further shown that the mobility of the linkage is related to the number of the real roots of this quartic equation as follows 0 real roots: crank-rocker or drag link 2 real roots: double rocker 4 real roots: special double rocker or rocker (input) -crank The conditions for the number of real roots are developed in terms of the explicit conditions on the linkage parameters. As subsets of these conditions, the Grashof mobility criteria for planar and spherical four-bars are developed. It is also shown that a <b>crank</b> type Bennett <b>linkage</b> can not exist. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} four-bar linkage to trace a desired path is an {{important}} part of obtaining the optimal geometry of a four-bar linkage which is used in design. When the number of the precision points exceeds a certain number, it is not possible to apply or it is difficult to apply analytical methods. Alternatively some intelligence optimization methods can be used based on the complexity of the problem. Path synthesis of four-bar linkages with multiple number of precision points has been illustrated as an optimization problem. The objective to be minimized is sum square error of all the points reached by the coupler point. The important constraints included are 1) Grashof’s condition to have a <b>crank</b> rocker <b>linkage,</b> 2) the transmission angle criterion and 3) input link angle sequence. The variables included are the link lengths and angles. A new optimization scheme known as harmony search method is implemented to get the optimum solutions. Harmony search method is based on musical performance process that occurs when a musician searches for a better state of harmony. The pitch of each musical instrument determines aesthetic quality just as objective function value assigned to variables. A computer programme based on this algorithm is implemented in MATLAB to obtain the optimum dimension of four-bar linkage. The function files are employed to generate initial feasible solutions and effective object function based on penalty function method. Four examples are illustrated to show the effectiveness of the method. It is found that the method is quite convenient and works in-par with other non conventional optimization methods like genetic algorithms and particle swam optimization...|$|R
40|$|Design {{requirements}} for the cabin, cabin system, flight controls, engine installation, and wing-fuselage interface that provide adequate interior volume for occupant seating, cabin ingress and egress, and safety are presented. The fuselage structure must be sufficient to meet the loadings specified in the appropriate sections of Federal Aviation Regulation Part 23. The critical structure must provide a safe life of 10 (exp 6) load cycles and 10, 000 operational mission cycles. The cabin seating and controls must provide adjustment to account for various pilot physiques and to aid in maintenance and operation of the aircraft. Seats and doors shall not bind or lockup under normal operation. Cabin systems such as heating and ventilation, electrical, lighting, intercom, and avionics must {{be included in the}} design. The control system will consist of ailerons, elevator, and rudders. The system must provide required deflections with a combination of push rods, bell <b>cranks,</b> pulleys, and <b>linkages.</b> The system will be free from slack and provide smooth operation without binding. Environmental considerations include variations in temperature and atmospheric pressure, protection against sand, dust, rain, humidity, ice, snow, salt/fog atmosphere, wind and gusts, and shock and vibration. The following design goals were set to meet the requirements of the statement of work: safety, performance, manufacturing and cost. To prevent the engine from penetrating the passenger area {{in the event of a}} crash was the primary safety concern. Weight and the fuselage aerodynamics were the primary performance concerns.

40|$|In {{brackish}} groundwater desalination, high recovery ratio (of {{fresh water}} from saline feed) is desired to minimise concentrate reject. To this effect, {{previous studies have}} developed a batch reverse osmosis (RO) desalination system, DesaLink, which proposed to expand steam in a reciprocating piston cylinder and transmit the driving force through a <b>linkage</b> <b>crank</b> mechanism to pressurise batches of saline water (recirculating) in a water piston cylinder unto RO membranes. However, steam is largely disadvantaged at operation from low temperature (< 150 oC) thermal sources; and organic working fluids are more viable, though, the obtainable thermal cycle efficiencies are generally low with low temperatures. Consequently, this thesis proposed to investigate the use of organic working fluid Rankine cycle (ORC) with isothermal expansion, to drive the DesaLink machine, at improved thermal efficiency from low temperature thermal sources. Following {{a review of the}} methods of achieving isothermal expansion, ‘liquid flooded expansion’ and ‘expansion chamber surface heating’ were identified as potential alternative methods. Preliminary experimental comparative analysis of variants of the heated expansion chamber technique of effecting isothermal expansion favoured a heated plain wall technique, and as such was adopted for further optimisation and development. Further, an optimised isothermal ORC engine was built and tested at < 95 oC heat source temperature, with R 245 fa working fluid – which was selected from 16 working fluids that were analysed for isothermal operation. Upon satisfactory performance of the test engine, a larger (10 times) version was built and coupled to drive the DesaLink system. Operating the integrated ORC-RO DesaLink system, gave freshwater (approximately 500 ppm) production of about 12 litres per hour (from 4000 ppm feed water) at a recovery ratio of about 0. 7 and specific energy consumption of 0. 34 kWh/m 3; and at a thermal efficiency of 7. 7 %. Theoretical models characterising the operation and performance of the integrated system was developed and utilised to access the potential field performance of the system, when powered by two different thermal energy sources – solar and industrial bakery waste heat – as case studies...|$|R
