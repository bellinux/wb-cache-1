The methods of self-sufficient problem-solving of the machines brings on several questions in programming, so mobile robots started to extend as tools of education as well. Our final goal was in this project to create the model of an automata depository that constitutes a closed system from the users ’ point of view. We model such circumstances that make autonomy important like extreme high or low temperature, closeness of dangerous materials. These circumstances substantiates the need of robots {{and that they have}} to solve their problems self-sufficiently, without any direct human interaction. The model builds up from two main components: the <b>Central</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>Unit</b> (CCU), and the group of robots. The robots ply in the depository using the line following method. During their activity may turn up some conflict situations, whose autonomous handling is the main topic of our research. Using the right wayfinder algorithm and the representation of the map of the depository, the robots find out after a short information excange, who of them has to give way to the other in order to solve the conflict in optimal time. The communication between the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Robots and the <b>Central</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>Unit</b> is based on a BlueTooth connection. The robots ’ autonomy means that if they loose connection with the CCU, they can finish their commands that they have already received. Nevertheless navigating their physical relocation and sense any incidental new barrier is absolutely their task...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Unified power Flow Controller (UPFC) is {{effective}} equipment in controlling the power {{flow in the}} new deregulated electricity markets. The UPFC realizes its function by changing part {{or all of the}} parameters affecting flowing of the power in a transmission line. These parameters include the bus voltages, the line impedance and the power angle. The UPFC {{is by far the most}} advanced and versatile device in the Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) device family. However, several problems, reliability, cost, and footprint requirement, hinder its widespread acceptance by the electric utilities. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional UPFC, this work proposed and studied a new UPFC technology that addresses these impediments. This novel technology is called the Distributed PFC (DPFC). The proposed DPFC is based on single-phase system, considering the high voltage insulation, the manufacturing cost, and the installation requirement. A hierarchy control of the DPFC system is proposed, which includes local <b>unit</b> <b>control</b> and a <b>central</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> The <b>central</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> calculates series voltage and shunt real/reactive power commands for every DPFC unit. The local DPFC unit accepts commands from the <b>central</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> monitors local voltage at the connection point, and realizes its control commands. The functions and performance of the DPFC system is verified with simulation and experiments...|$|R

With the ability of integrating several soft processor cores into one FPGA fabric, {{we can have a}} hierarchy of controllers in one SoC design. Compared to the previous codesigns trying to optimize the com-munication overhead between the <b>central</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> and coprocessor over bus by using different bus protocols (e. g. OPB, PLB and FSL) or advanced techniques (e. g. DMA), our approach prevents overhead in bus transactions by introducing a local 8 bit microcontroller, PicoBlaze, in the coprocessor. As a result, the performance of the ECC coprocessor can be almost independent of the selection of bus protocols. To further accelerate the Uni-PicoBlaze based ECC SoC design, a Dual-PicoBlaze based architecture is proposed, which can achieve the maximum instruc-tion rate of 1 instruction/cycle to the ECC datapath. Using design space exploration {{of a large number of}} system configurations of different ar-chitectures discussed in this paper, our proposed Dual-PicoBlaze based design also shows best trade-off between area and speed. ...|$|R
