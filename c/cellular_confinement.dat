40|$|ErbB transmembrane {{receptor}}s are {{a family}} of 4 receptor tyrosine kinases that {{interact with one another}} through homo and heterodimer interactions. When these dimers form, the kinase domains on the receptor tails interact with one another, transphosphorylating one another, initiating a signal cascade. The signaling pathways these receptors participate in are responsible for many different cell functions including apoptosis, growth, and proliferation. The overexpression of these receptors has been linked to various forms of cancer, emphasizing the importance of understanding how these receptors interact with one another to trigger these cascades. Single Particle Tracking experiments have provided more precise and detailed measures of dimer lifetimes and diffusion. A major observation from the experiments is the anomalous diffusion of the receptors. One suggested contributor to this anomalous diffusion is confinement zones on the membrane. In this work, we develop, validate, and implement a spatial stochastic model to study these receptors and uncover how their kinetics and dynamics as well as the membrane landscape come together to impact erbB activation. We start by focusing on erbB 1. Single particle tracking experiments show that receptor pairs interact repeatedly over a period of time. One possible explanation for these repeated interactions is to facilitate phosphorylation. An asymmetric phosphorylation model is proposed, where one receptor in the dimer pair is responsible for activating the other receptor, the receiver, which then in turn phosphorylates the original activator. The model shows that the confinement zones on the membrane {{play a critical role in}} causing repeated receptor interactions and reveals that receptors dynamically switch between different activation states over time. Our work continues by delving deeper into the membrane landscape. Single particle tracking data is analyzed to investigate the characteristics of the observed anomalous diffusion. The analysis gives an estimate for the size range of the confinement zones and shows that they are a series of domains, not corrals. Taking the single particle tracking analysis one step further, we develop a Domain Reconstruction Algorithm that reconstructs confinement zone shapes and sizes from single particle tracking trajectories. In the final study, we move on to erbB 2 and erbB 3 interactions. ErbB 3, which is traditionally believed to be kinase dead, has recently been shown to have weak kinase activity. Through kinase assay experiments, we show in the presence of erbB 2 and heregulin, erbB 3 has measurable kinase activity. Using the reconstructed domains from erbB 2 and erbB 3 data to create a simulation space, and experimental data from the kinase assay and single particle tracking, we extend the erbB 1 spatial stochastic model for this study. We show that erbB 2 and erbB 3 have significantly different interactions with the <b>cellular</b> membrane <b>confinement</b> zones, erbB 3 is dependent on erbB 2 activation, and erbB 3 homodimer stability inhibits erbB 3 activation. Extension of the model to investigate mutation behaviors in erbB 3 receptors reveals insights into how a gain of function mutation in the erbB 3 kinase domain impacts erbB 2 and erbB 3 interactions. Finally, discovery of a gain of function mutation in the kinase domain of erbB 3 is connected to an uptick in erbB 3 kinase activity. As a path forward from this work, we suggest using the spatial stochastic model to investigate more possible mutations in erbB 3 receptors to give better insight into which mutations would be promising to explore.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi {{investigar}} o efeito da castração, tempo de confinamento, metabolismo celular e regiões do musculo sobre a oxidação proteica e lipídica e outras características de qualidade da carne bovina. Oitenta e quatro bovinos (castrados e inteiros) Nelore, confinados por diferentes períodos, foram usados para conduzir estudos em músculos Longissimus dorsi e Biceps femoris. O segundo musculo foi dividido em duas porções: origem (PO) e inserção (PI). No estudo com L. dorsi, bifes foram embalados sob condições de aerobiose (PVC) e anaerobiose (vácuo) e maturados por 1, 3, 5, 7 e 9, e 1, 7, 14 e 21 dias, respectivamente. Para este músculo, nenhuma diferença na estabilidade oxidativa [tióis, carbonilas e Substancias Reativas ao Ácido Tiobarbiturico (TBARS) ] e cor entre as carnes dos animais inteiros e castrados foram encontradas. Isto poderia ser explicado pela falta de diferença no status oxidativo inicial, mensurados através da atividade de enzimas antioxidantes, conteúdo de glutationa total e composição de ácidos graxos, entre as condições sexuais. Os resultados também indicaram que a oxidação dos bifes embalados a vácuo leva o dobro de dias para iniciar, em comparação aos bifes em aerobiose. No estudo com o Bíceps femoris, os animais foram abatidos com 59 e 129 dias de confinamento e os bifes da PO e PI foram maturados por 1, 30, 60 e 100 dias. Os resultados da atividade das enzimas lactato desidrogenase e citrato sintase mostraram que a PO tem metabolismo mais oxidativo (aeróbio) e a PI glicolítico (anaeróbio). A carne dos animais inteiros tiveram menor TBARS e maior luminosidade (L*), perda de peso por cocção (PPC) e força de cisalhamento (FC) em comparação aos animais castrados. A PO foi mais susceptível a oxidação proteica (menor tióis) em comparação a PI. A carne dos animais confinados por 129 dias tiveram maiores PPC e oxidação proteica (menores tióis) em comparação a carne dos animais confinados por 59 dias. Diferenças de estabilidade oxidativa entre a carne de animais castrados e inteiros confinados por menor período desapareceram quando os animais foram confinados por maior período. Valores de pH e tióis na carne dos animais castrados e inteiros foram afetados pelo tempo de maturação. Ambas as condições sexuais tiveram carne com maior valores de pH no dia 30 de maturação e este, se manteve ao longo do tempo. A PO teve maiores valores de TBARS no dia 60, PPC no dia 100 e FC nos dias 30 e 60 de maturação em comparação a PI. Foi observada uma interação entre tempo de confinamento e tempo de maturação para tióis, TBARS, metamioglobina, pH, L* e FC. Quando comparado aos animais confinados por 59 dias, os animais confinados por 129 dias tiveram: maior oxidação (maior TBARS e menor tióis) nos dias 60 e 100 de maturação; oxidação da mioglobina (metamioglobina) mais tardia, sendo o maior valor obtido no dia 100; menor luminosidade (L*) em todos os tempos de maturação; maior maciez (menor FC) aos 100 dias de maturação. Os animais confinados por 59 dias tiveram: maior oxidação proteica (menor tióis) e maciez (menor FC) aos 30 dias de maturação. De forma geral, todos os efeitos testados tais como castração, tempo de confinamento, metabolismo celular e regiões do musculo pareceram influenciar sobre a oxidação proteica e lipídica e outras características de qualidade da carne bovina. The {{objective of}} this work {{was to investigate the}} effect of the castration, time on <b>confinement,</b> <b>cellular</b> metabolism and muscle region on the protein and lipid oxidation, and other traits of beef quality. Eight-four Nellore cattle (steers and bulls), confined for different periods, were used to conduct studies in Longissimus dorsi and Biceps femoris muscles. The latter muscle was divided in two portions: origin (OP) and insertion (IP). In the study of L. dorsi muscle, steaks were packaged under aerobiosis (PVC) and anaerobiosis (vacuum) conditions and aged for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9, and 1, 7, 14 and 21 days, respectively. For this muscle, no differences in oxidative stability [thiols, carbonyls and Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) ] and color between the meat from bulls and steers were found. This could be explained by the lack of differences in initial oxidative status, measured through the activity of the antioxidants enzymes, content of total glutathione and composition of fatty acids, between the sexual conditions. The results also indicated that the oxidation of the steaks vacuum-packaged took about twice more days to start than the steaks under aerobiosis. In the study of Biceps femoris muscle, the animals were slaughtered after 59 and 129 days on confinement and the steaks from OP and IP were aged for 1, 30, 60 and 100 days. The results of the lactate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase enzymes activity showed that the OP has a more oxidative metabolism and the IP has a more glycolytic metabolism. The meat from bulls had lower TBARS and higher lightness (L*), cooking loss (CL) and shear force (SF) in comparison with steers. The OP was more susceptible to protein oxidation (lower thiols) than the IP. Animals confined for 129 days had meat with higher CL when compared to those ones confined for 59 days. The meat from animals confined for 129 days had higher CL and protein oxidation (lower thiols) in regard to the meat from animals confined for 59 days. Differences in oxidative stability between the meat from steers and bulls confined for shorter period disappeared when the animals were confined for larger period. Values of pH and thiols in meat from steers and bulls were affected by the time of aging. Both the sexual conditions had meat with higher pH values at the day 30 of aging and this was kept across the time. The OP had higher values of TBARS at the day 60, CL at the day 100 and SF at the days 30 and 60 of aging when compared to the IP. It was observed an interaction between confinement time and aging time for thiols, TBARS, metmyoglobin, pH, L* and SF. When compared to the animals confined for 59 days, the animals confined for 129 days had: higher oxidation (higher TBARS and lower thiols) at the days 60 and 100 of aging; oxidation of myoglobin (metmyoglobin) slower, since the higher value was obtained at the day 100; lower lightness (L*) in all the times of aging; tender meat (lower SF) at 100 days of aging. The animals confined for 59 days had: higher protein oxidation (lower thiols) and tender meat (lower SF) at 30 days of aging. Overall, all the effects tested such as castration, time on <b>confinement,</b> <b>cellular</b> metabolism and muscle region seemed to influence on the protein and lipid oxidation and other traits of beef quality...|$|R

5000|$|When Neoweb is {{deployed}} and compacted with soil/aggregate a <b>cellular</b> <b>confinement</b> {{composite structure}} is created from the geotechnical {{interaction of the}} material, soil and geometry. Soil confinement retains infill materials in three dimensions providing high tensile strength on each axis. Under loading Neoweb generates lateral confinement while soil-to-cell wall friction reduces vertical movement. The high hoop strength of the cell walls, together with the passive earth and passive resistance of adjacent cells, also increases soil strength and stiffness. Aggregate abrasion is minimized by the cell confinement, thereby reducing attrition of the base material. Vertical loading on Neoweb with compacted infill creates a semi-rigid slab or [...] "beam effect" [...] in the structure.

NPA is a composite alloy of polyamide nano-fibers dispersed in a polyethylene matrix. It provides ductility similar to HDPE with elastic behavior similar to engineering thermoplastics, to create a stiffer CCS more suitable for heavy duty applications, such as base reinforcement of highways, railways, container yards, etc. that are subject to long-term heavy static and dynamic loading.|$|E
50|$|The few {{standards}} for CCS were developed more than 40 {{years ago and}} have changed little since. Some of the current standards evolved from 2D planar geosynthetics, and as such, {{do not reflect the}} composite behavior of 3D geometry of CCS, nor do they test long-term parameters such as: dynamic loading, permanent plastic deformation, effect of temperatures, environmental durability, etc. On the other hand ISO/ASTM procedures have been developed for testing polymers in the space and automobile industries, as well as for other geosynthetic products. These new {{standards for}} CCS were proposed and under discussion by leading experts in geosynthetics in ASTM technical committee D-35. The stated goal is to set new industry standards that more accurately reflect 3D <b>cellular</b> <b>confinement</b> system geometry and material performance in the field rather than lab tests of individual strips and virgin materials that are typically used today. Although international guidelines require the use of the most updated applicable standards, only one geocell manufacturer has done so to date. An example of one such standard is the SIM - Stepped Isothermal Method (ASTM D-6992) was specifically created for the accelerated creep testing of polymers. This test is important as creep resistance is critical to maintaining confinement, and the functioning of the geocell in the project over time.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a meeting}} between the Commanding Officer of the Light Dragoons (Lt Col Fair) and Commanding Officer of 28 Engineer Regiment (Lt Col MTG Bazeley) {{it was decided that}} a new and easier to protect road would be {{constructed}} by the Royal Engineers. 28 Engineer Regiment had used a new road construction material called NeoWeb geosynthetic <b>cellular</b> <b>confinement</b> system on an exercise in the UK prior to deployment and this was considered to be a practical option to reduce cost aggregate and provide a barrier to the implanting of lethal IEDS. Lt Col Bazeley contacted the Sales Director of PRS (who was at that time on holiday) and talked him into providing a small amount of Neoweb to trial in Afghan conditions which PRS agreed to do free of charge. The trial proved successful and Bazeley undertook to use funds originally designated to buy aggregate to purchase in excess of £2m of NeoWeb material. The NeoWeb was shipped to Cyprus by PRS and Bazeley convinced the RAF to re-route a flight via Cyprus to pick it up. Construction began in December 2009 and was completed in March 2010, during which time the construction teams and security forces came under frequent attack. This was the first road to be built under fire since British operations in the Dhofar Rebellion in the early 1970s, the completed road allowed resupply convoys to travel its length in about 30 minutes, compared to 36 hours along the old road. The success of the project led to the approval of plans for an extension to connect the provincial capital Lashkar Gah with the economic capital of Gereshk. Construction of the extension began in July 2010 and was completed in April 2011.|$|E
