The arguments for greater financial disclosure center around meeting the diverse needs of an increasingly sophisticated pool of investors. Another argument for voluntarily increasing financial disclosure is the potential threat of government intervention {{in the setting of}} financial disclosure requirements that may even be more stringent. These arguments have to be balanced against the counter-arguments that first, people can only process limited amounts of information. Second, do the benefits to users outweigh the costs of collection, collating, and disseminating the additional information? Third, there is the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>issue</b> of greater disclosure.

40|$|Abstract—Most {{of studies}} about E-Commerce Security {{focus on the}} data <b>confidentiality</b> <b>issue.</b> Although {{security}} mechanisms, such as SSL (secure socket layer) or SET (secure electronic transaction), have been adopted in websites, catastrophic events that confidential data in E-Commerce are revealed happened more than once. The essential {{reason for this is}} that there exist potential security vulnerabilities in the E-Commerce applications themselves. The origins of these vulnerabilities are mainly from the lack of reliable input validation that can prevent E-commerce application from attacks. SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and Price Changing Attack are mainly known security threats to E-Commerce applications. These attacks and the protecting ways by using XML validation technology have been discussed, and a framework that prevents E-Commerce applications from attacks has been proposed in this paper...|$|R

Surveys suggest that the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>issue</b> {{is one of the}} major obstacles for users to use cloud {{storage services}} to keep sensitive data. This paper proposes to deploy a Redundant Array of Independent Net-storages (RAIN) for confidentiality control in Cloud Computing. The RAIN approach splits data into segments and distributes segments onto multiple storage providers, without having to trust each provider. By keeping the distribution of segments and the relationships between the distributed segments private, the original data cannot be reassembled. When the segments are small enough, each segment discloses no meaningful information to others. Hence RAIN is able to ensure the confidentiality of data stored on clouds. A formal model of the proposed approach has been developed to articulate the process. Security analysis has been performed, indicating that the proposed approach can implement confidentiality protection without the need of encrypting the dat...|$|R

30|$|The {{security}} features forms {{an integral part}} of synchrophasor data communication and is left mostly unaddressed or merely addressed in IEEE C 37.118 standard. The prominent characteristics employed to judge security in wide area communication systems includes confidentiality, integrity, and availability. ‘Confidentiality’ deals with information privacy in the data packet when it is transmitted over an insecure communication network. It provides a measure of vulnerability of the data packets to attackers and is achieved through data encryption. IEEE C 37.118 does not address <b>confidentiality</b> <b>issue.</b> However in IEC 61850 - 90 - 5, confidentiality is achieved by implementing the concept of “perfect-forward” security and encryption key rotation between publishers and subscribers. Generally publisher, i.e. PMU, is the sender of synchrophasor data and the subscriber, i.e. PDC, is its receiver. The key distribution center (KDC) provides the symmetric key coordination between the publishers and subscribers. Where a subscriber is given advanced warning of when the next key rotation is to occur, i.e. TimeToNextKey, and also detects if it is out-of-sync with the current key.|$|R

The situation of health care informatization and implementation of electronic medical record in primary health care in new countries, other former Yugoslav republics, is described. There are rather big differences among countries and even among some regions of one country, but in the last year the situation improved, especially in Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. The main problem that is still unsolved is software offered by several companies which do not offer many functions, are non-standardized or user friendly enough and is not adapted to doctors' needs. Some important questions on medical records are discussed, e. g. what is in fact a medical record, what is its purpose, who uses it, which record is a good one, what should contain and <b>confidentiality</b> <b>issue.</b> The author describes what makes electronic medical record better than paper-based one (above all it is of better quality, efficiency and care-safe, easier in data retrieval and does it offer the possibility of data exchange with other health care professionals) and what are the barriers to its wider implementation...|$|R

40|$|Counseling {{service in}} schools {{is a recent}} phenomenon. My own {{experience}} of counseling in schools in Syria exposed me to a situation, when I was not sure whether people around me (management, teachers, and students) had any understanding of my work as a counselor or not. In the present study, I have attempted to respond to my own query. This study explored how principal, teachers, school counselor and students understood counseling service in a private school in Karachi, Pakistan. For this purpose, I conducted this study within the qualitative research paradigm. Semi-structured interview, focus group discussion, document analysis were used as tools to generate data. The school 2 ̆ 7 s principal, two teachers of grade eight, the school counselor, four students (who utilized the counseling service) and fifteen students (who did not utilize the counseling service) participated in the study. Findings of the study indicate that school counseling was unanimously viewed as a strategy for solving students 2 ̆ 7 problems. However, the school counselor considered it a strategy to enable students to solve their own problems. School counseling was also considered {{as a means to}} provide students with emotional support, which was not available to them otherwise in schools 2 ̆ 7 everyday mechanical routines. Furthermore, the school counselor was required to extend motherly affection 2 ̆ 7 and to act as a big sister or brother 2 ̆ 7 to the students. The stakeholders 2 ̆ 7 expectations of school counselor ranged between solving students 2 ̆ 7 day-to- day problems regarding studies, and also teaching the teachers counseling skills. The study also identifies the inherent tension between the school counselor and teachers. This tension seemed rooted in two factors. Firstly, school counseling is quite a recent phenomenon in schools, which is {{still in the process of}} being accepted by various stakeholders. In this particular case, the counselor is attempting to make her place in very conventional trio of teacher, student. and school. Secondly, the procedure used for counseling such as students being called from teaching and learning session, and school counselor observing teachers to check students 2 ̆ 7 particular complaints may have caused teachers 2 ̆ 7 disapproval of school counseling. The research also found an absence of role ambiguity, which has been found in research generally done about counseling and counselors 2 ̆ 7 role in other contexts. Clarity regarding school counselor 2 ̆ 7 s role was found at all levels (management, teachers and students). However, procedures used for offering counseling service were not clear. This led to some students 2 ̆ 7 dissatisfaction of the school counselor 2 ̆ 7 s ability to maintain confidentiality. In fact, the major challenge which the school counselor faced was the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>issue.</b> Students expressed reluctance to utilize the counseling service because of the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>issue.</b> This study has a particular significance for schools as it draws the attention of institutions such as the Aga Khan University-Institute for Educational Development (AKU-IED) to view school counseling as an important strategy that can contribute to school improvement efforts by the virtue of paying attention to students 2 ̆ 7 different needs...|$|R
