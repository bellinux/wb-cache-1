50|$|Books {{are used}} as a <b>concealment</b> <b>device</b> {{in part because they}} are readily {{available}} and inconspicuous in many settings.|$|E
50|$|A {{dead drop}} spike is a <b>concealment</b> <b>device</b> {{similar to a}} microcache. It has been used since the late 1960s to hide money, maps, documents, microfilm, and other items. The spike is water- and mildew-proof and can be pushed into the ground or placed in a shallow stream to be {{retrieved}} at a later time.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II MI9 was {{responsible}} for creating many <b>concealment</b> <b>devices</b> for [...] "escape aids" [...] to assist prisoners of war to escape.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Concealment</b> <b>devices</b> {{are used}} to hide things {{for the purpose of}} secrecy or security. Examples in espionage include dead drop spikes for {{transferring}} notes or small items to other people, and hollowed-out coins or teeth for concealing suicide pills.|$|R
50|$|Books are {{possibly}} the most common <b>concealment</b> <b>devices</b> in usage. They are easily made and can contain quite large objects. They are also very difficult for outsiders to spot but easy to recognize for those that {{are looking for a}} specific book on a shelf.|$|R
50|$|Also a {{new form}} of <b>concealment</b> <b>device,</b> mock cans of various {{household}} chemicals or food and drinks can be purchased. A wide variety of commonly used personal care, household products and food containers with removable tops and bottoms are available. Valuables can be discreetly stored inside these lookalike containers and kept in their seemingly rightful places. Each of these diversion safes are indistinguishable from the genuine product, and can thus avoid detection, and they may even be weighted to feel full.|$|E
50|$|A hollow container, {{fashioned}} to {{look like}} an Eisenhower dollar, is still used today to hide and send messages or film without being detected. Because it resembles ordinary pocket change, it is virtually undetectable as a <b>concealment</b> <b>device.</b> If a hollow coin is suspected, it sometimes can be easily confirmed by weighing against a normal coin on a simple balance. However, more sophisticated hollow coins have had their weight adjusted to match an unaltered coin by including a ring of a dense metal such as lead inside the coin. Typically coins that have no gold or silver content are used so as to further avoid suspicion.|$|E
5000|$|A {{drop-out}} compensator is an error <b>concealment</b> <b>device</b> that was {{commonly used in}} the analog video era to hide brief RF signal [...] "drop-outs" [...] on videotape playback caused by imperfections in or damage to the tape's magnetic coating. Most compensators worked by repeating earlier video scan-lines over short periods of signal loss; one early such system, [...] "Mincom" [...] {{was developed in the}} 1960s by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the company now known as 3M. Because of the high cost of the 3M device at the time, BBC R&D engineers developed a simpler, less expensive unit based on a sample-and-hold technique for in-house use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Concealment</b> <b>devices</b> or {{diversion}} safes {{are used}} to hide things {{for the purpose of}} secrecy or security. They are made from an ordinary household object such as a book, a soda can, a candle, a can, or something as small as a coin. The idea is that such an inconspicuous object would not be expected to contain anything of worth.|$|R
50|$|Agent {{training}} often includes {{techniques of}} tradecraft such as clandestine communications, including cryptography, {{the use of}} one-time pads, the construction of <b>concealment</b> <b>devices,</b> and the employment of dead drops. Other elements of tradecraft include elicitation, surveillance and countersurveillance, photography and the emplacement of audio devices, sensors, or other transmitters. Case officers generally train agents one at a time, in isolation, including only those elements of tradecraft needed to penetrate the target at hand. Case officers will also teach agents how to develop cover for status, and cover for action, meaning how to establish credible pretexts for their presence and behavior while engaged in collection activities. A well-trained and competent agent can conduct his or her clandestine tasks while under close surveillance, and still evade detection. More advanced agent training can include resistance to interrogation.|$|R
50|$|The AN-M8 Smoke Grenade {{designated}} as the Army/Navy Model 8 HC Smoke Grenade (AN-M8 Smoke HC) is a U.S. military grenade used as a ground-to-ground or ground to air <b>concealment</b> or signaling <b>device.</b>|$|R
50|$|Computer {{equipment}} and consumer electronics {{can easily be}} used for concealing goods and information. Usually the only tool required is a screwdriver, the device can be opened up, have {{the majority of the}} electronic and mechanical components removed and replaced with the goods to be concealed. Some of the more common devices used for this purpose are video players such as VHS, CD, DVD and Blu-ray players, computer accessories such as DVD-ROM drives and hard disk drives, battery packs or even a laptop computer itself. More often than not, the majority of the components will be removed to allow more space to conceal an item, but that will render the device inoperable and may arouse suspicion, and it may be of more benefit to preserve the operation of the device at the sacrifice of space. Additionally, the electronic device itself may be subject to theft, thereby defeating the purpose of such a <b>concealment</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
40|$|Society {{should give}} criminals {{incentives}} not to conceal their criminal activity. The concealment costs themselves are a social waste, as are other costs the concealment may impose on society, such as additional harm or increased law enforcement expenditures. I show that for any set of sanctions {{that lead to}} positive concealment {{on behalf of the}} criminal, that society can modify the sanctions to give the criminal an incentive not to conceal and unambiguously improve social welfare. A similar conclusion will apply to increasing the costs of concealment devices to improve social welfare. Society can deter concealment of crime by raising the sanction or raising the cost of concealing the crime. Which policy is chosen should depend upon the <b>concealment</b> <b>device</b> involved. If it is easy to detect the use of a <b>concealment</b> <b>device</b> when a person is caught, then penalties should be imposed on the criminal for using such a <b>concealment</b> <b>device.</b> If the device is of the type that has no legitimate purpose other than being used for concealment, then the device should be heavily taxed or be outlawed. For situations where we are unable to determine whether the device has been used to conceal and the device has legitimate purpose, society should set one penalty for the crime, and possibly a generalized additional sanction for any concealment of the crime that can be determined.
