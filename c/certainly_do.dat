However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E

In 2010 he rebuffed a query about his interest in sculpting a memorial to Bill McLaren, a rugby union broadcaster: [...] "I do not do sportsmen and I <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not do sports commentators. I do artists, philosophers and poets", he said, [...] warning that memorials are often hastily erected. Advocates of the memorial described the remarks as insensitive, and said that [...] "To have Bill {{looking down on the}} fans at Murrayfield, microphone in hand, would bring a huge smile to so many faces." ...|$|E

500|$|Echoing the magazine's earlier {{support for}} the tour, Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker praised Harrison's [...] "nifty slide guitar" [...] on the opening song and {{throughout}} the album, which he felt [...] "should <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> a tremendous amount to salvage George's battered reputation". In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner similarly opined that [...] "Hari's on Tour" [...] "boasts some mean licks" [...] while commenting that neither the tour nor the album [...] "warrant all the abuse they got". Writing more recently for AllMusic, Richard Ginell describes the recording as [...] "Tom Scott's L.A. Express churning out all-pro L.A.-studio jazz/rock" [...] and adds that the song [...] "gets the doomed project off to a spirited start".|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{a version}} for Java-based mobile phones was {{announced}} by Sony Pictures Mobile. Reviewers generally acknowledged it as a faithful port of the arcade original, but criticized the controls. Modojo's Robert Falcon {{stated that the}} diagonal controls take time to adapt to {{on a cell phone}} with traditional directions. Michael French of Pocket Gamer concluded: [...] "You can't escape the fact it doesn't exactly fit on mobile. The graphics <b>certainly</b> <b>do,</b> and the spruced-up sound effects are timeless… but really, it's a little too perfect a conversion." [...] Airgamer criticized the gameplay as monotonous and the difficulty as frustrating. By contrast, Wireless Gaming Review called it [...] "one of the best of mobile's retro roundup".|$|E

500|$|Kantrowitz deemed Tillman [...] "the Senate's wild man", {{who applied}} the same {{techniques}} of accusation and insinuation that had {{served him well}} in South Carolina. In 1897, Tillman accused the Republicans, [...] "I <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not want to attack {{any member of the}} committee who does not deserve to be attacked [...] nobody denies that there have been rooms occupied for two months by the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee at the Arlington Hotel... in easy reach of the sugar trust". Simkins, though, opined that Tillman's speeches in the Senate were only inflammatory because of his injection of personalities, and if that is disregarded, his speeches, when read, come across as well-reasoned and even conservative.|$|E
500|$|When {{he signed}} a {{professional}} football contract with the New York Giants, Timberlake stated {{that he intended to}} take ministerial training at Princeton Theological Seminary during the off-season. [...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it. [...] I put my face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace." ...|$|E
500|$|The State Department {{created a}} team of diplomats who would support PBSUCCESS. It was led by John Peurifoy, who took over as Ambassador to Guatemala in October 1953. Another {{member of the team}} was William D. Pawley, a wealthy {{businessman}} and diplomat with extensive knowledge of the aviation industry. Peurifoy was a militant anti-communist, and had proven his willingness to work with the CIA during his time as United States Ambassador to Greece. Under Peurifoy's tenure, relations with the Guatemalan government soured further, although those with the Guatemalan military improved. In a report to John Dulles, Peurifoy stated that he was [...] "definitely convinced that if [...] is not a communist, then he will <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> until one comes along". Within the CIA, the operation was headed by Deputy Director Frank Wisner, who had worked in the U.S. intelligence service since World War II. The field commander was former U.S. Army Colonel Albert Haney, who was then chief of the CIA station in South Korea. Haney reported directly to Wisner, thereby separating PBSUCCESS from the CIA's Latin American division, a decision which created some tension within the agency.|$|E

500|$|Along with Jim Miller's {{opinions}} in Rolling Stone magazine, Woffinden's 1974 album review for the NME {{was one of}} the most scathing critiques. Woffinden bemoaned how on Dark Horse, [...] "the radiant light of George's spirituality is planted firmly under a bushel and darkness is not confined to equine matters". He then wrote of the song: [...] " [...] seems to have most chance of independent survival, especially as the song turned up in quite pleasant shape on Wood's I've Got My Own Album To Do, but here again the production effectively smothers it, and Harrison's drab vocals complete the assassination." [...] By contrast, Michael Gross of Circus Raves magazine viewed the album as the equal of Harrison's acclaimed All Things Must Pass (1970) and praised the song and its arrangement, writing: [...] "Scott again excels on 'Far East Man', with a horn solo that would vindicate any context in which it was put." [...] In a similarly positive assessment for Melody Maker, Brian Harrigan opined that Dark Horse [...] "should <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> a tremendous amount to salvage George's battered reputation" [...] but found the extended playout to [...] "Far East Man" [...] overlong – an example, he said, where [...] "you can have just too much of a good thing".|$|E

2500|$|The {{reading of}} 'giants' is {{difficult}} for {{it is hard to}} imagine that Germanic 'giants' could have non-antagonistic relations with any human people. It seems likely that there is perhaps intentional ambiguity here between 'giants' and 'Jutes/Frisians'. [...] Stuhmiller makes the keen observation that after the Finn Episode, no form of eoten or eotan occurs in the poem, ambiguous or otherwise. This is striking because 'giants' <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not disappear from the poem at this point [...] The poet's song of Finn occurs immediately Beowulf has slain Grendel, the eotan who has been tormenting the Danes ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Neumann, a {{philosophy}} professor at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario {{expressed support for}} the boycott. Neumann stated that [...] "If people believe these are extreme circumstances and it will do some good, then I think it's reasonable and perhaps justified." [...] He argued that a boycott is not anti-semitic, stating that [...] "It targets Israeli, not Jewish, professors." [...] He further stated that [...] "People may always have bad motives underlying good motives. And it's not absolutely impossible {{that some of these}} people have anti-Semitic feelings deep down, but do I think that plays a large part? No, I <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not." ...|$|E

To Smith's proposal, Sarah replied, [...] "Am I called upon to break the marriage covenant ... to my lawful husband! I never will. I care not for the blessings of Jacob, and I believe in NO SUCH revelations, neither will I consent under any circumstances. I have one good husband, and that is enough for me." [...] She issued an ultimatum to Smith: [...] "Joseph, if you ever attempt any thing of the kind with me again, I will tell Mr. Pratt on his return home.
