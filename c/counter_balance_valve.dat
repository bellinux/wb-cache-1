40|$|A {{district}} heating {{system is a}} centralized heating system widely used for space heating. They offer economic benefits and are acknowledged to be more energy efficient. Their energy efficiency can be further improved by optimally controlling and operating the overall system. With this as the motivation a thermal and hydraulic model of a {{district heating}} is developed in this thesis. The developed model consists of a boiler, six buildings, hot water distribution network, circulating pump, <b>balancing</b> and control <b>valves</b> and terminal heaters. Both dynamic and steady state hydraulic simulations were made to study supply, return water and zone temperature response; Pressure distribution in the piping network under different load conditions. A relationship between <b>balance</b> <b>valve</b> settings and outdoor temperature (heating load) was determined. It was shown that proper setting of <b>balance</b> <b>valves</b> {{as a function of}} heating load improves energy efficiency. PI controllers were designed for the boiler and zone temperature control. Closed loop simulations are presented to show the control performance. By using steady state optimization technique optimal set points for the boiler temperature and near-optimal <b>balance</b> <b>valve</b> positions as a function of outdoor temperature were determined. Simulation results show that the use of optimal set points and <b>balance</b> <b>valve</b> settings up to 20...|$|R

The major influence of different functionalization groups on the pyrrolidine nitrogen is whether or not they lead to quaternisation while no differences could be detected for different groups (methyl group or alkyl chain) producing one or the other configuration.

The vertical movement system needs to be studied differently from the horizontal movement system to develop its precision. The vertical movement system has load on its transfer direction and it makes the movement system weak in precision than the horizontal one.

50|$|A V port {{ball valve}} has either a 'v' shaped ball or a 'v' shaped seat. This allows for linear and even equal {{percentage}} flow characteristics. When the valve {{is in the}} closed position and opening is commenced the small end of the 'v' is opened first allowing stable flow control during this stage. This type of design requires a generally more robust construction due to higher velocities of the fluids, which might damage a standard valve. These {{can be referred to}} as a type of control valve but are typically not as accurate as a <b>balancing</b> <b>valve,</b> needle valve, globe valve, or pressure regulating valve.|$|R

40|$|Evaporators {{found in}} most HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R {{applications}} use multiple circuits to address the multidimensional optimization problem of cost, capacity, and air-/refrigerant side pressure drop. However, an inherent problem of having multiple refrigerant circuits in evaporators is that maldistribution can occur. This maldistribution can be caused on the refrigerant side by quality and/or mass flow maldistribution at the refrigerant distributor. On the air-side, maldistribution {{can be caused by}} uneven airflow and/or air inlet temperature; on both sides the possibility of uneven fouling exists. To reduce the performance penalties caused by air-side maldistribution, the hybrid control method was used to optimize the refrigerant distribution to individual circuits. The hybrid control uses a primary expansion valve, which provides for most of the pressure drop, and smaller secondary <b>balancing</b> <b>valves,</b> which adjust the individual circuit mass flowrates. This approach was chosen since it is expected that the <b>balancing</b> <b>valves</b> can be manufactured at much lower cost than individual expansion valves for each circuit. In order to assess how severe the influence on maldistribution is, four applications with high potential for air-side maldistribution were selected and investigated experimentally, as well as in simulation studies. ^ Application 1 was a 3 -ton R 404 A walk-in cooler refrigeration system for a storage room with a target temperature of 2 °C (35. 6 °F). It was found that the increasing air-side maldistribution, caused by uneven frost built up over time can lead to severe hunting with liquid overfeed from the evaporator, when using the factory installed thermostatic expansion valve (TXV). An electronic expansion valve (EXV) was used as baseline for the performance evaluations. It was found, that in both the TXV and EXV case, significant refrigerant maldistribution occurred even if the system was tested with no enforced air-side maldistribution. After including the <b>balancing</b> <b>valves,</b> the system coefficient of performance (COP) increased by approximately 4...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine whether a single 10 minute bout of exercise, performed at multiple intervals throughout the day to equal 30 minutes, can effectively elicit post-exercise hypotension (PEH). Secondly, it is important to explore whether a light (40 % VO 2 R) or moderate (70 % VO 2 R) intensity is required to elicit PEH within 10 minutes. Subjects (N= 11) completed a VO 2 max test utilizing the Bruce Treadmill protocol. Each subject returned within 3 – 5 days to complete two separate exercising trials. A <b>counter</b> <b>balanced</b> system was employed so that each subject did not perform the same intensity rotation (<b>Counter</b> <b>Balance</b> 1 = 40 % VO 2 R and 70 % VO 2 R for session 1 and session 2, respectively; <b>Counter</b> <b>Balance</b> 2 = 70 % VO 2 R and 40 % VO 2 R for session 1 and session 2). The first session consisted of 3 sessions (morning, noon, evening) separated by an average of 3. 5 hours at one of two intensities (40 % VO 2 R or 70 % VO 2 R). The second group of sessions were performed identical to the first, however, the intensity was altered depending upon <b>counter</b> <b>balance.</b> Baseline BP was measured prior to exercising. After each session, BP was measured at 2 intervals for the morning and noon sessions (immediately following and 20 minutes post-exercise); and at 3 intervals for the evening sessions (60 minutes post-exercise added) for both intensities. At 40 % VO 2 R, BP decreased significantly at the morning (p = 0. 007), noon (p = 0. 018) and evening (p = 0. 010) sessions at the 20 minute post-exercise interval. Although not significantly different, BP was observed to be lower at 60 minutes post-exercise interval. During the 70 % VO 2 R session, BP was significantly lower at the morning 20 minute (p =. 029) and evening 60 minute post-exercise measurements (p =. 006) when compared to baseline. There was no significant difference noted between 40 % and 70 % VO 2 R intensities at eliciting a drop in BP at any interval at any time point. Although not statistically significant, 70 % VO 2 R appeared to produce a further decrease at the 60 minute post-exercise measurement (102 mmHg) than did the 40 % session (106 mmHg). The results {{of this study indicate that}} PEH may be elicited after a single 10 minute exercise session. Furthermore, multiple bouts of 10 minutes produce an accumulated decrease in BP that can be observed at the completion of the day...|$|R
