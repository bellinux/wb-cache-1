40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effect of three different acids (sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid), on three different clay deposit samples, to recycle used lubricating oil. To achieve this objective, filtration of the used oil was carried out first to remove impurities like: sand, metal chip and other micro impurities using: Buncher funnel, filter papers and vacuum pump. The filtered oil was allowed to settle for twelve hours (12 hrs), before being centrifuged for another 20 mins at 10000 rpm so any particles in the oil can settle and be decanted. Next, the oil was preheated to degrade some additives, which helped to reduce the work load when acid was added. 100 ml of the preheated oil was measured and treated with 10 ml of various acids (Sulphuric acid, Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid) in varied strengths, and then allowed to stand for thirty minutes in a separating funnel before being allowed {{to pass through the}} bed of clay using a vacuum pump. Caustic Soda was then added to the extracted oil to help neutralize the acid in the oil. The resulting oil was slightly dark in colour.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a generic <b>point</b> <b>cloud</b> encoder that {{provides}} a unified framework for compressing different attributes of point samples corresponding to 3 D objects with arbitrary topology. In the proposed scheme, the coding process is led by an iterative octree cell subdivision of the object space. At each level of subdivision, positions of point samples are approximated by the geometry centers of all treefront cells while normals and colors are approximated by their statistical average within each of tree-front cells. With this framework, we employ attribute-dependent encoding techniques to exploit different characteristics of various attributes. All of these have led to significant improvement in the rate-distortion (R-D) performance and a computational advantage over {{the state of the}} art. Furthermore, given sufficient levels of octree expansion, normal space partitioning and resolution of color quantization, the proposed <b>point</b> <b>cloud</b> encoder can be potentially used for lossless coding of 3 D <b>point</b> <b>clouds.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — Progressive coding, LOD, compression, octree, 3 D <b>point</b> <b>cloud...</b>|$|R

Heptadecene was used as a standard for the major products produced from the deoxygenation of saturated fatty acids. Heptadecene was blended in ratios of 1 to 5 wt% in both the standard and low saturate biodiesel. The standard biodiesel blended with heptadecene did not show any statistically significant shift in the mean <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> over the range. The low saturate biodiesel blended with heptadecene showed statistically significant deviations from the mean at 2, 4, and 5 wt%. A pseudo-eutectic system was observed between heptadecene and low saturate biodiesel with a minimum <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> of - 25. 16 +/- 2. 5 °C at 2 wt% Heptadecene...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} liquid-vapor phase {{behaviour}} of a polydisperse fluid using grand canonical simulations and moment free energy calculations. The strongly nonlinear {{variation of the}} fractional volume of liquid across the coexistence region prevents naive extrapolation to detect the <b>cloud</b> <b>point.</b> We describe a finite-size scaling method which nevertheless permits accurate determination of <b>cloud</b> <b>points</b> and spinodals from simulations of a single system size. By varying a particle size cutoff {{we find that the}} <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> density is highly sensitive to the presence of rare large particles; this could affect the reproducibility of experimentally measured phase behavior in colloids and polymers.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the hydrophobicity, nature, and structure of inducing addition agents on the <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> temperature of Triton X- 100 nonionic surfactant solutions is investigated, and the statistical estimation of the {{influence of}} each parameter is carried out. The linear regression equation for the prediction of a decrease of the <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> temperature in the presence of inducing agents is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Application of {{membrane}} technology for separation processes {{has been an}} efficient optional to produce a high quality of separation product. This process has been widely using in many field of industry. Therefore, knowledge of this membrane preparation is important for controlling the pore size of resulted membrane. This paper explained the basic concept of membrane preparation via non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process by immersion precipitation. The effect of concentration of polyethersufone on the formation of <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> of dope solution in N-methylpirrolidone was investigated.   Two kinds of non-solvent as water and ethanol were used in order to study phase separation mechanism of polymer solution. Base {{on the amount of}} non-solvent of water and ethanol needed for <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> formation, the ternary phase diagram can be performed. The experimental result indicated constant concentration of polyethersulfone, amount of ethanol needed was higher than water to obtain <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> formation of polymer solution.

40|$|The {{effect of}} three anionic, hairy-rod {{fluorene}} based conjugated polyelectrolytes on the <b>cloud</b> <b>points</b> of the alkyloxyethylene surfactants C 10 E 3, C 12 E 4, C 12 E 5, and C 12 E 6 {{has been studied}} in aqueous solution. Although the association behaviour of these rigid polymers with surfactants {{is different from that}} of more flexible polyelectrolytes, both types of polymers are seen to increase the <b>cloud</b> <b>points,</b> probably as a consequence of associative interactions. The possible importance of Coulombic interactions is suggested by the decrease in <b>cloud</b> <b>points</b> with these systems in the presence of NaCl. With the conjugated polyelectrolytes, the effect appears to be most pronounced with poly [9, 9 -bis(4 -phenoxybutylsulfonate) fluorene-co- 2, 5 -thienylene], which may result from specific interactions between oxyethylene groups and the thiophene ring. The value of <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> behaviour in designing water based formulations for preparation of devices of these conjugated polyelectrolytes is discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
