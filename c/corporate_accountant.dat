The US has introduced the Sarbanes Oxley Act, with requirements on <b>corporate</b> <b>accountants</b> and auditors, as well as its whistleblowing provisions. It has revised the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations. New rules for the NYSE and NASDAQ have also been introduced. In addition, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U. S.

Australia has revised the Corporations Act to include whistleblower protection clauses as well as adopted the ASX Corporate Governance guidelines. Standards Australia has issued its handbook on corporate governance. Although not a business issue, the Australian government has also announced that it will introduce whistleblower protection legislation for the public sector by the end of its first term in office. This legislation will likely influence whatever the private sector does in this respect.

40|$|Abstract: Historically, {{every country}} {{had its own}} {{accounting}} standards, each merging to some extent with its local corporate, labor, and tax laws. No matter how undesirable, it was natural to expect differences among nations. Globalization made these differences so impractical that from <b>corporate</b> leaders to <b>accountants</b> to government officials, many pushed for harmonized accounting standards. Pursuing this goal, a private international organization was created to set standards for the world. Currently around 120 countries require or permit International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), however, the United States is yet {{to make a decision}} to adopt these international standards. The adoption of IFRS in the United States would, in theory, be easier compared to the experience of the European Union. The EU mandated that all publicly traded firms use IFRS in their consolidated financial statements from 2005 onwards. Several issues are yet to be resolved, but Europe managed to achieve what was once thought to be an insuperable task in coordinating a common standard for its Member States. If the adoption of IFRS in the United States would be easier than the EU experience, why has the United States not adopted IFRS? With this paper, I argue that IFRS are a set of U. S. supported Anglo-American accounting standards. Further, that the reason for creating IFRS was not necessarily for the United States to adopt them but to convert the patchwork of accounting standards around the world into a single system that is similar to U.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the choice criteria companies use in the auditor selection process for listed Australian public companies. This is the first Australian study to investigate this issue. The study drawn on international literature and attempts to develop a more comprehensive study of these characteristics that minimise the limitations identified in these overseas studies. Eight constructs were identified from the literature and then empirically tested in a national survey. Factor analysis was used to analyse the data resulting in the establishment of nine choice criteria. The two most important choice criteria identified are Technical Competence and Client Orientation. Literature suggests that companies incur direct and indirect costs associated within an auditor change and such costs may impact on the importance of selection decision choice criteria. A comparison between companies that selected a new auditor and those that re-appointed the incumbent audit firm, suggests that seven of these choice criteria are of equal importance for the selection and re-appointment decisions. However, the results suggest that the other two criteria (Level of Audit Fee, and Effective Preparation and Communication of Audit Submission) are significantly more important to companies appointing a new auditor. The perceived difference in importance of these criteria on the selection decision process identified has implications for audit firms attempting to retain or obtain an audit appointment.

40|$|Enron, Arthur Andersen, Parmalat, AIG: {{business}} headlines {{over the}} last few years have stimulated worldwide interest in accounting responsibilities and standards. Smoke and Mirrors, Inc., is a remarkable introduction to contemporary accounting and its central importance for the operation of modern capitalism. Nicolas Véron, Matthieu Autret, and Alfred Galichon show how accounting always mirrored the features of contemporaneous financial systems, while remaining intrinsically subject to judgment and uncertainty and thus leaving scope for manipulation that can convert a rotten balance sheet into a picture of robust financial health. Beginning with the story of the fictional company Smoke & Mirrors Inc., Véron and his coauthors provide a brief history of accounting's emergence and its key concepts and practices. They then shift their focus to the political economy of the various actors involved in the preparation, auditing, and use of financial information and the new challenges facing regulators as capital markets spread across national boundaries. The authors challenge widespread beliefs that accounting practices are neutral and involve the mere reporting of objective data. They trace how different accounting standards, which alter the calculus of what counts as a "fair representation" of business dealings, can change economic behavior. Along the way they provide numerous examples and case studies, including a detailed account of the tricks with which Enron cooked its books. For students of <b>corporate</b> finance, practicing <b>accountants</b> and businesspeople, and general readers who have followed a seemingly endless parade of financial scandals with disbelief, Smoke and Mirrors, Inc., provides a clear and concise overview of the use and abuse of accounting and of the underlying changes in today's capital markets. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of Enron 2 ̆ 7 s and {{numerous}} other corporate scandals, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which empowered the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) to establish rules of professional conduct for attorneys who appear before it. In November 2002, the Commission released a proposal where attorneys {{would be required to}} report perceived violations of corporate governance and Commission rules up-the-ladder. Additionally, if the company failed to make an appropriate response, the attorney would be required to make a noisy withdrawal. After an onslaught of comments against the proposal, the Commission issued an alternative proposal for comment. Under the alternative rule, the issuer, rather than the attorney, would be responsible for notifying the Commission of an attorney 2 ̆ 7 s withdrawal. The alternative rule has sparked a fair amount of controversy. Many support the rule as consistent with the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s duty under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and necessary to effectuate up-the-ladder reporting. Others oppose the alternative rule because they believe the rule is in conflict with attorney-client privilege rules. The alternative rule will aid in the restoration of market integrity by granting corporate attorneys the ability to call public attention to violations of securities laws without destroying the attorney-client privilege. Because the reason for adopting rules concerning professional conduct of attorney is ultimately to protect the investing public, placing the burden of disclosure on the issuer, rather than the attorney, will result in sufficient disclosure to put the public on notice of serious problems.

40|$|The stereotypical {{image of}} the {{profession}} is poor with accountants appearing in popular media as either the object of satire or the criminally inclined expert who deceives the public for self-gain. Extant research on the portrayal of the stereotypic accountant is limited in that it assumes a unitary concept by inferring a dominant image when the accountant stereotype is multifaceted. It is unclear from existing research whether the dominant image results from perceived character traits or the duties undertaken by accountants. Research on accounting stereotypes has focused on external stereotypical perceptions of the profession as represented in the popular media and overlooks members&rsquo; self-perceptions and meta-stereotypes which, together with stereotypes, {{are part of a}} member&rsquo;s social identity. Furthermore, there has been little research identifying the dimensions that underpin these stereotypical perceptions. The thesis explores accountant stereotypes and identities by reference to two research questions: What are the dimensions that underlie the accountant stereotypes? and, What are the dominant perceptions of accountant stereotypes among members of the profession, students and the public? The research questions are addressed in two broad stages. The first stage is the development of a conceptual framework of accountant stereotypes from an examination of extant academic research literature on the external stereotypical image of accountants. The second stage empirically tests the conceptual framework through an online survey of commerce students and professional accountants who were asked to provide their self-perceptions and their perceptions of public perceptions (meta-stereotypes) of accountants and accounting. In addressing the research questions the thesis makes a number of contributions to research into accountant stereotypes. The first contribution is the identification of the dimensions that underlie the accountant stereotype. Secondly the identification of accountant subtypes based on different profiles of the underlying dimensions. The third contribution relates to the analysis of self-perceptions and meta-stereotypes to establish accountant identities rather than just accountant stereotypes. The final contribution refers {{to the development of a}} research instrument. The findings of the thesis indicate four accountant subtypes distinguished by different profiles of six dimensions with each dimension linked to either the Warmth or Competence scale identified by Fiske et al. (2002). The increasing negativity of accountant stereotypes is attributed in part to recent accounting scandals and <b>corporate</b> collapses where <b>accountants</b> were linked to scandalous behavior when they failed to detect or report fraudulent activities. The framework provided in the thesis shows how the profession could focus its attention in improving its public image. The findings suggest that the dimensions underlying the accountant stereotype have moved forward along the Competence scale but not along the Warmth scale. Ultimately, the ability of the profession to shift the prototypical image and enhance its self-portrayed image will depend on the strength of evidence that espouses ethics and challenges the notion of the unethical accountant. Attempts to improve the image of accountants should address dimensions on the Warmth scale but a focus on dimensions on the Competence scale are likely to be unsuccessful...|$|R
40|$|The {{academic}} literature is quite rich in exploring Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in developed markets {{and to a}} lesser degree in emerging markets. However, seldom one can find research on IPOs in start-up stock exchanges. Such is the case of the Cyprus Stock Exchange which was inaugurated in March 1996 and this thesis looks at IPOs that took place over a period of six years (1997 - 2002). Therefore, the first motivation is to explore this setting for IPOs. Moreover, the Cyprus Stock Exchange is probably the least researched stock exchange in the European Union. Out of the 12 countries that joined the European Union between 2004 and today, only Polish, Bulgarian and Hungarian IPOs are researched. Due to the comparatively young age of the Cyprus Stock Exchange and the Capital Markets in Cyprus in general {{at the time of the}} sample, the various players (underwriters, auditors, regulators, investors) were relatively inexperienced vis-à-vis the IPO process and outcomes of their actions (or rather their lack of action) affected the development of the primary market. Therefore, the second motivation stems from the specific institutional and regulatory characteristics of the CSE at the time of the sample. Cyprus, a start-up stock exchange with a relatively new but comparably densely populated market for listed companies (150 listed companies), poses an interesting research case. In particular, the institutional characteristics that existed in the Cypriot capital market over the period 1997 to 2002 (a novice stock exchange, inexperienced market participants, lack of investment options available and restrictions in capital flows, a weak legal and institutional framework) combined with a number of socioeconomic and political factors at the time make IPOs in the CSE an interesting subject for empirical research. This ‘cocktail’ of inexperience, inadequate regulation, and limited equity culture provided the platform for the formation of a large IPO ‘bubble’ which eventually imploded. Therefore, the motivation for the study develops the following research questions: 1. 	What is the level of first-day returns for Cypriot IPOs and how does that compare with the available literature? 2. 	What are the explanations for the level of short-run underpricing recorded? 3. 	What is the long-run (12 -, 24 - and 36 -months) aftermarket performance of these IPOs and how does that compare with the available literature? 4. 	What are the explanations for the documented long-run aftermarket performance? 5. 	Did CSE IPO firms employ income increasing accruals prior to the IPO? 6. 	What is the level of understanding of Cypriot Managers of the IPO process in relation to the extant literature? This thesis consists of three inter-related empirical studies on companies that were listed on the Cyprus Stock Exchange during the period 1997 to 2002. In particular, this thesis investigates the short- and long-run IPO performance of these companies (chapter 1). The variables employed are grouped into four categories namely advisor/certifier-, market/institutional-, issuer-, and IPO-specific. It is observed that CSE IPOs over the sample period offered investors the highest returns in a European market and one of the highest in the world. Following the establishment of these ultra-high returns, and the independent variables that are related to this spectacular performance, the thesis investigates whether these CSE IPO companies engaged in income increasing accruals before their IPOs (chapter 2). In Chapter 2, both univariate as well as multivariate tests are employed to test the hypothesis that these firms actually employed earnings management pre-IPO using income increasing accruals which reversed after the 1 st year of listing. In order to establish also the relationship between the short- and long-run performance of IPO firms, the latter are regressed with the earnings management variable which takes the form of discretionary accruals, total accruals or the components of accruals which are creditors, debtors, inventory, depreciation and cash flow from operations. The results show that both the short- as well as the long-run performance are also affected by the earnings management variable together with the other variables that are found to affect IPO performance in chapter 1. Having examined the two aspects of CSE IPOs, i. e., short, long performance and earnings management, the thesis presents also the results from a questionnaire survey which aims at revealing managers of CSE listed IPO companies level of understanding of the IPO process and IPO ‘anomalies’ (chapter 3) and comparing this with the extant {{academic literature}} and also with the responses of managers in the US. Great effort, both theoretical and empirical, has been made to understand managerial decision-making in the initial public offering (IPO) process. Most empirical IPO research relies on publicly available stock return data. However, there is a need to extend the literature by examining how well managers’ motivations for conducting IPOs and understanding of the IPO process correlate with existing academic theories. By surveying managers in an emerging market to obtain a real-world perspective on the IPO process, their beliefs and experiences can be compared to both academic theory and the findings from empirical research. Cypriot managers’ responses in an emerging/novice market such as the Cyprus Stock Exchange can also be compared with those of managers in a highly-developed market such as the US. The combination/integration of the above elements makes this study, the first of its kind for Initial Public Offerings in the Cyprus Stock Exchange. The results from the first study indicate the following: a. 	The existence of ultra-high first-day returns. b. 	The existence of a hot issue period. c. 	Long-run under-performance of IPOs over a three-year period. d. 	Significant institutional deficiencies. Specifically, it is observed that IPOs in the CSE offered investors initial (first day) returns that are among the higher in the world even after adjusting for the hot issue period of 1999. IPOs ‘younger’ in age, offered higher short-run returns than ‘older’ ones. Furthermore, smaller IPOs as measured by the size of gross proceeds perform better in the short-run than larger IPOs. Moreover, IPOs in certain industrial sectors offered investors the highest initial returns. It is observed that gross proceeds, the time from application to listing, the capital structure of the IPO firm (leverage), the standard deviation of market returns 21 days after the listing, and return on shareholders’ equity provide a highly explanatory model of raw initial returns. It is also found that Cypriot IPOs underperform in the long-run as the majority of IPOs in academic studies do. Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CARs) are negative for all years in the sample period during the 24 -, and 36 -month periods. In contrast, the 12 -month period average CARs over the sample period are all positive. Moreover, IPOs in the ‘hot’ issue period have worse performance than the rest of the pack which confirms that findings of many researchers that IPOs in ‘hot’ periods have a worse performance than the rest in the long-run. The standard deviation of returns 21 days after the listing of the IPO, the capital structure of the IPO firm (leverage), the return on equity of the IPO firm prior to listing and its sales growth prior to listing offer a satisfactory explanatory model of 36 -month cumulative average returns. Cypriot firms exploited a ‘window of opportunity’ that was opened in the market for listing. However, the high inefficiencies that existed and continuous changes that took place in the regulatory and institutional framework of the market as reflected predominantly by the large time span between application and listing (probably the longest in the World), had as a result huge delays in listing. Consequently, IPOs were caught up by the declining returns in the secondary market and the majority of them after the third quarter of the year 2000 opened below their offer price. In summary, the findings suggest that the institutional and market aspects of the Cypriot capital markets affected the CSE IPO returns in a manner that produced astonishingly high returns. This thesis contributes to the existing literature by demonstrating that start-up stock exchanges with institutional and regulatory deficiencies offer a platform for highly abnormal IPO returns, which fade away though, in the long-run. The results of the second study point out to the fact that earnings management cannot be ruled out for CSE IPO firms over the sample period. Specifically, using both univariate and multivariate tests it is observed that both discretionary accruals and total accruals rise within the prospectus time frame (pre-IPO) and reverse post-IPO. Moreover, change in profitability measures, namely return on sales, return on assets and return on assets net of cash, demonstrate significant statistical difference when compared pre-IPO and post-IPO. Finally, when the IPOs price performance (short and long) is regressed against a set of independent variables and among them, a variable for earnings management which takes the form of discretionary accruals, or total accruals, or the components of accruals over the same period it is observed that discretionary accruals have a positive relationship with short-run returns, meaning that as accruals rise, underpricing increases. This can be attributed to the faster adjustment by underwriters of valuations to take into account income increasing accruals, and at the same time the inability of investors to revise with the same degree and speed their valuations due to the high levels of exuberance that existed in the market as these were manifested by the high level of secondary as well as primary returns as well as possibly their lack of sophistication to do so. Moreover, it is argued that the components of accruals explain well the long-run stock price performance. The third chapter of this thesis presents the findings from a questionnaire survey of managers of listed companies in the Cyprus Stock Exchange. It is suggested that in some areas, there is harmony between managers’ beliefs and academic theory. Nevertheless, in other key areas, managers’ perceptions diverge from traditional academic theory. It is also evident that Cypriot managers’ overall views coincide at large with views of US managers, a country with arguably the most advanced capital market in the world. Several general implications can be drawn out of this thesis for academics, regulators and policy makers, investors, professionals such as security analysts and certifying agents and companies aiming at listing their shares. Specifically: 	The academic community, which could utilise the findings from the study to understand better the role of institutional setting on IPO ‘anomalies’ as well as the ‘maturity’ of stock exchanges on IPO price performance behaviour. 	Policy makers and regulators alike to assist them in drafting improved laws for the future as well as avoiding mistakes of the past. Specifically, the laws must aim at protecting the minority shareholders and making more accountable certifying agents and managers of IPO firms. 	Investors and portfolio managers who will be more educated and informed on making better decisions in the future regarding IPOs especially in newly formed equity capital markets. In particular, stock exchanges that lack strong institutional framework could offer excellent opportunities for ultra-high short-run returns. 	Professionals (such as <b>corporate</b> financiers, <b>accountants</b> and lawyers), especially those dealing with IPOs who will be able to draw on the findings of the study to improve the knowledge and professional practices when dealing with issuers. Principally, certifying agents to become more wary of firms that employ accruals aggressively to enhance valuation parameters and achieve higher gross proceeds. 	Prospective issuers to become more educated on matters involving avoiding the boosting accruals and consequently IPO valuations as this is a short-lived trick of becoming unpopular with market participants. ...|$|R
