5|$|By March 2003, the {{cheapest}} fare from the UK was £59 return, available all year around.

5|$|<b>Competition</b> <b>between</b> the French and the Portuguese {{began to}} show itself in the region during this period. Because the Portuguese-operated trading posts in Cacheu and Farim asked for higher prices than the French-operated trading posts in Carabane and Sédhiou, the Portuguese lost many traders to the French. This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which was {{negotiated}} in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe.|$|E

5|$|In the 8th and 9th centuries, {{civil service}} {{constituted}} the clearest path to aristocratic status, but, {{starting in the}} 9th century, the civil aristocracy was rivalled by an aristocracy of nobility. According to some studies of Byzantine government, 11th-century politics were dominated by <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> the civil and the military aristocracy. During this period, Alexios I undertook important administrative reforms, including {{the creation of new}} courtly dignities and offices.|$|E
5|$|In the Maasai Mara game reserve, {{there is}} a {{non-migratory}} population of blue wildebeest which had dwindled from about 119,000 animals in 1977 to about 22,000 in 1997. The reason for the decline {{is thought to be}} the increasing <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> cattle and wildebeest for a diminishing area of grazing land as a result of changes in agricultural practices, and possibly fluctuations in rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Many birds {{actively}} {{defend a}} territory from {{others of the}} same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> and within species for nesting sites can be intense.|$|E

5|$|Murray cod {{have died}} out {{in many of}} their upland habitats, {{particularly}} in the southern Murray-Darling basin, due {{to a combination of}} overfishing, siltation, dams and weirs blocking migration, pollution from arsenic-based sheep-dips, mining, and in some cases, introduced trout stockings, which causes <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> juvenile Murray cod and introduced trout species.|$|E

5|$|Snakes {{use their}} venom {{to kill or}} subdue prey, {{as well as for}} other diet-related functions, such as digestion. Current {{scientific}} theory suggests that snake venom is not used for defense or for <b>competition</b> <b>between</b> members of the same species, unlike in other taxa. Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.|$|E
