5|$|After {{losing to}} the New England Patriots in the American Football Conference Championship Game and losing Marcus Washington who joined the Washington Redskins, the <b>Colts</b> shuffled their linebacker lineup and June was listed as a starter when the <b>Colts</b> arrived at mini-camp.

That season, the <b>Colts</b> used a 4-3 defense with a fourth linebacker on passing downs.
