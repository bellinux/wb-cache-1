Modifications of this single <b>collector</b> <b>device</b> have permitted its {{use as a}} medium precision instrument in the determination of isotope abundances in carbon dioxide. In addition, a previous gas chromatograph design has been modified to allow a one step separation and collection of carbon dioxide from a volcanic gas matrix, thus eliminating the usual and tedious volumetric method. To qualitatively predict the magnitude {{and direction of the}} isotopic fractionation in volcanic gases at higher temperatures (600 °K- 1500 °K), equilibrium constants were calculated for numerous reactions involving carbon or oxygen isotope exchanges, such as 1 / 2 C 16 O 2 + H 2180 = 1 / 2 C 18 O 2 + H 2160. The validity of these calculations was discussed on a basis of high temperature anharmonicity, and the resultant effect on the partition function ratios was estimated. Samples from a Hawaiian volcanic system were collected and analyzed for carbon and oxygen isotope abundances, in the form of carbon dioxide. Samples were taken from several areas, including fumarolic gases from Sulfur Bank in Kilauea Iki Crater, on Hawaii Island, gases from the drill holes in the lava lake of recently erupted Makaopuhi Crater, also on Hawaii, and assorted carbonaceous samples of marine origin.

40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 6 th August 2002 The capability to determine isotope abundances is a main feature of mass spectrometry. The precise and accurate determination of isotope ratios is required for different application fields, such as: isotope ratio measurements of stable isotopes in nature, especially for the investigation of isotope variation in nature or age dating; determining isotope ratios of radiogenic elements in the nuclear industry; quality assurance of fuel material for reprocessing plants, nuclear material accounting and radioactive waste control; and tracer experiments using highly enriched stable isotopes or long-lived radionuclides in biological or medical studies. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) provides excellent sensitivity, precision and good accuracy for isotope ratio measurements with practically no restriction {{with respect to the}} ionization potential of the element investigated. Therefore both ICP-MS and LA-ICP-MS are increasingly replacing thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), which has been used as the dominant analytical technique for precise isotope ratio measurements for many decades. In the last few years instrumental progress for improving figures of merit in isotope ratio measurements in ICP-MS and LA-ICP-MS with a single ion detector has been achieved by the introduction of the collision cell interface, in order to dissociate disturbing argon-based molecular ions, to reduce the kinetic energy of ions and neutralize the disturbing argon ions of the plasma gas (Ar 1). The application of the collision cell in ICP-MS results in higher ion transmission, improved sensitivity and better precision of isotope ratio measurements compared to ICP-MS without the collision cell.

40|$|Compared {{to other}} {{volatile}} carbonylic compounds present in outdoor air, formaldehyde (CH 2 O) {{is the most}} toxic, deserving more attention in terms of indoor and outdoor air quality legislation and control. The analytical determination of CH 2 O in air still presents challenges due to the low-level concentration (in the sub-ppb range) and its variation with sampling site and time. Of the many available analytical methods for carbonylic compounds, the most widespread one is the time consuming collection in cartridges impregnated with 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine followed by {{the analysis of the}} formed hydrazones by HPLC. The present work proposes the use of polypropylene hollow porous capillary fibers to achieve efficient CH 2 O collection. The Oxyphan (R) fiber (designed for blood oxygenation) was chosen for this purpose because it presents good mechanical resistance, high density of very fine pores and high ratio of collection area to volume of the acceptor fluid in the tube, all favorable for the development of air sampling apparatus. The <b>collector</b> <b>device</b> consists of a Teflon pipe inside of which a bundle of polypropylene microporous capillary membranes was introduced. While the acceptor passes at a low flow rate through the capillaries, the sampled air circulates around the fibers, impelled by a low flow membrane pump (of the type used for aquariums ventilation). The coupling of this sampling technique with the selective and quantitative determination of CH 2 O, in the form of hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) after derivatization with HSO 3 -, by capillary electrophoresis with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (CE-(CD) -D- 4) enabled the development of a complete analytical protocol for the CH 2 O evaluation in air.

Embora várias alternativas tenham sido cogitadas durante o processo, a energia solar sempre teve um papel importante nesta nova conjuntura. Este tipo de energia aumentou significativamente a sua participação na forma que é mais utilizada: o aquecimento direto de água. Embora outros usos da energia solar, como para geração de eletricidade, estejam em estudo no Brasil, os projetos neste sentido ainda são incipientes. No país, os principais aproveitamentos sustentáveis estão direcionados para o uso de várias formas de biomassa. Se em grande escala o uso da energia solar ainda não merece destaque, o seu uso em residências representa um caso de sucesso. Os sistemas de aquecimento baseados em energia solar podem ser direcionados tanto para uso doméstico como para uso em piscinas possui inúmeras vantagens como: a economia de outras fontes de energia e uma eficiência energética adequada. Uma das maiores restrições à difusão destes sistemas é o seu elevado custo inicial.

Concern {{about the}} environment and the increasing in energy cost has been representing an incentive in finding alternative and renewable energy sources. Although several alternatives had been congitated during this times, solar energy was always an important role in this new context. This energy form has significantly increased its participation in the group that it is most commonly used: the water heating. While other uses of solar energy, such as for electricity generation, are being studied in Brazil, the tests in this direction are still incipient. In the country, the main sustainable energy source is the direct use of biomass. If large-scale use of solar energy don't deserves mention it use on residential devices is a sucess. Heating systems based on solar energy can be directed for both domestic use and for use in swimming pools. The heating of swimming pool water has many advantages such as: the economy of other energy sources and energy efficiency appropriate. One of the major constraints to the diffusion of these systems is their high initial cost.

40|$|The {{result of}} several years of {{analysis}} of Distributed Concentrating Solar Combined Heat and Power (DCS-CHP) systems is a design that is predicted to convert sunlight to heat at 8 - 10 % solar-electric efficiency while simultaneously capturing ~ 60 % of that initial sunlight as usable heat (at 100 ºC). In contrast to similarly sized photovoltaic systems in the U. S. that cost ~$ 7. 90 /Watt of generator rated peak electrical output, in mass production the proposed collector and generator system sized at 1 - 10 kW would cost ~$ 3. 20 /Watt electricity and ~$ 0. 40 /Watt-thermal, allowing adjustment of heat and electrical output on demand. The proposed system would revolutionize distributed energy generation in several ways: 1) by enabling rapid dissemination via avoidance of production limitations of photovoltaics such as expensive and limited materials, 2) by efficient local production of both heat and power to offset more greenhouse gases {{at a lower cost}} than other renewable energy technologies, and 3) by democratizing the means of electricity production; putting the {{power in the hands of}} the consumer instead of large utilities. With over 5. 4 GW of photovoltaics added globally in 2008 and 20 GW of solar thermal, there is a large proven market for solar energy. With widespread market penetration, this system would reduce greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions from electricity generation and heating for a significant portion of the developed and developing world, including those in remote locations with no connection to an electric grid. Chapter 1 begins with analysis of the relative demand for electricity and heat in California, showing that, on average, demand matches production of a theoretical solar CHP system. Then, we explore the economic and technological impetus for a solar powered combined heat and power Rankine cycle, showing cost and performance modeling in comparison to photovoltaics across varying conditions, and concluding that solar CHP generated electricity is comparable to PV electricity in terms of cost "per peak watt". Chapter 2 shows results of a life cycle analysis of DCS-CHP in comparison to other renewable and non-renewable energy systems including its global warming potential (80 gCO 2 eq/kWh electric and 10 gCO 2 eq/kWh thermal), levelized electric and thermal energy cost ($ 0. 25 /kWh electric and $ 0. 03 /kWh thermal), and cost of solar water purification/desalination ($ 1. 40 /m 3). Additionally the utilization of water for this technology is shown to be much less than fossil-fuel based thermal power plants. Chapter 3 explores the expander as an enabling technology for small solar Rankine cycles and presents results of physical testing and characterization of a rotary lobe expander prototype developed by a small Australian company, Katrix, Inc. Testing of this expander using compressed air yields an impressive isentropic efficiency of 80 - 95 % at pressure ratios of 6 - 11 making the rotary lobe expander a leading choice for DCS-CHP systems, if operation on steam is successful and reliability issues can be addressed. Chapter 4 concludes with a description and analysis of a DCS-CHP system using simulation software developed in Matlab for the purpose of system analysis and optimization. This chapter focuses on the selection of an appropriate expander and collectors, the two key enabling technologies for DCS-CHP. In addition to discussion of the rotary lobe expander, we present a novel <b>collector</b> <b>device</b> appropriate for solar CHP systems that eliminates high pressure articulate joints, a typical failure point of solar concentrating systems. Given the results of the rotary lobe expander testing, comparison to previous expander modeling work, and comparison of the predicted cost and efficiency of the collectors analyzed, an appropriate technology version of the DCS-CHP system is selected and overall system performance is predicted across 1020 sites in the US...|$|E
30|$|In recent years, {{the study}} of {{convective}} heat transfer in nanofluids has {{received a lot of}} attention. Nanofluids which are suspensions of solid nanoparticles in conventional liquids like water, oil and ethylene glycol have many potential applications in industry. Convection in nanofluid flows in porous media has also received attention due to its potential application in materials processing and solar energy <b>collector</b> <b>devices.</b> Nield and Kuznetsov [5] extended the Cheng-Minkowycz problem for heat transfer in porous media to nanofluids. Uddin et al. [6] used the lie group analysis to study non-Newtonian nanofluid flow in a porous medium with internal heat generation. They investigated heat transfer rates and showed that the rates decrease with increasing power-law index, particle Brownian motion, thermophoresis and fluid buoyancy. The boundary layer formed by a non-Newtonian flow over a vertical plate in a porous medium saturated with a nanofluid was studied by Hady et al. [7]. In their study, they found that the reduced Nusselt number increases with the power-law index and the Lewis parameter. Gorla and Khan [8] studied natural convection in boundary layer flow over a vertical cylinder embedded in a porous medium saturated with a nanofluid. Free convection in boundary layer flow over horizontal and vertical plates was investigated by, among others, Gorla and Chamkha [9, 10].|$|R
40|$|Sleep apnea is a sleep {{disorder}} that causes repeatedly reduced respiration or no airflow {{in a period}} of time during sleep. Sleep apnea can be detected by analyzing bio-physiological signals such as electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and respiratory effort, etc. The bio-physiological signals that are recorded during sleep, are usually kept in files which have low level abstractions, indexing primitives, and diverse formats such as EDF/EDF+ file formats, or a Waveform Database format (PhysioBank databases). To manage and query data from these files the provided software packages are required, i. e. the WFDB software package for the Waveform Database format. Otherwise, it is necessary to write a new software application based on the specification of the file formats, which leads to increased difficulty of programming and analyzing bio-physiological data. The thesis presents design and implementation of a relational database model for storing not only Obstructive Sleep Apnea signals, but also other bio-physiological signals. The first benefit of using a relational database for storing bio-physiological data {{is that there is no}} need to write or include management tools for managing the collected data. Furthermore, data analysis can be directly performed on the <b>collector</b> <b>devices</b> (mobile devices) by using the SQL language, which provides many useful algorithms for analyzing data. In addition, remote services can ask for some parts of data from <b>collector</b> <b>devices</b> by using remote querying. Last but not least, the privacy of patients is not violated if they can keep their bio-physiology on their own devices, and can decide which data they would like to send. The database model that is presented is this thesis is a platform independent, it can therefore be implemented on whatever database management system as long as they support SQL language. In this thesis, a design and implementation of a database application for the database model are proposed. The design is discussed first at an abstract and platform independent level, in which it describes the ways the database application works with real-time sources and files. The Android platform is chosen as implementation platform for both the database model and database application. Data sources for the database are from the CESAR acquisition tool and EDF files that are exported from PhysioBank. The database size is less than 1736 MB after collecting data from all channels of the CESAR acquisition tool with 100 Hz for each channel in nearly 19 hours. That is, the application can collect data for a whole day without any storage problem. The power consumption for the application is 6. 6 % of the total power drain on the device, which is quiet efficient. The average read time and write time are 17936 samples per second and 12960 samples per second. With a stress test, the application shows that it can manage all channels of 14 BITalino sensor kit with 100 Hz while importing a EDF file, exporting data from six channels to a EDF file, and visualizing incoming samples on a graph. Nevertheless, the results show that the database model and database application are very efficient for storing and analyzing Obstructive Sleep Apnea signals, and other bio-physiological signals...|$|R
