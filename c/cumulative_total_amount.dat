5000|$|On a multi-processor or {{multi-core}} system, [...] implements global EDF, so {{tasks are}} able to migrate across available CPUs. In such a case, the configured budget is the <b>total</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of time the task is allowed to run on any CPU during each period. However, the scheduler also respects tasks' affinity masks, so one can easily create partitioned scheduling scenarios, partitioning tasks in groups where each group is restricted to a specific CPU, or clustered scheduling scenarios, obtained by also partitioning CPUs and each tasks partition is pinned down to a specific CPUs partition.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} that salient features of (time series of annual) citations to scientific publications might {{be captured by}} a Bass type diffusion model. This is particularly useful as it allows for a comparison of these features across journals, across disciplines and over time. For the illustrative case of Econometrica 1987, {{it is found that}} the peak in citations occurs at 6. 5 years, on average. Also, it is found that after 14 years there is only a little gap between cumulative citations and the estimated <b>total</b> <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount,</b> suggesting that on average the impact of these articles lasts for about 15 years or so. Finally, it appears that these features can partly be explained {{by the size of the}} articles, as it is found that longer papers get more citations and peak later. ...|$|R

40|$|Whether {{sunlight}} (especially ultraviolet B radiation: UVB) {{exposure is}} {{harmful to the}} cellular immunity of HIV infected individuals and whether it is associated with an accelerated progression toward AIDS is still under debate. Among HIV+ homosexual participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Study, the degree of exposure to UVB was assessed over a period from 1995 until 1997 {{by means of a}} retrospective questionnaire. Two UVB measures were calculated: a <b>cumulative</b> measure (the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of UVB exposure received over two years) and a short-term measure (the amount of UVB exposure per stated period). Using both the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and robust regression, the association between the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of UVB received in the two-year interval and the slopes of the following immunological parameters were studied: CD 4 + T cell count, CD 4 /CD 8 ratio and T cell reactivity after stimulation with CD 3 antibodies. Secondly, the short-term association between UVB exposure per period and the immunological parameters were studied with linear mixed-effect models (LME). In the study group with a median CD 4 + T cell count of 480 x 106 /l, no association could be established between UVB exposure, and the immunological parameters. Among HIV infected individuals, no indications could be found between the two year cumulative UVB exposure and markers of cellular immunity. Using the linear mixed effects model for longitudinal data, a slight trend in lower values of markers of cellular immunity after higher short term UVB-exposure was noted. It is quite unlikely that this small effect has clinical significance for the individuals of the study cohort, yet it may indicate that an effect of UV might have been established in a larger cohort...|$|R
