25|$|The Porton Down {{analysis}} by James R. Riches and his colleagues, , showed that while fentanyl or 3-methyl fentanyl were {{absent from the}} urine of one survivor and residues of the agent in the clothing of two other British survivors, the veterinary large animal sedative drug <b>carfentanil</b> and anesthetic agent remifentanil were identified by liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry in one hostage's urine and on the clothing of three hostages who had returned to Britain after the hostage rescue. The authors concluded that <b>carfentanil</b> and remifentanil were used as a mixture in the chemical agent employed by Russian troops to subdue the Chechen terrorists and hostages at the Barricade Theater, perhaps suspended in the anesthetic agent halothane.|$|E
25|$|Many new {{intravenous}} and inhalational anesthetics {{were developed}} and brought into clinical {{use during the}} second half of the 20th century. Paul Janssen (1926–2003), the founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica, is credited with the development of over 80 pharmaceutical compounds. Janssen synthesized nearly all of the butyrophenone class of antipsychotic agents, beginning with haloperidol (1958) and droperidol (1961). These agents were rapidly integrated into the practice of anesthesia. In 1960, Janssen's team synthesized fentanyl, the first of the piperidinone-derived opioids. Fentanyl was followed by sufentanil (1974), alfentanil (1976), <b>carfentanil</b> (1976), and lofentanil (1980). Janssen and his team also developed etomidate (1964), a potent intravenous anesthetic induction agent.|$|E
25|$|Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone or naltrexone. These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists {{but do not}} activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter {{than that of the}} opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and <b>carfentanil.</b> However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, Riches et al. found {{evidence}} from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of extracts of clothing from two British survivors, and urine {{from a third}} survivor, that the aerosol was a mixture <b>carfentanil</b> and remifentanil the exact proportions of which they could not determine. Assuming that these were the only active constituents (which has not been verified by the Russian military), the primary acute toxic effect to the theatre victims would have been opioid-induced apnea; in this case mechanical ventilation and/or treatment with naltrexone, the specific antidote for poisoning with <b>carfentanil</b> in humans would have been life-saving for many or all victims.|$|E
50|$|Other opioid analogs {{even more}} potent still than 3-MF are known, such as <b>carfentanil</b> and ohmefentanyl, {{but these are}} {{significantly}} more difficult to manufacture than 3-methylfentanyl and have not been so well accepted as street drugs.|$|E
50|$|Lofentanil {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent opioid analgesics known and is an {{analogue}} of fentanyl, which was developed in 1960. It is most similar to the highly potent opioid <b>carfentanil</b> (4-carbomethoxyfentanyl), only slightly more potent. Lofentanil can be described as 3-methylcarfentanil, or 3-methyl-4-carbomethoxyfentanyl. While 3-methylfentanyl is considerably more potent than fentanyl itself, lofentanil is only slightly stronger than <b>carfentanil.</b> This suggests that substitution at both the 3 and 4 positions of the piperidine ring introduces steric hindrance which prevents μ-opioid affinity from increasing much further. As with other 3-substituted fentanyl derivatives such as ohmefentanyl, the stereoisomerism of lofentanil is very important, with some stereoisomers being much more potent than others.|$|E
5000|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>carfentanil</b> {{has been compared}} with nerve gas, according to the Associated Press article. The article quoted Andrew C.

[...] Weber added, [...] "Countries that {{we are concerned about}} were interested in using it for offensive purposes... We are also concerned that groups like ISIS could order it commercially."

50|$|N-Methylcarfentanil (R-32395) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug {{related to the}} highly potent animal tranquilizer <b>carfentanil,</b> but several thousand times weaker, being only slightly stronger than morphine. It was first synthesised {{by a team of}} chemists at Janssen Pharmaceutica led by Paul Janssen, who were investigating the structure-activity relationships of the fentanyl family of drugs. They found that replacing the phenethyl group attached to the piperidine nitrogen of fentanyl with a smaller methyl group, made it so much weaker that it was inactive as an analgesic in animals. However the same change made to the more potent analogue <b>carfentanil</b> retained reasonable opioid receptor activity, reflecting the higher binding affinity produced by the 4-carbomethoxy group.|$|E

50|$|Authors of a {{previous}} paper in the Annals of Emergency Medicine surmised from the available evidence that the Moscow emergency services had not been informed {{of the use of}} the agent, but were instructed to bring opioid antagonists. Not knowing to expect hundreds of patients exposed to high doses of strong opioids, the emergency workers did not bring enough naloxone or naltrexone (the two most commonly-used opioid antagonists) to counteract the <b>carfentanil</b> and remifentanil and save the lives of many of the victims. 125 people exposed to the gas used in the rescue attempt are confirmed to have died from both respiratory failure and aerosol inhalation during the incident. The authors state that, assuming <b>carfentanil</b> and remifentanil were the only active ingredients of the knockout gas, that the worst danger to the theater victims would have been apnea (loss of breathing), and that mechanical ventilation and/or treatment with opioid antagonists could have saved many lives.|$|E

50|$|Etorphine is an {{extremely}} potent, non-selective full agonist of the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors. It also has relatively weak affinity for the nociceptin receptor. Etorphine has an LD50 of 30μg in humans. Its mu affinity is 0.024nM compared with nalorphine nM 0.559Nm and diprenorphine 0.072kI so the compound naloxone would need large doses as it battles for space on receptors. Diprenorphine <b>Carfentanil</b> has a Ki of 0.0000007.|$|E
50|$|Diprenorphine (brand name Revivon; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} M5050), {{also known as}} diprenorfin, is a non-selective, high-affinity, weak partial agonist of the μ- (MOR), κ- (KOR), and δ-opioid receptor (DOR) (with equal affinity) that is employed in veterinary medicine as an opioid antagonist. It is used to reverse the effects of super-potent opioid analgesics such as etorphine and <b>carfentanil</b> that are used for tranquilizing large animals. The drug is not approved for use in humans.|$|E
50|$|Acetorphine was {{developed}} in 1966 by the Reckitt research group that developed etorphine. Acetorphine {{was developed}} for the same purpose as etorphine itself, namely as a strong tranquilizer for use in immobilizing large animals in veterinary medicine. Despite showing some advantages over etorphine, for instance producing less toxic side effects in giraffes, acetorphine was never widely adopted for veterinary use, and etorphine (along with other tranquilizers such as <b>carfentanil</b> and azaperone) remains the drug of choice in this application.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use for {{azaperone}} is in relatively small doses to reduce aggression in farmed pigs, either {{to stop them}} fighting or to encourage sows to accept piglets. Higher doses are used for anesthesia {{in combination with other}} drugs such as xylazine, tiletamine and zolazepam. Azaperone is also used in combination with strong narcotics such as etorphine or <b>carfentanil</b> for tranquilizing large animals such as elephants. Use in horses is avoided as adverse reactions may occur.|$|E
50|$|In theory, {{diprenorphine}} {{could also}} be used as an antidote for treating overdose of certain opioid derivatives which are used in humans, particularly buprenorphine for which the binding affinity is so high that naloxone does not reliably reverse the narcotic effects. However, diprenorphine is not generally available in hospitals; instead a vial of diprenorphine is supplied with etorphine or <b>carfentanil</b> specifically for reversing the effects of the drug, so the use of diprenorphine for treating a buprenorphine overdose is not usually carried out in practice.|$|E
