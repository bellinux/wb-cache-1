Nettie Rothblum, {{one of the}} {{original}} founders of the Kappa Beta Pi Legal Sorority in 1908, was in Sinaloa during the Mexican Revolution, and included a short description of life in Mexico at the time along with payment for her sister Ruth 2 ̆ 7 s tuition. Transcript: February 21, 1913. Dear Mr. Guernsey, Your cordial letter received and but for the fact that I have been extremely busy, would have answered it before this. With all the war news that you are getting in Chicago, it hardly behooves me to add anything, excepting the fact that this particular spot is quiet. At least, we expected to be besieged day before yesterday. Everyone was armed, and the home I live in was guarded, because it would be the centre of attack, but the revolutionists stopped at Mochicahui, a little town few miles north, thought better of it when they heard we were prepared to meet them, and didnt [sic] come that day, although we now expect them daily. In fact, their leader was at the house the morning the attack was expected, reconnoitred, and withdrew, and none of us were any the wiser until now. Inclosed [sic] herewith please find my <b>check</b> <b>to</b> <b>order</b> of Chicago-Kent to pay for Ruth 2 ̆ 7 s tuition, the last semester. I have dated it March 4 th, which is near enough {{to the beginning of the}} new semester, to be acceptable, I think. Please acknowledge receipt direct to my sister, as you did before. With kindest personal regards, I am, Sincerely yours, Nettie Rothblum[URL]...|$|E

40|$|The two-fermion {{relativistic}} wave equations of Constraint Theory are reduced, after {{expressing the}} components of the 4 × 4 matrix wave function in terms of one of the 2 × 2 components, to a single equation of the Pauli-Schrödinger type, valid for all sectors of quantum numbers. The potentials that are present belong to the general classes of scalar, pseudoscalar and vector interactions and are calculable in perturbation theory from Feynman diagrams. In the limit when one of the masses becomes infinite, the equation reduces to the two-component form of the one-particle Dirac equation with external static potentials. The Hamiltonian, <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 1 /c 2, reproduces most of the known theoretical results obtained by other methods. The gauge invariance of the wave equation is <b>checked,</b> <b>to</b> that <b>order,</b> in the case of QED. The role of the c. m. energy dependence of the relativistic interquark confining potential is emphasized and the structure of the Hamiltonian, <b>to</b> <b>order</b> 1 /c 2, corresponding to confining scalar potentials, is displayed...|$|R

40|$|Patients' {{willingness}} to undertake secondary preventive strategies following heart attack {{are likely to}} be affected by their understandings of their condition. This qualitative study explored patients' understandings of heart attack in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the design of effective secondary prevention services. In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 patients with myocardial infarction (MI). These data indicate that information received from health professionals encourages patients to view heart attack as an acute event rather than a symptom of a chronic condition and that this understanding provides patients with low motivation for long-term lifestyle change. Patients may benefit from understanding a heart attack as an acute symptom of an underlying disease process which long-term medication and behavioural change can help <b>to</b> <b>check.</b> In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> achieve this, health professionals need to examine patients' understandings of their heart attack and recovery and to provide information about lifestyle which engages with these understandings...|$|R
