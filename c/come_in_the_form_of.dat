5|$|Mephedrone can <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> capsules, tablets {{or white}} powder that users may swallow, snort, inject, smoke or use rectally. When taken orally, users {{reported}} they {{could feel the}} effects within 15–45 minutes; when snorted, the effects were felt within minutes and peaked within half an hour. The effects last for between two and three hours when taken orally or nasally, but only half an hour if taken intravenously. It is sometimes sold mixed with methylone in a product called bubbles in the UK and also mixed with other cathinones, including ethcathinone, butylone, fluoromethcathinone and methedrone.|$|E
5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E
5|$|Player-run guilds <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Free Companies, {{organized}} {{bands of}} adventurers {{under the auspices}} of one of the three Grand Companies of Eorzea. Free Company members may gain access to a shared company chest, a private chat channel, and Company Actions which are 24-hour buffs to certain aspects of gameplay, such as increased EXP or reduced gear damage. Free Company members may also pool their resources to purchase a house in one of the residential districts. In addition to decorating the house, players may use the grounds to grow unique items through the gardening system, train their chocobo companion, embark on airship expeditions, and purchase a private room for personal use. Linkshells are another form of in-game networking; whereas players may only belong in one Free Company, they may join up to eight linkshells which act as private chat channels for interested sub-groups.|$|E

5|$|The Wipeout {{games are}} {{a series of}} futuristic racers which involve players {{piloting}} anti-gravity ships through various forms of races. The series is known for its extreme speed, range of electronic dance music soundtracks, and consequential difficulty. Power-ups <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> offensive or defensive weaponry, ranging from machine guns, missiles, rockets, to energy shields, auto pilots, and mines. Power-ups are usually collected by flying over different coloured pads on race tracks. Speed boost pads also feature prominently on race tracks: once flown over, the player receives a short momentous boost. Every ship featured in a game is owned by a different racing corporation (collectively referred to as 'teams' in-game) although the number of teams and ships will vary throughout the games. Every ship has different characteristics, for example each ship will vary in handling, thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each ship is equipped with a compulsory shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire. If the shield runs out, the ship in question will explode and the player is consequently eliminated from the race.|$|E
5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E
