50|$|The reduced shift travel {{provided}} by the synchroniser package has also allowed increased space {{for the use of}} larger gears, which are stronger to deliver improved torque capacity and gearbox durability. A new single-piece <b>counter</b> <b>shaft</b> also contributes to the greater torque capacity and durability enhancements.|$|E
5000|$|The Toploader {{comprises}} two components: {{the main}} case, which encloses the gears, input and <b>counter</b> <b>shaft,</b> and the tailhousing, which encloses the speedometer gear and output shaft. The main case measures 12" [...] in length, while the tailhousing measures 14", 14 [...] " [...] or 17", {{depending on the}} application.|$|E
5000|$|Transmission shafts {{are used}} to {{transmit}} power between the source and the machine absorbing power; e.g. <b>counter</b> <b>shafts</b> and line shafts.|$|R
50|$|The {{crankshaft}} {{is geared}} {{directly to the}} clutch. No <b>counter</b> balancer <b>shaft</b> is used. Starting is by electric starter only. Lubrication is wet sump using a trochoid pump.|$|R
50|$|The V6 {{does not}} have the {{inherent}} freedom from vibration that the inline-six and flat-six have, but it can be modeled as two separate straight-3 engines sharing a crankshaft. Counterweights on the crankshaft and a <b>counter</b> rotating balance <b>shaft</b> are required to compensate for the first order rocking motions.|$|R
5000|$|Mixing of gearsets can be {{achieved}} due to the similarity between the various transmissions, but some gears must be interchanged in sets. First and second gear are integral to the input shaft and cannot be interchanged independently. All transmissions have a third gear ratio of 1.38:1. However, third and fourth gear are clustered on the <b>counter</b> <b>shaft</b> which was available with two different fourth gear ratios: 1.03:1 or [...]94:1. Fifth gear is independently interchangeable and available with a [...]80:1 and [...]72:1 ratio.|$|E
50|$|In {{this case}} {{generally}} forward reverse synchronizers {{are replaced by}} the multi-plate friction clutches. Typically the multi-plate clutches are arranged on the main shaft or on the <b>counter</b> <b>shaft.</b> The forward reverse section of the gear box is generally located in the forward section {{as close to the}} engine as possible. This is beneficial to the forward reverse control elements as they are not subjected to the high relative torque.The challenge involved in providing this feature in the existing transmissions is the complex shaft arrangement. This problem arises due to the limitation of centre distance between the two shafts and fixed axial dimensions due to the vehicle size limitations.|$|E
5000|$|In 1913, a Bradbury {{motor cycle}} won the Transvaal Speed Championship. Also in 1913 Bradbury {{motorcycles}} {{participated in the}} Scottish Six Days Trial. In the 1914 six-day trial based in Sheffield the chassis of the Bradbury 6 hp broke {{and as a consequence}} Bradbury were excluded from the War Department Trials. However the company did supply Naval Authorities with [...] motorcycles with a 3-speed <b>counter</b> <b>shaft</b> gear. [...] After the First World War Bradbury produced a range of 4 hp 554 cc single-cylinder motorcycles as well as the [...] 750 cc twin and a [...] 350 cc single. In 1922, the range was redesigned with a new frame and fuel tank and a new Bradbury [...] 996 cc V-type twin was launched with an optional side car.|$|E
50|$|The dual {{crankshafts}} {{are geared}} {{directly to the}} clutch, while the front crankshaft also drives a <b>counter</b> balancer <b>shaft</b> mounted between the two crankshafts. The counterbalance shaft, unusual on a two-stroke, assists with damping engine vibrations. The engine is cooled by thermostatically controlled liquid cooling, an auxiliary electric fan mounted behind the radiator cuts in at quite high but acceptable working temperatures (e.g. when stationary in traffic).Lubrication is by direct injection into the inlet manifolds using Yamaha's 'Autolube' pump system. Normally controlled in other two-stroke engines by throttle position, the engine oil pump {{is controlled by the}} YPVS servo motor ensuring that the oil supply is not shut off at high engine revolutions.|$|R
25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising {{of the potential for}} differential failure due to external leaks {{at the front of the}} transmission's <b>counter</b> gear <b>shaft.</b> The revision of the four speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer transmission output shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case. These are among many of the course corrections undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.|$|R
50|$|The FJ1200 uses a four {{cylinder}} in-line {{layout and}} is air-cooled. Sixteen valves are {{operated by a}} chain-driven double overhead camshaft; valve clearances are adjusted using shims. The four constant-velocity carburettors are mounted in a bank behind the cylinders and feed each cylinder through short intake manifolds. Four exhaust downpipes join a box below the engine where the gases are split to exit through two silencers (mufflers). The crankshaft is geared directly to the clutch, no <b>counter</b> balancer <b>shaft</b> is used. Starting is by electric starter only. Lubrication is wet sump using a trochoid pump; an oil radiator assists with cooling. Both the FJ1100 and FJ1200 were fitted with an additional fuel vapour recovery system to comply with California emission regulations.|$|R
50|$|Defiance, a fast {{touring car}} on the 40 hp chassis was {{exhibited}} at Olympia's 1912 Motor Show. It is delivered ready for the road with hood, screen, Austin-Sankey detachable wheels, dynamo and lamps. The CAV dynamo projects through the aluminium dashboard from its mounting on an aluminium bridge over the flywheel. It is driven by a <b>counter</b> <b>shaft</b> taking its drive from the camshaft. The Automotor Journal described Defiance as having a Torpedo body.Defiance had been developed from the 40 hp for the 2,000 mile trial held by the Automobile Club of Russia and run from St Petersburg to Riga and Moscow. It was given a streamlined body, a tapered bonnet and a radiator with rounded edges. It performed well. At St Petersburg over the flying kilometre carrying three people, two spare wheels, spare parts and luggage it was timed at 28 seconds, more than 80 miles an hour.|$|E
5000|$|A Toploader {{transmission}} is a manually shifted {{three and four}} speed gearbox introduced in 1963 by the Ford Motor Company to replace the BorgWarner T-10. It was used in most Fords and Mercurys from 1964 until 1973 {{as well as some}} foreign models. Officially designated the 3.03 three speed or Ford design four speed. The 3.03 is the centerline distance between <b>counter</b> <b>shaft</b> and mainshaft. The Toploader got its name {{from the fact that the}} access plate to the inner workings was located on the top of the main case as opposed to the side, a convention used on most gearboxes such as the Ford Dagenham or GM's Saginaw or Muncie. This feature increased the rigidity of the case significantly. Distinguishing the three speed from the four is as simple as counting the fasteners on the top plate. The four speed has ten; the three, nine. Both the three and four speed top loader gearboxes were designed to function in constant mesh, due to synchronizer sleeves being used instead of sliding gears, and be fully synchronized, with the exception of reverse. Forward gears are helical-type while reverse gear including the exterior of the first and second synchronizers sleeve are spur-type gears. This {{transmission is}} also known as the Tremec T-170, HEH, or RUG depending on the year(s) of production. [...] At some point in the early 70's production was moved to Mexico and the name was changed to Tremec.|$|E

40|$|A {{self-acting}} {{spiral groove}} inter-shaft ring seal of nominal 16. 33 cm (6. 43 in.) diameter for sealing fan bleed air between <b>counter</b> rotating <b>shafts</b> in advanced turbofan engines was analyzed. The analysis {{focused on the}} lift force characteristics of the spiral grooves. A NASA Lewis developed computer program for predicting the performance of gas lubricated face seals was used to optimize the spiral groove geometry to produce maximum lift force. Load capacity curves (lift force as function of film thickness) were generated for four advanced turbofan engine operating conditions at relative seal speeds ranging from 17, 850 to 29, 800 rpm, sealed air pressures from 6 to 42 N/sq cm (9 to 60 Psi) absolute and temperatures from 95 to 327 C (203 to 620 F). The relative seal sliding speed range was 152 to 255 m/sec (500 to 836 ft/sec). The analysis showed that the spiral grooves are capable of producing sufficient lift force such that the ring seal will operate in a noncontacting mode over the operating range of typical advanced turbofan engines.

40|$|Abstract The present paper {{emphasizes}} on {{the estimation of}} natural frequencies and mode shapes of a shaft supported by more than three bearings. In advent of this, a <b>counter</b> <b>shaft</b> of already developed experimental setup has been considered. The natural frequencies and mode shapes of <b>counter</b> <b>shaft</b> are deteremined analytically by adopting Holzer's method and the results obtained are then compared {{with the results of}} software based approach. By adopting the same method, Stresses in the shaft and amplitudes of rotors are also estimated. Based on the obtained data the generallised mathematical models have been formulated for the prediction of stresses in shaft and amplitudes of rotors. Significant independent variables which influence the phenomenon i. e development of stresses and amplitudes of rotor have been accounted in terms of a group of pie terms. These group of pie terms are accomplished with the help of dimensional analysis technique and they are used to formulate the mathematical models. In this paper the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the established mathematical models are also carried out...|$|E

40|$|Citation: Richardson, Emmit D. and Brant, Walter J. Design and {{construction}} of a twenty-five horse-power gasoline traction-engine. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1906. Introduction: Object: To design and construct at the shops of the Kansas State Agricultural College, a gasoline traction engine that shall fulfill the following requirements; The engine shall have but one set of gearing {{to be used for}} forward and reverse motion, dispensing with speed changing gearing, together with its expensive first cost and maintenance, noise, low efficiency and weight. The gearing shall be on stiff shafts and rigid centers, having no radius rods nor stub gearing. All gears shall be of crucible cast steel, and shall be of ample size to stand rough usage and wear. Master or bull gears shall have roller bearings. Differential gears shall be of the spur gear type and shall be placed on a <b>counter</b> <b>shaft.</b> The bull gears shall be attached to the drive wheels by means of ample spring cushion links to take off sudden strains on the gearing and frame. The crank shaft shall be given as steady a torque as possible by using four quadruple opposed cylinders. These cylinders shall be large enough to give the crank shaft as great a torque as is given to the crank shaft of steam engine of the same nominal rating. The governor shall be constructed {{so that it can be}} set and regulated to run the engine under complete control at any speed from 50 R. P. M. to 220 R. P. M., as desired. The cylinders shall be horizontal and shall be located as low as possible in order that they may be covered with cooling water when water in the tank is low. The engine shall be easily reversed and shall be fitted with two friction clutches, one for the traction gearing and one for the belt pulley...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of two mechanicalwind pumpingsystems was carriedout to determine windmill performance at different water depths. A 2. 44 m (8 ft) rotor diameterwindmill with 15 vanes, and a 4. 88 m (16 ft) rotor diameterwindmill with 32 delta wing vanes, were compared. The smallerwindmill had vanes that filled 90 % of the rotor areawhile the vanes on the largerone filled 41 % of the rotor area. The smallerunit used a gearbox and the largerone used a pump jack style with a <b>counter</b> weighted <b>shaft.</b> Results {{from this study}} showed that both windmills started pumping at about the samewind speed (2. 5 and 3. 5 m/s), but the largerrotor operated at 6 to 8 strokes per minute faster than the smallersystem when wind speeds were between 4 and 10 m/s. Although both windmills were fitted with the. same size and style of pump, the larger rotor pumped more water because it had more stokes per unit of time. The delta wing rotor averaged 14, 874 Llday compared to 10, 974 Llday for the traditionally designed rotor. However, one must consider the difference in rotor diameters, total weight, cost and the efficiency of the two units. The larger rotor had a peak efficiency of 6. 5 % compared to 10. 5 % for the smaller rotor. The 35 % more water pumped required twice as much rotor diameter...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{odd number}} of {{cylinders}} in each bank, V6 designs are inherently unbalanced, regardless of their V-angle. All straight engines with an odd {{number of cylinders}} suffer from primary dynamic imbalance, which causes an end-to-end rocking motion. Each cylinder bank in a V6 has an odd number of cylinders, so the V6 also suffers from the same problem unless steps are taken to mitigate it. In the horizontally opposed flat-6 layout, the rocking motions of the two straight cylinder banks offset each other, while in the inline-6 layout, the two ends of engine are mirror images {{of each other and}} compensate every rocking motion. Concentrating on the first order rocking motion, the V6 can be assumed to consist of two separate straight-3 where counterweights on the crankshaft and a <b>counter</b> rotating balance <b>shaft</b> compensate the first order rocking motion.|$|R
40|$|Cupola is a <b>counter</b> current <b>shaft</b> reactor for {{production}} of cast iron. The solid charge consisting of coke, pig iron, steel scrap and flux {{is fed from}} the top of the reactor and blast is blown radially through the tuyeres. One-dimensional (1 -D) models, wherein the governing equations are solved along the axial direction, have been reported in the literature. However, because of radial entry of blast through the tuyeres, incorporation of boundary conditions at the tuyere level poses a major difficulty in l-D models. In this paper, a pseudo 2 -D model for cupola has been proposed in which, the governing equations are employed in 2 -D at the tuyere level and l-D in the remaining portion. The solution of 2 -D equations at the tuyere level generates the appropriate boundary conditions for the remaining l-D portion above the tuyeres. In order to evaluate the performance of the pseudo 2 -D model, a 2 -D model was also developed. Further, the two models have been validated using reported experimental data. The study shows that the overall temperature and composition distributions obtained from the pseudo 2 -D model are quite comparable with that obtained from the 2 -D model. Also, the pseudo 2 -D model was found to be computationally faster compared to the 2 -D model. Hence, for practical design and operation exercise, pseudo 2 -D model can be effectively used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Actual on-engine {{testing of}} {{accessory}} and internal components is expensive and time consuming {{and many times}} altogether impractical, certainly on a production basis. There is an increasing need for high performance electric motors that can produce high frequency torque/velocity variations while running at a steady base speed to simulate the engine characteristics. Testing superchargers, pumps, <b>shafts,</b> <b>counter</b> balancers on a production basis {{with an electric motor}} requires rpm up to 6000 or higher and plus minus 5 % to 10 % velocity variation up to 100 times per second to duplicate this stress. Modern motor systems can accomplish this using Brushless technology. The Problem: Certain parts and accessories used with internal combustion engines must have considered in their design the pulsating nature of the rotation of such engines. This pulsation creates both primary and harmonic torsional stress on any component driven by the crankshaft. Common examples of these components would b...|$|R
40|$|A {{formulation}} {{was designed}} to produce silane crosslinkable rice straw/high density polyethylene (RSPE) compound suitable for injection molding process. The formulations consist of high density polyethylene (HDPE) as the base polymer, rice straw as the filler, processing aids and a mixture of crosslink chemicals. Crosslink chemicals consist of vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMO) as crosslinking agent, dicumyl peroxide (DCP) as the initiator, dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL) as the condensation catalyst. Lignocellulosic material, rice straw was oven dried at 70 °C for 24 h, grinded and sieved. A <b>counter</b> rotating twin <b>shaft</b> high speed mixer was utilized to mix the rice straw, HDPE and the processing aids. Blends were then compounded on co-rotating and intermeshing twin screw extruder. Test specimens were prepared via injection molding process followed by oven curing at 90 °C. Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) {{was used to determine}} the chemical group involved in the crosslinking reaction. Degree of crosslinking in the silane crosslinked compound was measured by determining their gel content. Thermal properties were analyzed on the Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) for the melt temperature, Tm, whereas Thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis for its thermal stability behavior. The degree of crosslinking in RSPE increases with an increased in VTMO and DCP concentration. The results from FTIR showed the presence of Si-O-Si bond and Si-O-C indicative of crosslinks formation. Thermal behavior of the compound illustrated that the crosslinked RSPE was more stable than the uncrosslinked RSPE and pure HDPE, while the Tm was unchanged...|$|R
