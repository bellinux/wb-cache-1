30|$|To {{promote the}} {{application}} of petroleum coke in clean energy storage, we have synthesized an oxygen-doped porous carbon via KOH activation and chemical modification of petroleum coke. The as-prepared carbon possesses a high surface area and abundant oxygen-containing groups, leading to large EDL capacitance and pseudo-capacitance. The introduced oxygen-containing groups can also improve the accessibility of electrolyte ions; thus, the ions {{can get to the}} surface easily even at ultrahigh current density. In addition, the stable micrographic structure of the material makes the electron transfer fast. Furthermore, the facile and efficient synthesis process could be easily scaled up, which makes the practical application of petroleum <b>coke</b> in energy <b>storage</b> possible.|$|R

30|$|In {{the above}} example [14], as the channel diameters of H-ZSM- 5 {{are small and}} {{relatively}} uniform, {{there is not much}} internal space for the coke building up, whereas the larger inner cavity space allows the H-SAPO- 34 to accumulate more coke species inside. It {{should be noted that the}} volume of <b>coke</b> <b>storage</b> here is not directly correlated with the coke capacity of zeolite. In contrast, due to the uniformly distributed channel size, H-ZSM- 5 would possess a much higher coke tolerance capacity, this is because in principle, chemicals with larger than the channel diameter size are hardly formed inside [12, 13, 22, 25]. For H-SAPO- 34, the smaller pore opening and much larger inner cavity make it difficult to move those internally formed large coke species to outside space, thus eventually leadint to an inreversible catalyst deactivation [10, 12, 13, 34, 35, 36].|$|E
