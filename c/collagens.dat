5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, <b>collagens</b> and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In fibrotic {{diseases}} such as pulmonary fibrosis there is evidence suggesting enhanced synthesis and degradation of lung connective tissue components, including <b>collagen.</b> It has therefore been hypothesised that products of <b>collagen</b> degradation may {{have a role in}} the promotion of <b>collagen</b> deposition. In support of this hypothesis, it has recently been shown that intravenous injection of lung <b>collagen</b> degradation products in experimental animals stimulated <b>collagen</b> synthesis leading to increased <b>collagen</b> deposition and diffuse interstitial lung disease. METHODS [...] Rabbit and human fibroblast cultures from lung and skin were used as an in vitro model to study the responses of these cells to rabbit <b>collagen</b> degradation products. The effects of an acute exposure to <b>collagen</b> degradation products on synthesis of <b>collagen</b> and noncollagenous protein have been studied in confluent cultures by [3 H]-proline incorporation. The effects of <b>collagen</b> degradation products on fibroblast proliferation and production of genetic types of <b>collagen</b> have also been investigated. RESULTS [...] The acute exposure of rabbit lung fibroblast cultures to <b>collagen</b> degradation products significantly increased <b>collagen</b> synthesis without affecting non-collagenous protein synthesis. This effect was dose related, specific for lung fibroblasts, and species specific. <b>Collagen</b> degradation products altered the rate of synthesis of genetic types of <b>collagen</b> with a consequent decrease of type III/I+III <b>collagen</b> ratio (0. 26 (0. 04) treated with <b>collagen</b> degradation products; 0. 45 (0. 02) controls). These effects occurred without the intervention of serum factors. In addition, <b>collagen</b> degradation products neither affected fibroblast proliferation nor selected specific clones emphasising one type of <b>collagen.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] These results suggest that <b>collagen</b> degradation products can influence lung <b>collagen</b> metabolism by stimulating <b>collagen</b> synthesis.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} whether <b>collagen</b> queternary structure {{is required for}} the platelet: <b>collagen</b> interaction. Quaternary structure refers to the assembly of <b>collagen</b> monomers (tropocollagen) into polymers (native-type fibrils). Purified monomeric <b>collagen</b> was prepared from acetic acid extracts of fetal calfskin. Polymeric <b>collagen</b> was prepared by dispersion of bovine Achilles tendon <b>collagen</b> and by incubation of monomeric <b>collagen</b> at 37 Â°C and pH 7. 4. The state of polymerization was confirmed by electron microscopy. Release of platelet serotonin in the absence of platelet aggregation was used to determine the effectiveness of the platelet: <b>collagen</b> interaction. All forms of <b>collagen</b> produced serotonin release only after a lag period, but polymeric <b>collagen</b> gave a shorter lag period than did monomeric <b>collagen.</b> Monomeric <b>collagen</b> was also quanidinated selectively to convert <b>collagen</b> lysine groups to homoarginine, while leaving the arrangement of polar groups intact. Guanidination of monomeric <b>collagen</b> increased the rate of polymerization and reduced the lag time in serotonin release. Glucosamine (17 mM) retarded polymerization and inhibited the release of platelet serotonin by monomeric <b>collagen</b> but had little effect on release produced by thrombin or polymeric <b>collagen.</b> At the same concentration, glucosamine did not reduce the sensitivity of platelets to stimulation by <b>collagen</b> or block the platelet: <b>collagen</b> interaction. The only effect of glucosamine was on the collagen: <b>collagen</b> interaction. Galactosamine had a similar effect, but glucose, galactose, and N-acetylglycosamine had no effect.

40|$|This study investigates whether soluble <b>collagen</b> can {{initiate}} {{platelet aggregation}} or whether {{a higher degree}} of polymerization is required. Purified rat skin <b>collagen</b> was prepared in four states. Soluble monomeric <b>collagen,</b> containing 2 Î¼M calcium chloride, was maintained at 4 Â°C until use. A previously uncharacterized form of <b>collagen,</b> soluble microfibrillar <b>collagen,</b> was prepared from monomeric <b>collagen</b> containing calcium chloride by allowing it to polymerize at 23 Â°C. Viscometric and electron microscopic characterization of microfibrillar <b>collagen</b> indicated polymerization to ordered native filaments. Particulate native macrofibrillar <b>collagen</b> was prepared from monomeric <b>collagen</b> by allowing it to polymerize at 37 Â°C in the absence of calcium. Particulate <b>collagen,</b> in which the fibers were randomly associated, was prepared by salt precipitation of calcium-free monomeric <b>collagen.</b> Microfibrillar and native macrofibrillar <b>collagen</b> initiated platelet aggregation, with a lag phase of approximately 60 s. Monomeric <b>collagen</b> initiated aggregation with a lag phase of approximately 180 s. The duration of the lag phase for platelet aggregation initiated by monomeric <b>collagen</b> was independent of the dose. Salt-precipitated particulate <b>collagen</b> did not initiate platelet aggregation.

30|$|The {{structure}} and hierarchical organisation of <b>collagen</b> is well documented. The process of constructing a <b>collagen</b> tissue begins with three <b>collagen</b> polypeptide chains each comprising over 1050 amino acids {{of a specific}} sequence twisting to form a <b>collagen</b> molecule with a rigid rope like triple helix motif. The alternate direction of the twist and the steric local arrangement of amino acids in the chain cause the helix to lock into a specific structure where water has a significant relationship with the <b>collagen</b> molecule. <b>Collagen</b> molecules then aggregate in a very specific and highly directed way where stability is engendered through ionic interactions, hydrophobic regions and covalent intra and intermolecular crosslinkages to form an insoluble <b>collagen</b> fibril. <b>Collagen</b> fibrils are slender structures (â‰ˆ 120 Â nm wide in skin and at least several microns long) each fibril comprises several thousand <b>collagen</b> molecules in cross-section and extends over several <b>collagen</b> molecules in length.
