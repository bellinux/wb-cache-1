Divestitures of low productive plants were found to play a particularly important role in the replacement process generating productivity growth. The effect of external restructuring on productivity is to some extent explained by a shift towards a more skill-intensive production. Corporate Restructuring; Labor Productivity Growth...|$|R

40|$|The success <b>of</b> the <b>accounting</b> {{profession}} in claiming social rewards has {{been attributed to}} strategies of "closure " which bound its body of knowledge, provide monopoly powers over areas of practice and limit who may have access to the rewards of practice [cf. Murphy, 1984, 1988; Macdonald, 1985; Lee, 1990; Richardson, 1998]. In this paper we examine gender as a criterion for closure in the Canadian accounting profession. We use archival and oral history materials to determine the mechanisms used to control the gender composition of the profession and to explore the subjective experiences of those women who imfially breached this aspect <b>of</b> the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the profession. Our review is divided into three areas: education, employment, and professional affiliation. We assume that professional status require sequential movement through these three stages but that the extent and nature of discrimination in each will be independent. Our analysis of the role of gender in the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>accounting</b> profession draws on feminist theories which seek to explain and understand the experience of women in patriarchal societies. What feministheorie share is the assumption that systems of power and resource allocation in society are shaped by masculine values. These theories suggest how these systems negatively affect all people but particularly women psychologically, physically, and socially. One key aspect of a masculine system of power is the allocation of work roles on the basis of gender. Women, for example, are {{more likely than men to}} work at unpaid labor (e. g. domestic labor) in the private sphere of society withouthe protection of labor laws which affect jobs in the public sphere.

5000|$|Furthermore, in the {{aftermath}} of the 2009 UBS tax evasion controversy, the U.S. government began concerted efforts to identify U.S. citizens who held non-U.S. financial accounts. A major limb of this effort was the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), passed in 2010, which imposed additional taxes on the U.S. income of non-U.S. banks which did not sign an agreement with the IRS to collect information about their customers' citizenships and to provide the IRS with any information on customers identified as having [...] "U.S. indicia", including a U.S. place of birth.
