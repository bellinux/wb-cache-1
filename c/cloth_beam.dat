The correct tension of the warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.|$|E
50|$|The warp {{passes from}} the warp beam, passes over a {{friction}} guide roller, where it horizontally {{passes through the}} loom to a breastbeam. Here it turns vertically to the <b>cloth</b> <b>beam.</b> Even tension is essential as any variation will lead to broken threads. As the warp beam empties its effective diameter changes making the warp slacker- tension is maintained by adding a wooden pulley to the beam, around which are two turns of rope that are attached to mill weights- thus retarding the beam through friction. The <b>cloth</b> <b>beam</b> bears a toothed wheel which works a pinion. A ratchet wheel is attached with a click level {{to take up the}} slack in the cloth. This was Roberts invention.|$|E

50|$|To {{begin the}} weaving process, Dash & Miller weave 1 or 2 inches of plain weave at the {{beginning}} of the warp. This spaces out the warp threads properly and also evens out any tension issues. They can then begin weaving the tapestry, passing the 3 colours of thread by hand through the shed created by lifting the warp threads up and down. The computer controls which threads are lifted up and down, but the weft yarns are passed through the shed by hand. Weaving builds up at a rate of approximately 11 inches per hour, and the weaving is stored on the <b>cloth</b> storage <b>beam</b> at the front of the weaving loom.|$|R
5000|$|William Horrocks secured several patents {{to improve}} the loom. The Horrocks loom Introduced in 1803, {{featured}} an improved method of taking up the <b>cloth</b> onto the <b>beam</b> once it was woven. It had a metal frame, as was described as neat and compact so hundreds could be at work in a single room. [...] As the warp was now dressed away from the loom, Horrocks loom could be run continuously being stopped only to piece broken threads and to replenish the weft in the shuttle. Two thousand four hundred were in use by 1813, by 1818 there were 32 factories containing 5732 looms. There were 14,150 looms by 1820 but 55,500 by 1829. though these would be outnumbered 4 to 1 by handlooms. Official figures, The Facories Inspectors'count) were first compiled in 1835 and they showed 108,189 power looms used for cotton, 1713 for silk, 2330 for wool and 2846 for worsted {{but not all of}} these would have been Horrocks looms, the 1830 Roberts Loom (based on 1822 patents) had become more popular.|$|R
5000|$|With each weaving operation, {{the newly}} {{constructed}} fabric must be wound on a <b>cloth</b> <b>beam.</b> This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or {{released from the}} warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a filling stop motion which will brake the loom, if the weft thread breaks.|$|E
50|$|In {{general the}} {{supporting}} {{structure of the}} loom is called the frame. It provides the means of fixing the length-wise threads, called the warp, and keeping them under tension. The warp threads are wound on a roller called the warp beam, and attached to the <b>cloth</b> <b>beam</b> which will hold the finished material. Because of the tension the warp threads are under, {{they need to be}} strong.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{secondary}} motions, {{because with}} each weaving operation the newly constructed fabric must be wound on a <b>cloth</b> <b>beam.</b> This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or {{released from the}} warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a tertiary motion, the filling stop motion. This will brake the loom, if the weft thread breaks. An automatic loom requires 0.125 hp to 0.5 hp to operate.|$|E
40|$|In this research, the {{experimental}} work is on strengthening the Reinforced Concrete (RC) structure by using steel plates in different configuration. Repair or strengthening the Reinforced Concrete (RC) beam had become {{very common in}} all country. The RC beams mostly repair by externally retrofit with Fibre Reinforced Polymer and plates. The flexural of the beams {{can be achieved by}} using different retrofitting materials. The crack RC beam can be strengthening after repair with FRP or plate. The FRP consist of Carbon Fibre Reinforced polymer (CFRP), Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP), Aramic Fibre Reinforced polymer (AFRP) and also steel plate. In this research, the steel plate was used to repair the cracked beams sample. The concrete grade of all beams is 30 MPa. The size of the beams is 150 mm x 250 mm x 2000 mm. The beams are cure for 28 days by put the wet <b>cloth</b> on the <b>beams</b> and make sure the cloth is moisture to prevent dehydration. The beams were compress by Frame Testing Machine (FTM) until to get a first crack and stop the machine. The beams were taken out for repair by inject epoxy into cracking part and gun the steel plate on the beams. The steel plate with width 30 mm is used. The ten pieces of steel plates were wrapped on each RC beam. There were arranging in two different sequences of U- jacket and L-j acket. The experimental results of this research can be used in the industry to strengthen the cracked beams rather than being demolish. However, further study is needed to carry out to get a better result which having higher strength of RC structure...|$|R
50|$|From pre-history {{through the}} early middle ages, for most of Europe, the Near East and North Africa, two main types of loom {{dominate}} textile production. These are the warp-weighted loom and the two-beam loom. The length of the <b>cloth</b> <b>beam</b> determined {{the width of the}} cloth woven upon it, and could be as wide as 2-3 meters. The second loom type is the two-beam loom. Early woven clothing was often made of full loom widths draped, tied, or pinned in place.|$|E
50|$|In {{the process}} of {{manufacture}} the raw cotton is procured by the weavers from the Karnataka State Handicrafts Development Corporation. Cotton 3/10s, an unbleached yarn, {{is used for the}} warp and cotton 10s of 6-ply is used for weft. The yarns could also be purchased from the market in Hubli. After procurement of the required material, pre-weaving process is started. This is a four-stage process. The first step being preparation of warp, which is a set of threads which runs through the length of the durries and which is covered by the weft. The decision on the length of the durrie is dictated by the 3/10s cotton converted into balls. While warp of the small durries are made in the open yard of the house, in the case of larger size durries of say 8 x 12 ft size, the warps are made in large open grounds in the town. Then a detailed work procedure is followed with sticks to warp the required number of threads. This warp is then shifted to the loom inside the house and weaving is done in a set pattern using warp beams of the looms, sticks and threads. The yarn of the weft 10s cotton is then dyed with dyes of black, yellow, red, brown, blue and green colours, mixed with water, and the hanks are kept in the dye solution for 20 minutes before removal and drying. The warp is fixed on the loom (which is of vertical design, quite ancient, unlike the horizontal loom used at the ground level at other places in the country) and adequately stretched to obtain the required tension. The weaving is then started by two weavers facing each other. Patterns are introduced in the warp at the appropriate stage of weaving. Vertical and diagonal lines are marked and weaved suitably. Weft is then covered over the warp, and this covering decides the quality of the durries. Weft is layered over the warp and pressed properly by beating and tamping. The <b>cloth</b> <b>beam</b> is used to wind the cloth as the durrie gets made. The designs are decided by the weavers intuitively. The progress achieved on each loom is about 6 in per day.|$|E
