This finding should be useful for similar etching experiments, as it has never been <b>concerned</b> <b>previously.</b> By adding a HF dipping after each NHH etching, the exact composition and current distributions as well as their correlation are obtained. The results suggested that the ring-shaped current distribution is determined by its topography while the composition distribution mainly influences the current values.|$|R

One section of the SD that {{was nothing more than a}} front for subversive activities against Austria ironically promoted “German-Austrian peace.” Throughout the events leading to the Anschluß and even after the Nazis marched into Austria, Heydrich - convinced that only his SD could pull off a peaceful union between the two German-speaking nations - organized demonstrations, conducted clandestine operations, ordered terror attacks, distributed propaganda materials, encouraged the intimidation of opponents, and had his SS and SD personnel round-up prominent anti-Nazis, most of whom ended up in Mauthausen concentration camp. Through the coordinated efforts of the SiPo and Heydrich's SD during the first days of the Anschluß, all forms of possible political, military and economic resistance within Austria were effectively eliminated. Once the annexation was official, the Austrian police was immediately subordinated to Heydrich’s SD, SS and the Gestapo. Machinations by the SD, the Gestapo, and the SS helped to bring Austria fully into Hitler's grasp and on 13 March 1938, he signed into law the union with Austria as tears streamed down his face.|$|E

40|$|The {{health needs}} {{of women in}} sub-Saharan African prisons are both {{neglected}} and poorly understood. Outside South Africa, little research exists on African prison health; what is available tends to be gender-blind and concerned with disease prevention rather than with health promotion. While Vetten (2008) has raised this <b>concern</b> <b>previously,</b> a comprehensive overview of women's health and health promotion in African jails is clearly absent. Available evidence shows that the conditions in African prisons are harmful to health, justifying {{a need for a}} health promoting prisons agenda rooted in the needs of sub-Saharan Africa. Women prisoners have significant mental and physical health needs, and international conventions on health care are not being respected globally. The health promoting prison concept has considerable attention in the Global North, with a commitment to equivalence of health care, gender sensitivity and to prisoners’ social as well as health needs. This article provides an opportunity for critical reflection on women's health in prison, shows the lack of research in this area, questions the suitability of the health promoting prisons’ agenda for sub-Saharan Africa, draws on our limited experience of the women's prison in Lusaka, Zambia, and produces recommendations to tackle women's health and wellbeing needs within the criminal justice systems of sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E

This study aims at determining the biomechanical properties of the plasma-treated nitinol spinal rods. The samples were treated at 800 °C 1 hour with furnace-cooling, 450 °C 30 minutes with water-quenching and followed by nitrogen plasma immersion ion implantation at 40 kV for 4 hours. The rods embedded with spinal functional unit were undergone static and dynamic compressive bending tests under temperature control according to ASTM F 1717 - 01. Five models were used in the static test. For the dynamic test, two models were used {{for each of the three}} loading levels (75 %, 50 % and 25 % of ultimate load). The fatigue strength was equal to the loading level with two models endured five million cycles without failure. All samples were plastically deformed without failure after the static test. The average ultimate load was equal to 516. 2 N (SD = 18. 1 N). For the dynamic test at 75 %, there was unilateral fracture of nitinol rod in each model after half million cycles. Bilateral fracture near the rod and screw junction in both models was occurred at 50 % after million cycles. The last two models were loaded for over five million cycles without failure at 25 %. The fatigue strength was equal to 25 % ultimate load, i. e. 129. 0 N. Our results are comparable to the existing implants and considerable for clinical trial.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the pattern of dietary weight loss practice among Malaysian government working women who are working in selected public funded institutions in Malaysia. This cross-sectional study involved two phases; firstly 639 adult Malaysian working women were recruited and underwent weight loss screening process and secondly 120 working women identified from the screening process based on their experience of losing at least 10 % of their highest lifetime body weight, which is a criterion for successful weight loss. Simple random sampling method was used to select 4 ministries in Putrajaya vicinity, Kuala Lumpur and 25 schools in Bandar Baru Bangi. Data were collected via a survey using a set of self-administered questionnaire that includes socio-demographic characteristics, weight history and anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference, body fat). The study was conducted within one year duration from June 2011 to June 2012. The prevalence of successful weight loss among government working women was 18. 8 % (120 / 639). The mean age of women who experienced successful weight loss in this study was 33. 2 ± 7. 7 years old. Majority of these women were married (72. 5 %), of Malay ethnicity (96. 7 %), had 1. 3 ± 1. 5 children and had college or university degree (79. 2 %). Eat more fruits and vegetable...|$|E
