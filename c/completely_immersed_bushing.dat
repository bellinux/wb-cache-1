40|$|This study {{examined}} in vitro {{the existence of}} microbial leakage along {{the components of the}} Brånemark implant system. Thirty-two implant/abutment assemblies were installed in a liquid blood medium previously inoculated with oral micro-organisms. To examine the leakage at the implant-abutment interface, 16 assemblies were partially immersed. The remaining 16 were <b>completely</b> <b>immersed</b> to observe the leakage at both the implant-abutment and abutment-prosthesis interface. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the micro-organisms in the internal part of the implants were collected and incubated on blood agar plates in anaerobic conditions. Micro-organisms were found in the <b>completely</b> <b>immersed</b> assemblies and at lower numbers in the partially immersed implants, indicating that bacterial leakage at both levels seems to exist. Several penetrating bacteria have been associated with peri-implantitis. The clinical importance of this bacterial leakage is not yet well understood. Although the longevity of the Brånemark implants is well documented, this bacterial leakage might play a role in peri-implantitis, both in the etiology {{as well as in the}} treatment. status: publishe...|$|R
