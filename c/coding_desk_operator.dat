40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} and practical issues of special-purpose keyboard design and operator training precedures. It is in two parts. The research discussed in Part A {{was carried out in}} support of two contracts from the Post Office and had two main objectives: first, to provide information needed for the selection of a new keyboard design for use on foreign destination <b>coding</b> <b>desks</b> and second, to evaluate one component of a computerbased training system for operators of the new keyboard. In relation to the first objective, four keyboard designs were evaluated, namely the 2 x 6, 4 x 4, 10 -key chord and 10 -key sequential. On the basis of the results of three experiments, the 10 -key chord keyboard was chosen and recommended to the Post Office as the most efficient of the four layouts. The computer-based training system for operators of foreign destination letter <b>coding</b> <b>desks</b> consists of three stages. In this thesis only the first such stage is discusssed, namely the Keyboard Familiarization, which involves developing the skill of keying chord patterns. Four different computer-based training methods are presented, discussed and evaluated in an experiment specifically designed for this purpose. The main issue of Part B is speed-accuracy tradeoff relationships in a keyboard task. Following a discussion of the limitations of typical Choice Reaction Time models and the benefits of studying speed-accuracy tradeoff relationships, another analysis of the data of Experiment 4 is presented. In this analysis, the speed and accuracy of any given response are examined in terms of those of the preceding response. These findings are discussed in the light of established theories and it is concluded that no known theory can fully account for the obtained results. A new theoretical model is presented to explain them. Finally, this new model is assessed and its implications for keyboard operation and operator training are considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} ufthe {{optical character}} reading (OCR) machine for high-speed code marking and sortation of letter mail {{has led to}} the need for a high-speed method of printing the phosphorescent code marks used by the mechanised letter sorting machines. This paper looks at the requirements,for the printing system, the method adopted and the results achieved. 1 HISTORY Early {{in the development of the}} automatic letter sorting system the British Post Ofice (BPO) adopted a system of code marking letter mail with phosphorescent machine readable codes. Phosphorescent encoding was chosen in preference to fluorescent, magnetic, or passive optical encoding because envelopes have no natural phosphorescence thus simplifying the detection of the coded information. Fluorescent and magnetic encoding systems are more likely to suffer from background inter-ference; background fluorescence occurs from optical brightening agents (OBAs) added to the paper in manu-facture and background magnetism from enclosures within envelopes. A passive optical system, black and white bars, places a constraint on the customer to leave a set area of the envelope blank and is unacceptable. The method of coding currently in use on <b>coding</b> <b>desks</b> is hot melt transfer which, although highly effec-tive on all envelope materials at <b>coding</b> <b>desk</b> rates, is an inherently slow process having a maximum throughput speed of two items per second. Optical character reading (OCR) machines are cost effective only at high throughput rates, of the order of ten items per second, and so a new method of printing was required to match the increased speed. Enclosures within envelopes can be irregular in shape, raising some parts of the envelope surface and leaving cavities elsewhere, thus the envelope can be ren-dered vulnerable to damage by high pressures from an impact type of printer. An ink jet printer imposes almost zero impact pressure on the printed item and also has the capability of high printing speed; it thus became the first choice solution to the printing problem even though no suitable phosphorescent ink was avail-able at the time.

Several steps are taken for the staffing and tour scheduling of an IT help desk agents. First, data on the number of calls is used to estimate hourly labour requirements. Next, new scheduling options are proposed to better match these requirements. An Integer Programming (IP) model is then formulated and solved to determine tour scheduling assignments. Finally, alternative schedules are evaluated in terms of tradeoffs between workforce size and cost, service level and employee utilisation. The chosen tour schedules provide better service with a lower cost and a smaller number of employees.

40|$|This {{paper will}} explain SCADA “Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition”, {{and the need}} for quality {{management}} information systems in today’s competitive and widely spread business world. Information systems help companies extend their reach to faraway locations, reshape jobs and work flows, and perhaps profoundly change the way they conduct their business. SNGPL is the only gas transportation company in Pakistan, which is utilizing the SCADA system on such a large scale, with much effect. The SCADA system, implemented in SNGPL since 2000, has greatly changed the corporate profile and organizational procedures as well as the public image of the company. DMC phones and traditional tele-printer messages were mainly used for the communication/dissipation of information across the organization before the implementation of SCADA. No timely or abrupt response could have been given to any sabotage/rupture of pipelines, mainly due to lack of an effective and efficient information system throughout the organization. Nowadays, while monitoring mainline pressure and flow at Gas Control Center Faisalabad, the <b>desk</b> <b>operator</b> would immediately issue a command to close the nearest valve, not only to save the gas volume being purged into the atmosphere but also {{to ensure the safety of}} precious human lives and public property. Moreover, the company’s image in the consumer market has improved greatly due to an uninterrupted gas supply to all major cities and towns of Punjab and NWFP. In short, SCADA has proved to be a blessing in disguise for SNGPL, keeping in view its widely spread infrastructure...|$|R
5000|$|A {{long string}} of [...] "faced" [...] letters (i.e. turned to allow the address to be read) is {{presented}} to a keyboard <b>operator</b> at a <b>coding</b> <b>desk,</b> who types the postcodes onto the envelopes in coloured phosphor dots. The associated machine uses the outward codes in these dots to direct bundles of letters into the correct bags for specific delivery offices. With a machine knowledge of the specific addresses handled by each postal walk at each office, the bundles can be further sorted using the dots of the inward sorting code so that each delivery round receives only its own letters. This feature depends upon {{whether or not it}} is cost effective to second-sort outward letters, and tends to be used only at main sorting offices where high volumes are handled. When postcodes are incomplete or missing, the operator reads the post town name and inserts a code sufficient for outward sorting to the post town where others can further direct it. The mail bags of letter bundles are sent by road, air or train, and eventually by road to the delivery office. At the delivery office the mail that is handled manually is inward sorted to the postal walk that will deliver it, and it is then [...] "set in", sorted into the walk order that allows the deliverer the most convenient progress in the round. The latter process is now being automated, as the rollout of walk sequencing machines continues.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{manufacturing}} process of brick and well rings {{were conducted by}} workers who must bend down, sit, and stand to do the job. This body positions occur repeatedly, so it can cause muscular and back bone injury. This monotonous and repetitive work, plus unergonomic working tools can cause Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) to workers, and will have impact to work productivity. Because of that, analysis was conducted to assess work risk relating to worker muscular disorder {{in the work place}} by using Quick Exposure Check (QEC) to every task elements, and working position that have potential to cause WMSDs. QEC assess damage to the back, shoulder, wrist, and neck. Research results shows that parts of {{manufacturing process}} of brick and well rings that have potentials to cause WMSDs are material mixture and the bucket filling, with exposure level of 73. 8 % and 71. 5 %.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study investigates {{the hypothesis that}} case-based reasoning (CBR) systems have advantages over rule-based reasoning (RBR) systems in providing automated support for Tier- 2 help desk operations. The literature suggests that rule-based systems are best suited for problem solving when the system being analyzed is a single-purpose, specialized system and the rules for solving the problems are clear and do not change with high frequency. Case-based systems, because {{of their ability to}} offer alternative solutions for a given problem, give help-desk technicians more flexibility. Specifically, this dissertation aims to answer the following questions: 1. Which paradigm, rule-based or case-based reasoning, results in more precise solutions to problems when compared to the solutions derived from system manuals? 2. Which paradigm, rule-based or case-based reasoning, is more convenient to maintain in terms of knowledge modification (i. e. addition, deletion, or modification of rules/cases) ? 3. Which paradigm, rule-based or case-based reasoning, enables help-desk technicians to solve problems in shorter time, and therefore at lower cost? This is an {{exploratory study}} based on data collected from field experiments. RBR and CBR based prototypes were set up to support Tier- 2 help desk operations. Trained help <b>desk</b> <b>operators</b> used the system to solve a set of benchmark problems. Data collected from this exercise was analyzed to answer the three research questions. This exploratory study supported the hypothesis that the case-based paradigm is better suited for use in help desk environments at the Tier- 2 level than is the rule-based paradigm. The case-based paradigm, because of its ability to offer alternative solutions for a given problem, gave the help-desk technician flexibility in applying a solution. Alternatively, the rule-based paradigm provided a solution if, and only if, a rule existed for a solution meeting the exact problem specifications. Further, {{in the absence of a}} rule, problem research time, using the rule-based paradigm, extended the time required to formulate a solution thereby increasing the cost. This research provided sufficient information to show that the help-desk knowledge based system utilizing the case-based shell provided better overall solutions to problems than did the rule-based shell...|$|R

30|$|Operators {{described}} {{the transition from}} the platform to the onshore facility as a trade-off. First, there were descriptions of gains in life quality by moving from the stressful confinement environments of the platforms and having more contact with their own families. The second gain was described in terms of proximity and a more direct interaction with operators responsible for other platforms. Operators described increasing and facilitated communication with operators responsible for other platforms due to physical proximity. It was possible to observe that operators in the control room would regularly walk to each other’s desk to discuss ongoing issues and were therefore less dependent on radio or phone. This was regarded as particularly positive in critical situations such as recovery from platform shutdowns in which fast communication is often decisive. For instance, the operators of platform that was recovering from a shutdown could walk to the <b>desk</b> of another <b>operator</b> and ask for more gas in order to restart operations. Other operators in the room followed attentively such situations. They could anticipate possible consequences to their own platforms facilitating decision-making and therefore responding faster to unexpected events. As operators described, small incidents can lead to major outcomes to platforms in the same area. In such cases, only the operator has the local knowledge can operate his/her platform, but rapid information exchange with other operators was seen as highly decisive.|$|R
