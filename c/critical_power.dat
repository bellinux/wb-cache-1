2500|$|Although Arnold's poetry {{received}} only mixed reviews and attention during his lifetime, his forays into literary criticism were more successful. [...] Arnold {{is famous for}} introducing a methodology of literary criticism somewhere between the historicist approach common to many critics {{at the time and}} the personal essay; he often moved quickly and easily from literary subjects to political and social issues. [...] His Essays in Criticism (1865, 1888), remains a significant influence on critics to this day, and his prefatory essay to that collection, [...] "The Function of Criticism at the Present Time", {{is one of the most}} influential essays written on the role of the critic in identifying and elevating literature — even while admitting, [...] "The <b>critical</b> <b>power</b> is of lower rank than the creative." [...] In one of his most famous essays on the topic, [...] "The Study of Poetry", Arnold wrote that, [...] "Without poetry, our science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry". He considered the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were [...] "high truth" [...] and [...] "high seriousness". By this standard, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales did not merit Arnold's approval. Further, Arnold thought the works that had been proven to possess both [...] "high truth" [...] and [...] "high seriousness", such as those of Shakespeare and Milton, could be used as a basis of comparison to determine the merit of other works of poetry. He also sought for literary criticism to remain disinterested, and said that the appreciation should be of [...] "the object as in itself it really is." ...|$|E
60|$|November 1843.--Wordsworth {{holds the}} <b>critical</b> <b>power</b> very low, {{infinitely}} {{lower than the}} inventive; and he said to-day that if the quantity of time considered in writing critiques on the works of others were given to original composition, of whatever kind it might be, {{it would be much}} better employed; it would make a man find out sooner his own level, and it would do infinitely less mischief. A false or malicious criticism may do much injury to the minds of others; a stupid invention, either in prose or verse, is quite harmless.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} slope-dependent {{variation}} in critical mean bed shear stress for coarse grain motion, and evaluates stream power per unit bed area {{as an alternative}} threshold parameter. Explanations for observed slope dependency and existing approaches for predicting the <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> per unit bed area are reviewed. An analysis of secondary bed-load transport datasets is {{used to examine the}} strength of associations between stream power per unit bed area, mean bed shear stress and mean velocity, with bedload transport rate. Data from an original flume study are combined with secondary data from similar flume experiments to investigate the effect of slope on both <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> per unit bed area and critical mean bed shear stress. Results suggest that stream power per unit bed area is most closely correlated with bed-load transport rate, and also that <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> per unit bed area is less variable with slope than critical mean bed shear stress. Alternative solutions to approximating <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> are explored. These include: (1) modifying existing expressions for <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> to account for higher critical mean bed shear stresses at higher slopes, and (2) applying a constant dimensionless <b>critical</b> stream <b>power</b> criterion...|$|R

60|$|All writers, all {{artists of}} any kind, {{in so far}} as they have had any {{philosophical}} or <b>critical</b> <b>power,</b> perhaps just {{in so far as}} they have been deliberate artists at all, have had some philosophy, some criticism of their art; and it has often been this philosophy, or this criticism, that has evoked their most startling inspiration, calling into outer life some portion of the divine life, of the buried reality, which could alone extinguish in the emotions what their philosophy or their criticism would extinguish in the intellect. They have sought for no new thing, it may be, but only to understand and to copy the pure inspiration of early times, but because the divine life wars upon our outer life, and must needs change its weapons and its movements as we change ours, inspiration has come to them in beautiful startling shapes. The scientific movement brought with it a literature, which was always tending to lose itself in externalities of all kinds, in opinion, in declamation, in picturesque writing, in word-painting, or in what Mr. Symons has called an attempt 'to build in brick and mortar inside the covers of a book'; and now writers have begun to dwell upon the element of evocation, of suggestion, upon what we call the symbolism in great writers.|$|E
6000|$|About {{the time}} of his marriage, he {{published}} two books which, by their character, show pretty well the divided interest of his life. His bent from the beginning was more decidedly literary than that of any contemporary American poet. That is to say, the history and art of literature divided his interest with the production of literature, and he carried the unusual gift of a rare <b>critical</b> <b>power,</b> joined to hearty spontaneous creation. It may indeed be guessed that the keenness of judgment and incisiveness of wit which characterize his examination of literature sometimes interfered with his poetic power, and made him liable to question his art when he would rather have expressed it unchecked. One of the two books was a volume of poems; the other was a prose work, Conversations on Some of the Old Poets. He did not keep this book alive; but it is interesting as marking the enthusiasm of a young scholar treading a way then almost wholly neglected in America, and intimating a line of thought and study in which he afterward made most noteworthy venture. Another series of poems followed in 1848, and in the same year The Vision of Sir Launfal. Perhaps it was in reaction from the marked sentiment of his poetry that he issued now a jeu d'esprit, A Fable for Critics, in which he hit off, with a rough and ready wit, the characteristics of the writers of the day, not forgetting himself in these lines: ...|$|E
