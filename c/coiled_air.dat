50|$|The two RSD-7 demonstrators were {{significant}} for Alco. They were built {{with the intention}} of challenging the Fairbanks-Morse Train Master H24-66. When built in early 1954 the RSD-7 delivered the highest continuous tractive effort of all diesel locomotives then available. The RSD-7 offered 75% more dynamic braking capacity than any standard freight unit available at the time. The superlatives of the RSD-7 allowed two units to do the work of three conventional 4-motor units. The dynamic brake system was mounted on top the long hood, leaving room in the short hood for a steam generator. The RSD-7 was the first Alco built with the notched corner sand fills. The RSD-7 was the first Alco to use the <b>coiled</b> <b>air</b> brake intercoolers mounted just above and ahead of the radiator intakes. The RSD-7 was the first Alco to use the then new Model 710 water cooled turbocharger in a 16-cylinder engine. The two demonstrators were numbered DL600 and DL601. The DL600 weighed 360,000 pounds at the standard 60,000 pounds per axle. The DL601 weighed 390,000 to test the gains in adhesion from the extra weight. Additional experimentation by Alco used new fuel injection pumps and nozzles, increased fuel rack settings, and an aftercooler was applied to reduce engine air inlet temperature. The aftercooler allowed higher density inlet air into the engine that promoted greater fuel burning efficiency. The aftercooler became the feature that allowed the 244 to be pushed to 2400 horsepower and the designation of 244H. The 244H is also known as the Alco 250 engine to disassociate it from the troubled 244 engine series. The maroon, yellow and gray painted RSD-7 demonstrators began a 23-railroad, 50,000 mile demonstration tour in the Spring of 1954. The tour concluded in September 1954 and the two units were refurbished before sale to the Santa Fe.|$|E

40|$|Liquid-to-air <b>coils</b> used as <b>air</b> {{heating system}} <b>coils</b> and <b>air</b> system cooling <b>coils</b> for air-conditioning, {{refrigeration}} etc. rarely use their design capacity. The capacity {{must therefore be}} reduced accordingly, traditionally by means of on-off operation or by means of control valves. Draw-backs of traditional control are excessive pressure drop and drive power to pumps due to high flows {{as well as the}} need for balancing valves and control valves with authority. There are, however, possibilities to substantially reduce the drive energy of pumps and fans for <b>air</b> <b>coils,</b> e. g. by replacing valve and damper control by direct control of decentralized pumps and fans. This may achieve better control at a lower cost while using substantially less drive energy. This paper includes basic analysis of heat transfer and control methods to study how coil design affects the transfer function of an <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> on capacity turn-down. The analysis indicates that direct flow control, using variable-speed pumps, may require {{only a fraction of the}} drive power needed by traditional valve control. Furthermore, system designs for low flow rate and pressure drop also provide opportunities for new types of laminar-flow coil designs. Results show that the transfer functions of alternative control methods for the capacity and outlet temperatures of <b>air</b> <b>coils</b> can be written as simple functions of the controlling variable (supply temperature, inlet temperature or coil liquid flow rate). The transfer functions may be tailored to specific needs by changing design parameters such as the design values of air and liquid flow rate and the heat transfer characteristics and heat transfer areas of the respective air and liquid sides.

To increase {{the productivity of}} the millers, many researchers have proposed with a new detection method to replace the conventional one. The sensitivity of such a sensor {{plays a crucial role}} in determining the effectiveness of the method. In our preliminary study a novel oil palm fruit sensor to detect the maturity of oil palm fruit bunches is proposed. The design of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> sensor based on an inductive sensor is further investigated to improve its sensitivity. This paper investigates the results pertaining to the effects of the <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> structure of an oil palm fruit sensor, taking consideration of the used copper wire diameter ranging from 0. 10 mm to 0. 18 mm with 60 turns. The flat-type shape of <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> was used on twenty samples of fruitlets from two categories, namely ripe and unripe. Samples are tested with frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 120 MHz. The sensitivity of the sensor between air to fruitlet samples increases as the coil diameter increases. As for the sensitivity differences between ripe and unripe samples, the 5 mm <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> length with the 0. 12 mm coil diameter provides the highest percentage difference between samples and it is amongst the highest deviation value between samples.

Recovery of condensing heat is one of the important air conditioning energy saving technology for not only increasing energy efficiency ratio，but also reducing peak and filling valley, and balancing power load. In this paper, the phase change material developed by us was used as heat storage medium, and was researched in dual energy storage air conditioning system that could store cold both energy and condensing heat of air conditioning. Specifically, the following subjects have been accomplished: (1) the phase transition properties of sodium acetate trihydrate was studied, its supercooling and precipitation were solved, its latent heat, transformation temperature and thermal conductivity were measured and improved in order to develop a new phase change material used in dual energy air conditioning. (2) the dual energy storage air conditioning experimental equipment was put up including the material researched by us in its heat accumulator. Experiment study has been carried out in the space cooling and water heating mode, cool storage and water heating mode, and space cooling and heat storage mode in this system. The effect on the whole performance of this system was investigated by changing coolant flux, heat water flux and fan <b>coil</b> <b>air</b> flow. The results showed: (1) CMC could control the precipitation of sodium acetate trihydrate, Na 4 P 2 O 7 &# 8226; 10 H 2 O and Na 2 HPO 4 &# 8226; 12 H 2 O could resolve supercooling of this system, and sodium chloride solution could adjust its transformation temperature. (2) The phase change material’s latent heat was 241 J/g, transformation temperature was about 53 ℃, thermal conductivity was above 0. 8 W/m&# 8226;K, which was composed by 88. 11 wt%CH 3 COONa&# 8226; 3 H 2 O+ 1. 54 wt%CMC+ 1. 54 wt%Na 2 HPO 4 &# 8226; 12 H 2 O + 8. 81 wt% NaCl (26. 5 wt%). (3) In the space cooling and water heating mode, the greater heat water flux, the better whole performance of the dual storage system. The integrated energy efficiency ratio (IEER) of this system was 7. 14, as the heat water flux was 410 L/h. (4) In space cooling and heat storage mode, the research showed that heat storage had little effects on space cooling, but the IEER was greatly improved that was useful for air conditioning energy saving. In this mode, the greater coolant flux and fan <b>coil</b> <b>air</b> flow, the greater IEER of this system. The value of IEER could research 7. 06, when the fan <b>coil</b> <b>air</b> flow was 1033 m 3 /h and coolant flux was 972 L/h. 随着社会经济的发展，空调用量增大、能耗不断增加，空调节能日益成为人们关注和研究的焦点。空调冷凝热回收是一种重要的空调节能技术，不仅能提高空调能效比，还能起到削峰填谷、平衡电力负荷的作用。 本文采用自行研制的三水醋酸钠基相变材料储存回收的冷凝热，并在可同时 蓄冷和蓄热的双蓄能空调实验平台进行综合性能研究，具体研究内容包括：（ 1 ）研究三水醋酸钠的相变特性，解决其过冷和析出问题，测量和改善其相变潜热、相变温度和导热率等性能参数，配制出一种可应用于空调冷凝热回收系统中的优质相变材料；（ 2 ）搭建双蓄能实验平台，并在该平台上进行制冷兼供热水、蓄冷兼供热水、制冷兼蓄热等模式下的实验研究，同时研究了冷冻水流量、热水流量、风机盘管风量对机组整体性能的影响。 实验结果表明：（ 1 ）羧甲基纤维素能有效抑制CH 3 COONa&# 8226; 3 H 2 O析出，该体系中加入焦磷酸钠和Na 2 HPO 4 &# 8226; 12 H 2 O均可克服过冷问题，同时加入一定浓度的NaCl溶液可起到调整其相变温度和降低液态粘稠度的作用。（ 2 ） 88. 11 wt%CH 3 COONa&# 8226; 3 H 2 O+ 1. 54 wt%羧甲基纤维素+ 1. 54 wt%十二水磷酸氢二钠+ 8. 81 wt%浓度为 26. 5 wt%的NaCl溶液混合而成的相变材料，相变温度在 53 ℃左右，相变潜热为 241 J/g，导热率大于 0. 8 W/m&# 8226;K，是一种可用于空调冷凝热回收的较理想的相变材料。（ 3 ）双蓄能空调机组在制冷兼供热水模式下运行，热水流量越大，机组整体性能越好，当热水流量为 410 L/h时，机组综合能效比IEER高达 7. 14 ，热水温度为 42. 1 ℃。（ 4 ）对双蓄能空调机组在制冷兼蓄热模式下运行进行研究表明，蓄热对机组制冷端的影响很小，但机组综合能效比得到大幅提高；在该模式下，冷冻水流量和风机盘管风量的越大，机组的综合能效比IEER越大，当风机盘管风量为 1033 m 3 /h、冷冻水流量为 972 L/h时，机组综合能效比可达 7. 06...|$|R

40|$|As {{the main}} {{exporter}} {{in the oil}} palm industry, {{the need to improve}} the quality of palm oil has become the main interest among all the palm oil millers in Malaysia. To produce good quality palm oil, it is important for the miller to harvest a good oil palm Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB). Conventionally, the main reference used by Malaysian harvesters is the manual grading standard published by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB). A good oil palm FFB consists of all matured fruitlets, aged between 18 to 21 weeks of antheses (WAA). To expedite the harvesting process, it is crucial to implement an automated detection system for determining the maturity of the oil palm FFB. Various automated detection methods have been proposed by researchers in the field to replace the conventional method. In our preliminary study, a novel oil palm fruit sensor to detect the maturity of oil palm fruit bunch was proposed. The design of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>coil</b> sensor based on the inductive sensor was further investigated mainly in the context of the effect of coil diameter to improve its sensitivity.
