40|$|<b>Curated</b> <b>{{databases}}</b> are databases {{that are}} populated and updated {{with a great}} deal of human effort. Most reference works that one traditionally found on the reference shelves of libraries – dictionaries, encyclopedias, gazetteers etc. – are now <b>curated</b> <b>databases.</b> Since it is now easy to publish databases on the web, there has been an explosion in the number of new <b>curated</b> <b>databases</b> used in scientific research. The value of <b>curated</b> <b>databases</b> lies in the organization and the quality of the data they contain. Like the paper reference works they have replaced, they usually represent the efforts of a dedicated group of people to produce a definitive description of some subject area. <b>Curated</b> <b>databases</b> present a number of challenges for database research. The topics of annotation, provenance, and citation are central, because <b>curated</b> <b>databases</b> are heavily cross-referenced with, and include data from, other databases, and much of the work of a curator is annotating existing data. Evolution of structure is important because these databases often evolve from semistructured representations, and because they have to accommodate new scientific discoveries. Much of the work in these areas is in its infancy, but it is beginning to provide suggest new research for both theory and practice. We discuss some of this research and emphasize the need to find appropriate models of the processes associated with <b>curated</b> <b>databases...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Curated</b> <b>databases</b> {{represent}} {{a substantial amount}} of effort by a dedicated group of people to produce a definitive description of some subject area. The value of <b>curated</b> <b>databases</b> lies in the quality of the data that has been manually collected, corrected, and annotated by human curators. Many <b>curated</b> <b>databases</b> are continuously modified and new releases being published on the Web. Given that <b>curated</b> <b>databases</b> act as publications, archiving them becomes a necessity to enable retrieval of particular database versions. A system trying to archive evolving databases on the Web faces several challenges. First and foremost, the systems {{needs to be able to}} efficiently maintain and query multiple snapshots of ever growing databases. Second, the system needs to be flexible enough to account for changes to the database structure and to handle data of varying quality. Third, the system needs to be robust and invulnerable to local failure to allow reliable long-term preservation of archived information. Our archive management system XArch addresses the first challenge by providing the functionality to maintain, populate, and query archives of database snapshots in hierarchical format. This presentation intends to give an overview of our ongoing efforts of improving XArch regarding (i) archiving evolving databases, (ii) supporting distributed archives, and (iii) using our archives and XArch as the basis of a system to create, maintain, and publish <b>curated</b> <b>databases.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Many <b>curated</b> <b>databases</b> are {{constructed}} by scientists integrating various existing data sources “by hand”, that is, by manually entering or copying data from other sources. Capturing provenance {{in such an}} environment is a challenging problem, requiring a good model of the process of curation.

In this paper we motivate and present a simple model of provenance for manually <b>curated</b> <b>databases</b> and discuss ongoing and future work. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{knowledge}} on protein–protein interactions (PPI) and their related pathways are {{equally important to}} understand the biological functions of the living cell. Such information on human proteins is highly desirable to understand the mechanism of several diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Because much of that information is buried in biomedical literature, an automated text mining system for visualizing human PPI and pathways is highly desirable. In this paper, we present HPIminer, a text mining system for visualizing human protein interactions and pathways from biomedical literature. HPIminer extracts human PPI information and PPI pairs from biomedical literature, and visualize their associated interactions, networks and pathways using two <b>curated</b> <b>databases</b> HPRD and KEGG. To our knowledge, HPIminer is the first system to build interaction networks from literature as well as <b>curated</b> <b>databases.</b> Further, the new interactions mined only from literature and not reported earlier in databases are highlighted as new. A comparative study with other similar tools shows that the resultant network is more informative and provides additional information on interacting proteins and their associated networks...|$|R

5000|$|MPromDb (Mammalian Promoter Database) is a <b>curated</b> <b>database</b> of gene {{promoters}} identified from ChIP-seq [...] The {{proximal promoter}} region (upstream of the core-promoter region) contains the cis-regulatory elements {{of most of}} the transcription factors (TFs). Recently a better approach to annotate active promoters has been demonstrated with a combination of ChIP-seq and computational technique. This technique has been used to find the target genes of TFs in mammalian systems. The MPromDb is based on this technology. Curated promoter sequences for eukaryotic organisms are provided by EPD database, however, promoter activity information at tissue/ cell centric level is not offered. The MPromDb data base added active RNAP-II promoters identified after analyzing ten different mouse cell/tissue ChIP-seq experiments performed with RNAP-II antibody and six different human cell types. The data was acquired by a series of computational methods followed by manual correction to ensure its high level quality. In the newest version of MPromDb, about 507 million uniquely aligned RNA Pol-II ChIP-seq reads have already been analyzed from 26 different databases, including six human cell-types and 10 distinct mouse cell/tissues.|$|E
