40|$|This project {{developed}} into an installation comprising of 30 titled elements of varying status (artworks and not) for which materials, equipment and objects were borrowed, found, bought, and fabricated {{during the course}} of the residency. It became an interrogation of the gallery space, the local environment and my activities (both as an artist and in general), and was a kind of improvised, art survival exercise. For example, an early decision was not to use any source of artificial light inside the gallery. This had two effects – firstly, that light became very important to the project; secondly, that the space looked neither open nor closed to passers-by. The final elements that I installed were Art Surplus Store, where all surplus material and found / bought objects etc. (including sawdust and rubbish) were displayed in the window for sale; and Mea Culpa, graffitied along the inside top edge of the window (just out of easy reach), using highly toxic spray paint. This was a critical conclusion to my work: that, regardless of my intentions, I was dependent on unsustainable methodologies and constructs throughout. The gallery was open to the public at set times throughout the residency, and there was a closing event at the end which took place in the evening: the work gradually disappeared from view as the sun set.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of glyoxylate {{released as}} a result of ureide catabolism in the developing fruits of legumes was examined through an investigation of alanine-, glutamate- and serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in these tissues. A study of the distribution of these activities among the tissues of the developing fruits of two ureide-transporting legumes, <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and an amide-transporter, snow pea (Pisum sativum), was conducted. Serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity in each species was very low relative to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity. In all three species most of the aminotransferase activity was in the pods. In cowpea, alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity was high in the embryos relative to the seed coats, whereas in <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea the seed coats had higher activity than the embryos. Three glyoxylate aminotransferases were isolated and partially purified from extracts of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea developing fruits. These were a serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT), which primarily catalyzes the serine glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction; a glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase (GGAT), which catalyzes both the glutamate- and alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reactions; and an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT), which catalyzes the alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase reaction. Sucrose-density gradient ultracentrifugation indicated that the SGAT and GGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> fruits are located in the peroxisomes, and that the AGAT is located outside the peroxisomes, probably in the mitochondria or chloroplasts. These results confirm the existence of an alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGAT) as an enzyme distinct from the GGAT. The results of initial velocity kinetic studies of the enzymes isolated from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> and snow pea, conducted at pH 7. 1, were consistent with a Ping Pong reaction mechanism involving pyridoxal phosphate as a co-enzyme. The Km values obtained for the substrates of the enzymes were in all cases higher for the amino acid than for glyoxylate. For the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> enzymes the Km for the amino acids was about ten-fold higher than that for glyxoylate. The affinity of the snow pea enzymes for glyoxylate was less than that of the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> enzymes. Alanine--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity was associated with the GGAT and this activity was reversible, in contrast to the alanine- and glutamate-glyoxylate aminotransferase activity of this enzyme. The reversible aspartate--ketoglutarate aminotransferase activity of the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> developing fruits was not catalyzed by the glyoxylate aminotransferases. The pH optimum of the GGAT and the SGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> was approximately 8. 3. The molecular weight of the GGAT and AGAT from <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> estimated by gel filtration was 104 kDa.

40|$|Businesses {{operate in}} a world in which {{information}} is more readily and publicly available than ever before. Thanks to the development of the Internet, information on market trends, legislation, customers, suppliers, competitors, distributors, product development and almost every other conceivable topic is available at the click of a mouse. Search engines, online libraries, company websites and other sources provide information in an increasingly plentiful, easy to find, and easy to digest way. Small-scale farmers continue to sell their <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> to middlemen at throw away prices yet there are exporting companies that can buy their beans at high prices for profitability. This has been brought about by the possible missing information about the <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> marketing trends and the profitability of the crop, limited access to the necessary capital to make the switch possible, poor infrastructure necessary to bring the crops to export outlets, high risk of the export markets (for instance, from hold-up problems selling to exporters), limited human capital necessary to adopt successfully a new agricultural technology, for instance the Global Good Agricultural Practices (GlobalGAP) and Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) requirements, and misperception by researchers and policy makers about the true profit opportunities and risk of crops grown for export markets. This study was conducted to assess the impact of market intelligence systems on sales revenue of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> farmers in Ol-Donyo Sabuk of Machakos County, Kenya. To achieve this overall objective, three specific objectives were addressed, namely; (1) to establish the existing <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> marketing channels in Ol-Donyo Sabuk, (2) to compare the sales revenues of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> farmers with and without market intelligence systems, and (3) to compare return on capital for different actors within the <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> value chain. Systemic random sampling was used to select 120 farmers for this study. Data were collected through administering questionnaire for personal interviews. Data analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics such as percentages, and means to answer the stated objectives. In addition, statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse data. The study revealed that 30 percent of the 120 sampled <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> producers had access to <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> market intelligence systems, which is a small proportions of farmers compared to those who did not have access. The results revealed that 30 percent of the 120 sampled <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> producers were selling their produce as a group and had access to market intelligence systems 70 percent of the 120 sampled <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> producers not having access to market intelligence systems thus selling their produce to brokers. The results showed that group farmers selling their product to exporters had a higher return on capital as compared to individual farmers selling their produce to middlemen. xiii Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the government and other key players in the horticulture industry enhance extension services to <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> producers by training them on market intelligence systems and stringent EU market requirements in order to improve on sales revenues from the crop and subsequent return on capital. Further the government establishes a <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> value addition plant that will cater for all farmers in <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> production and a high return on capital will go to Kenya economy but not to foreigners who own most of the value addition plants. This will too provide employment to many. The brokers should be removed from the production chain because they misuse farmers making profits where they did not invest and exporters would be advised to improve on their mode of produce payment and produce rejection handling. There is need to do away with hawkers and brokers within the value chain by having binding contracts and steady markets. Based on the findings, policy implications were drawn for improvingthe quality of <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> immensely by farmers through complying with GlobalGAP right from land preparation to harvesting and adhering to stipulated MRLs, proper postharvest handling of the produce with thorough grading and subsequent proper storage...|$|R

40|$|Yields of commercially {{important}} {{crops in}} Kenya are often far below their potential. Amongst the possible reasons for such low yields {{may be the}} ecosystem degradation that {{can be expected to}} have negative impacts on pollinator presence in cropland, and the consequent food security issue for smallholder farmers who depend on these crops for their livelihood. Our study was carried out to assess the potential pollination deficit of <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), a major export vegetable crop in Kenya grown by small-scale farmers. Sufficient pollination of <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> likely results in high seed set and uniform heavier green pods. Such pods get the highest grade while malformed pods are unmarketable, reducing family income. We hypothesized that pollination success was linked to the abundance and diversity of large pollinators, itself associated with the proximity to natural habitats. Flower visitors to <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> were sampled in 2011 and 2012 in ten farmer-managed plots, five within 200 m from the edge of Mt. Kenya forest and five farther away, more than 1000 m. Each plot measured 760 m 2 and was planted at the same time, with the “Julia” variety. Flowers were observed for 2 h in each plot once weekly for three weeks at peak flowering from 0900 - 1100 h in the morning and 1200 – 1400 h in the afternoon on alternate days. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) were the most abundant visitors of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> flowers followed by carpenter bees (Xylocopa spp.) and leafcutter bees (Megachile spp.). Significantly higher numbers of leafcutter bees were recorded on farms far to the forest. There {{was no significant difference in}} honey bee abundance among the study sites, probably because apiaries and wild colonies are located across the landscape. <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> yield was significantly correlated with the mean abundance of carpenter bees in 2011. This suggests the possible occurrence of pollination deficit in <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> where the density of carpenter bees is insufficient, which was reflected by the high variability of yields in the farmland.

There were significantly more F. schultzei than F. occidentalis in lettuce and tomato, and significantly more F. occidentalis than F. schultzei in <b>French</b> <b>beans.</b> Zucchini supported the highest abundance of both species, with no significant difference in mean abundance. Both species displayed similar preferences for different plant parts, with significantly more in flowers compared to leaf and stem and growing tip samples. There were significantly more thrips in female zucchini flowers compared to male flowers. Thrips were present in small numbers one week after planting in all crops, with peak abundance at flowering. F. occidentalis were temporally segregated by crop age (weeks since planting), with significantly higher levels present in zucchini compared to <b>French</b> <b>bean,</b> lettuce and tomato between weeks three and six, followed by significantly higher levels in <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> between weeks eight and ten.

There have been other assertions that it is a form of lablab but horticultural consensus places it simply as variety of Phaseolus vulgaris, closely related to <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> and haricot beans.|$|R
40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} cultural, morphological and pathogenic variability among Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli strains isolated from <b>French</b> <b>beans.</b> Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methodology: The <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> showing Fusarium wilt symptoms {{were obtained from}} different fields in Kabaa irrigation scheme in Machakos County, Kenya. The diseased plants were washed and cut into 5 mm pieces which were surface sterilized before plating on Fusarium-selective medium. They were incubated for 10 days at 25 - 26 °C. The developing colonies were transferred on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), Carnation Leaf Agar (CLA) and Spezieller Nahrstoffarmer Agar (SNA) media for cultural and morphological characterization. Pathogenicity was assessed using on <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> ‘Amy’ variety. Results: From 84 Fusarium isolates obtained, 18 were confirmed to be F. oxysporum from which 8 were confirmed to be F. oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli (Fop). Variations existed cultural and morphological variations among the 8 isolates. Isolates showed luxuriant, moderately luxuriant and scanty aerial mycelial growth. Mycelial texture was either fluffy or fibrous. Isolate Fop 8 had the highest growth at 85 mm at 7 th day followed by Fop 3 (84 mm) and Fop 6 (84 mm) while Fop 7 had the least growth at 71 mm. The colony colour was purple, pink or white. Microconidia sizes ranged from 8 X 3. 0 to 10 X 3. 4 µm while macroconidia ranged from 28 X 3. 8 to 42 X 4. 2 µm. Macroconidia had 3 septa. The microconidia were abundant and aseptate. Chlamydospore formation was terminal and intercalary, occurring in singles and in pairs. Although all the 8 isolates were pathogenic on ‘Amy’ <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> variety, their pathogenic potential was significantly different (P< 0. 01). The most pathogenic isolate was Fop 03, followed by Fop 06 and Fop 07 at means of 97. 0, 92. 4 and 92. 0 %, respectively. The least pathogenic isolate was Fop 05 {{with a mean of}} 65. 9 % pathogenicity. Conclusion: The isolates in this study are culturally and morphologically varied and have high pathogenicity on <b>French</b> <b>bean...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Green {{beans are}} the unripe, young fruit and {{protective}} pods of various cultivars {{of the common}} bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Immature or young pods of the runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus), yardlong bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis), and hyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus) are used in a similar way. Green beans are known by many common names, including <b>French</b> <b>beans,</b> string beans, snap beans, and snaps.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Yields of commercially {{important}} {{crops in}} Kenya are often far below their potential. Amongst the possible reasons for such low yields {{may be the}} ecosystem degradation that {{can be expected to}} have negative impacts on pollinator presence in cropland, and the consequent food security issue for smallholder farmers who depend on these crops for their livelihood. Our study was carried out to assess the potential pollination deficit of <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), a major export vegetable crop in Kenya grown by small-scale farmers. Sufficient pollination of <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> likely results in high seed set and uniform heavier green pods. Such pods get the highest grade while malformed pods are unmarketable, reducing family income. We hypothesized that pollination success was linked to the abundance and diversity of large pollinators, itself associated with the proximity to natural habitats. Flower visitors to <b>French</b> <b>beans</b> were sampled in 2011 and 2012 in ten farmer-managed plots, five within 200 m from the edge of Mt. Kenya forest and five farther away, more than 1000 m. Each plot measured 760 m 2 and was planted at the same time, with the “Julia ” variety. Flowers were observed for 2 h in each plot once weekly for three weeks at peak flowering from 0900 - 1100 h in the morning and 1200 – 1400 h in the afternoon on alternate days. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) were the most abundant visitors of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> flowers followed by carpenter bees (Xylocopa spp.) and leafcutter bees (Megachile spp.). Significantly higher numbers of leafcutter bees were recorded on farm...|$|R
40|$|Endopeptidase {{activity}} increases continually in pods of maturing {{fruits of}} <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv Goldstar) plants and {{is thought to}} participate in the protein mobilization in pods during the development of seeds (M. Endo, T. Minamikawa, D. Yamauchi, W. Mitsuhashi [1987] J Exp Bot 38 : 1988 - 1995). In the present studies, one of the major endopeptidase forms, designated EP-C 1, was purified as a 34 -kD polypeptide from pods of maturing <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> fruits. EP-C 1 was found to be immunologically distinguished from other forms in extracts from pods, but homologous to SH-EP, the major cysteine endopeptidase expressed in cotyledons of germinating Vigna mungo seeds (W. Mitsuhashi, T. Minamikawa [1989] Plant Physiol 89 : 274 - 279). The level of endopeptidase that reacted with the antiserum to EP-C 1 increased in pods as the fruit maturation proceeded. EP-C 1 was also immunologically detected in stems of <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> plants bearing fruits of later maturation stages. Protein immunoblotting showed that a 34 -kD polypeptide corresponding to EP-C 1 in molecular mass occurred in extracts from 7 - to 9 -d cotyledons of germinating <b>French</b> <b>bean</b> seeds. In addition, two other polypeptides with slightly higher molecular masses were observed in extracts from 3 - to 5 -d cotyledons. We suggest that these two polypeptides are intermediates involved in posttranslational processing of EP-C 1. RNA blot hybridization with EP-C 1 cDNA as a probe showed that EP-C 1 mRNA occurred in pods of fruits at later maturing stages and also in cotyledons of 3 - to 7 -d germinating seeds...|$|R
