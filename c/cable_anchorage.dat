The western crossing between Yerba Buena and downtown San Francisco has two complete suspension spans connected at a center anchorage. Rincon Hill is the western anchorage and touch-down for the San Francisco landing of the Brown bridge connected by three shorter truss spans. The eastern crossing, between Yerba Buena Island and Oakland, was a cantilever bridge with a double-tower span, five medium truss spans, and a 14-section truss causeway.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{connection}} details used for <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> blocks on cable-stayed bridges have the potential for fatigue damage due to fluctuating stresses generated by the cyclic traffic loads passing over the bridge. To investigate the fatigue damage and determine the remaining fatigue life of a <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> block used on a cable-stayed bridge, finite element (FE) analyses were undertaken by using the Fatigue Load Model 4 (FLM 4) proposed by the Eurocodes to identify the most fatigue-critical locations within the details. One of the main objectives of this research was to identify the critical area prone to fatigue in the anchorage block due to the response in traffic loads. Therefore, two types of numerical models of a typical <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> block were analysed as a three dimensional sub-model which was driven by global cable forces obtained from the global analysis of a three-span cable-stayed bridge. These models are of the <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> block without the longitudinal girder modelled and the <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> block with the longitudinal girder modelled. The <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> blocks without the longitudinal girder model were classified into three categories of model types namely; model types 0, A and B. Similarly, the <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> blocks with the longitudinal girder model were classified as model types A-G, B-G and C-G. These model classifications are based on several boundary conditions simulated in the analyses. In addition to this, the fatigue behaviour of the <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> block was analysed by using three different approaches namely; by using the nodal stresses at the location of the stress concentration (node stress concentration), by using a stress averaged over an area {{in the vicinity of the}} stress concentration (average elements) and by using the hot-spot method, in order to identify the stress ranges that adversely affect the remaining fatigue life of cable anchorages. Each approach was analysed with three different mesh sizes; 5 mm by 5 mm, 10 mm by 10 mm and 20 mm by 20 mm in order to carry out a mesh sensitivity analysis of the resulting stresses and associated stress ranges. The 10 mm by 10 mm mesh size was found to be most appropriate for this fatigue appraisal. This finding is supported because the 10 mm by 10 mm mesh size is specified in several code of practices such as the International Institute of Welding (IIW) and BS 7608 as guidance for use when determining hot-spot stress when using the hot-spot method for the fatigue analyses of a welded detail. The critical stresses from model type C-G were used in the fatigue appraisal as the behaviour of this model represented more accurately the actual <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> block on the cable-stayed bridge compared to the other types of models used. Model type C-G were selected for further fatigue appraisal as this model include the correct boundary conditions and applied load that represented the actual condition of the anchorage behaviour on the cable-stayed bridge. This included the movement of the top anchorage block due to the displacement of the cable and in addition the deck movement. Also, non-uniform pressure was applied on the bearing plate which was included to model possible construction tolerances which was one of the important properties of the model type C-G. In evaluating the possible fatigue damage in the <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> block, the cumulative model for fatigue failure expressed in terms of Miner’s rule was used. In addition to this, the condition of the structural detail due to fatigue with increasing traffic loading was determined by projecting traffic volume increases of up to 20...|$|E

40|$|Cable-net {{supported}} {{glass facade}} systems that comprise of pre-stressed cable-net, glass panes and glass support attachments; {{are commonly used}} in airport terminals, hotel lobbies, and trade centres. Glass used in building facade presents an aesthetic feature as well as contributes to the structural stiffness of the whole structural system of the building. In this research, the performance of cable-net supported glass facade systems was investigated via experiments and finite element analysis using the Abaqus v 6. 9 software. Two generic configurations of cable-net system were considered, namely flat and curved cable-net system, both with and without glass panes. For the curved cable-nets, two different curvatures were considered. Each system was subjected to three tests: static, impact and <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> failure test. The {{results indicated that the}} glass panes made significant contributions to the stiffness of the whole structural system. The glass stiffness contribution for flat cable-net system was high at the early stage of loading (approximately 30 %) but reduced when the load was increased. However, the glass stiffness contribution for curved cable-net increased gradually as the load was increased. For both configurations, the glass stiffness contribution remained steady at about 20 % of the whole structural stiffness as the cables in the cable-net stiffened until the maximum load was applied to the system. Based on the static tests, the pre-stress force in the cables in the cable-net systems can possibly be reduced by approximately 50 % of the initial pre-stress force; should the glass be considered in the analysis design of cable-net structure. Moreover, the curved cable-net could be designed to have lower pre-stress force in cables compared to that of flat cable-net to meet the deflection criterion of the cable-net structure. Consequently, in the impact test, the glass supported by cable-net structure was deflected at the same level as the cable-net when subjected to impact force. Although the deflection of cable-net is large, the deflection of individual glass was very shallow compared to the allowable deflection of glass pane. Despite the cable-net structure having the capability in reducing the impact force on the glass pane, it has no capability to prevent glass breakage when the impact hit the glass at its edge. Another effect of impact test was the corner node of the cable-net structure had almost the same deflection when the ball bearing hit the glass at the centre of glass facade; although it was found to be very stiff in the static test. The corner node was deflected excessively although the impact was farther from the node. The sudden failure of <b>cable</b> <b>anchorage</b> had no dramatic effects such as progressive collapse or glass breakage even though the cable forces in the curved cable-net oscillated about ± 20 % of the initial pre-stressed force. Finite element (FE) models were developed for flat cable-nets with and without glass panes using the Abaqus v 6. 9 software. The FE results were in good agreement with the experimental results with only 1 % difference between the two sets of results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is an {{advanced}} composite material with {{the advantages of}} high strength, lightweight, no corrosion and excellent fatigue resistance. Therefore, unidirectional CFRP has great potential for cables and to replace steel cables in cable structures. However, CFRP is a typical orthotropic material and its strength and modulus perpendicular to the fiber direction are much lower {{than those in the}} fiber direction, which brings a challenge for anchoring CFRP cables. This paper presents an overview of application of CFRP cables in cable structures, including historical review, state of the art and prospects for the future. After introducing properties of carbon fibers, mechanical characteristics and structural forms of CFRP cables, existing CFRP cable structures in the world (all of them are cable bridges) are reviewed. Especially, their CFRP <b>cable</b> <b>anchorages</b> are presented in detail. New applications for CFRP cables, i. e., cable roofs and cable facades, are also presented, including the introduction of a prototype CFRP cable roof and the conceptual design of a novel structure—CFRP Continuous Band Winding System.

40|$|Controlling {{excessive}} vibrations of {{stay cables}} on cable-stayed bridges {{is important to}} minimize the fatigue failure and damage at the <b>cable</b> <b>anchorages.</b> Using cross-ties to connect a vulnerable cable with its neighbors to form a cable network and installing external damper to a cable {{have been widely used}} in field. More recently, the idea of adding damper to an existing network to form a hybrid system was also proposed. Though the stiffening effect of the cross-tie solution are widely studied by numerous researchers, the damping property of a network has rarely been investigated. Also, the available studies on the hybrid system are very limited. In the present work, experimental study was carried out to investigate the modal behavior of a cable network in terms of its first modal frequency and damping. The efficiency of the damper-only solution and hybrid system solution with different configurations were also examined and the results were compared. Then, an independent finite element simulation was conducted. The two sets of results agree well. They both indicate that the cross-tie solution improves the stiffness of the target cable, the damper-only solution enhances its energy dissipation, and the hybrid system increases both the stiffness and the damping of the target cable...|$|R
