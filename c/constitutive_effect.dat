Although the 2004 {{draft of the}} new Civil code stipulated a retroactive (declarative) effect for the inheritance partition, the Amending Commission preferred to formulate the legal effects of partition in this way: each co owner (coheir) becomes the exclusive owner of the assets or, as the case, of the sums of money that were assigned starting only the day established in the partition act, but not before {{the day of the}} concluding of the act in case of voluntary partition or, as the case, from the date of the final court decision.

This article, partly a follow up of the authors' frequently cited 2000 Human Relations article, provides a critical and perhaps provocative overview of some of the more recent work and tendencies within the field. It is argued that discourse continues to be used in vague and all-embracing ways, where the <b>constitutive</b> <b>effects</b> of discourse are taken for granted rather than problematized and explored. The article identifies three particular problems prevalent in the current organizational discourse literature: reductionism, overpacking, and colonization and suggests three analytical strategies to overcome these problems: counter-balancing concepts - aiming to avoid seeing 'everything' as discourse - relativizing muscularity - being more open about discourse's <b>constitutive</b> <b>effects</b> - and disconnecting discourse and Discourse through much more disciplined use of discourse vocabulary...|$|R

The inspectorate’s prevalent search for ‘equivalent judgements’ and the high stakes nature of inspectors’ judgement making give rise to complicated professional dilemmas and what Peter Dahler-Larsen labels <b>constitutive</b> <b>effects.</b> Inspectors struggle with their judgements and seek to merge programmatic and technical elements within the current model of regular supervision with their accumulated professional experience.

40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility {{is not a}} new concept. Indeed, it {{has become}} a growing {{scientific}} field creating multiple theories and approaches. Yet different approaches use different terminology making it difficult to define the concept and explain why MNCs participate in CSR initiatives at all. To solve this problem International Relations theory offers a series of useful tools. One of these tools which until recently has not been used to research CSR are international norms and their <b>constitutive</b> <b>effect</b> on actors. Therefore, this paper discusses CSR in the light of international norms. Following the works of Searle and Winch on the <b>constitutive</b> <b>effect</b> of norms, this paper argues that all actors (including MNCs) are “social actors ” with an endogenously constructed identity. CSR and private self-regulation can no longer be exclusively explained in terms of profit and instrumental motivation. Instead, norms constitutively influence the identity and the behavior of MNCs and therefore become an ideational driving force for CSR. This theoretical argument is empirically illustrated by the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPs). Negotiated by both states, NGOs and MNCs, the VPs were announced in December 2000 and define the relation between the safety of companies and the protection of human rights in potentially dangerous areas. Within this initiative norms have influenced the identity and the action of MNCs and thus became an explanation of CSR...|$|E

The interviewed teachers emphasised the importance of internal evaluations performed close to daily teaching practice and jointly with students and colleagues. These evaluations are generally overlooked in evaluation and school-policy research and seldom attended to or appreciated by school providers. Further, teachers were critical of and reported several negative consequences of accountability and external evaluations, but still generally complied by participating in them.

Local decision makers have learned to navigate the web of evaluations and developed response strategies to manage external evaluations and {{to take into account}} what can be useful and what cannot be overlooked in order to avoid sanctions. The study shows that in contexts with high issue polarisation, such as schooling, the use of evaluation differs between the political majority and opposition, and relates to how schools perform in national comparisons and school inspections. Responses to external evaluations follow the same pattern. Some key performance indicators from the National Agency of Education and the School Inspectorate affect local school governance in that they define what is important in education, and reinforce the norm that benchmarking is natural and worthwhile, indicating <b>constitutive</b> <b>effects</b> of national evaluation systems.

Institutionalists and Rationalists treat state preferences as fixed and emphasize the influence of IO memberships on interstate bargaining. In this view, IOs act as constraints, because while they help states negotiate more efficiently (with fewer costs 2 ̆ 6 greater information), they do not significantly alter states’ preferences.

40|$|This thesis {{engages in}} a {{critique}} of the concept of Australian native title law as a 'recognition space'. It doing so, it treats native title law as a form of identity politics, the courts a forum in which claims for the recognition of identity are made. An overview of multicultural theories of recognition exposes what is signified by the use of recognition discourse and situates this rhetoric in political and theoretical context. A critique of native title recognition discourse is then developed by reference to the insights of sociolegal scholarship, critical theory, critical anthropology and legal pluralism. These critiques suggest that legal recognition is affective and effective. This thesis highlights native title law's false assumptions as to cultural coherence and subject stasis by exploring law's demands and indigenous claimant engagement with these demands. In this analysis, law's <b>constitutive</b> <b>effect</b> is emphasized. However, a radical constructivist approach is eschewed, subject engagement explored and agency located in the limits of law's constitutive power. The effects of legal recognition discourse, its productive and enabling aspects, are considered best understood by reference to Butler's notion of provisional 'performativity'. Ultimately, claimant 'victories' of resistance and subversion are considered not insignificant, but are defined as temporary and symbolic by virtue of the structural context in which they occur...|$|E

Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider the environmental measures as quantitative variables, but rather as factors in multi-environment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasted temperature and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and heat constraints in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G x E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive (G), G x D, G x H and G x H x D, and were analysed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasted responses to heat and drought constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviours of two strong Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) previously associated with yield components. This analysis confirmed the <b>constitutive</b> <b>effect</b> of chromosome 1 B QTL, and explained the G x E interaction of chromosome 3 B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises.

Classical social psychological work often quantitatively structures this phenomenon in a predictable linear relationship. In contrast, poststructural scholarship draws on qualitative approaches to claim the malleable and multiple dynamics behind the phenomenon. The two schools oppose but complement each other. Nevertheless, both schools struggle to capture the detailed and nuanced construction of ethnic identity through Heritage Language learning. Different from the extant research, we make an attempt to ethno-methodologically unearth the nuisances and predicaments embedded in the reflexive, subtle, and multi-layered identity constructions through nuanced, inter-nested language practices. Drawing on data from the qualitative phase of a large project, we highlight some small but powerful moments abstracted from the interview accounts of five Chinese Australian young people. Firstly, we zoom in on the life politics behind the ‘seen but unnoticed’ stereotype that looking Chinese means being able to speak Chinese. Secondly, we speculate the power relations between the speaker and the listener through the momentary and inadvertent breaches of the taken-for-granted stereotype. Next, we unveil how learning Chinese has become an accountably rational priority for these young Chinese Australians. Finally, we argue that the normalised stereotype becomes visible and hence stable when it is breached – a practical accomplishment that we term ‘habitus realisation’...|$|E

40|$|Plant root {{architecture}} is highly responsive {{to changes in}} nutrient availability. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the adaptability of root systems to changing environmental conditions is poorly understood. A screen for abnormal root architecture responses to high nitrate in the growth medium was carried out for a population of ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The growth and root architecture of the arm (for anion altered root morphology) mutant described here was similar to wild-type plants when grown on low to moderate nitrate concentrations, but on high nitrate, arm exhibited reduced primary root elongation, radial swelling, increased numbers of lateral roots, and increased root hair density {{when compared to the}} wild-type control. High concentrations of chloride and sucrose induced the same phenotype. In contrast, hypocotyl elongation in the dark was decreased independently of nitrate availability. Positional cloning identified a point mutation in the AtCTL 1 gene that encodes a chitinase-related protein, although molecular and biochemical analysis showed that this protein does not possess chitinase enzymatic activity. CTL 1 appears to play two roles in plant growth and development based on the <b>constitutive</b> <b>effect</b> of the arm mutation on primary root growth and its conditional impact on root architecture. We hypothesize that CTL 1 plays a role in determining cell wall rigidity and that the activity is differentially regulated by pathways that are triggered by environmental conditions. Moreover, we show that mutants of some subunits of the cellulose synthase complex phenocopy the conditional effect on root architecture under nonpermissive conditions, suggesting they are also differentially regulated in response to a changing environment. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

The landscape of powerful social institutions {{in which a}} movement is situated affects which tactics become dominant among these organizations (and thus, within the movement) and which tactics are sidelined, discredited, or not even considered. The mainstream media {{is one example of}} a social institution that may have such a <b>constitutive</b> <b>effect</b> on social movements. When the mainstream news media – conceptualized here as a journalistic field – produce more substantial coverage of a given movement tactic, they may increase the tactic’s legitimacy, permitting organizations that perform the tactic to occupy a more dominant position within the movement. In this paper, I analyze media coverage of LGBT movement activity in a sample of mainstream newspapers from 1985 - 2008 to examine whether, in its coverage of the movement for LGBT rights, the mainstream media have focused on the LGBT movement’s legal tactics, organizations, and framing, and have downplayed other types of movement tactics and framing. This paper expands upon empirical studies from the communications and sociolegal literatures, which find that litigation often attracts publicity, whereas protest activity rarely receives any substantive news coverage. The data presented here will likely have implications for the new, multi-institutional approach to social movement theory. They should help to clarify the ways in which tactics, when amplified by media coverage, influence the ascendancy of specific strategies and organizations within a social movement...|$|E

Starting from different F 4 families, {{two pairs of}} near isogenic lines (NILs) were developed at root-yield- 1. 06. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate root-yield- 1. 06 effects across different water regimes, genetic backgrounds, and inbreeding levels. The NILs per se and their crosses with Lo 1016 and Lo 964 were tested in 2008 and 2009 near to Bologna, with the well-watered (WW) and water-stressed (WS) treatments providing, on average, 70 mm and 35 mm of water, respectively. For NILs per se, the interactions QTL 3 water regime and QTL 3 family were negligible in most cases; the QTL additive effects across families were significant for several traits, especially root clump weight. For NILs crosses, analogously to NILs per se, the interactions were generally negligible and the additive effects across water regimes and families were significant for most traits, especially grain yield.
