60|$|Intoxicating Fish.--Lime {{thrown into}} a pond will kill the fish; and the similar but far more {{energetic}} properties of <b>Cocculus</b> <b>Indicus</b> are well known. Throughout tropical Africa and in South America, the natives catch fish by poisoning them. Dams are made, which, when the river is very low, Enclose deep pools of water with no current; into these the poison is thrown: it intoxicates the fish, which float and are taken by the hand.|$|E
6000|$|Now it {{is worth}} remarking, that it is Shelley's form of fever, rather than Byron's, which has been of late years the {{prevailing}} epidemic. Since Shelley's poems have become known in England, and a timid public, after approaching in fear and trembling the fountain which was understood to be poisoned, has begun first to sip, and then, finding the magic water at all events sweet enough, to quench its thirst with unlimited draughts, Byron's fiercer wine has lost favour. Well--at least {{the taste of the}} age is more refined, if that be matter of congratulation. And there is an excuse for preferring champagne to waterside porter, heady with grains of paradise and quassia, salt and <b>cocculus</b> <b>indicus.</b> Nevertheless, worse ingredients than oenanthic acid may lurk in the delicate draught, and the Devil's Elixir may be made fragrant, and sweet, and transparent enough, as French moralists well know, for the most fastidious palate. The private sipping of eua-de-cologne, say the London physicians, has increased mightily of late; and so has the reading of Shelley. It is not surprising. Byron's Corsairs and Laras have been, on the whole, impossible during the thirty years' peace! and piracy and profligacy are at all times, and especially nowadays, expensive amusements, and often require a good private fortune--rare among poets. They have, therefore, been wisely abandoned as ideals, except among a few young persons, who used to wear turn-down collars, and are now attempting moustaches and Mazzini hats. But even among them, and among their betters--rather their more-respectables--nine-tenths of the bad influence which is laid at Byron's door really is owing to Shelley. Among the many good-going gentlemen and ladies, Byron is generally spoken of with horror--he is [...] "so wicked," [...] forsooth; while poor Shelley, [...] "poor dear Shelley," [...] is [...] "very wrong, of course," [...] but [...] "so refined," [...] "so beautiful," [...] "so tender"--a fallen angel, while Byron is a satyr and a devil. We boldly deny the verdict. Neither of the two are devils; as for angels, when we have seen one, we shall be better able to give an opinion; at present, Shelley is in our eyes far less like one of those old Hebrew and Miltonic angels, fallen or unfallen, than Byron is. And as for the satyr; the less that is said for Shelley, on that point, the better. If Byron sinned more desperately and flagrantly than he, it was done under the temptations of rank, wealth, disappointed love, and under the impulses of an animal nature, to which Shelley's passions were ...|$|E

5000|$|Although poisonous, hard multum is a {{preparation}} {{made from}} <b>Cocculus</b> <b>Indicus,</b> etc., once used (by 19th century brewers) to impart a more intoxicating quality ("giddiness") to beer than {{provided by the}} alcoholic content alone. [...] Charles Dickens referred to those engaging in such practices as [...] "brewers and beer-sellersof low degree,... who {{do not understand the}} wholesome policy ofselling wholesome beverage." [...] Although appearing in many homeopathic volumes and at least two brewers' guides, the use of such preparations was outlawed in England, during the mid-19th century, with fines of £500 for sale and £200 for use of the drug.|$|E
5000|$|In 1875, {{his book}} Thrift was published. In it, {{he said that}} [...] "riches do not {{constitute}} any claim to distinction. It is only the vulgar who admire riches as riches". He claimed that the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 was [...] "one {{of the most valuable}} that has been placed on the statute-book in modern times". He also criticised laissez-faire: When typhus or cholera breaks out, they tell us that Nobody is to blame. That terrible Nobody! How much he has to answer for. More mischief is done by Nobody than by all the world besides. Nobody adulterates our food. Nobody poisons us with bad drink. Nobody supplies us with foul water. Nobody spreads fever in blind alleys and unswept lanes. Nobody leaves towns undrained. Nobody fills gaols, penitentiaries, and convict stations. Nobody makes poachers, thieves, and drunkards. Nobody has a theory too—a dreadful theory. It is embodied in two words—Laissez faire—Let alone. When people are poisoned by plaster of Paris mixed with flour, [...] "Let alone" [...] is the remedy. When <b>Cocculus</b> <b>indicus</b> is used instead of hops, and men die prematurely, it is easy to say, [...] "Nobody did it." [...] Let those who can, find out when they are cheated: Caveat emptor. When people live in foul dwellings, let them alone. Let wretchedness do its work; do not interfere with death.|$|E
40|$|Pensacola Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) is a {{valuable}} method to analyse symptoms evoked by exposure to a flight simulator environment that can also be adopted {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of preventive tools, aiming at reducing simulator sickness (SS). In this study we analysed SSQ data in subjects undergoing a standard ground based spatial disorientation training inside a flight simulator, in order to evaluate the SS prevention obtained with two different pharmacological tools. Twelve males volunteers participated to an experimental design based on a double-blind, balanced administration of either 30  mg cinnarizine (CIN), or <b>Cocculus</b> <b>Indicus</b> 6 CH (COC), or placebo (PLC) before one trial of about one hour spent inside a spatial disorientation trainer. All subjects underwent the three different conditions (CIN, COC, PLC) during 3 non-consecutive days separated by at least 2  weeks. During each experimental day, all subjects filled in SSQ. In addition, both postural instability (with the use of a static stabilometric platform), and sleepiness symptoms were evaluated. All the tests were performed before and after the simulated flight, at different times, in one-and-half-hour intervals. Results indicated a strong increase of sickness after flight simulation that linearly decreased, showing pre-simulator scores after 1. 30  hours. In contrast to both PLC and COC, CIN showed significant side effects immediately following flight simulation, with no benefit at the simultaneous SSQ scores. Globally, no highly significant differences between COC and PLC were observed, although a minor degree of postural instability could be detected after COC administration. As far as the present exposure to a simulator environment is concerned, none of the pharmacological tools administered in this study resulted effective in reducing SS symptoms as detected by the SSQ. Moreover, CIN significantly increased sleepiness and postural instability in most subjects. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
