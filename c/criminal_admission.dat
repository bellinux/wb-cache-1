40|$|Informants {{who report}} admissions to crime can be {{powerful}} and dangerous {{players in the}} criminal justice system. Some informants, such as jailhouse informants, are considered deceitful, in part because they can receive incentives to report criminal admissions. However, little research has examined the nature of information that informants provide. In particular, no recent published research has examined whether there are valid behavioural cues that distinguish deceptive from truthful informants. In addition, no published study to date has explored whether informants’ reports and demeanours are affected by the incentives that they receive. Participants in this study either did or did not hear a <b>criminal</b> <b>admission</b> and then were interviewed one week later about details of the admission they had allegedly heard. Some participants were offered an incentive to report the <b>criminal</b> <b>admission</b> in a way that appeared accurate and forthcoming. The {{results of this study suggest}} that there may be behavioural cues emitted during the reporting of criminal admissions that distinguish truthful from deceptive informants. However, the direction of differences for some cues may deviate from other types of witnesses to crime. In addition, the findings of this study indicate that being offered an incentive may induce informants to emit cues during the reporting of criminal admissions that make them appear more truthful, regardless of whether or not they are actually telling the truth. The findings of this study raise concerns about whether informants’ honesty should be assessed in the same way as other witnesses, and about potentially negative consequences of offering incentives to informants in exchange for their reports of criminal admissions...|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, a McClatchy {{investigation}} {{found that the}} NRO was possibly breaching ethical and legal boundaries by encouraging its polygraph examiners to extract personal and private information from DoD personnel during polygraph tests that were purported {{to be limited to}} counterintelligence issues. [...] Allegations of abusive polygraph practices were brought forward by former NRO polygraph examiners. [...] In 2014, an inspector generals' report concluded that NRO failed to report felony admissions of child sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities. NRO obtained these <b>criminal</b> <b>admissions</b> during polygraph testing but never forwarded the information to police. NRO's failure to act in the public interest by reporting child sexual predators was first made public in 2012 by former NRO polygraph examiners.|$|R

An additional requirement must be met where statements are made in the course of negotiations for the settlement of a dispute, in that such statements cannot be disclosed without the consent of both parties. In <b>criminal</b> matters, an <b>admission</b> must be proved to have been made voluntarily before it can be admitted into evidence.|$|R

Instances when <b>criminal</b> history gains <b>admission</b> are divided into two categories: admissibility regardless of the trial tactics of the defense and admissibility due to the trial tactics of the defense. The principles of evidence stated in the article are North Carolina rules with frequent footnote reference to the corresponding Federal Rules of Evidence...|$|R
40|$|As {{more and}} more of our lives are taken over by {{automated}} decision making systems (whether it be for hiring, college <b>admissions,</b> <b>criminal</b> justice or loans), we have begun to ask whether these systems are making decisions that humans would consider fair, or non-discriminatory. The problem is that notions of fairness, discrimination, transparency and accountability are concepts in society and the law that have no obvious formal analog. But our algorithms speak the language of mathematics. And so if we want to encode our beliefs into automated decision systems, we must formalize them precisely, while still capturing the natural imprecision and ambiguity in these ideas. In this talk, I 2 ̆ 7 ll survey the new field of fairness, accountability and transparency in computer science. I 2 ̆ 7 ll focus on how we formalize these notions, how they connect to traditional notions in theoretical computer science, and even describe some impossibility results that arise from this formalization. I 2 ̆ 7 ll conclude with some open questions...|$|R
40|$|Problem and Purpose: This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of addiction among female patients of two clinics located in Atlanta metropolitan area: (1) The Midtown Intake and Treatment Center, (2) The Synthesis West Treatment Center. The main variables in this study are as follows: a. Personal characteristics such as: age, education, marital status. b. Behavioral characteristics such as: age at first drug experience, <b>criminal</b> behavior, <b>admission</b> status. c. Family background such as: socioeconomic status of parents, family disorganization and drug dependency, and place of residence. This study was designed to investigate and describe specific aspects of the variables mentioned above about the female heroin addict and {{to determine whether or not}} the information agrees with the previous researches. Procedures The data were obtained by administration of a questionnaire to fourty-six female patients of the two mentioned clinics. The paper discusses data collection procedures, results, scope of the study, findings and finally, suggestions for further study. Results In most of the areas, the findings agree with the previous researches. Important findings with respect to the family background are the following: 1. Most of the respondents 2 ̆ 7 fathers are skilled or semiskilled workers. 2. A large proportion of respondents have been raised in families living in urban areas. 3. Respondents have been raised often in families in which at least one member of them had a history of drug or alcohol use. Important finding relating to personal characteristics are the following: 1. Females have become addicts at earlier ages in more recent years. In fact, most had their first drug experience between ages 13 to 18 years. 2. Most of the respondents have high school level of education but a good number of them become dropouts. 3. Respondents seem to have more stable marriages than their parents. Important findings relating to behavioral characteristics: 1. First drug experience was experienced with friends. 2. A good number of respondents admitted that they committed a crime during their heroin addiction and most of them categorized their crime as prostitution. 3. More than 80 percent of respondents voluntarily committed themselves to the clinics for treatment...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the {{interpretation and application}} of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (UK), Part 11 Chapter 1, which came into force on 15 December 2004. Part 11 Chapter 1 concerns evidence of bad character, a concept approximately comparable with common law similar fact evidence, in relation to all parties who may be connected with a <b>criminal</b> trial. The <b>admission</b> and use of similar fact evidence has often {{been the subject of}} controversy, and the significant changes made by the CJA 2003 have attracted their own body of support and criticism. The nine chapters of this thesis attempt an in-depth study into the impact of the legislation on the robustness and effectiveness of the criminal trial, and consider whether the criminal trial is suited to the level of exposure of bad character now facilitated by the CJA. In particular, the thesis focuses upon the key provisions governing the uses of bad character evidence of the defendant: the seven gateways set out in s 101 of the CJA. The operation of those gateways and their accompanying explanatory provisions is examined through a combination of engagement with the Law Commission’s Report 273 (which preceded the enactment of the legislation), the range of Court of Appeal cases dealing with the legislation, and academic commentary. It was foreshadowed by commentators and early case law that the new provisions might not be easy to interpret or apply, and subsequent cases have borne out this prediction. An analysis of the bad character provisions suggests that, even though the CJA was intended to provide clarity in regulation, it has itself led to confusion in some important respects. Certain central terms lack definition, and some provisions have unintended consequences. The case law reflects this in its frequent, often brief, and sometimes inconsistent analysis of the specific parts of the legislation, which can make it difficult to determine the defendant’s guilt or innocence in a precise and scrupulous manner. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
