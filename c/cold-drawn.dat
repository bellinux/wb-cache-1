6000|$|The {{commercial}} college was a fine, roomy establishment, pleasantly situate among woods. The air was healthy, the food excellent, the premium high. Electric wires connected it (to {{use the words}} of the prospectus) with [...] "the various world centres." [...] The reading-room was well supplied with [...] "commercial organs." [...] The talk was that of Wall Street; and the pupils (from fifty to a hundred lads) were principally engaged in rooking or trying to rook one another for nominal sums in what was called [...] "college paper." [...] We had class hours, indeed, in the morning, when we studied German, French, book-keeping, and the like goodly matters; but the bulk of our day and the gist of the education centred in the exchange, where we were taught to gamble in produce and securities. Since not one of the participants possessed a bushel of wheat or a dollar's worth of stock, legitimate business was of course impossible from the beginning. It was <b>cold-drawn</b> gambling, without colour or disguise. Just that which is the impediment and destruction of all genuine commercial enterprise, just that we were taught with every luxury of stage effect. Our simulacrum of a market was ruled by the real markets outside, so that we might experience the course and vicissitude of prices. We must keep books, and our ledgers were overhauled at the month's end by the principal or his assistants. To add a spice of verisimilitude, [...] "college paper" [...] (like poker chips) had an actual marketable value. It was bought for each pupil by anxious parents and guardians at the rate of one cent for the dollar. The same pupil, when his education was complete, resold, at the same figure, so much as was left him to the college; and {{even in the midst of}} his curriculum, a successful operator would sometimes realise a proportion of his holding, and stand a supper on the sly in the neighbouring hamlet.

50|$|Season {{cracking}} {{is a form}} of {{stress-corrosion cracking}} of brass cartridge cases originally reported from British forces in India. During the monsoon season, military activity was temporarily reduced, and ammunition was stored in stables until the dry weather returned. Many brass cartridges were subsequently found to be cracked, especially where the case was crimped to the bullet. It was not until 1921 that the phenomenon was explained by Moor, Beckinsale and Mallinson: ammonia from horse urine, combined with the residual stress in the <b>cold-drawn</b> metal of the cartridges, was responsible for the cracking.|$|E

5000|$|Metal cores in {{the range}} 1 to 120 micrometres with a glass coating a few micrometres in {{diameter}} can be readily produced by this method. Glass-coated microwires successfully produced by this method include copper, silver, gold, iron, platinum, and various alloy compositions. It has even proved possible to produce amorphous metal ("glassy metal") cores because the cooling rate achievable by this process can be {{of the order of}} 1,000,000 kelvins per second. Glass-coated wire receives all of its material properties from its microstructure. The microstructure in turn receives its properties from {{the rate at which the}} wire is cooled. The magnetic properties of glass-coated wires also differ greatly from the properties of amorphous wires and <b>cold-drawn</b> wires due to the difference of the internal stresses that are occurring in the wire. When choosing a metal for the wire Fe-rich compositions of metals typically hold and advantage over Co-rich compositions since Co is more expensive and Fe-rich metals have better magnetic properties. Although the magnetic properties such as the magnetic softness of Fe-rich materials can be improved by annealing the metal while it is under mechanical stresses. When a magnet is said to be [...] "soft" [...] it implies that the magnetic abilities are only temporary. These magnets are easily magnetized when they are exposed to an electrical current. These types of magnets are often used in computers and technology to control the flow of electric current. This is what makes these wires useful in technological applications because they can easily control the flow of electricity in a device. A hard magnet on the other hand does not need an electrical current to remain magnetized so these magnets are permanent. These magnets are used to create magnetic fields in devices such as an alternator that is in the engine of a car.|$|E

40|$|A mother alloy of 10 % Cr and 90 % Cu was {{prepared}} by sintering. This was alloyed with the Cu melt and Cu-Cr alloys containing about 0. 5 % Cr was obtained. These alloys could be deformed easily {{in both the}} hot and cold states. By measuring the hardness change, age-hardening properties of cast alloys were studied, which were quenched from 950 deg and aged at 300 to 700 deg for 1 hour. The maximum hardness was obtained with the tempering temperature of 500 deg. For the temperature of solution-treatment, 950 deg was insufficient and that above 1000 deg necessary. For the tempering time, a treatment at 500 deg for 1 hr. or at 450 deg for 3 hrs. yielded the maximum hardness.

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to {{investigate}} the ductile performance of concrete tilt-up panels reinforced with <b>cold-drawn</b> mesh to improve the current seismic assessment procedure. The commercial impact {{of the project was}} also investigated. Engineering Advisory Group (EAG) guidelines state that a crack in a panel under face loading may be sufficient to fracture the mesh. The comments made by EAG regarding the performance of <b>cold-drawn</b> mesh may be interpreted as suggesting that assessment of such panels be conducted with a ductility of 1. 0. Observations of tilt-up panel performance following the Christchurch earthquakes suggest that a ductility higher than μ= 1. 0 is likely to be appropriate for the response of panels to out-of-plane loading. An experimental test frame was designed to subject ten tilt-panel specimens to a cyclic quasi-static loading protocol. Rotation ductility, calculated from the force-displacement response from the test specimens, was found to range between 2. 9 and 5. 8. Correlation between tensile tests on 663 L mesh, and data collected from instrumentation during testing confirmed that the mesh behaves as un-bonded over the pitch length of 150 mm. Recommendation: Based on a moment-rotation assessment approach with an un-bonded length equal to the pitch of the mesh, a rotation ductility of μ= 2. 5 appears to be appropriate for the seismic assessment of panels reinforced with <b>cold-drawn</b> mesh...|$|E
40|$|Relaxation {{processes}} {{associated with}} the glass transition in nonferroelectric and ferroelectric polyamide (PA) 11 are investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) {{in order to obtain}} information about the molecular mobility within the amorphous phase. In particular, the effects of melt quenching, cold drawing, and annealing just below the melting region are studied with respect to potential possibilities and limitations for improving the piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of PA 11. A relaxation map is obtained from DRS that shows especially the crossover region where the cooperative alpha relaxation and the local beta relaxation merge into a single high-temperature process. No fundamental difference between quenched, <b>cold-drawn,</b> and annealed films is found, though in the <b>cold-drawn</b> (ferroelectric) film the alpha relaxation is suppressed and slowed down, but it is at least partly recovered by subsequent annealing. It is concluded that there exists an amorphous phase in all structures, even in the <b>cold-drawn</b> film. The amorphous phase can be more rigid or more viscoelastic depending on preparation. Cold drawing not only leads to crystallization in a ferroelectric form but also to higher rigidity of the remaining amorphous phase. Annealing just below the melting region after cold drawing causes a stronger phase separation between the crystalline phase and a more viscoelastic amorphous phase.

40|$|The {{residual}} stress state {{in both the}} cementite and ferrite phases of <b>cold-drawn</b> pearlitic wires has been measured by neutron diffraction. The phase microstress in the axial direction is obtained. It is found that the cementite lamellae are subjected to a high tensile stress, up to 2000 MPa, after cold drawing. Measurements on etched wires showed that the phase microstress is nearly constant with {{the distance to the}} wire axis. Combination of these data with complementary X-ray diffraction measurements on the ferrite determines the response of each phase to the macrostress or an applied stress. Additionally, the peak broadening and texture of both phases have been studied using the neutron diffraction technique. The texture is less sharp in the cementite than in the ferrite. In the <b>cold-drawn</b> samples the diffraction peaks are very broad, which suggests plastic deformation of the cementite lamellae. Copyright (C) 1996 Acta Metallurgica Inc. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{demand on}} microparts is {{increasing}} significantly {{due to the}} global trend of product miniaturization. Microforming provides a promising approach to fabricating microparts with good mechanical properties at low cost and high productivity. However, when the part dimension is scaled down to micro-level, the size effect occurs such that the deformation behaviors {{are different from those}} in macroscale. The investigations on size effect and the physics behind the phenomena observed are thus needed. In this research, the size effect on material deformation behavior is investigated based on the two heading cases, viz., central heading and end heading of the rods of the <b>cold-drawn</b> and annealed pure copper. It is found that the grain flow of the <b>cold-drawn</b> material is {{different from that of the}} annealed material and the coarse-grained material undergoes nonuniform deformation when the part size is in microscale. These phenomena can be explained by the strong texture in the <b>cold-drawn</b> material and the strain incompatibility among different grains in the coarse-grained material. In addition, the tooling surface texture generated in grinding process makes the friction different in different flow directions, resulting in the variation of formed profiles in both macro- and microparts. The surface roughening effect on the formed part becomes significant in microheading process. It has a close relationship with the grain size and crystallographic texture of the forming material. Furthermore, the punch-die and workpiece-tooling interfaces have a certain effect on deformation pressure. This leads to the scattering effect and the difference of the deformation pressure-stroke curves between the macroheading and microheading. The reported experimental results and the articulated findings provide a basis for understanding of material size effect in microheading process. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
