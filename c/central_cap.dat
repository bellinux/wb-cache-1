As long as H is thick enough, here H {{greater than or equal}} to 5 mm, the exponents are n = 1 / 2 and n = 1 / 3 for the front and the <b>central</b> <b>cap,</b> respectively. For thinner layers, H similar to 2 mm, and moderate DeltaC, the spreading is drastically hindered and the measured values can go down to n = 0. 1, due to the additional friction imposed by the confinement of the convective calls generated by dissolution below the primary film which anchor on the solid surface beneath the liquid substrate.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the morphology of corneal caps in femtosecond laser small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) {{and its relation}} to the refractive outcomes. METHODS: A prospective study of fifty-four corneal caps created with VisuMax femtosecond laser were examined using an Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 6 months after SMILE. The cap thickness at nine points on each of the four meridians (0 °, 45 °, 90 °, 135 °) and the diameter were measured. Cap morphology, changes over time and its correlation with refractive outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: The mean achieved <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> thickness were (108. 74 ± 5. 06) µm at 6 months and (107. 32 ± 4. 81) µm at 1 month postoperatively, significantly thinner than that at 1 day (110. 81 ± 7. 95) µm and 1 week (109. 58 ± 7. 48) µm (P< 0. 05). The mean diameter on 0 ° meridian was (7. 61 ± 0. 07) mm, significantly larger than that on 90 ° meridian (7. 57 ± 0. 06) mm (P =  0. 001). Cap morphology showed good regularity, except that the differences of points in two pairs were significant at 1 day postoperatively. The uniformity was consistent over time and the <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> thickness was thinner than those in the paracentral and peripheral areas. The refractive outcomes stabilized within 1 month. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) was correlated to the <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> thickness at 1 day and 1 week (both rs  =  0. 33, p< 0. 05). The uniformity index was correlated with UDVA (rs  =  0. 34, p< 0. 05) and corrected distance visual acuity (rs  =  0. 32, p< 0. 05) at 1 week postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal caps of SMILE are predictable with good reproducibility, regularity and uniformity. Cap morphology might have a mild effect on refractive outcomes in the early stage. Further study should focus on the impact on the visual quality...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{collision}} of water drops against small targets was studied experimentally {{by means of}} a high-speed photography technique. The drop impact velocity was about 3. 5 m/s. Drop diameters were in the range of 2. 8 - 4. 0 mm. The target was a stainless steel disk of 3. 9 mm diameter. The drop spread beyond the target like a <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> surrounded by a thin, slightly conical lamella bounded by a thicker rim. By mounting a small obstacle near the target, surface-tension driven Mach waves in the flowing lamella were generated, which are formally equivalent to the familiar compressibility driven Mach waves in gas dynamics. From the measurement of the Mach angle, the values of some flow parameters could be obtained as functions of time, which provided insight into the flow structure. The liquid flowed from the <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> to the liquid rim through the thin lamella at constant momentum flux. At a certain stage of the process, most of the liquid accumulated in the rim and the internal part of the lamella became metastable. In this situation, a rupture wave propagating through the metastable internal part of the lamella caused the rim to retract while forming outwardly directed secondary jets. The jets disintegrated into secondary droplets due to the Savart-Plateau-Rayleigh instability. Prior {{to the end of the}} retraction, an internal circular wave of rupture was formed. It originated at the target and then it propagated to meet the retracting rim. Their meeting resulted in a crown of tiny droplets. A theoretical analysis of the ejection process is proposed.

40|$|Food {{security}} {{has always been}} {{at the heart of}} the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). However, the way in which this objective has been pursued and formulated has changed considerably since the policy was first introduced in 1962. Not least, the European approach to food {{security has}} evolved from being primarily focused upon ensuring high levels of food supply and internal price stability to becoming increasingly responsive to the environmental implications of agricultural intensification. Thus, as the wider costs of intensive production have garnered heightened recognition, so too has appreciation of the need to move towards ecologically sustainable forms of agriculture, as a pre-requisite for securing long-term food security. In response, the sustainable management of natural resources and climate change has become a <b>central</b> <b>CAP</b> objective aimed at addressing the environmental externalities of land management practices funded under the CAP. And the relevance of this discussion has recently been carried forward in the context of the 2013 CAP reforms, which delivered the latest in a long line of measures aimed at greening the policy and reducing the negative externalities of European agriculture. These were explicitly introduced to give expression to the underlying principle of sustainable development, but important questions remain as to their ability to provide ecologically sustainable solutions. This thesis explores the <b>central</b> <b>CAP</b> objective of sustainable agriculture and its key role for ensuring food security. In doing so, it seeks to add to the current debate by critically assessing the impact of the sustainable development paradigm upon the framing of the EU agri-environmental measures and the greater implications that these may have for the long-term protection of ecological systems and food security. In particular, it analyses the main legal measures delivered by the 2013 CAP reforms and the extent to which they correspond to these long-term objectives...|$|E
40|$|Thin-section {{electron}} microscope analysis of rat and rabbit-cultured granulosa cells treated with concanavalin A (Con A) at 37 ~ revealed coordinated {{changes in the}} cytoplasmic disposition of microfilaments, thick filaments, and microtubules during cap formation and internalization of lectin-receptor complexes. Con A-receptor clustering is accompanied by an accumulation of subplasmalemmal microfilaments which assemble into a loosely woven ring as patches of receptor move centrally on the cell surface. Periodic densities appear in the microfilament ring which becomes reduced in diameter as patches coalesce to form a single <b>central</b> <b>cap.</b> Microtubules and thick filaments emerge associated with the capped membrane. Capping is followed by endocytosis of the con A-receptor complexes. During this process, the microfilament ring is displaced basally into the cytoplasm and endocytic vesicles are transported to the paranuclear Golgi complex along microtubules and thick filaments. Eventually, these vesicles aggregate near the cell center where they are embedded in a dense meshwork of thick filaments...|$|E

40|$|Human {{neutrophil}} polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) {{were studied}} {{to determine the}} influence of cellular locomotion upon the redistribution and capping of concanavalin A (Con A). Con A was detected by fluorescence (using Con A conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate [Con A-FITC]), or on shadow-cast replicas (using Busycon canaliculatum hemocyanin as a marker for Con A). After labeling with Con A 100 µg/ml at 4 °C and warming to 37 °C, locomotion occurred, and the Con A quickly aggregated into a cap at the trailing end of the cell. When locomotion was inhibited (with cytochalasin B, or by incubation in serum-free medium at 18 ° C) Con A rapidly formed a <b>cap</b> over the <b>central</b> region of the cell. Iodoacetamide inhibited capping. PMN labeled with FITC, a monovalent ligand, developed caps at the tail only on motile cells; FITC remained dispersed on immobilized cells. PMN exposed to Con A 100 µg/ml at 37 °C bound more lectin than at 4 °C, became immobilized, and showed slow <b>central</b> <b>capping.</b> The Con A soon became internalized to form a perinuclear ring. Such treatment in the presence of cytochalasin B resulted in the quick formation of persistent <b>central</b> <b>caps.</b> Colchicine (or prior cooling) protected PMN from the immobilizing effect of Con A, and tail caps were found on 30 - 40 % of cells. Immobilization of colchicinetreated cells caused Con A to remain in dispersed clusters. Thus, capping on PMN is a temperature- and energy-dependent process that proceeds independently of cellular locomotion, provided a colchicine-sensitive system is intact and the ligand is capable of cross linking receptors. On the other hand, if the cell does move, it appears that ligands may be swept into a cap at the tail whether cross-linking occurs or not...|$|R

40|$|In theory, {{miniaturized}} {{systems such}} as the around-the-ear electrode arrays (cEEGrids) enable mobile monitoring of the electroencephalogram (EEG) {{in a variety of}} real life situations without interfering with the natural setting. However, the research benefit of such cEEGrid recordings critically depends on their validity. To investigate whether visual and motor processing are reflected in the cEEGrid-EEG, a direct comparison of EEG that was concurrently recorded with the cEEGrids and with a high-density cap setup was conducted. Thirteen participants performed a classic Simon task in which letters were presented laterally and a lateralized choice response was executed. N 1, P 1 and P 300 event-related potential (ERP) waveforms were extracted from cEEGrid-EEG: they were found to be strongly correlated with corresponding waveforms extracted from cap-EEG but with lower signal strength and lower signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Event-related lateralizations (ERLs) recorded at posterior scalp sites were well reflected in middle cEEGrid pairs. Moreover, the effect size of the Simon correspondence effect on the extracted ERLs was similar between the two systems. However, lateralizations at <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> sites were less well reflected in the cEEGrid-EEG indicating a difficulty in capturing motor response preparation and execution. These results show that well-described visual and cognitive ERPs and ERLs can be measured using the cEEGrids, while motor-related cortical potentials are not well captured. This study further demonstrates the potential and possible limitations of unobtrusive cEEGrid-EEG recordings...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the mechanisms of Al tolerance in wheat varieties by the direct observation of Al distribution in root cells using the hematoxylin stain method. Five-day-old seedlings of Al-tolerant varieties, Atlas 66 and Shirosanjyaku, and an Alsensitive variety, Chikushikomugi, were treated with 150 PM Al in 0. 4 mM CaCl_ 2, pH 4. 5 for 24 hours under aseptic conditions; afterwards the roots were stained with hematoxylin. Comparison of hematoxylin stain of root tips among the varieties showed that the root cap of Alsensitive seedlings was stained intensively, reflecting high accumulation of Al in this region. The roots developed symptoms of Al toxicity such as increased vacuolation, and swelling and rapture of the cells of the epidermis. On the other hand, in Al-tolerant varieties the <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> cells and the cortical region of the meristem and elongation zone were not stained. The site of the earliest Al accumulation in Al-tolerant varieties seemed to be the edge cells of the root cap. In the elongation zone, Al accumulated mainly in the cell wall and nuclei. Those differences in the staining pattern were probably due to immobilization of Al in the cytosol that could not react with hematoxylin and/or due to the ability of Al-tolerant varieties to better exclude Al from cytoplasm...|$|E
40|$|Although the rootcap is {{required}} for gravitropic sensing, various classical and contemporary data {{raise the question of}} whether additional sensing occurs away from the cap in roots. Roots of Equisetum hyemale L. (horsetail) were examined by light and electron microscopy to determine which cell components were distributed with respect to gravity both in and away from the rootcap. Adventitious roots from stem cuttings were gravitropic in a vertical orientation or if reoriented to the horizontal. Obvious amyloplast sedimentation was found in vertical and in reoriented roots 1) in cells {{in the center of the}} rootcap and 2) in young, elongating cortical cells located in two to three layers outside the endodermis. These cortical amyloplasts were smaller than cap amyloplasts and, unlike <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> amyloplasts, were occasionally found in the top of the cell. The nucleus was also sedimented on top of the amyloplasts in both cell types, both in vertical and in reoriented roots. Sedimentation of both organelles ceased as cortical cells elongated further or as cap cells became peripheral in location. In both cell types with sedimentation, endoplasmic reticulum was located in the cell periphery, but showed no obvious enrichment near the lower part of the cell in vertical roots. This is the first modern report of sedimentation away from the cap in roots, and it provides structural evidence that gravitropic sensing may not be confined to the cap in all roots...|$|E

Roots of Limnobium are strongly gravitropic. The rootcap consists of only two layers of cells. Although small amyloplasts {{are present in the}} <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> cells, no sedimentation of any organelle, including amyloplasts, was found. In contrast, both amyloplasts and nuclei sediment consistently and completely in cells of the elongation zone. Sedimentation occurs in one cell layer of the cortex just outside the endodermis. Sedimentation of both amyloplasts and nuclei begins in cells that are in their initial stages of elongation and persists at least {{to the level of the}} root where root hairs emerge. This is the first modern report of the presence of sedimentation away from, but not in, the rootcap. It shows that sedimentation in the rootcap is not necessary for gravitropic sensing in at least one angiosperm. If amyloplast sedimentation is responsible for gravitropic sensing, then the site of sensing in Limnobium roots is the elongation zone and not the rootcap. These data do not necessarily conflict with the hypothesis that sensing occurs in the cap in other roots, since Limnobium roots are exceptional in rootcap origin and structure, as well as in the distribution of organelle sedimentation. Similarly, if nuclear sedimentation is involved in gravitropic sensing, then nuclear mass would function in addition to, not instead of, that of amyloplasts...|$|E
40|$|Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is {{essential}} for sperm maturation within the epididymis, but the roles of estradiol- 17 (E 2) and progesterone (P) in epididymal function are unknown. To identify sites of potential action of these hormones, and any effect of season on their concen-trations, specific binding of steroids to receptors in extracts of ram epididymal tissue was quantified in two studies. Tissue was taken from three broad regions of the epididymis (cap Ut, corpus, and cauda; Study 1) or from seven discrete regions of the epididymis (Study 2) in February to May (nonbreeding season; NBS) or late August to October (breeding season; BS). Specific binding of P was not detected. Saturable high-affinity binding sites specific for DHT (Ka = 2. 6 x 10 ’ ‘M’) and E 2 (Ka = 5. 4 x 10 ’ ‘M’) were detected. Binding was not to androgen-binding protein, testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin, or sperm nuclei. There was no regional or seasonal difference in affinity of DHT or E 2 binding. In both studies, concentration of DHT-binding sites (fmol/mg protein for low- plus high-salt extracts) was higher (p. <O. 05) in the BS than NBS. In Study 1, mean concentration of DHT-binding sites was higher (p<O. 05) in the cap ut than in the corpus and cauda. The more definitive localization possible in Study 2 revealed that concentration of DHT-binding sites was highest in the distal caput, lowest in the proximal cauda (p<O. O 5), and intermediate in other regions. For E 2, however, concentration of binding sites was higher (p<O. 05) in the BS than NBS only in Study 1, and was higher (p<O. 05) in the cauda or corpus than in the caput epididymidis. In Study 2, the season by region inter-action was significant (p<O. 05); concentration of E 2 -binding sites was higher in the distal cauda during the NBS. These data support the concept that the <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> Ut through proximal corpus epididymidis are most dependent on androgenic stimulation, whereas distal regions may respond to estrogenic stimulation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the local base of the south polar layered deposits (SPLD) exposed in the bounding scarp near 72 °– 74 °S, 215 °– 230 °W {{where there is a}} clear unconformable contact with older units. Sections of layering up to a kilometer thick were examined along the bounding scarp, permitting an estimate of the thinnest individual layers yet reported in the SPLD. Rhythmic layering is also present locally, suggesting a similarly rhythmic variation in environmental conditions and a recorded climate signal at least in some SPLD strata. Locally, angular unconformities may be present, as has been reported for the north polar layered deposits (NPLD) and may likewise imply intervals of subaerial erosion in the SPLD. The outcropping layers display a broad range of weathering styles and may reflect more diverse conditions of depositions, erosion, and diagenesis than might have been expected from simple aeolian depostion modulated only by astronomically driven climatic fluctuations. An unexpected finding of our study is the presence of locally abundant small pits close to the bounding scarp. These quasi-circular, negative, rimless features probably originated as impact craters and were modified to varying degrees by local endogenic processes, as well as locally variable blanketing. A nominal exposure age for the most heavily cratered region in our study area is about 2 million years, and the crater statistics appear consistent with those for the overall SPLD, although there are large uncertainties in the absolute ages implied by the crater size–frequency statistics, as in all martian crater ages. Another new finding is the presence of mass wasting features along the steepest portion of the retreating bounding scarp {{as well as a number}} of examples of brittle fracture, consistent with large-scale slumping along the bounding scarp and probably also ancient basal sliding. Both subhorizontal and high angle faults appear to be exposed in the bounding scarp, but the dips of the faults are poorly constrained. These fractures, along with the relatively undeformed layers between them, suggest to us that whatever horizontal motion may have taken place outward from the <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> region was accomplished by ancient basal sliding rather than large-scale glacial-like flow or ice migration by differential ablation, as proposed recently for the northern permanent cap and underlying NPLD.

40|$|According to the {{importance}} of rehabilitation and recovery of Architectural Heritage in the live of people, this paper is aimed to strengthen the traditional methods of stone vaults calculation taking advantage of the technological characteristics of the powerful program ANSYS Workbench. As an example of this, it could find out the possible pathologies that could arise during the construction history of the building. To limit this research, the upper vault of the main chapel of the Santiago parish church in Orihuela -Alicante- is selected as a reference which is a Jeronimo Quijano´s important building work in the XVI century in the Renaissance. Moreover, it is an innovative stone masonry vault that consists of 8 double intercrossed arches with each other and braced by severies. During the seventeenth century there was a lantern in the <b>central</b> <b>cap</b> and it is unknown why it was removed. Its construction could justify the original constructive solution with intercrossed arches that freed the center to create a more enlightened and comfortable presbytery. By similarity with other Quijano’s works, it is considered a small lantern drilling the central spherical cap. It is proposed to carry out a comparative study of it with different architectural solutions from the same period and based on several common parameters such as: a vault of square plant with spherical surround, intercrossed arches, a possible lantern, the dimension of the permitted space, similar states of loads and compact limestone masonry. The three solutions are mainly differentiated by their size and the type of lantern and its comparison lets us know which one is the most resistant and stable. The other two building works maintain some connection with the Quijano's professional scope. It has selected the particular case of the Communion chapel of the Basilica in Elche (a large prismatic lantern with a large cylindrical drum that starts from the own arches and an upper hemispherical dome), for its conservation, its proximity to Orihuela and its implementation during the century XVIII. Finally, a significant Dome Spanish Renaissance complete the selection: a cross vault of the Benavides Chapel of the Saint Francisco Convent in Baeza - Jaén-, designed by Andres of Vandelvira in the sixteenth century (a large hemispherical dome that starts from the own arcs). To simplify the calculation and standardize the work that have to be contrasted, all of them were considered with some similar characteristics: 30 cm constant thickness, the intercrossed arches were specifically analyzed and had identical loads, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Regarding the calculation solutions, in general terms, the compressive stresses predominate, influencing on it the joint collaboration of the filling material on the vault, the vault itself, the thick side walls, the buttresses and the top cover weight. In addition, the three solutions are suitable, being the Orihuela one the safest and the Baeza one the riskiest for its large dimensions. Thus, the idea of intercrossed arches with suitable thickness would allow carry out the heaviest lantern and this would confirm it as a Renaissance architectural typology built in stone...|$|E
