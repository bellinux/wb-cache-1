40|$|Introduction: The {{problem of}} early {{diagnostics}} of cerebral circulation pathology in children, ‎who {{are exposed to}} industrial toxicants, is not well-studied. ‎Objective: The {{study was designed to}} assess the features of impaired cerebral circulation in ‎children, when exposed to environmental formaldehyde, phenol, cresol and methanol. ‎Method: A total of 120 children (6 to 10 years of age) who lived in the area influenced by the ‎emissions of chemical companies. The children were randomized to two groups, depending on ‎the concentrations of chemicals in their bio-samples. The examination was carried out using a ‎Toshiba Aplio XG ultrasound scanner (Japan) with 1. 8 - 2. 5 MHz multi-frequency linear-array ‎transducers. All the measurements were performed under standard conditions. ‎Results: In order to assess cerebrovascular disorders caused by exposure to environmental ‎chemicals of industrial origin, the authors proposed to use transcranial Doppler sonography. The ‎children, exposed to phenol, <b>cresol,</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> and methanol, demonstrated such features of ‎cerebrovascular disorders as lower compliance, increased stiffness and resistance of cerebral ‎artery walls. These changes in the vascular tone correlated with the blood level of chemicals of ‎industrial origin. ‎Conclusion: The investigation of the features of cerebrovascular disorders in children in ‎environmentally unfavorable areas is of importance for the prevention of cerebrovascular diseases ‎and the reduction of the mortality rate associated with their complications in adults. ...|$|E
50|$|Third-hand smoking (THS) {{consists}} of residual tobacco smoke pollutants that remain on surfaces and in dust after tobacco has been smoked, are re-emitted into the gas phase, or react with oxidants and other compounds {{in the environment}} to yield secondary pollutants. Chemicals of tobacco smoking include nicotine, 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP), phenol, <b>cresols,</b> naphthalene, <b>formaldehyde,</b> and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (including some not found in freshly-emitted tobacco smoke).|$|R
40|$|Virucidal {{effects of}} six kinds of {{disinfectants}} were examined against Oncorhynchus masou virus (OMV), and {{infectious pancreatic necrosis}} virus (IPNV), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV). At 15 °C for 20 min, minimum concentrations showing 100 % plaque reduction of OMV by iodophor, sodium hypochlorite solution, benzalkonium chloride solution, saponated <b>cresol</b> solution, <b>formaldehyde</b> solution and potassium permanganate solution were 40, 50, 100, 100, 3, 500 and 16 ppm, respectively. Susceptibility of OMV against these disinfectants was {{higher than that of}} IPNV, IHNV and HIRRV, suggesting that the usage of disinfectants against IPNV and/or IHNV is also effective against OMV. 　　ポピドンヨード液, 次亜塩素酸ナトリウム液, 塩化ベンザルコニウム液, クレゾール石ケン液, ホルムアルデヒド液および過マンガン酸カリウム溶液のOMV不活化最少濃度は, 15 ℃・ 20 分間の反応で各々 40, 50, 100, 100, 3, 500 および 16 ppmであった。また, OMVのそれら薬剤に対する感受性は, IPNV, IHNV,HIRRVより高かった。従って, OMV感染症には, IPNやIHNに対する防除対策が有効であると考えられる...|$|R
2500|$|Bellows-driven {{instruments}} – {{such as the}} accordion, concertina, melodeon and (Irish) Uilleann bagpipes – reportedly need {{less frequent}} cleaning and maintenance {{as a result of}} the Irish smoke-free law. [...] "Third-hand smoke", solid particulates from secondhand smoke that are adsorbed onto surfaces and later re-emitted as gases or transferred through touch, are a particular problem for musicians. [...] After playing in smoky bars, instruments can emit nicotine, 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP), phenol, <b>cresols,</b> naphthalene, <b>formaldehyde,</b> and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (including some not found in freshly emitted tobacco smoke), which can enter musicians' bodies through the skin, or be re-emitted as gases after they have left the smoky environment. Concern about third-hand smoke on instruments is one of the reasons many musicians, represented by the New Orleans Musicians' Clinic, supported the smoking ban there.|$|R
