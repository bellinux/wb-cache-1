25|$|Rural loans {{commonly}} arose as {{a result}} of unpaid obligations due to an institution (such as a temple), in this case the arrears were considered to be lent to the debtor.

RBS helped to provide an estimated £8 billion from 2006 to 2008 to energy corporation E.ON and other coal-utilising companies. In 2012, 2.8% of RBS' total lending was provided to the power, oil and gas sectors combined.

25|$|India's {{reliance}} on external assistance and concessional debt has decreased since liberalisation of the economy, and the debt service ratio decreased from 35.3% in 1990–91 to 4.4% in 2008–09. In India, external commercial borrowings (ECBs), or <b>commercial</b> <b>loans</b> from non-resident lenders, are being permitted {{by the government}} for providing an additional source of funds to Indian corporates. The Ministry of Finance monitors and regulates them through ECB policy guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999. India's foreign exchange reserves have steadily risen from $5.8billion in March 1991 to $318.6billion in December 2009. In 2012, the United Kingdom announced an end to all financial aid to India, citing the growth and robustness of Indian economy.|$|E
25|$|Smallholders {{used the}} dense network of ADMARC markets to obtain {{fertilizer}} or seed and {{to buy or}} sell crops at standard prices. Partial privatisation inspired by the World Bank in 1987 left it short of funds to provide services. Despite liberalisation, few private traders emerged, and maize markets were disrupted. Malawi was increasingly dependent on imported maize in deficit years, but limited state funding forced ADMARC to use <b>commercial</b> <b>loans</b> to import 312,000 tonnes of maize a year in the 1990s. It also had to create, with inadequate funds, an 180,000 tonne Strategic Grain Reserve from the cheaper of domestic or imported maize to stabilise prices for farmers and consumers. The World Bank criticised losses on imported maize as an untargeted subsidy: in 1996, it required the creation of a National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA) independent of government influence to control grain imports. NFRA was not responsible for price stability, and was poorly funded. ADMARC kept control over domestic grain and remained under political control. It also started selling the domestic reserves after the NFRA was formed.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, ADMARC {{had needed}} {{to sell the}} {{strategic}} reserve to repay its loans, and after a poor harvest later in 1997, maize stocks were low and consumer prices high. Rainfall in 1997/98 was erratic and the 1998 crop was also poor: ADMARC released reserves and imported maize to prevent famine. The 1999 and 2000 harvests were good, with large sweet potato and cassava crops {{as the result of}} USAIDprojects to promote drought-resistant foods. ADMARC undertook a partial sale of its reserves in 2000, as it could not pay the interest its <b>commercial</b> <b>loans.</b> Sales, including some exports at low prices continued in 2001 despite a poor harvest. The harvest of 2002 was also disappointing, and failure to prevent food shortages caused deaths from hunger and related diseases, mainly in 2002. Estimates of the death toll ranged from a semi-official figure of 500 to 1,000 to credible reports by NGO over 1,000. The harvest of 2003 was also poor and that of 2004 was deficient in maize and in root crops; the next satisfactory harvest was in 2005. Rural poverty increased and by 2005, about 14% of Malawian adult were HIV positive.|$|E
