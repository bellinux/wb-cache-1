40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relation among face recognition skill, motor ability and singing ability in young children. The subjects were 3 to 7 years old children. Experimentations were divided into two phases, first experiment dealt with the relation between singing ability and Goodenough-Drawing –Test, and second with the correlation between singing ability and motor skill. In both experiments, subject children were asked to sing a popular song, “Omochano cha cha cha” and testers recorded their singing. Two testers independently scored their total singing ability with respects to melody, rhythm, text and musicality. Subjects in the first group were tested with the Goodenough –Drawing-Test. The second group underwent Voluntary movement test and <b>Chain</b> <b>tie</b> test. Results were as follows. First, singing abilities were not significantly different between ages, however girls took significantly higher score the boys at melody and rhythm score. Second, scores in melody had a significant positive correlation with the scores of the Goodenouhg drawing test. Third, the duration of subjects’ music training had a significant positive correlation with the accuracy of lyrics. Forth, there was no significant correlation between singing ability and motor skill. The findings in this study suggested that music training affects “the accuracy of the text” in singing. In addition, the ability in face recognition was associated with the ability to reproduce melody line. Possible mechanism for the apparent association between different modalities (melody reproduction vs. drawing a face) is discussed...|$|E

5000|$|The Good Friday {{ritual in}} Malta {{includes}} visits to seven tabernacles, or [...] "Altars of Repose", in seven different churches. Sombre, and solemn religious processions and pageants {{are held in}} many towns and villages, with statues and costumed, local amateur actors representing scenes from the Passion of Christ. In some parts of Malta, these processions will include a number of penitents dressed in white robes and hoods, walking barefoot (or occasionally with <b>chains</b> <b>tied</b> to their ankles) {{as an act of}} penance or in fulfilment of a vow. This is a unique, medieval tradition which still survives today. Easter Sunday in Malta, by contrast, is marked by the incessant pealing of church bells, and festive, fast-paced processions, with the youth of each town running through the streets bearing sculptures of the Risen Christ.|$|R
40|$|Hash Chains {{are used}} {{extensively}} in various cryptographic {{systems such as}} onetime passwords, server supported signatures, secure address resolution, certificate revocation, micropayments etc. However, currently they suffer from the limitation {{that they have a}} finite number of links which when exhausted requires the system to be re-initialized. In this paper, we present a new kind of hash chain which we call a Re-initializable Hash Chain (RHC). A RHC has the property that if its links are exhausted, it can be securely re-initialized in a non-repudiable manner to result in another RHC. This process can be continued indefinitely to give rise to an infinite length hash chain, or more precisely, an infinite number of finite length hash <b>chains</b> <b>tied</b> together. Finally we illustrate how a conventional hash chain (CHC) may be profitable replaced with a RHC in cryptographic systems. ...|$|R
