5|$|The Treaty of Lisbon {{abolished}} the pillar system and gave further powers to Parliament. It also merged the Council's High Representative with the Commission's foreign policy head, {{with this new}} figure chairing the foreign affairs Council rather than the rotating presidency. The European Council was declared a separate institution from the Council, also chaired by a permanent president, and the different <b>Council</b> <b>configurations</b> were mentioned in the treaties for the first time.|$|R

40|$|The {{enlargement}} of the European Union to 25 Member States is having a particularly strong impact {{on the work of}} the Council. It has made it all the more important to streamline and better coordinate the <b>Council’s</b> <b>configurations</b> and preparatory bodies. The increase from 11 to 20 official languages poses unprecedented practical challenges, and {{it remains to be seen}} whether the new linguistic regime will make it possible to cope. New guidelines for the presidency and delegations have been adopted concerning preparation and management of meetings. Other innovations are being explored under the Dutch Presidency. The first months of experience in EU 25 suggest that continuing efforts will be required to ensure that Council business can be managed efficiently and effectively in the coming years...|$|R

40|$|The General Affairs Council (GAC) {{has so far}} {{not lived}} up to the {{expectations}} created by the Treaty of Lisbon, which in principle assigned it an important position within the EU system. The EU’s new General Affairs Council (GAC) –chaired by the Trio Presidency– was designed to fulfil the role of strategic coordinator of policy-making in the Union. Nearly a year-and-a-half since its creation, this aim is even more pertinent than ever, since the need to develop that function has become more acute. The GAC has not asserted itself politically and other possible coordinators that are well established and permanently based in Brussels –such as the President of the European Council, the COREPER, and even the Secretariat General of the Council– are not the ideal actors to carry out the coordinating function, which needs a strong political involvement of the member states at the ministerial level. The GAC has probably achieved the basic goal of guaranteeing a minimum of consistency {{in the work of the}} nine other <b>Council</b> <b>configurations</b> and it has formally prepared and followed up on the meetings of the European Council. However, it has failed to become a powerful and distinctive actor with a strategic approach...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{participation}} of ministers in the Council of the European Union. The first goal is to explore the participation as such, i. e. how often the ministers attend the Council meetings and what differences there are among the member states and the <b>Council</b> <b>configurations.</b> Secondly, the thesis seeks to reveal factors at the institutional (European), national and governmental level which {{have an impact on}} the participation. From the theoretical point of view, the thesis is framed by the rational choice approach. In terms of methodology, a quantitative analysis based on extensive dataset for the period 2009 - 2015 and logistic regression have been employed. The thesis concludes that the ministers attend the Council meetings quite often - the average for the period was 64 %. Regarding the individual factors, it is argued that the ministers representing the presidency country attend the sessions more often. Similarly, the participation is higher if there are many points on the agenda or if the minister represents a pro-European government. On the contrary, the probability of the participation is lower if the ministers face upcoming legislative elections at home. The analysis also shows that the public attitude towards the EU is irrelevant in this case. The results are, finally, [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The six-month {{rotating}} Presidency of the Council of Ministers, {{which currently}} {{coincides with the}} Presidency of the European Council, would be changed to an 18-month rotating Presidency shared by a trio of member countries, {{in an attempt to}} provide more continuity.

50|$|The Foreign Affairs <b>Council</b> is a <b>configuration</b> of the <b>Council</b> of the European Union {{and meets}} once a month.

50|$|The circuit has two {{different}} sections, an all tarmac race circuit and a rally cross circuit utilizing {{some of the}} race circuit with an addition off-road surface. The circuit is operated by the British Automobile Racing Club (BARC) {{under the terms of}} a 50-year lease from Carmarthenshire County <b>Council.</b> A third <b>configuration</b> was also used in 1996, which was that of a short oval. This followed the race circuit from the Start/Finish straight, through the first two corners of the track, before turning left at the third corner and returning to the Start/Finish straight.There were plans to include a quarter mile drag strip, but this never came to fruition.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>council</b> and {{courtroom}} <b>configuration</b> of seating is {{one that}} fosters interaction between the [...] "panel" [...] (court, council, board, or other officials) and the public. The panel members may debate or engage in discourse amongst themselves, particularly in a council of elected officials, {{but that is not}} normally the main portion of discourse. The more linear the seating arrangement is, the less supportive of it is for discourse. City Council chamber are less likely to use a linear configuration whereas judges {{in a court of law}} (where there is more than one judge in a sitting) frequently sit in a straight or nearly straight line.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} basic motivations behind Engineering Data Management (EDM) {{in a decade}} long Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project with at least another decades {{operational}} period at CERN. The main argument is that without strict managerial principles to control engineering work the exploitation of EDM becomes impossible. Structured and organized configuration management is the absolute prerequisite for an effective integration of design, manufacturing and installation work. EDM is seen to provide all collaborating parties of the project with a coherent and up-to-date view of the product specifications together with other relevant information, such as products change log, responsibilities and status indicators during the products whole life-cycle. It is argued that by combining simple and commonly accepted managerial principles with an advanced EDM system the outcome supports the main phases of products evolution, i. e. design, assembly, operation and maintenance. The paper outlines the main tasks of the configuration management and the fundamental requirements of EDM {{in order to meet}} LHC-projects complexity, stringent budget, high quality and tight schedule constraints set by the CERN <b>Council.</b> Keywords: <b>configuration</b> management, new product development, project management, concurrent engineering, engineering data managemen...|$|R
