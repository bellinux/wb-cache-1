40|$|The <b>citrus</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> Anoplophora chinensis is {{native to}} Asia, where it lives {{on a wide range}} of {{deciduous}} tree species, and it is the most important plant pest on Citrus spp. In recent years A. chinensis has been introduced to Europe and to North America. The pest has proven to be highly adaptable, and presents a threat to ecosystems and to many economically important tree species. A. chinensis is on the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) A 2 list, which means that EPPO recommends its member countries to regulate the pest as quarantine pests. There are two former risk assessments of A. chinensis: one for England in 2006 and one for the EU countries in 2008. 1) Import of plants for planting that are hosts for A. chinensis, especially Acer spp. from Asia, is considered to represent the highest probability for entry of the pest to Norway. Entry via this pathway is evaluated as very likely. The level of uncertainty in this conclusion is medium; 2) An establishment of A. chinensis in Norway is considered as moderately likely, with a high level of uncertainty. The uncertainty is mainly due to lack of data concerning cold tolerance and ability of the pest to overwinter. If A. chinensis should establish, spread of the pest within Norway is considered as moderately likely, with a low level of uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Several {{coastal areas}} of Southern Norway {{probably}} have sufficiently mild climate for the <b>citrus</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> Anoplophora chinensis {{to establish and}} cause major damage to parks, gardens, and forests. These are conclusions made by the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM) in a risk assessment commissioned by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. VKM considers the probability of an establishment of A. chinensis in Norway to be moderately likely. The level of uncertainty behind this conclusion is high, mainly {{due to lack of}} data concerning cold tolerance and ability of the beetle to survive cold winters. Pathways for entry and spread Import of host plants for planting, especially Acer spp. from Asia, is considered to represent the highest probability for the pest to enter Norway. This way of entry is considered as very likely, with a medium level of uncertainty. If A. chinensis should establish, the spread of the pest within Norway is considered as moderately likely, with a low level of uncertainty. The mechanism for long-distance spread is already present through distribution of plants for planting. Natural spread will probably be local. Major economic consequences VKM considers the potential damage of A. chinensis as major, with medium level of uncertainty. A. chinensis has caused major economic damage in all areas where it has been introduced. A. chinensis is polyphagous and capable of killing trees of many genera. It is therefore assumed that A. chinensis might cause major damage to parks, gardens and forests if the pest should establish in Norway. The risk assessment The Norwegian Food Safety Authority will consider whether A. chinensis should be regulated as a quarantine pest in Norway, and whether specific phytosanitary measures should be introduced to prevent entry and establishment in Norway. VKM’s Panel on Plant Health is responsible for the risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{trade in}} plants for {{planting}} {{is a major}} pathway for the introduction and further spread of alien plants, pests and diseases. Information about the structure of plant trade networks is not generally available, but it is valuable for better assessing the potential risks associated with the trade in live plants {{and the development of}} prevention and mitigation measures and policy. The discovery of two larvae of Anoplophora chinensis (<b>citrus</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> - CLB) in 2009, at a nursery importing Acer palmatum from China in one of the major Dutch tree nursery areas, has resulted {{in the creation of a}} detailed dataset on the intra- European Union trade in its potential hosts. This study describes European imports of the primary host of A. chinensis, Acer spp. into the Netherlands (1998 - 2012) and the effects of the finding in a tree nursery area. In addition, shipments of Acer spp. from 138 producers in the nursery area in 2009 were analysed in a one-offanalysis of intra-EU trade. The volume of Acer spp. imports from Asia was stable early during the studied period, and declined to 5 % of the initial imports after a period of interceptions, illustrating the effect of regulations. The number of notifications of A. chinensis infestations in imported consignments of Acer spp. increased sharply in the years up to 2007, then declined as imports also reduced. Although plants were shipped to destinations throughout Europe, each producer shipped plants only to few destinations in few countries. Most of the plants were shipped to nurseries in EU countries. These patterns could make it easier to target these high risk destinations for control measures. The lack of transaction records makes it difficult to trace the destination of plants. More systematic electronic record keeping by traders and growers and the data being collated in a database that can be made available to regulatory authorities, together with further studies of plant trade data using network approaches, would be beneficial for improving trace-back and trace-forward and provide better safeguards for plant health and quality.

(Rhabditida: Diplogastridae) is {{described}} from {{a population of}} <b>Citrus</b> <b>Longhorn</b> <b>Beetles.</b> Alive adults of this Cerambycid were collected from Acer saccharinum trees at Assago and Parabiago (Villastanza), two localities near Milan (Italy).

Preliminary laboratory infectivity tests highlight the potential parasitic nature of the nematode. However, it was not successfully maintained in storage and culture.

40|$|<b>Longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) {{have been}} used to {{identify}} sites of high biological diversity and conservation value in cultivated landscapes, but were rarely studied in changing landscapes of humid tropics. This study was conducted in a region of southern Yunnan, China, which was dominated by natural rainforest until 30 years ago, but is successively transformed into commercial rubber monoculture plantations since that time. The objectives were to investigate <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> species diversity and distribution in the major land use types of this landscape and to estimate the effects of an expected expansion of rubber plantations on the <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> assemblages. The results showed that tree species diversity (181 species in total) and <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> diversity (220 species in total) were closely related with {{no significant differences between the}} tree and <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> assemblages shown by similarity distance analysis. There was a highly positive relationship between the estimated species richness of <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> and the number of tree species. Individual numbers of <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> and trees were also highly positive related at the sampling sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed that the degree of canopy coverage, succession age and tree diversity explained 78. 5 % of the total variation in <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> assemblage composition. Natural forest sites had significantly higher numbers of species and individuals than any other type of habitat.
