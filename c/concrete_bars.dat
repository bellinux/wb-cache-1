40|$|In this work, several beam {{finite element}} {{formulations}} are proposed for failure analysis of planar reinforced concrete beams and frames under monotonic static loading. The localized failure of material is modeled by the embedded strong discontinuity concept, which enhances standard interpolation of displacement (or rotation) with a discontinuous function, {{associated with an}} additional kinematic parameter representing jump in displacement (or rotation). The new parameters are local and are condensed on the element level. One stress resultant and two multi-layer beam finite elements are derived. The stress resultant Euler-Bernoulli beam element has embedded discontinuity in rotation. Bending response of {{the bulk of the}} element is described by elasto-plastic stress resultant material model. The cohesive relation between the moment and the rotational jump at the softening hinge is described by rigid-plastic model. Axial response is elastic. In the multi-layer beam finite elements, each layer is treated as a bar, made of either concrete or steel. Regular axial strain in a layer is computed according to Euler-Bernoulli or Timoshenko beam theory. Additional axial strain is produced by embedded discontinuity in axial displacement, introduced individually in each layer. Behavior of <b>concrete</b> <b>bars</b> is described by elasto-damage model, while elasto-plasticity model is used for steel bars. The cohesive relation between the stress at the discontinuity and the axial displacement jump is described by rigid-damage softening model in <b>concrete</b> <b>bars</b> and by rigid-plastic softening model in steel bars. Shear response in the Timoshenko element is elastic. The multi-layer Timoshenko beam finite element is upgraded by including viscosity in the softening model. Computer code implementation is presented in detail for the derived elements. An operator split computational procedure is presented for each formulation. The expressions, required for the local computation of inelastic internal variables and for the global computation of the degrees of freedom, are provided. Performance of the derived elements is illustrated on a set of numerical examples, which show that the multi-layer Euler-Bernoulli beam finite element is not reliable, while the stress-resultant Euler-Bernoulli beam and the multi-layer Timoshenko beam finite elements deliver satisfying results...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{corrosion}} protection methods in reinforcing <b>concrete</b> <b>bars</b> is the application of fusion-bonded epoxy coatings. Although considerable research has been carried out on the performance of epoxy-coated bars (ECR), there are still many uncertainties about their performance in cracked concrete. In this experimental program, reinforcing steel bars with six types of epoxy coatings embedded in concrete slabs with a 0. 4 mm wide preformed crack intersecting the reinforcing steel at right angles were tested. Results of corrosion potentials, corrosion current density, coating adhesion tests, chloride content, and visual examination after 68 months of exposure to a simulated marine environment are reported. Results revealed that under the studied conditions the ECR did not provide total protection of steel reinforcement in cracked concrete. Their use however, tended to reduce significantly the damage caused by the chloride-induced corrosion when compared with the uncoated bars embedded in concrete with similar characteristics.

40|$|Reinforcing bars in {{concrete}} elements functions as the component carrying tensile stresses after concretecracking.
