Shortly thereafter, the University of Albany, Buffalo, Binghamton, and Stony Brook won recognition when the State of New York PERB ruled teaching assistants were employees and were granted collective bargaining rights. [...] Several other public universities also won {{recognition in the}} 1990s. In 1995, the University of Kansas signed their first union <b>contract.</b> <b>Teaching</b> and research assistants at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell and the University of Iowa approved a union contract in 1996. Wayne State University also negotiated a contract with teaching assistants in 1999. Besides SUNY, the University of California system was the second university system to unionize. In 1999, the California PERB ruled teaching assistants were allowed to collectively bargain with the University of California. Union elections were held at the University of California's Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Riverside, and Irvine campuses—all of them approving a teaching assistant union. In 2000, union negotiations {{for all of the}} campuses were combined into UAW Local 2865, who bargains on behalf of all the campuses. Teaching assistants at the University of California, Merced also joined the union when the campus opened in 2006.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Natal, 1998. This thesis {{describes}} the casualisation of teachers' work (in Greater Durban) {{during the period}} of the democratic transition in South Africa. It provides evidence that <b>contract</b> <b>teaching</b> exists among men and women teachers employed in primary and secondary schools. These teachers are relegated to the secondary labour market with low income, poorer working conditions and lack of job security. It begins by adopting an electic theoretical approach, combining labour process and interactionist theories, to understand teachers' work. From this eclectic theoretical perspective, it is argued that contract teachers control and influence over their work is considerably eroded by the casualisation of the teaching labour process. However, unlike existing international studies, it is argued that casualisation of teaching in the Durban area serves not only as a deskilling process for most contract teachers but also as a re-skilling process for a few. Furthermore, this study shows that <b>contract</b> <b>teaching</b> has a gendered dimension. Not only because women teachers are mostly affected by casualisation of teaching but that it tends to relegate women to the primary school system where they teach young children. It is therefore argued that the casualisation of teaching extends women's mothering role into the classroom. The historical basis for casualisation of teaching, in South Africa, especially its gender dimension {{is a result of the}} 'Marriage Bar 'of 1912, the legacy of the Bantu Education system and the non-standardisation of teachers' qualifications until the 1980 s, as well as the education policy flux {{during the period of}} political transition. Because <b>contract</b> <b>teaching</b> has existed over a long period, it has to be acknowledged as a sub-category of the national teaching corps. This means that the contribution of contract teachers towards the formation and transformation of the capacity to learn should not only be recognised and accordingly rewarded by education authorities but that casualisation of teaching should constitute an area for further academic research...|$|E

40|$|The ALTC funded ‘Studio Teaching Project’ {{confirmed}} that studio teaching {{is a key}} and indispensable characteristic of pedagogy in the discipline of Architecture. However increases in student numbers, expectations for feedback and accountability measures imposed by institutions have resulted in an escalation {{in the administration of}} courses. Academics are increasingly relinquishing their studio teaching roles to visiting and part-time <b>contract</b> <b>teaching</b> staff who are in turn becoming increasingly important to students achieving learning outcomes. It is widely assumed that anyone who has experienced a design studio education will know how to go about teaching in the studio. Whilst it is true that most university learning and teaching institutes provide manuals and training sessions for new tutors but little of this material describes the circumstances surrounding productive studio interactions. Furthermore whilst the visiting practitioner architect is hugely valued for their knowledge of current practice and in particular of ‘how buildings go together’ their particular mind-set is as designer/problem solver as distinct from educationalist. The proposed paper will focus on the nature of interactions between the student and their developing project work and the role the studio-instructor has in mediating these interactions. In observing interactions through the lens of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy this paper speculates a means for isolating characteristics and clarifying practical strategies to assist tutors in their role as studio advisers. The paper was prompted by conversations between a studio academic and an architect with extensive part-time and visiting teacher experience about how to assist tutors in studio contexts...|$|E

40|$|Veterinary Science at James Cook University {{dates back}} to 1969 when a small {{enthusiastic}} team initiated the Graduate Department of Tropical veterinary Science. An innovative mix of degrees and {{a substantial amount of}} support from the University, State and Federal governments as well as members of the veterinary profession, local farmers and international collaborators facilitated the rapid growth of the program. The Department spent ten years in temporary accommodation on the Pimlico Campus until it moved to purpose built facilities on the Douglas campus where it built a reputation for ground breaking research into national and international problems. Changes in the funding model for Australian Universities and international student places required a major change in direction that resulted in the introduction of a Biomedical Sciences degree, a reorganisation in structure and a name change to the School of Biomedical Sciences as well as the establishment of the Australian Institute of Tropical Veterinary Science to maintain the veterinary focus. An extremely active honours and PhD program promoted innovative research. The health faculty expanded the range of degree programs including Nursing and rehabilitation sciences and in 2000 a medical degree program that had taken over 20 years to establish was commenced. The School made crucial contributions to the establishment of all of these programs with <b>contract</b> <b>teaching</b> vital for the establishment of many of the subjects. An undergraduate veterinary degree program was commenced in 2005 with an intake of 72 students. The curriculum was developed as an undergraduate teaching model with full integration from second to fifth year. A name change to the School of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences reflected the diverse range of teaching and research activities that the rapidly expanding School embraced. The School has an enviable history of innovative research, developing country project management and consultancies. However, maintaining the momentum in a challenging era of contracting funding despite potential pandemics and food production crises will continue to present immense challenges...|$|E

40|$|PROBLEM: Integrating {{residents}} into community family practices can {{be challenging}} for busy doctors, especially when new preceptors have no formal preparation or teaching experience. OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM: To develop an organized and practical approach to teaching residents in our busy rural group practice. Our seven northern Ontario family doctors have been training elective residents and clerks for 15 years. Recently, we have gone from hosting elective residents and students to teaching core family medicine residents. Our precepting plan allows us to dedicate a reasonable time to teaching while fulfilling our primary care duties. MAIN COMPONENTS: The program involves <b>contracting,</b> <b>teaching,</b> monitoring, feedback, and evaluation. CONCLUSION: We think we have developed a sustainable, workable set of teaching parameters that is applicable by various preceptors in different settings. It has simplified our teaching role and lessened our anxieties. Residents {{have benefited from the}} consistent protocol, which can be flexible enough to adapt to individual residents and preceptors, and have valued this teaching approach...|$|R
40|$|Although recent {{research}} reveals a growing engagement amongst coaches with supervision, many coaches still pursue their professional practice {{without the support}} and guidance of a supervisor. Also, while the organisations that purchase coaching are clear that the coaches they hire should have supervision, they are unclear as to what forms that supervision should take. This article sets out to identify the kind of models of supervision that might be appropriate to coaches by exploring models and lessons from the supervision of counsellors and psychotherapist. Such models are valid because many current practising coaches are professionally trained as counsellors or psychotherapists, {{and a range of}} alternative supervisory models have been tried and evaluated over several decades. Applying elements of these models to a coaching context has allowed for the design of what is termed a systemic model of coaching supervision, with <b>contracting,</b> <b>teaching</b> and evaluation at its core. Models of the supervisory relationship are also discussed as important elements of the supervisor-coach alliance...|$|R
