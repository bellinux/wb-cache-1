The use of energy management systems (EMS) and uninterruptible power systems (UPS) can be seen both ashore and afloat. Most UPS and EMS are comprised of power inverters. These inverters must comply with the military standards for conducted emissions. In this thesis, two different modulation strategies, bipolar and unipolar, are explored. The primary goal is to understand the effects each modulation strategy has on the conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) {{and then try to}} eliminate that EMI in the <b>common</b> and differential <b>mode</b> <b>paths.</b> In order to accomplish this, a laboratory experiment on an EMS using both modulation strategies was performed. The EMS was in grid-connected mode. Once the differential and <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> currents and voltages were obtained, Simulink was used to model the laboratory EMS. Once there was confidence in the model's ability to predict the laboratory behavior, a line impedance stabilization network (LISN) was added to the design. Comparing the LISN voltage to the MIL-STD showed that the current model was not within limits.

PWM rectifier operation produces electrically noisy DC bus on <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> basis. This results in higher ground current as compared to three phase diode bridge rectifier. Due to fast turn-ON and turn-OFF time of IGBT, the inverter output voltage dv/dt is high during switching transients and voltage waveform is rich in harmonics. As a result, in applications involving long cable the motor terminal voltage during the switching transient {{is as high as}} twice the applied voltage. This voltage stress reduces the life of insulation in motors. The high dv/dt output voltage applied at the motor terminal excites the parasitic capacitive coupling resulting in increased ground currents and causes Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) which reduces the life of motor bearings. The <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> voltage due to PWM rectifier and the inverter appear at the motor terminals exacerbating these problems.

Switching power supplies gener-ate two types of noise: <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> and differential mode. Differential mode noise (Figure 1 a) follows the same path as the input power. Com-mon mode noise (Figure 1 b) is rep-resented by spikes that are equal to and in phase with each other and have a circuit path through ground. To suppress EMI, a typical filter will include <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> induc-tors, differential mode inductors and X and Y capacitors.

The commonly used approach to regional filtering assumes that the <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> error is spatially uniform, which is a good approximation for networks of hundreds of kilometers extent, but breaks down as the spatial extent increases. A more rigorous approach should remove the assumption of spatially uniform distribution and let the data themselves reveal the spatial distribution of the <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> error. The principal component analysis (PCA) and the Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLE) both decompose network time series into a set of temporally varying modes and their spatial responses.
