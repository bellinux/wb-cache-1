5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} <b>CheMin</b> {{instrument}} aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The <b>CheMin</b> on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400µm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Mézières was {{approached}} {{by the city of}} Lille, which had been designated European Capital of Culture in 2004, to produce something for the celebrations. He created a series of futuristic arches, called <b>Chemin</b> des Etoiles (The Way of the Stars) along the Rue Faidherbe in the city, similar to those seen at the Port Abyss spaceport depicted in the Valérian album At the Edge of the Great Void which was first published the same year.|$|E
5|$|The 26th Infantry Division {{remained}} {{in a relatively}} quiet region of the lines along the <b>Chemin</b> des Dames for several months before it relieved the 1st Division near St. Mihiel on 3 April. The line here taken over extended from the vicinity of Apremont, on the west, in front of Xivray-Marvoisin, Seicheprey, and Bois de Remieres, {{as far as the}} Bois de Jury, on the right, where the French line joined the American line. Division Headquarters were at Boucq.|$|E
50|$|Several {{of these}} pieces {{became the basis}} of larger works: Sequenza II, with the {{addition}} of extra instrumental parts around the original solo, became <b>Chemins</b> I; Sequenza VI developed into <b>Chemins</b> II, <b>Chemins</b> IIb, <b>Chemins</b> IIc and <b>Chemins</b> III; Sequenza VII became <b>Chemins</b> IV; Sequenza XI became <b>Chemins</b> V; Sequenza X became Kol-Od, also known as <b>Chemins</b> VI; Sequenza IXb became Récit, also known as <b>Chemins</b> VII; and Sequenza VIII became Corale. Conversely, Sequenza IX grew out of a piece for clarinet and electronics (later withdrawn), originally known as <b>Chemins</b> V; NB it {{is not the same as}} the work with the same title which originates from Sequenza XI.|$|R
50|$|Berio {{is known}} for {{adapting}} and transforming the music of others, but he also adapted his own compositions: the series of Sequenze {{gave rise to a}} series of works called <b>Chemins</b> each based on one of the Sequenze. <b>Chemins</b> II (1967), for instance, takes the original Sequenza VI (1967) for viola and adapts it for solo viola and nine other instruments. <b>Chemins</b> II was itself transformed into <b>Chemins</b> III (1968) by the addition of an orchestra, and there also exists <b>Chemins</b> IIb, a version of <b>Chemins</b> II without the solo viola but with a larger ensemble, and <b>Chemins</b> IIc, which is <b>Chemins</b> IIb with an added solo bass clarinet. The Sequenze were also shaped into new works under titles other than Chemins; Corale (1981), for example, is based on Sequenza VIII.|$|R

5|$|In May 2001, Bouchard's {{successor}} Bernard Landry, who had {{until then}} {{lived in a}} three-room apartment, {{announced that he would}} accept the SITQ offer of the Édifice Price apartment, and took up occupancy in November. The choice, although praised for its symbolic location, attracted criticism that the apartment, rather small and poorly lit, could not accommodate a family (Landry was widowed from his first wife at the time). Some also noted that the former Lieutenant-Governor's residence, located at 1010 <b>Chemin</b> Saint-Louis and sold in 1996 for a fraction of its estimated value, would have made an excellent choice. From 1997 an exclusive psychiatric clinic had occupied the Price Building's second and third floors. This was moved out in 2002; the administration strongly affirmed the timing with the Premier's installation to be a complete coincidence.|$|E
5|$|The Jardines de la Galera {{date back}} to the 10th century. They are nestled between the Torre de Espantaperros and the <b>Chemin</b> de ronde, within the Alcazaba. Many Alhambran ruins still exist within the gardens, and have been open to the public since 2007 after the site was {{restored}} after being closed for more than thirty years. The etymology of the gardens {{stems from the fact that}} the gardens provided a respite for prisoners sentenced to the gallows in Seville. Plant species extant in the gardens include cinnamomum camphora, dichondra repens, ceiba speciosa, and trees of the myrtle, laurel, orange, lemon, and pomegranate. Other parks and gardens include Castelar, which has a central pond and several monuments dedicated to the romanticist writer Carolina Coronado and to Luis Chamizo Trigueros, la Legión, Rivillas y Calamón, San Fernando, and La Viña.The city also has a water and leisure park, called the Lusiberia.|$|E
5|$|D'Erlon's men {{ascended the}} slope and {{advanced}} on the sunken road, <b>Chemin</b> d'Ohain, that ran from behind La Haye Sainte and continued east. It was lined {{on both sides}} by thick hedges, with Bylandt's brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On {{the right of the}} French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the 45e Régiment de Ligne and followed by the 25e Régiment de Ligne, somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the 21e and 45e regiments. Opposing them {{on the other side of}} the road was Pack's 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the Royal Scots, the 42nd Black Watch, the 92nd Gordons and the 44th Foot totaling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.|$|E
5000|$|Sequenza VI {{was written}} in 1967 for Serge Collot, to whom the score is dedicated. It also forms the core of two other Berio compositions, <b>Chemins</b> II for viola and nine {{instruments}} (1968), and <b>Chemins</b> III (1969), which adds an orchestra to the forces of <b>Chemins</b> II. Walter Trampler, for whom <b>Chemins</b> III was written, believed it had in fact been composed first and the Sequenza then extracted from it [...] The relationship of the three works is described by Berio as being [...] "something like the layers of an onion: distinct, separate, yet intimately contoured on each other; each new layer creates a new, though related surface, and each older layer assumes a new function {{as soon as it}} is covered" [...] Two further works were evolved from <b>Chemins</b> II: <b>Chemins</b> IIb for orchestra (1969) and <b>Chemins</b> IIc for bass clarinet and orchestra (1972) [...]|$|R

5|$|The outer {{gate of the}} {{fortress}} lies in the northwestern side of the outer ward, originally within a small recess in the outer curtain wall, protected by a portcullis. The recess was later filled by the Turks with a smaller set of walls, so as to preserve unbroken the outer wall's frontage. The Ottomans also added additional buttresses to the junctions of their wall with the original curtain wall, while {{the space between the}} original gate and the new, Ottoman entrance was left unroofed and open to the sky. From the gate, the outer wall continues east and then south, in three distinct stretches of walls, to the keep. The wall is built of limestone masonry, with little evidence of brick or tiles, topped by a small inner parapet and Ottoman-built crenellations, now largely ruined. From the beginning, buildings were built leaning on the outer wall, as evidenced by the remnant of their foundations, side walls joining the curtain wall's inner face, or the presence of fireplaces and lancet windows in the curtain wall. One of these buildings is largely preserved immediately next to the outer gate. Windows, fireplaces etc. display a uniformity of style that points to their construction {{at the same time as}} {{the fortress}} itself. At the point where the outer wall joins the keep, a small postern is located, as well as a stairway leading up to the outer wall's <b>chemin</b> de ronde.|$|E
