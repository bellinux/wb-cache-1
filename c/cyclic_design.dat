A perfect <b>cyclic</b> <b>design</b> {{in the class}} PD(υ, k, λ) consists of a pair (Q, B) where Q is a set with |Q| = υ and B {{is a collection of}} cyclically ordered k-subsets of Q such that every ordered pair of elements of Q are t apart in exactly λ of the blocks for t = 1, 2, 3,…, k− 1. To clarify matters the block [a 1, a 2, …, ak] has cyclic order a 1 < a 2 < a 3 … < ak < a 1 and ai and ai+ 1 are said to be t apart in the block where i + t is taken mod k. In this paper we are interested only in the cases where λ = 1 and υ ≡ 1 mod k. Such a design has υ(υ − 1) k blocks. If the blocks can be partitioned into υ sets containing (υ − 1) k pairwise disjoint blocks the design is said to be resolvable, and any such partitioning of the blocks {{is said to be a}} resolution. Any set of υ − 1) k pairwise disjoint blocks together with a singleton consisting of the only element not in one of the blocks is called a parallel class. Any resolution of a design yields υ parallel classes. We denote by RPD(υ, k, 1) the class of all resolvable perfect cyclic designs with parameters υ, k, and 1.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project on Ecological Concrete was to reduce the CO 2 -emission of concrete and to reuse secondary materials form concrete production and other industries simultaneously. This also minimizes the use {{of natural resources and}} the production costs. To replace cement in concrete in a safe way, the main question answered in this thesis was how particle packing models can be used to predict the mechanical properties of ecological concrete from its basic components. To optimize ecological concrete on packing density the Compaction-Interaction Packing Model was developed, in which particle interaction of fillers is taken into account. The developed <b>cyclic</b> <b>design</b> method for ecological concrete, which is based on the packing density, water demand and strength, enables concrete mixture optimization based on performance.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} decentralized hypothesis testing under communication constraints in a topology where several peripheral nodes are arranged in tandem. Each node receives an observation and transmits a message to its successor, and the last node then decides which hypothesis is true. We assume that the observations at different nodes are, conditioned on the true hypothesis, independent and the channel between any two successive nodes is considered error-free but rate-constrained. We propose a <b>cyclic</b> <b>design</b> algorithm {{for the design of}} nodes using the minimum expected error probability as a design criterion in a person-by-person methodology, where the number of communicated messages is not necessarily equal to the number of hypotheses. The number of peripheral nodes in the proposed method is in principle arbitrary and the information rate constraints are satisfied by quantizing the input of each node. The performance of the proposed method for different information rate constraints, in a binary hypothesis test, is compared to the optimum rate-one solution due to Swaszek’s and a method proposed by Cover, and it is shown numerically that increasing the channel rate can significantly enhance the performance of the tandem network.

40|$|For {{many years}} fatigue in soils {{has been a}} major design challenge. Due to cyclic loading the {{material}} behavior changes and permanent deformations are observed. Although explicit cyclic calculation methods exists, none are ideal for <b>cyclic</b> <b>design</b> computation. The available methods are currently either to simplified, labor-intensive or inaccurate. A framework based on Python, Matlab and Fortran has been developed for creating soil models and doing cyclic simulations.

An average and a cyclic material model based on elasto-plasticity and non-linear elasticity has been created and coupled together. A state variable used to model material softening is used to couple the materials. The material equations were defined in Matlab and generated as object-oriented Fortran code ready to be compiled together with a Fortran wrapper. Plane strain simulations has been done for monopiles, represented by a wall, and gravity based structures. The results are encouraging.

In this paper a <b>cyclic</b> <b>design</b> method based on particle packing is presented and evaluated {{on the basis of}} experiments on cement pastes combined with quartz powder. The packing density of sixteen pastes is measured using the mixing energy test. Furthermore, the cement pastes were tested on compressive strength at 7 and 28 days. Adding quartz powder M 600 can increase the packing density by more than 10 %. This means that fine quartz powders can improve the packing density to such extent that the cement content can be decreased while simultaneously the water cement ratio is decreased. This occurs for pastes with a packing density higher than the completely saturated packing density of cement. Additional strength tests were performed on two mixtures with constant water cement ratio and showed a 15 % strength increase when 20 % of the cement was replaced by quartz powder M 600. In the design procedure for ecological concrete, increased strength efficiency can be balanced by lowering the amount of cement. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

Space time coding (STC) is a scheme that employs multiple antennas to increase transmission rate or to improve transmission quality. STC is used widely in mobile cellular networks, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and wireless metropolitan area networks (WMAN). However, {{there are still}} many unsolved or partially solved issues in STC. In this thesis, I propose a new STC design from <b>cyclic</b> <b>design.</b> I then propose a systematic method to design quasi-orthogonal space time block codes (QOSTBC) for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas, and derive the optimal constellation rotation angles to achieve full diversity. I also propose an analytical method to derive the exact error probabilities of orthogonal space time block codes (OSTBC). In order to improve the error performance, I introduce an adaptive power allocation scheme for OSTBC. Combining STC with continuous phase modulation (CPM) is an attractive solution for mobile commu- nications for which power is limited. Thus, I apply OSTBC to binary CPM with modulation index h = 0. 5, and develop a simplified receiver for such scheme. Finally, I present a decoding method to reduce the complexity of QOSTBC without degrading its error performance...|$|E

This first phase of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>design</b> research involved 20 in-service trained chemistry teachers from elementary to high school level and two researchers. The aim was to collaboratively develop and test teaching concepts that the teachers had created within in-service training courses over a period of two years. The research questions were: (i) How to develop concepts of chemistry teaching that combine IBL with LCA? and (ii) What kind of teaching concepts related to LCA do chemistry teachers develop in their own practice? The study presents a framework for the development process of new practices in chemistry teaching. The findings reveal that teachers can combine LCA with IBL on all school levels in several different ways. The most popular approach was a project-based student-centered inquiry concept, which combined social and personal teaching strategies. The study suggests that LCA-IBL approaches should be im-plemented into chemistry education at all school levels. The opportunities to foster several modern educational goals, including scientific literacy and sustain-ability competence, are also discussed.

Ethical considerations are introduced so that students engage with a range of people in a respectful and confidential manner in the process.

40|$|Plant {{phenotyping}} includes {{monitoring of}} rather complex plant processes which {{are linked to}} environmental factors. As complete homogeneity of the factors like temperature, light, water and airflow is usually impossible, it is of importance to optimize experiment design to exclude {{the impact of these}} compound factors. Furthermore, an optimization of cost, throughput and reliability of the data for high-throughput (HTP) phenotyping depends largely on the experimental design. To do this, an existing R package “agricolae” in statistical software R (de Mendiburu, 2009) was modified to generate 13 frequently used experimental designs (completely randomized design, randomized complete block design, Latin squared design, split-plot design, Graece-Latin design, augmented design, Youden design, Balance incomplete design, <b>cyclic</b> <b>design,</b> lattice design, alpha design, strip-plot design, and factorial design). The modified R package has been applied in generating different experimental designs for our common experiment with maize, barley, rapeseed, wheat, and sugar beet in the field and Arabidopsis 1001 genome phenotyping experiment in the screen chamber in 2015. A semi-automated pipeline for statistical analysis with these experimental designs and the data from high-throughput phenotyping experiments has been developed. The statistical functions include: descriptive statistics, frequency and correlation analysis, imputation of missing data with consideration of distribution of the sample data, detection of outlier data, determination of optimal replicates, verifying the assumptions of the linear model, data transformation, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with appropriate statistical models, interaction of different factors, multiple comparisons with different methods, time-serials or repeated measured data analysis, and so on. Graphic user interfaces (GUI) are under development for all statistical analysis procedures so that non-experienced R users can easily automate the selection of a suitable experimental design and the data analysis afterwards by using a step-by-step selection workflow as well as make it possible to monitor and analyze these experiments even during the run.
