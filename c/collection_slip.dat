40|$|We propose an {{analytical}} method, namely the SORTAN method, {{to determine the}} sense of slip on faults as induced by stresses. This method is useful to infer the sense of motion along faults whose surface cannot be directly accessed, such as faults imaged in the subsurface. Because the SORTAN method {{is based on the}} Wallace-Bott hypothesis, we assume that the shear stress vector applied to a given fault is parallel to the slip vector on this fault. The assumptions allow for simplification of the method that in turn implies very short calculation times. A concise formalism is adopted. We introduce the stress ratio Φ′ that accounts for (1) the type of stress regime (i. e., strike-slip, reverse or normal) and (2) the degree of anisotropy of the stress state. The formalism of the SORTAN method permits an easy exploration and imaging of the complete <b>collection</b> of <b>slip</b> motions that may theoretically occur on fault planes. The input parameters are the fault plane orientation, the type and anisotropy of the stress regime, and the azimuth of the horizontal stress axes...|$|R

2500|$|Murray {{started the}} project, {{working in a}} {{corrugated}} iron outbuilding called the [...] "Scriptorium" [...] which was lined with wooden planks, book shelves, and 1,029 pigeon-holes for the quotation slips. He tracked and regathered Furnivall's <b>collection</b> of quotation <b>slips,</b> which were found to concentrate on rare, interesting words rather than common usages. For instance, there were ten times as many quotations for abusion as for abuse. [...] He appealed, through newspapers distributed to bookshops and libraries, for readers who would report [...] "as many quotations as you can for ordinary words" [...] and for words that were [...] "rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar or used in a peculiar way". Murray had American philologist and liberal arts college professor Francis March manage the collection in North America; 1,000 quotation slips arrived daily to the Scriptorium and, by 1880, there were 2,500,000.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} 500 submorphemic slips of the typewriter key that escaped the notice of authors and other proofreaders and thereby {{made their way into}} the published records of scientific research. Despite this high selectivity, the corpus is not found to differ in major ways from other <b>collections</b> of keying <b>slips.</b> The main characteristics of this error type include a predomi-nance of within-word slips, an elevated rate of noncontextual slips, a heightened incidence of omis-sions (in particular, masking errors), a high number of adjacent switches, and an uncommonness of these slips in word edges. In all these respects, slips of the key resemble slips of the pen, although not slips of the tongue. It is argued that speech errors are shaped by a fully deployed structural representation, whereas key slips arise under the influence of a weak structural representation. By implication, speaking is characterized by a hierarchical strategy of activation while typewriting is subject to the so-called staircase strategy of serialization in which activation is a function of linear distance. These disparate strategies may be understood as a response of the processing system to disparate requirements, such as varying speed of execution...|$|R
40|$|For {{the project}} of the Historical Dictionary of Hungarian a {{carefully}} selected representative corpus was collected (24. 5 million running words). The texts were chosen from three centuries. A morphological analyser programme was successfully run on the modern texts, but {{the analysis of the}} earlier texts was problematic. In our paper we will describe a method for the conversion and analysis of archaic texts, without losing the original word forms. The Historical Dictionary project itself, and the analyser developed for the modern text, will also be reported briefly. 1. The Historical Dictionary project and its corpus The project first started in the late 19 th c ntury with the collection of old fashioned dictionary slips. The idea was to compile an OED-like dictionary which covers the vocabulary of the Hungarian language from 1772 up to the time of collection. (There exists an historical dictionary for the former period: Czuczor G & Fogarasi J 1862). The <b>collection</b> of the <b>slips</b> continued until about 1960. From time to time there was an attempt to compile some draft entries based on this collection, but somehow or other these experiments always happened to fail. Possibly these repeated failures were partly {{due to the lack of}} an adequate personality in charge of a project at this scale (Hutás, 1974). Without a dedicated and convinced chief editor not even a one volume dictionary can ever be completed, not t...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThanks to citizen-side contributions, {{heritage}} {{scientists can}} now quite often gather {{large amount of}} spatio-temporal data about heritage artefacts. In the context of minor heritage <b>collections,</b> which often <b>slip</b> through large-scale heritage programs, accessing such data sets may be a decisive turn in uncovering important clues, or significant relationships in and across collections. In other words, the " citizen science " paradigm seemingly opens a whole new range of opportunities at research level (e. g., enrichment of data, comparative analyses, multidisciplinary annotations) and for collection holders (e. g., networking, " intangible " museums). Yet, {{due to the nature}} of such data sets (e. g., heterogeneity in the wording, in the precision, verifiability issues, contradictions), these opportunities also raise challenges, in particular when wanting to foster cross examinations by heritage scientists. The global objective of our research is to better weigh how the nature of citizen-side contributions can impact the way information can be recorded, formalized, and visualized. In this paper a clear focus is put on the space and time parameters: geo-visualization, and spatio-temporal data visualization. The paper introduces a series of open-source geo-visualization solutions that have been designed for use in the context of information sets harvested from citizen-side e-sources, and that help document minor heritage assets. The results we present show that hybrid visualizations can act as a basis for comparative reasoning and analysis, but also that the core service we should manage to offer is definitely an infovis one: getting to understand (at last) what we really know (and ignore) ...|$|R

Madumathi said here on Wednesday. She told The Hindu that the distribution of booth slips at the doorsteps of the voters by polling officials could not be carried out due to delay in arrival of the slips. Stating that the slips reached the Returning Offices of the Assembly segments only on Monday night, she said that it would be impossible for the officials to complete the door-to-door distribution. By engaging officials to do that they could not be involved in other election-related activities, she added. The Collector also clarified that there was no standing instruction from the Election Commission directing the officials to distribute the slips door-to-door.But for Rasipuram (SC) Assembly segment where the booth slips reached late compared to the other five Assembly segments there was good response from the voters as they thronged the booths to collect their slips. At Rasipuram, the distribution started around 12 noon and was extended till the late hours of the day to facilitate the voters, she said.According to her a total 1,360 polling officials - one each for the 1,360 polling stations across the district - were involved in distribution of the slips. She said that there is a proposal to carry out a door-to-door booth slip distribution drive on Friday and Saturday to ensure 100 percent distribution.Voters of the six Assembly segments could get further information or irregularities on collecting booth slips by contacting the Returning Officer (RO) and Assistant RO in the numbers mentioned below: Rasipuram (SC) assembly segment: RO V.
