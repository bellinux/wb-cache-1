5|$|Article 14(2)(a) of the Constitution {{provides}} that Parliament may restrict {{the right to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression to provide against <b>contempt</b> of court. One of the more prominent uses of the court's <b>contempt</b> power has been for the Attorney-General to charge persons with the common law offence of scandalizing the court.|$|E
5|$|Harper's Cabinet was {{defeated}} in a no-confidence vote on March 25, 2011, after being found in <b>contempt</b> of parliament. Harper thus, in accordance with constitutional convention, advised the Governor General to call a general election. This was the first occurrence in Commonwealth history of a government in the Westminster parliamentary tradition losing {{the confidence of the}} lower house on the grounds of <b>contempt</b> of parliament. The no-confidence motion was carried with a vote of 156 in favour of the motion and 145 against.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{a former}} {{executive}} of Jay Cooke refused to testify before Congress and was found in <b>contempt</b> and detained. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to release him in Kilbourn v. Thompson.|$|E
5|$|Italy now {{effectively}} {{became an}} occupied country, as the Germans poured in troops. Italy's decision to switch sides created <b>contempt</b> for the Italians among both the Allies and Germans, {{which was to}} have far-reaching consequences.|$|E
5|$|Selfe's <b>contempt</b> for {{the liberal}} arts {{tradition}} and the priority he accorded practical skill have certain implications which cannot be commended. These reflected and augmented... one of the less attractive features of the Australian ethos– indifference to higher learning and advanced attainments, an indifference shading into <b>contempt</b> and suspicion... Selfe may have lost a battle but before long, {{the liberal arts}} tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised {{is that in the}} vehemence of the struggle, and in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable in the liberal arts tradition was lost.|$|E
5|$|Diomedes soon does win her heart. In Benoît, it {{is through}} his display of love and she gives him her glove as a token. Troilus seeks him out in battle and utterly defeats him. He saves Diomedes' life, only {{so that he can}} bring her a message of Troilus' <b>contempt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Freedom {{of speech}} and expression, on which the State can impose {{reasonable}} restrictions {{in the interests of}} the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to <b>contempt</b> of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.|$|E
5|$|In July 2000 it was {{announced}} that Punch magazine was to be prosecuted for <b>contempt</b> of court after publishing an article by former MI5 agent David Shayler. Shayler's article claimed MI5 could have stopped the Bishopsgate bombing, which a spokesman for Attorney General Lord Williams claimed was a breach of a 1997 court injunction preventing Shayler disclosing information on security or intelligence matters. In November 2000 Punch and its editor were found guilty and fined £20,000 and £5,000 respectively. In March 2001 the editor successfully appealed against his conviction and fine, with an appeal judge accusing the Attorney General of acting like a press censor and ruling that the 1997 injunction was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 2002 this decision was overturned at the House of Lords, with five law lords ruling that editor James Steen's publication of Shayler's article was indeed in <b>contempt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Isa was demoted in 1987, because Abu Nidal {{believed}} he had become too close to other figures within the ANO. Always keen to punish members by humiliating them, Abu Nidal insisted he remain in the Intelligence Directorate, forcing him to work for his previous subordinates, who according to Seale were told to treat him with <b>contempt.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lincoln rarely raised {{objections}} in the courtroom; {{but in an}} 1859 case, {{where he}} defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, {{who was accused of}} stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in <b>contempt</b> of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.|$|E
5|$|Newnes {{stipulated that}} Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} must sail under the British flag, and be styled the British Antarctic Expedition. Borchgrevink readily agreed to this, even though {{only two of}} the entire expedition party were British. This increased the hostility and <b>contempt</b> of Markham, who chastised RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch.|$|E
5|$|Offenses where impalement was {{occasionally}} employed include: <b>contempt</b> for the state's {{responsibility for}} safe roads and trade routes by committing highway robbery or grave robbery, violating state policies or monopolies, or subverting standards for trade. Offenders {{have also been}} impaled {{for a variety of}} cultural, sexual and religious reasons.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, {{regarded}} {{the state of}} the national capital as an embarrassment. Over time his attitude changed from one of <b>contempt</b> to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city, feeling that their performance lacked intensity.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens in}} medias res to Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{as she is}} brought before a Senate select {{committee}} to be questioned about the whereabouts of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Scully refuses to answer the committee's questions and attempts to read a statement denouncing the conspiracy within the government. Senator Sorenson threatens to hold Scully in <b>contempt</b> of Congress.|$|E
5|$|The film opens as Mr. Wilson reads {{a letter}} he has {{received}} from his son Neto, in which Neto declares his <b>contempt</b> for his father. It {{is followed by a}} flashback to explain the story; Neto, a São Paulo middleclass teenager, has a troubled relationship with his father and his mother, Meire.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} press {{reporting}} on {{aspects of the}} case led to legal proceedings against several UK newspapers. Libel action was brought by Jefferies against eight publications over their coverage of his arrest, resulting in the payment to him of substantial damages. The Daily Mirror and The Sun were found guilty of <b>contempt</b> of court for reporting information that could prejudice a trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{storytelling}} {{tends to}} be melodramatic, and the stories {{tend to focus on}} struggles against social oppression in which characters are silenced by economic, political, and other social forces. The characters are clearly delineated as good or evil—the good drawn sympathetically and the evil with the <b>contempt</b> of the artist's moral indignation.|$|E
5|$|The {{young men}} and women of Hazelwood East {{expected}} a civics lesson, but not the one the Court teaches them today...Such unthinking <b>contempt</b> for individual rights is intolerable from any state official. It is particularly insidious from (a school principal) to whom the public entrusts the task of inculcating in its youth an appreciation for the cherished democratic liberties that our constitution guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Unique to Article 14(2)(a) is an {{addendum}} {{stating that}} the right to freedom of speech and expression may be curtailed by restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament, or to provide against <b>contempt</b> of court, defamation or incitement to any offence. The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds.|$|E
5|$|A {{declaration}} is only {{as effective}} as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement of the law in it, as it is not a <b>contempt</b> of court to ignore a declaration. In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit Webster to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it did not agree with Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not <b>contempt.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{second meeting}} {{occurred}} on 8 May, when Virginia came out while Monitor {{and four other}} Federal ships bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point. The Federal ships retired slowly to Fort Monroe, hoping to lure Virginia into the Roads. She did not follow, however, and after firing a gun to windward {{as a sign of}} <b>contempt,</b> anchored off Sewell's Point. Later when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy Virginia.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} American adults {{conducted}} by YouGov in September 2015 found that 56% supported Judge Bunning's decision to jail Davis for <b>contempt</b> of court, while 31% of Americans opposed the decision. When asked what Davis should do, 65% said that Davis should resign from office; 23% said that Davis {{should stay in}} office and continue to refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples; and 4% said that Davis should remain in office but issue licenses to all persons legally entitled to one.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda under Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman on 9 November 2005, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. The attack {{is considered to}} be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal security was dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with <b>contempt</b> by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West.|$|E
5|$|Andrea and Shane then {{go off to}} town after Shane finds a lead on {{the missing}} Sophia, but find it overrun by walkers. They escape after Andrea rediscovers her {{shooting}} abilities, and the two subsequently begin an affair. Dale senses something amiss and warns Shane to stay from Andrea, {{as well as his}} suspicion of what happened to Otis while he and Shane went searching for medical supplies, and his <b>contempt</b> for Rick. Shane denies the accusations and threatens to shoot Dale should he make any more.|$|E
5|$|As Marge {{prepares to}} leave Vancouver, she reveals to Homer {{that she is}} left-handed, but has always used her right hand to avoid seeming unusual (due to years of using her right hand, it renders her cross-dominant). She has enough dexterity to change Maggie's diaper and dress her one-handed. They return to the rink {{just in time to}} stop Seymour from {{forfeiting}} the match and go on to defeat Sweden for the gold. Agnes softens her attitude of unyielding <b>contempt</b> toward her son after he breaks his broom and has to drop out, and Marge and Homer agree that they had a great date night.|$|E
5|$|Augustine St. Clare – Tom's {{third owner}} {{and father of}} Eva. St. Clare is complex, often sarcastic, with a ready wit. After a rocky {{courtship}} he marries a woman he grows to hold in <b>contempt,</b> though he is too polite to let it show. St. Clare recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but {{is not willing to}} relinquish the wealth it brings him. After his daughter's death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the Bible to Tom. He plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves, but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Both parties {{reached a}} {{settlement}} on 20 April 2007, agreeing {{to drop their}} respective lawsuits. Under {{the terms of the}} settlement, Thompson has been barred from suing to ban the sale or distribution of games by Take-Two or its subsidiaries. He is restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matter, but is able to maintain his outspoken stance against their titles and may act as counsel in lawsuits against Take-Two by other parties. For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop the <b>contempt</b> of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged improper conduct during the court hearings for Rockstar's game Bully in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Chartjackers {{garnered}} a viewing figures peak {{of almost}} half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers. Some commentators felt that the programme's concept was ridiculous and doomed from the start, others felt that the series showed a <b>contempt</b> for music and the general public, and other critics questioned whether {{the point of the}} project was to raise money for charity or for the four bloggers to promote themselves. The show was nominated for a 2010 Broadcast Digital Award in the Best Multi-Platform Project category, but lost out to The Operation...Surgery Live.|$|E
5|$|Day {{focussed}} on the girls' education, in {{the style}} of Emile. He expanded on the teaching they had received from the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he {{wanted to be able to}} debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical <b>contempt</b> for luxury.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{authorized}} {{and actual}} sentence, upon demand, a criminal defendant {{has a right}} to trial by jury. The defendant does not have a right, conversely, to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution. If the defendant is charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months, whether in state or federal court, the defendant {{has a right to}} a jury. Further, the defendant has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. <b>contempt</b> of court).|$|E
5|$|During the 1950 campaign, both Nixon and Douglas {{were accused}} of having a voting record {{comparable}} to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio. The sole congressman from the American Labor Party at the time, Marcantonio represented East Harlem. He was accused of being a communist, though he denied being one; he rarely discussed the Soviet Union or communism. Marcantonio opposed restrictions on communists and the Communist Party, stating that such restrictions violated the Bill of Rights. He regularly voted against <b>contempt</b> citations requested by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), on which Nixon served.|$|E
5|$|Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a {{vigorous}} supporter of old-age pensions, {{free trade and}} several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy and spoke {{in support of the}} children of Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in <b>contempt</b> of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The <b>contempt</b> of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and <b>contempt</b> of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
5|$|In 1983's Never Say Never Again, Edward Fox played M as a bureaucrat, {{contemptuous of}} Bond—far {{removed from the}} {{relationship}} shared between Bernard Lee's M and Sean Connery's Bond; the academic Jeremy Black notes that the <b>contempt</b> felt for the 00 section by Fox's M was reciprocated by Connery's Bond. Fox's M is also younger {{than any of the}} previous incarnations. The media historian James Chapman notes that whilst M considers Bond to be an out-dated relic, the Foreign Secretary orders the 00 section to be re-activated.|$|E
5|$|In March 1904 Neild {{attacked}} the government's military {{policy and the}} commander of the military forces, Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, who had long wished to dismiss Neild from the citizen army. Neild had incited a near mutiny by destroying a well-known sergeant's military career, and was suspended from duty; Neild responded by accusing Hutton of intimidation and infringing a Senator's right of freedom of expression. In April 1904 the Senate formed a committee to investigate alleged <b>contempt</b> of Parliament by Hutton, which found that Neild had not been intimidated. In 1905 Neild retired from the militia.|$|E
