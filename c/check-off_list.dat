50|$|The Spokane Trophy {{is awarded}} by Commander United States Pacific Fleet on a cycle basis {{to the surface}} {{combatant}} ship {{considered to be the}} most proficient in overall combat systems readiness and warfare operations. The nomination will be submitted by the type commander based on the recommendations of the ISIC (Immediate Superior In Charge). Because the award is to recognize demonstrated ability to fully conduct, on a sustained basis, simultaneous and coordinated air warfare, surface warfare, and undersea warfare operations with all installed equipment, no <b>check-off</b> <b>list</b> of particular criteria is appropriate nor can a ship explicitly work for nomination for the award other than by routinely striving for the highest levels of combat systems training and material excellence. The actual Spokane Trophy is made of 400 ounces of silver and is valued at $4 million.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this correlational {{study was to determine}} if there was congruity among the Directors (members) of the Joint Review Committee on Educational Programs in Nuclear Medicine Technology (JRCNMT) when they reviewed the same self-study. A self-study report from an institution requesting new or continued accreditation is required by the JRCNMT before a site-visit is arranged. This self-study, written to satisfy the standards as delineated in the 2 ̆ 2 Essentials and Guidelines of an Accredited Educational Program for the Nuclear Medicine Technologist, 2 ̆ 2 (Essentials), is first examined by two of the twelve JRCNMT Directors. The analysis determines any areas requiring more information, along with instructions for the site-visitors. In this research project two self-studies, based on actual institution self-studies, were reviewed by the twelve current Directors of the JRCNMT. The review consisted of using a <b>check-off</b> <b>list</b> with the seven areas of the Essentials subdivided into descriptors. The sum of each of the seven areas as rated by the Director reviewers were compared to one another for consistency. There was no significant interrater reliability (p 3 ̆e. 05) among the Director reviewers on one self-study, while review of the second self-study demonstrated statistical significance (r =. 68, p 3 ̆c. 02). There were no significant correlations between any demographic data and the Director reviews on one self-study; but on the other self-study, there were significant correlations between the Director reviews and the number of years of their active service to the professional organization (r =. 74, p 3 ̆c. 01), and number of years they were practicing nuclear medicine or nuclear medicine technology (r =. 69, p 3 ̆c. 02). There is preliminary evidence that the degree of compliance with the Essentials determines consistency of review, and the (1) number of years of active service to the professional organization, and (2) number of years practicing nuclear medicine or nuclear medicine technology correlates with the reviews of self-studies in compliance with the Essentials. ...|$|E
40|$|This action {{research}} study examines parent-teacher communication {{using a combination}} of an online email program called MailChimp, a text app called Remind, and a class web page. A group of 17 parents from a private elementary classroom in a Montessori school agreed to participate in this study. Time sheets, <b>check-off</b> <b>lists,</b> feedback from parents, and statistics from MailChimp were used to collect data. The majority of the parents were pleased with the school-to-home communication during this period. The email and text message programs were the most efficient communication methods. Updating the class web page proved to be the most time-consuming communication process. This study showed why teachers should use a variety of correspondence methods in order to be effective communicators. While I will continue to use MailChimp, Remind, and my web page for parent-teacher communication, I also discovered there is room for improvemen...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the {{conceptual}} power of Dooyeweerdian philosophy for designing technology is reviewed. It is {{shown that the}} philosophical richness {{of the theory of}} modal aspects, the theory of individuality structures, and the theory of ground motives has to be disclosed to engineers in order to apply them in their daily practice. The Triple I model has been developed with engineers in a dialogical process. This model takes user practice as a starting point and analyses this practice from three different perspectives: identity or intrinsic values of the user practice; inclusion of the justified interests of stakeholders, and the ideals, dreams and values that co-shape designs. Other philosophical tools are the theories of modal aspects and of individuality structures. All these tools are made concrete for engineering practice by means of schemes, drawings, design questions, moral standards, <b>check-off</b> <b>lists</b> and design heuristics. By adopting this model, it is hoped that these tools can be fruitfully applied in engineering practice...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few years, many {{interesting}} papers have been written {{on the subject of}} product-market diversification. A majority of the writers have dealt with either case histories of successful diversification or with qualitative <b>check-off</b> <b>lists</b> to be used in analyzing specific diversification opportunities. A much smaller group of papers has been devoted to formulation of a systematic approach which a company can use to compare alternative diversification decisions. This paper falls in the latter category. As a first step, diversification is defined and distinguished from other company growth alternatives. Typical growth perspectives are described which may motivate a company to diversify. Diversification objectives are established and related to the company's long-range objectives. A two-step evaluation scheme is proposed for selection of the preferred diversification strategy. The first is a qualitative step, which narrows a wide field of diversification opportunities to a selected few which are consistent with the company's diversification objectives and long-range policy. In the second step, a quantitative procedure is outlined for evaluating the relative profit potential of the selected alternatives. Finally, limitations of the present method are discussed. ...|$|R
