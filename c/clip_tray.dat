500|$|The G2 {{ships with}} Android 4.2.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] with a custom {{interface}} and software. It contains {{a number of}} features {{that are designed to}} [...] "learn" [...] from users by predicting future actions, and allow for flexibility and customization. The G2 retains features from previous LG models such as the Optimus G and G Pro, including QuickMemo (which allows users to write notes on top of a screenshot), QuickRemote (a feature which allows the device to serve as a universal remote), QSlide pop-up apps, and Voice Mate. New features introduced by the G2 include TextLink, which analyzes text messages to detect content such as addresses and times that can be passed to other apps (such as the calendar, a note, or Google Maps), a pop-up menu of relevant apps triggered when plugging in headphones or a USB cable (Plug & Pop), the ability to answer a phone call by holding the phone to the user's head (AnswerMe), Slide Aside, a multitasking feature which allows users to [...] "slide" [...] away apps onto cards with a three-finger gesture, the <b>Clip</b> <b>Tray</b> (which collects content that had been copied to the clipboard), and Guest Mode. The G2 uses on-screen buttons; users can change their background color (which includes black and white options, either solid colored or with a gradient), customize the order of the buttons, or add additional buttons for opening QuickMemo or the notification shade. The G2's default music player supports the playback of WAV and FLAC files with 24-bit/192kHz audio.|$|E

5000|$|For {{many years}} (c. 1960s) there was, {{opposite}} the lighthouse, a drive-in roadhouse named [...] "The Doll's House", where white {{people used to}} go for a snack and coffee during the day, or after a movie at night, which was served on a <b>tray</b> <b>clipped</b> to the window of the vehicle. The local seagulls became wise to this smorgasbord and many a patron lost his or her sandwich to a robber gull that had landed {{on the roof of the}} car.|$|R
