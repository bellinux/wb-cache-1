5|$|Between 1859 and 1860, Frewin Hall {{housed the}} future Edward VII whilst he {{attended}} Christ Church. The <b>chapel</b> <b>and</b> old kitchen were planned to {{form part of}} a new, third, quadrangle for Brasenose. The valuable rents that the shops {{on the south side}} of Brasenose earned the college provided the most significant reason for the delay in further expansion, which only began in 1886 when work on the west side was started. It was finally completed in 1911, the last work having been done to the High Street frontage. Frewin Hall was reconstructed between 1887 and 1896, as were the <b>chapel</b> <b>and</b> antechapel. It had been in 1886 that Cradock had died and was replaced by Albert Watson.|$|E
