50|$|In civil {{engineering}} applications, one typically considers structures {{to be in}} static equilibrium: that is, are either unchanging with time, or are changing slowly enough for viscous stresses to be unimportant (quasi-static). In mechanical and aerospace engineering, however, stress analysis must often be performed on parts that are far from equilibrium, such as vibrating plates or rapidly spinning wheels and axles. In those cases, the equations of motion must include terms that account for the acceleration of the particles. In structural design applications, one usually tries to ensure the stresses are everywhere well below the yield strength of the material. In the case of dynamic loads, the material fatigue {{must also be taken}} into account. However, these concerns lie outside the scope of stress analysis proper, being covered in materials science under the names strength of materials, fatigue analysis, stress <b>corrosion,</b> <b>creep</b> modeling, and other.|$|E
50|$|For {{many years}} after the new art deco fronted {{building}} was opened in 1939 the work {{was carried out in}} laboratories fronting on Euston Street, London, NW1. These included three parallel four-story blocks of laboratories and offices with the basements being used for the heaviest equipment and for storage of samples. In 1953 the Euston Street building was extended {{to the right of the}} main entrance making the address 81-103 Euston Street, N W 1, with the laboratories behind being in Regnart Buildings and Euston Buildings which fronted on Stephenson Street. The extension was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh who then toured all departments. The laboratories were grouped in specialist sections, including Analytical Chemistry, <b>Corrosion,</b> <b>Creep</b> Testing, Electroplating, Fatigue Testing, General Metallurgy, Information Library, Mechanical Testing, Melting and Casting, Members Liaison, Metallography, Metal Working, Physics (X-ray crystallography), Spectrography. The laboratories were an excellent training ground both for assistants who studied for their qualifications part-time and for recent graduates from universities. As such members found that staff could be ideal recruits for industrial work. There were 150-200 staff and the average time for researchers to stay was about three years and they could then be found in industries in Britain and world-wide. From the late 1930s to the 1960s through the war and then post-war recovery the Director was Mr G. L. Bailey with Miss E. M. (Helen) Hills as his secretary.|$|E

This phenomenon was identified as <b>creep</b> <b>corrosion</b> and was the motivation for this work. This dissertation advances the state of knowledge on the <b>creep</b> <b>corrosion</b> process and the strategies for mitigation. A range of plastic encapsulated packages with noble metal pre-plated leadframes, from different vendors, with different package attributes, were used in this study. <b>Creep</b> <b>corrosion</b> on the mold compound surface was reproduced in an accelerated manner using mixed flowing gas (MFG) testing in laboratory conditions. Of the three most widely-used industry-standard MFG testing conditions, Telcordia Outdoor was found to be the most effective environment to induce and promote <b>creep</b> <b>corrosion</b> over the mold compound; Battelle Class III environment can also induce the similar effects of <b>creep</b> <b>corrosion</b> on mold compound, but in a limited rate on selective packages; Telcordia Indoor was found to induce no <b>creep</b> <b>corrosion</b> on the mold compound over a 30 day test time. In both Telcordia Outdoor and Battelle Class III environments, packages attributes and applied pre-conditionings were found to have no significant influence on the <b>creep</b> <b>corrosion</b> effect. <b>Creep</b> <b>corrosion</b> over the mold compound showed a dendritic formation. The thickness of the corrosion product layer on the mold compound tended to increase with increased exposure time. <b>Creep</b> <b>corrosion</b> products were electrically conductive and were able to bridge the adjacent leads, thereby causing electrical shorts. The corrosion products were found to consist primarily of copper oxides, copper chlorides, and copper sulfides. No distinct differences in corrosion products composition was observed on the lead versus the mold compound surfaces.

40|$|Summary. The {{properties}} and applications of magnesium alloys have been increasingly investigated {{due to their}} light weight and high specific strength. Recent studies indicate that an addition of tin (Sn) to magnesium (Mg) significantly increases the corrosion resistance of the latter. Also, the addition of calcium (Ca) increases the creep resistance of ternary Mg-Sn-Ca alloys. Therefore, such alloys {{have been developed to}} address the dual demands of high <b>corrosion</b> and <b>creep</b> resistance at service temperatures, and would be widely acceptable if they could be converted into wrought alloys. The specific alloy selected for this study is Mg 3 Sn 1 Ca. Though this composition is synonymous with the popular AZ 31 type alloys, the microstructures of these two types are quite different. While AZ 31 alloys basically involve single phase with aluminium (Al) and Zinc (Zn) present in the form of solid solution in Mg, the selected Mg-Sn-Ca alloy has two phase microstructure in the form of particles distributed in a matrix. However, such a microsturcture requires careful consideration in terms of forming operations to convert the material into wrought status. The experiments involved hot compression testing conducted over a temperature range 300 to 550 o C and a strain rate range 0. 0003 to 10 s- 1 using a computer-controlled servo-hydraulic testing machine. The recorded force and compression measurements are converted into corresponding stress- strain curves. Through the analysis of such results, conditions for good formability are identified along with characterization of the deformed material. It is found that this alloy is suitable for hot deformation and could be established as a new standard wrought material for applications requiring improvement in <b>corrosion</b> and <b>creep</b> resistance...|$|R
40|$|Thermally sprayed {{aluminium}} (TSA) {{is widely}} used for corrosion protection on offshore installations. Rapid degradation of the TSA has earlier been discovered, if organic coating is applied {{on top of the}} TSA. In case of coating damages on the TSA, a duplex corrosion mechanism may occur. Due to access limitations with coating equipment or hot work limitations offshore, application of new TSA may be difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a repair coating for TSA in connection with damage. The repair coating must provide corrosion protection without triggering the duplex corrosion mechanism and shall be applied without removing the intact TSA. Eight repair coatings were tested on steel coated with TSA to determine the corrosion behavior in marine environment. Four possible protection mechanisms were considered: (1) cathodic polarization, (2) buffering capacity, (3) ability to release an aggressive environment formed under the coating and (4) electrical conductive coatings. The coatings contained anodic elements such as aluminium, zinc or magnesium, except for an inorganic copolymer coating and an MgO pigmented coating. A cyclic coating test was conducted for 20 cycles according to ISO 20340. Highest amount of <b>corrosion</b> <b>creep</b> for the TSA was seen for the Zn epoxy, the inorganic copolymer coating, the high Zn primer and the modified Zn epoxy. An average <b>corrosion</b> <b>creep</b> of approximately 5. 1 mm was seen for the Zn epoxy. Due to corrosion products, blistering or cracking of the repair coat were seen for these coatings. The Zn-, MgO-, Mg- and Al-silicate showed promising results without blistering after the same test. The Zn silicate showed an average <b>corrosion</b> <b>creep</b> of approximately 0. 6 mm, while the MgO-, Mg- and Al-silicate showed negligible <b>corrosion</b> <b>creep.</b> Coating resistivity was measured by obtaining several electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) over a period of time, and the open circuit potential (OCP) was measured. The zinc containing coatings were exposed for 134 days, while the MgO-, Mg-, Al-silicate and the inorganic copolymer coating were exposed for 81 days. All coatings showed an OCP more negative than - 800 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, except for the inorganic copolymer coating. This coating had an initial potential of - 430 mV vs. Ag/AgCl with decreasing development towards a more negative potential. The coatings that revealed blistering or cracking of the repair coating during the cyclic coating test showed generally higher impedance, compared to the silicate coatings that did not blister. An open coating structure was considered as the most important protection mechanism for a TSA repair coat. The protection mechanisms regarding cathodic polarization, electrical conductive coatings and the buffering effect were assumed less important compared to the open coating structure. Crevice corrosion tests with different crevice designs were performed {{in order to have a}} short-term test for the TSA duplex corrosion mechanism. Further development of the test design is necessary before the mechanism can be investigated by this method...|$|E

Among all the choices of materials, tungsten is the prime candidate for plasma-facing material in magnetic fusion energy devices due to its high strength and excellent high temperature properties.

To isolate the radioactivity to minimize radiation doses to personnel, and protect the primary circuit from contamination, intermediate heat exchangers (IHXs) have been proposed as a means for separating the primary circuit of the NGNP (Next Generation Nuclear Plant) or other process heat application from the remainder of the plant. This task will first review the different concepts of IHX that could be envisioned for HTR/VHTR applications in a range of temperature from 850 to 950 C. This will cover shell-and-tube and compact designs (including the platefin concept). The review will then discuss the maturity of the concepts in terms of design, fabricability and component testing (or feedback from experience when applicable). Particular attention will be paid to the feasibility of developing the IHX concepts for the NGNP with operation expected in 2018 - 2021. This report will also discuss material candidates for IHX applications and will discuss specific issues {{that will have to be}} addressed in the context of the HTR design (thermal aging, <b>corrosion,</b> <b>creep,</b> creep-fatigue, etc). Particular attention will be paid to specific issues associated with operation at the upper end of the creep regime...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{computational}} and theoretical {{investigation of the}} response of materials' mechanical properties {{to a wide range}} of environmental conditions, with a particular focus on the coupled effects of strain rate and temperature. The thesis provides original contributions to the fundamental understanding of how the materials mechanical properties change, as manifested by defect structure evolution, with temperature and strain rate conditions, as well as to the development of methodology used for enabling the investigation of dislocation-defect interactions over a much wider range of time scales than of reach to traditional techniques. This thesis advanced the capabilities of a recently developed activation-relaxation based atomistic method to enhance the accuracy of kinetic predictions, and to enable the investigation of dislocation-defect interactions dynamically at long time scales. We took the Autonomous Basin Climbing (ABC) method as a starting point, and incorporated the ability to sample multiple transition pathways associated with a given state. This new feature addresses the problem of overestimating the system evolution time due to the one-dimensional nature of the original ABC algorithm. The ABC method was further implemented in a dynamic framework, which makes it possible for the first time to directly simulate the dislocation-obstacle interactions at very low strain rates. This approach allows for a new way to connect the atomistic results to models at the meso-scale for simulating the plasticity of metals. We analytically derived how the applied strain rate couples with the thermal activation process, based on the framework of transition state theory informed by the atomistic approach described above. We demonstrated the coupling effect is a common mechanism behind many important phenomena, and provide three examples from the atomic level on the dislocation mobility and dislocation interactions with radiation induced defects. (i) A well-known universal flow stress upturn behavior in metals has been examined. We provide a simple physically based model to predict the flow stress at various strain rates, without invoking any assumed mechanisms or fitting parameters as in the traditional constitutional models. (ii) We implemented this new model in (i) to investigate the dislocation-obstacle interactions. The approach enabled us to map the interaction between an edge dislocation and a self interstitial atom (SIA) cluster in Zr in a two-parameter space consisting of temperature and strain rate. This approach allows the direct atomistic simulation of dislocation-obstacle interactions at experimental time scale, namely at low strain rates, which cannot be reached by traditional atomistic techniques. The dislocation is found to absorb the SIA cluster and climb at low strain rates and high temperatures, while it passes through the SIA cluster at high strain rates and low temperatures. The predicted mechanism map is able to reconcile the seeming controversy between previous experimental and computational findings. (iii) A dislocation-void interaction in bcc Fe at prescribed strain rate is also investigated. We demonstrated that different applied strain rates can affect the interaction mechanism and the defect microstructure, and eventually lead to a negative strain rate sensitivity (nSRS) of yield strength below a critical strain rate. This finding at the unit process level supplements the previous explanations of the nSRS with higher level constitutive relations. Beyond the specific cases analyzed in metals in this thesis, the insights gained on the coupling between strain rate and thermal activation can be used to explain the dependence on strain rate and temperature in other important classes of materials (e. g. colloids, cement) and phenomena (e. g. <b>corrosion,</b> <b>creep).</b> by Yue Fan.

40|$|Recent legislation, LOLER, {{removed the}} {{compulsion}} of periodical proof testing of lifting equipment to ascertain its "fitness for purpose". It {{has become the}} responsibility of a competent person to assess equipment's fitness for purpose and ability for continued safe use. This thesis reviews the technologies available to the competent person to enable him/her {{to come to an}} informed decision regarding the condition of mechanical structures. It was identified that an optimal methodology would interrogate structural integrity whilst the equipment performed its intended function. Coupling a means of assessment with the equipment's operation allows the investigator to focus on only defective conditions that will limit the future operation. Such an approach of condition monitoring structural integrity as opposed to employing traditional methods of inspection that are essentially failure finding tasks permits the discrimination between benign and malignant defects. Restorative and replacement activities can therefore take place based upon the likelihood of equipment's functional failure. The supplementary monitoring of Acoustic Emission (AE), with the established industrial practice of proof testing, was considered to provide data to monitor structural integrity and provide the basis upon which a structure can be re-qualified for future service. The nature of failure of engineering materials was examined which identified failure modes such as <b>corrosion,</b> <b>creep</b> and fatigue resulted in a progressive degradation of a localised area. The AE is a proportion of energy released during such deterioration. Further it was determined that {{the rate at which the}} deterioration increased was non-linear. Within a laboratory environment wire ropes with seeded faults were subjected to a simulated life during which the qualitative and quantitative nature of the AE was investigated. It was found that the quantity of the emission generated during proof tests was indicative of the severity of the induced defect. This substantiated the claim that AE could be used to enhance the proof test and provide a means by which a condition assessment could be made at intervals throughout the life of a structure. A series of five case studies explored the use of AE on a variety of differing in-service mechanical structures, mostly lifting equipmept. The case studies were conducted on pad-eyes,link-plates, cranes, both Electrical Overhead Travelling (EOT) and pedestal cranes and finally, an underwater vehicle pressure hull. The approach of using the combination of AE with a proof test was verified in the cases of pad-eyes and EOT cranes. In the instance of link plates, simultaneous measurement of strain and AE during a load test demonstrated the ability of AE to detect localised yielding. During the destruction test of a pedestal crane boom section, various conventional methods of AE evaluation were utilised to investigate which would provide the most reliable condition indicator; it was found that Intensity Analysis generated the most effective trendable measurement. A study on a pressure hull with known fatigue cracks that were subjected to both static and dynamic testing whilst monitoring with AE was conducted. The fatigue cracks were sized pre and post the trial using Time of Flight Diffraction (ToFD). During the trial Alternating Current Potential Drop (ACPD) was used to detect any growth as it occurred. Such techniques were used to substantiate claims AE could detect a propagating defect. When the AE is viewed in conjunction with ACPD results and the measurements attained with the ToFD it was clear that all three techniques concluded that crack growth occurred at two sites. Finally the investigation returns to a laboratory to exarnine the robustness of the technique through the life of a mechanical structure. The objective being to identify if periodical measurement of AE taken during the course of the life of the structure would repetitively generate information pertaining to the identification of the flaw as well as the severity of the flaw as it initiates and propagates through to failure. A power law was fitted to the data acquired during the proof tests. The use of a power law was considered appropriate due to the previously identified non-linear nature of material failure. A Scanning Electron Microscope was used to visually examine the fracture surfaces. It was found that increasing increments between striations on the fracture surface illustrated the non-linear increase of crack extensions during fatigue and corroborated the appropriateness of fitting a power law to the proof test data. Such an investigation permitted the conclusion that the approach of fitting a power law to the discrete energies from sequential proof tests is an appropriate method of attaining a trendable condition indicator. The competent person could employ such a methodology for the purposes of attaining information upon which an informed decision can be made on the continued safe use of mechanical structures.

40|$|Nickel based {{super alloy}} MoNiCr was {{developed}} as the material with high <b>corrosion</b> and <b>creep</b> resistance against aggressive molten fluoride salt environment. This medium {{is used by}} Fluoride salt cooled High temperature Reactor (FHR) and Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) systems. The elements Mo, Cr and Fe are most important alloying elements accompanied by very low amount of Al + Ti. Necessity to prepare hot formed semi products such as sheets, bars, wires and tubes was the motivation for this new experimental program execution searching for suitable hot forming conditions. In the case of MoNiCr components forming, recrystallization is a crucial process allowing successful forming. Special {{attention was paid to}} this process after finding out, that this process is running very slowly or even not running at all, if inappropriate conditions are met. Proper temperature and strain rate range were determined and furthermore the influence of cold deformation on recrystallization progress was determined. It was found that cold deformation before hot forming as well as after hot forming can be successfully implemented into technological chain. Almost fully recrystallized microstructure can be achieved using synergy of both cold and hot deformation...|$|R
40|$|Compact recuperators/heat-exchangers are {{essential}} hardware for microturbines, {{and are also}} desirable for increased efficiency of small industrial gas turbines. Most commercial recuperators today are made from 347 stainless steel sheet or foil. Larger engine sizes, higher exhaust temperatures and alternate fuels will all require materials with better performance (strength, corrosion resistance) and reliability than typically found in 347 steel, especially as recuperator temperatures approach or exceed 700 - 750 oC. To meet these needs, the Department of Energy (DOE) has sponsored programs at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to generate data that enables selection of commercial sheet and foil materials, to analyze recuperator components, and to identify or develop more cost effective materials with improved performance and reliability. This paper summarizes data on the high-temperature creep behavior of both standard, commercial 347 steel sheet and foils typically used for commercial recuperators and as well as commercial HR 120 foil as a higher performance alternative. This paper also presents some of the initial data on standard 347 steel with modified commercial processing for improved creep resistance. Finally, ORNL efforts on lab-scale heats of 347 steels with modified compositions for improved <b>corrosion</b> and <b>creep</b> resistance are summarized...|$|R
