40|$|Objectives: It is {{important}} to assess the risk of static magnetic fields (SMFs) on human health, because epidemiological {{studies have indicated that}} SMFs {{play a role in the}} development of diseases such as leukemia and brain tumor. In our environment, we have numerous chances to be exposed to not only SMFs but also many chemicals containing mutagens. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of SMFs on the induction of micronuclei induced by some mutagens. Methods: BALB/c mice were exposed to 4. 7 tesla (T) SMF for 24 hr immediately after the injection of <b>carboquone</b> (alkylating agent), colcemid (spindle poison), mitomycin C (cross-linking agent), vincristine (spindle poison), sodium fluoride (a byproduct of aluminum plants under strong SMF) or 1 -ethyl- 1 -nitrosourea (brain tumor-, gliomas- and thymic lymphoma-inducing chemical). Results: The frequency of micronuclei induced by six mutagens increased after co-exposure to SMF. Conclusions: An additive/synergistic effect of SMF and chemicals was observed from the results of increased frequency of micronuclei induced by mutagens in mouse bone marrow erythrocytes.

40|$|A case of {{bilateral}} renal angiomyolipoma without tuberous sclerosis is reported. A 49 -year-old woman {{was admitted to}} the general practitioner with a sudden onset of severe left flank pain. An excretory urogram and ultrasonogram revealed an enlargement of the left kidney. She was subsequently referred to our clinic for further investigation and treatment. Computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging using Tl-weighted image showed several tumors with a fatty, dense area in the bilateral kidney. An arteriogram demonstrated a hypervascular renal mass with aneurysms in her left kidney. Diagnosis {{of bilateral}} renal angiomyolipoma was confirmed by percutaneous needle biopsy. Superselective embolization of the tumor was successfully performed, preserving normal renal tissue. Gelatin sponges containing <b>Carboquone</b> (CQ sponge) were used as embolic material. Angiomyolipoma has become relatively easy to diagnose by CT, ultrasound, MRI and so on. However, there are some cases of angiomyolipoma which are indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma using these modes of testing. Therefore, in selecting a conservative management, we indicated that percutaneous biopsy or open biopsy should be done to confirm the results of the above procedures. Moreover, therapeutic embolization for angiomyolipoma was concluded to be very useful...|$|E

40|$|Seven {{patients}} were treated by instillation of <b>carboquone</b> (CQ) into the bladder. Ten milligrams of CQ dissolved in 50 ml of sterile water were administered {{twice a week}} to {{the total amount of}} 100 mg of CQ. The curative effect of CQ was evaluated by cystoscopy, pathology and electron microscopy. CQ was estimated to be excellent when the tumor completely disappeared. When the size of the tumor reduced, it was judged as moderately effective, and when no shrinkage or increase in size was observed, it was regarded as non-effective. In the clinical evaluation according to above criteria, it was summarized that excellently effective in 2 cases, moderately effective in 3 cases, and non-effective in I case. Frequent urination was oberved as a side effect only in one patient. In the pathological observations, one case changed into necrotic tissues and the tumor cells of 3 cases were shed off or degenerated following the administration of CQ.

40|$|In {{this special}} lecture {{presented}} were {{the results of}} tissue culture studies of urological cancers in our department. The tissue cultures have been introduced into our experimental investigations of the fibrinolytic system in neoplasms, particularly bladder cancer, and of an in vitro sensitivity test of anticancer drugs. In addition, {{the results of our}} clinically significant studies related to the fibrinolytic system in the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of bladder cancer were reported. Using a micro-single radial immunodiffusion method, serum protease inhibitors includingα 1 -antitrypsin, α 1 -antichymotrypsin and Cis-inhibitor were increased, whereas plasminogen was decreased in bladder cancer patients. These changes were remarkable in patients with an advanced bladder cancer and the decrease of α 2 -macroglobulin, a distinct condition in DIC, was also found. The depressed fibrinolytic activity indicated by these results would be a predisposing cause of fibrin depositions in cancerous tissues or blood vessels, and explain that patients with an advanced tumor are prone to develop vascular thrombosis and tend to occur a peculiar form of intravascular coagulation. During last 6 years, 75 out of In human urological malignant tumors subjected to tissue culture studies were successed in a primary culture, and 2 cell lines, KK- 47 and KW- 103, derived from transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder, and 2 cell lines, KN- 41 and KH- 39, from renal cell carcinomas, have been established and these cell lines utilized for the subsequent studies. Three human bladder carcinoma cell lines, T 24, RT 4 and MANO, a human bladder non-malignant epithelial cell line, HCV- 29, and a human lung fibroblast line, 460 HI, were investigated for their ability to induce fibrinolytic, urokinase and plasmin inhibitory activities in cell culture, using serum-free medium, for up to 36 hrs. Generally, the non-malignant cell line and the fibroblast line had a greater ability to produce urokinase inhibitor than did the malignant cell lines. The low concentration of plasminogen activator, immunologically identical with urokinase, and its accumulation in culture supernatant were found with RT 4 after 12 -hr and 24 -hr cultivations, whereas no plasminogen activator was detected in all other cell lines for periods up to 36 hrs. No plasmin, non-specific protease or plasmin inhibitory activities were detected in any of the supernatants from the cell lines. Moreover, [125]I-fibrin coated culture dishes were adopted for a meticulous detection of in vitro plasminogen activator production by cultured cells in Ham Fl 2 medium supplemented with 20 per cent calf serum. In this assay system, KK- 47, KW- 103 and KN- 41 cells resulted in an accumulation of plasminogen activator in the medium along with their logarithmic cell growth curves. However, in case of culture dishes not coated by fibrin, a temporary production of plasminogen activator occurred for the first 24 hrs of culture periods, and then a progressive lowering of the production was found in spite of their logarithmic cell proliferation. These in vitro results suggested that the activator production by cultured cells may be stimulated by the coexistence of fibrin and it may overcome the activity of fibrinolysis inhibitors. This suggestion would be able to explain a mechanism between the production and elimination of fibrin depositions in cancerous tissues and a rapid turnover of fibrinogen or fibrin in cancer patients. Clinically, the presence of this turnover would be manifested by an increased urinary FDP in bladder cancer patients, and urinary FDP would be considered as a biochemical marker in bladder cancer. Enhanced cell killing effect by thio-TEPA and urokinase on KK- 47 cells was investigated using methods of assessing cell growth and 3 H-thymidine uptake. A combined use of urokinase and thioTEPA resulted in a significant increase of the thio-TEPA toxicity with a 2 -hr and 24 -hr exposure times. A peak in 32 P-thio-TEPA uptake in the cells was observed 2 hrs after administration of the agent, and about 2 -time increase in the peak was obtained by adding urokinase. From the results, it was suggested that the increased cytotoxicity may be related with a gross change in cell permeability to thio-TEPA through plasminogen activation by urokinase. This conclusion was introduced into the topical prophylactic combination use of thio-TEPA, <b>carboquone</b> or cytosine arabinoside and urokinase in bladder cancer patients. The recurrence rates of the thio-TEPA and <b>carboquone</b> therapies for the postoperative 12 months were 10 and 14 per cent, and 22 and 33 per cent for the postoperative 24 months, respectively. While, combined instillation of cytosine arabinoside, a time-dependent anticancer agent, and urokinase resulted in high recurrence rates, 24. 0 and 33. 5 per cent for the postoperative 3 and 6 months, respectively. These data would recommend the topical use of dose-dependent anticancer agents such as alkylating agent and antibiotic rather than time-dependent anticancer agents. KK- 47, KW- 103 and KN- 41 were used for studies on the cytocidal effect of 7 anticancer agents. The effect on in vitro cultured cells was determined by a colony-forming method. Based on 50 per cent and 90 per cent lethal dosages in 2 -hr and 24 -hr exposures, the most prominent cytocidal effect on the cells was obtained by <b>carboquone,</b> adriamycin and mitomycin C. A mild cell killing effect was obtained by cis-platinum, VP- 16, bleomycin and thio-TEPA. There were slight differences of cell killing effect among the cell lines, and the survival curves characteristic in cell killing modality would provide a valuable reference for their clinical use. The in vitro cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs should be compared with their clinical benefits and the improvement of the test system including much more significant cell lines is necessary to establish its clinical usefulness. Enhanced cell killing effect by t-AMCHA, a potent antiplasmin agent, and <b>carboquone</b> or bleomycin on KK- 47, KW- 103 and KN- 41 cells was investigated using the colony-forming method. The effect was observed in the combinations of 50 per cent lethal dose of the agents and 150 to 1500 µg/ml of t-AMCHA. Much more clearly enhanced cell killing effect was also obtained in combination with another most potent antiplasmin agent, DV-I 006, and these anticancer agents. While, EACA, a relatively weak antiplasmin agent compared with t-AMCHA or DV-I 006, possessed less combination effect. It is certain that an enhanced inhibitory action for the cell growth is achieved by combination of anticancer drugs and induced antifibrinolysis. However, further in vivo studies of the combination are necessary to clarify the role of antifibrinolysis in the combination effect. A future new promising plan for tissue culture studies with regard to the development of diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer was discussed...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} examine the effects of various chemotherapeutic agents on development of urinary bladder tumors induced by N-butyl-N-(4 -hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) in rats. All rats were given 0. 05 % BBN in drinking water for the initial 8 weeks of the experiment. Chemotherapeutic agents evaluated in this investigation were administered as single treatments during the subsequent 12 weeks and rats were sacrificed after 20 weeks of the experiment. The investigation was divided into 3 experimental groups according to animal strains and administration methods of chemotherapeutic agents : (1) intraperitoneal administration in male Wistar rats; (2) oral administration in male Fischer 344 rats; and (3) intraperitoneal administration in male Fischer 344 rats. In experimental group (1), 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), 1 -(2 -tetrahydrofuryl) - 5 -fluorouracil (FT- 207), <b>carboquone</b> (CQ), vincristine (VCR) and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP) were effective in suppressing the incidence of bladder tumor. On the other hand, doxorubicin (DXR), mitomycin-C (MMC), neocarcinostatine (NCS), cyclophosphamide (CPM) and bleomycin (BLM) were not effective. In experimental group (2), both UFT, 4 : 1 mixture of uracil and tegafur, and 1 -hexylcarbamoyl- 5 -fluorouracil (HCFU) suppressed the incidence of bladder tumor. In experimental group (3), N, N', N"-triethylene thiophosphoramide (thiotepa) also suppressed the tumor incidence. These results indicate that 5 -FU analogue, CQ, VCR, CDDP and thiotepa may be clinically effective for prophylactic treatment for superficial bladder cancer.

An invasive bladder tumor was found and TUR-Bt (Transitional cell carcinoma, G 2, pT 3 NXMO) was performed. Fluoroscopic examination revealed a large esophageal cancer (Undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma, T 2 NXMO) and irradiation was performed (Linac 4, 600 rads). The patient's condition aggravated rapidly and he died in February 1980. A 76 -year-old man irradiated for an esophageal cancer (Linac 6, 540 rads) (undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma, T 1 NXMO) in March 1981. Eleven months later, bladder cancer was found and treated with TUR-Bt (Transitional cell carcinoma, G 2, PTlmNXMO) followed by intravesical instillation of <b>carboquone</b> and adriamycin. The patient was alive 1 year and 9 months after the diagnosis of the esophageal cancer. Sixteen cases of double cancer of the esophagus and urinary bladder {{were found in the}} Japanese literature.

40|$|One case of {{contracted}} bladder and 2 cases of remarkable decrease of bladder capacity by intracavitary instillation of <b>carboquone</b> (CQ) were presented. The instillation was performed against bladder cancer. Case 1 : A 69 year-old-male visited the Dept. of Urol., Nagoya City University Hospital, complaining of miction pain. Cystoscopic examination revealed solid and sessile tumors on the bladder neck. Bladder capacity was 300 ml. Histologic diagnosis was transitional cell carcinoma, grade 3. 5 mg of CQ was dissolved in 10 ml of distilled water and instilled into the bladder, 3 times a week. After 13 times of instillation, urinary frequency appeared. Since it became severe at 17 times (total dose: 85 mg), instillation was discontinued. Cystoscopy showed 50 ml of capacity and pale {{appearance of the}} mucosa. The muscle layer was exposed at the upper region of right side wall. The tumors disappeared, apparently. As bladder capacity did not increase 4 weeks after discontinuation of instillation, total cystectomy and bilateral ureterosigmoidostomy were performed. Histologic examination of the extirpated bladder disclosed degeneration, necrosis and denudation of the mucosa and fibrosis in the muscular layer. Case 2 : A 55 year-old-male visited the Dept. of Urol., Nagoya Municipal Josai Hospital, because of gross hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed a walnut-sized, papillary and half-pedicled tumor in the neck and on the trigone, respectively. Capacity was 300 ml. Biopsy specimens showed transitional cell carcinoma, grade 2. Instillation of CQ 5 mgJdistilled water 10 ml was performed 4 times a week. Because the tumors did not become smaller by 12 times of instillation, dose of CQ was increased to 10 mg/l 5 ml. As CQ was not effective in spite of total dose of 170 mg, the treatment was interrupted. Since then frequency of urination began to increase and reached 24 times a day. By conservative therapy it improved 2 weeks after discontinuation of instillation. Case 3 : A 74 year-old-female came to the Dept. of Urol., Nagoya First Red Cross Hospital with the chief complaint of hematuria. By cystoscopy, capacity was about 200 ml and a thumb's headsized, papillary and pedunculated tumor was demonstrated just above the right ureteral orifice. Biopsy specimens histologically showed transitional cell carcinoma, grade 1 - 2. 5 mg of CQ was dissolved in 20 ml of saline and instilled into the bladder, 3 times a week. After 14 times, size of the tumor reduced slightly, however, severe frequency (40 times a day) appeared. The treatment was interrupted and intravesical instillation of betamethasone was begun. Intramuscular injection of dexamethasone was also started. After 10 days' administration of both steroids, frequency improved and then TUR-Bt was performed. Discussion: Cyclophosphamide, {{which is one of}} the alkylating agents, has occasionally produced hemorrhagic cystitis and shrunken bladder. After systemic administration, cyclophosphamide is changed to active form by phosphatase and phosphamidase. It is excreted by the kidney and affect the bladder. Its effect is enhanced by phosphatase in the bladder wall. <b>Carboquone</b> is also one of the alkylating agents and thought to have similar effect as cyclophosphamide on the bladder epithelium in specific conditions. Since molecular weight of CQ is 321. 34, according to the theory of Yeates, it does not seem to pass the bladder epithelium in normal condition. Therefore, local side effects by CQ may be due to its direct action to the bladder. To prevent local side effects seen in instillation of CQ the following consideration is advocated. 1) Concentration of solution of CQ should be settled under 250 mcg/ml. 2) Instillation should be interrupted when frequency of urination exceeds 20 times a day (frequency often appear when total dose of CQ reaches 50 mg). 3) Complete disappearance of tumor should not be expected if the diameter of tumor exceeds 1 cm. 4) Combination of instillation of steroids with CQ may reduce the side effects. 5) Hydration may also reduce the side effects, however, it should be kept in mind that frequency of urination will increase by hydration. 6) Procedures to intensify the effect of CQ (e. g., dehydration, increase of concentration of the drug, control of urination, etc.) may augment the side effects. As one of the treatments of severe bladder damage by CQ systemic and local administration of steroids is recommended after interruption of instillation.
