40|$|Abstract. Residual {{stresses}} in titanium {{casting alloy}} were estimated by X-ray stress measurement technique. There are two {{problems in the}} condition of X-ray stress measurement. Firstly, the titanium casting alloy has the large <b>crystal</b> grains. These <b>coarse</b> grains were generated under solidification processes and those sizes are approximately 2 millimeter in this study. These <b>coarse</b> <b>crystal</b> grains interfere with an accurate stress measurement due to the unstable diffraction profile [1]. This is because {{the existence of a}} sufficient number of isotropic crystal grains in the X-ray irradiation area are based on the X-ray diffraction theory. In this study, the stress measurement technique of single crystal materials was adopted for the solution of this fundamental problem [2, 3]. Because the <b>coarse</b> <b>crystal</b> grain was treated as a single crystal, the high intensity diffraction profiles were observed from a certain direction with investigations of crystal orientation. The problem with the <b>coarse</b> <b>crystal</b> grain in titanium casting alloy were cleaned up by the employment of the single crystal measurement technique. Secondly, the results from this study show that the position of crystal grain within the X-ray irradiation area greatly influenced the residual stress values. Therefore, in the present paper the erasing method of this position effect was tried and discussed [4]. Finally, the improvement of the accuracy of this method for the residual stress measurement in titanium casting alloy under the several bending stresses was confirmed. These results show that the erasing method in this study is an effective correction method...|$|R

40|$|The {{collection}} by confocal Raman microspectrometry in the motorized point-by-point scanning mode of crystalline samples with heterogeneity {{larger than}} the spatial resolution (~ 1 m) generates large amounts of useable Raman spectral data. The present selected examples of fine, medium, and <b>coarse</b> <b>crystal</b> powders (anhydrite, CaSO 4; calcite, CaCO 3; gypsum, CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O; and (NH 4) 2 SO 4) treated by the new Simplisma method combining conventional and second derivative data demonstrate the main role of the crystal size on the number {{and shape of the}} resolved spectra. With fine crystal powders (size less than 0. 5 m), well-known powder Raman spectrum characteristics of each compound were extracted. These spectra were often superimposed on a weak baseline. With medium and <b>coarse</b> <b>crystal</b> powders (size more than 1 m), several significant spectra were extracted for each pure crystalline compound. These spectra were found to be analogous to the polarized spectra previously obtained with oriented large single crystal and were attributed to the several scattering contributions according to the symmetry of the several vibrational modes. The band splittings by the static and dynamic crystal effects can be resolved by the Simplisma approach using the pure variable concept according to the width of the splitting depending on the crystal. These results were explained by theoretical equations deduced from the Raman tensor elements and orientational functions of the crystal-fixed coordinates with respect to the space-fixed coordinates. These findings could provide accurate assignment of the resolved spectra extracted by the Simplisma approach from mixtures with large heterogeneities and can provide meaningful applications to Raman imaging of environmental and material samples...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an improvement in}} the compressive strength of the clinker-free CaO-activated GGBFS system {{with the addition of}} gypsum. The compressive strength was primarily governed by the amount of ettringite, but more importantly, the morphology of reaction products (e. g., size, slenderness) is proposed as being a more dominant factor. The gypsum content at the best strength produced fine ettringite crystals and removed large pores that were around 100 μm in diameter, resulting in significant pore-size refinement. However, excessive addition reduced the strength and generated a large volume of detrimental pores with sizes of 0. 03 - 0. 4 μm, which were probably due to expansive cracking or large voids between the large sizes of re-precipitated gypsum crystals.

The particle size of the non-fat particles in the chocolate, i. e. sugar and cocoa particles was varied between 15, 22 and 40 mu m. A novel set of analytical techniques was used and by combining migration results with surface topology results clear differences could be observed between the samples. At 23 degrees C storage the samples with a particle size of 15 mu m showed higher rate of oil migration and, further, the earliest development of fat bloom at the surface. This could be observed both macroscopically and microscopically. Thus, it appears as a larger specific surface area of the nonfat particles facilitates migration of filling oil, possibly due to a more heterogeneous and <b>coarser</b> <b>crystal</b> network with higher permeability.
