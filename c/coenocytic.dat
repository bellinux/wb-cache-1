5|$|Most fungi grow as hyphae, {{which are}} cylindrical, thread-like {{structures}} 2–10µm {{in diameter and}} up to several centimeters in length. Hyphae grow at their tips (apices); new hyphae are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing hyphae by a process called branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing hyphae. Hyphae also sometimes fuse when they come into contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastamosis). These growth processes {{lead to the development}} of a mycelium, an interconnected network of hyphae. Hyphae can be either septate or <b>coenocytic.</b> Septate hyphae are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; <b>coenocytic</b> hyphae are not compartmentalized. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. <b>Coenocytic</b> hyphae are in essence multinucleate supercells.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to a lack}} of septate hyphae, a <b>coenocytic,</b> {{transfer}} cell-like structure {{characterizes the}} Hartig net of many ectomycorrhizas, which facilitates interhyphal transport. Wall ingrowths in Pisonia, for example, resemble those found in other plant species where transfer cells yield high rates of nutrient transport between apoplast and symplast. Overall, ectomycorrhizal fungi receive approximately 15% of the net primary production and can provide up to 86% of a host’s nitrogen needs. Carbon allocation {{has been shown to be}} correlated with growth rates and nutrient availability. Belowground allocation is highest when nutrient availability is low and when growth rates are reduced. Phosphorus is another typically limiting nutrient in many terrestrial ecosystems. Evidence suggests that phosphorus is transferred largely as inorganic orthophosphate. Some mat-forming ectomycorrhizas contain ribonucleases capable of rapidly hydrolyzing DNA in order to obtain phosphorus from nuclei.|$|E

50|$|Like most sacoglossans, Placida dendritica {{feeds on}} <b>coenocytic</b> green algae. It {{is able to}} retain the chloroplasts for a short period, however the {{ingested}} plastids are not functional, and do not provide nutritional benefit to the animal.|$|E
5000|$|Some protozoans {{reproduce}} by {{yet another}} mechanism of fission called as plasmotomy.In {{this type of}} fission, a multinucleate adult parent undergoes cytokinesis to form two multinucleate( [...] or <b>coenocytic)</b> daughter cells. The daughter cells so produced undergo karyokinesis, further.|$|E
50|$|Hyphae are <b>coenocytic</b> {{and produce}} sporangiophores covered in calcium oxalate. Sporangiophores {{give rise to}} pedicellate, unispored sporangia. In many cases, {{the wall of the}} {{sporangium}} and the spore have fused. Zygospores tend to be ornamented and reddish-brown with opposed suspensors.|$|E
5000|$|Less {{definition}} between cells; the hyphae {{of higher}} fungi have porous partitions called septa, which allow {{the passage of}} cytoplasm, organelles, and, sometimes, nuclei. Primitive fungi have few or no septa, so each organism is essentially a giant multinucleate supercell; these fungi are described as <b>coenocytic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some {{filamentous}} fungi (Such as Glomeromycota, Chytridiomycota and Neocalligomastigomycota) {{may contain}} multiple nuclei in a <b>coenocytic</b> mycelium. A coenocyte {{functions as a}} single coordinated unit composed of multiple cells linked structurally and functionally, i.e. through gap junctions. Fungal mycelia in which hyphae lack septa are known as [...] "aseptate" [...] or [...] "coenocytic".|$|E
50|$|The {{members of}} this group are found in aquatic {{habitats}} and on decaying wood in moist and damp places or as obligate parasites on plants. The mycelium is aseptate and <b>coenocytic.</b> Asexual reproduction by zoospore or by aplanospore. A zygospore is formed by the fusion of two gametes. Examples are Mucor, Rhizopus and Albugo.|$|E
50|$|During mitotic progression, {{typically}} {{after the}} anaphase onset, the cell may undergo cytokinesis. In animal cells, a cell membrane pinches inward {{between the two}} developing nuclei to produce two new cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms between the two nuclei. Cytokinesis does not always occur; <b>coenocytic</b> (a type of multinucleate condition) cells undergo mitosis without cytokinesis.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} cells where mitosis and {{cytokinesis}} occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei. The most notable occurrence {{of this is}} among the fungi, slime molds, and <b>coenocytic</b> algae, but the phenomenon is found in various other organisms. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of fruit fly embryonic development.|$|E
50|$|Mortierella fungi are {{typically}} <b>coenocytic,</b> but {{compared with the}} genus Mucor (Mucoromycotina, Mucorales), they have a stronger tendency towards septum formation. Compared with Mucor-like fungi, the mitosporangia {{are typically}} smaller, contain fewer spores and lack a columella (Fig. 1). Many Mortierella-like fungi are asexual. However, if zygospores are found, they strongly resemble Mucor-zygospores. Sometimes sexual structures are embedded in loosely arranged hyphal networks.|$|E
5000|$|Pythium irregulare is a soil borne oomycete plant pathogen. Oomycetes, {{also known}} as [...] "water molds", are fungal-like protists. They are fungal-like because of their similar life cycles, but differ in that the resting stage is diploid, they have <b>coenocytic</b> hyphae, a larger genome, {{cellulose}} in their cell walls instead of chitin, and contain zoospores (asexual motile spores) and oospores (sexual resting spores).|$|E
50|$|The {{plant has}} runners that are {{overlaid}} by sand rising up to thick stalks that split into heavy upright branches {{that are in}} turn lined with rows of short think branchlets. The length can vary from 2 to 25 cm with a tall slender habit to a short bushy habit. It is a <b>coenocytic</b> species that grows well in shallow protected areas with sandy bottoms.|$|E
50|$|Zygomycota, or zygote fungi, is a {{division}} of fungi. Approximately 1050 species are known. They are mostly terrestrial in habitat, living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material. Some are parasites of plants, insects, and small animals, while others form symbiotic relationships with plants. Zygomycete hyphae may be <b>coenocytic,</b> forming septa only where gametes are formed or to wall off dead hyphae.|$|E
5000|$|A coenocyte (from Greek: κοινός (koinós) = [...] "common" [...] + κύτος (kýtos) = [...] "box, i.e. cell") is a multinucleate cell {{which can}} result from {{multiple}} nuclear divisions without their accompanying cytokinesis, {{in contrast to a}} syncytium, which results from cellular aggregation followed by dissolution of the cell membranes inside the mass. The word syncytium in animal embryology is used to refer to the <b>coenocytic</b> blastoderm of invertebrates.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{release from}} the germinated resting spore, zoospores seek out a {{suitable}} substrate for growth using chemotaxis or phototaxis. Some species encyst and germinate directly upon the substrate; others encyst and germinate a short distance away. Once germinated, enzymes released from the zoospore begin {{to break down the}} substrate and utilize it produce a new thallus. Thalli are <b>coenocytic</b> and usually form no true mycelium (having rhizoids instead).|$|E
5000|$|An ascus (plural asci; from Greek ἀσκός ảskós 'skin bag') is {{the sexual}} spore-bearing cell {{produced}} in ascomycete fungi. Asci usually contain eight ascospores, produced by meiosis followed, in most species, by a mitotic cell division. However, asci in some genera or species {{can occur in}} numbers of one (e.g. Monosporascus cannonballus), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off conidia that may fill the asci (e.g. Tympanis) with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some Cordyceps, also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be <b>coenocytic</b> (lacking a septum), {{and in some cases}} <b>coenocytic</b> in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei. The term ocular chamber, or oculus, refers to the epiplasm (the portion of cytoplasm not used in ascospore formation) that is surrounded by the [...] "bourrelet" [...] (the thickened tissue {{near the top of the}} ascus).|$|E
50|$|Members of {{this family}} have <b>coenocytic</b> hyphae. Colonies tend to be white or off-white and are {{characterized}} by zonate growth—that is, growing in rings—and an onion or garlic smell. Single or multiple collumellate sporangia are born on aerial sporangiophores. Their distinctive zygospores may be enveloped by hyphae. They may be smooth or dimples but nearly all have apposed suspensors. This family also produces chlamydospores, which may be spiny or rough and thick-walled.|$|E
5000|$|The Glomeromycota have {{generally}} <b>coenocytic</b> (occasionally sparsely septate) mycelia and reproduce asexually through blastic {{development of the}} hyphal tip to produce spores (Glomerospores) with diameters of 80-500 μm. In some, complex spores form within a terminal saccule. [...] Recently it was shown that Glomus species contain 51 genes encoding all the tools necessary for meiosis. [...] Based on these and related findings, {{it was suggested that}} Glomus species may have a cryptic sexual cycle.|$|E
50|$|A. whisleri was {{isolated}} from the digestive tract of a marine invertebrate, specifically the filter-feeding mussel Mytilus sp. A. whisleri has a very complex life-cycle, yet to be resolved. It includes several different cell stages, ranging from amoebodial, hyphal-like and plasmodial stages, which can present filopodia-like (pseudopodia) structures. They also present <b>coenocytic</b> spherical stages with prominent vacuoles and several nuclei. All of those stages undergo dramatic morphological changes and have a cell wall (except for the amoeboid stage).|$|E
50|$|Zoophthora species parasitize insects, {{using their}} host’s {{body as a}} source of {{nutrition}} and as a site for reproduction. In order to infect a potential insect host, fungal tissue (generally as uninucleate or <b>coenocytic</b> hypha) must first penetrate the insect’s cuticle. Upon entering an insect’s body, some Zoophthora species are able to lose their cell walls and exist as protoplasts; this phenomenon is common in many taxa in the Entomophthorales, and is believed to help the fungus evade its host’s immune responses.|$|E
50|$|Rhizopus species grow as filamentous, {{branching}} hyphae {{that generally}} lack cross-walls (i.e., they are <b>coenocytic).</b> They reproduce by forming asexual and sexual spores. In asexual reproduction, sporangiospores are produced inside a spherical structure, the sporangium. Sporangia {{are supported by}} a large apophysate columella atop a long stalk, the sporangiophore. Sporangiophores arise among distinctive, root-like rhizoids. In sexual reproduction, a dark zygospore is produced {{at the point where}} two compatible mycelia fuse. Upon germination, a zygospore produces colonies that are genetically different from either parent.|$|E
5000|$|Pythium aphanidermatum is a soil borne plant pathogen. Pythium is a genus in {{the class}} Oomycetes, which are also known as water molds. Oomycetes are not true fungi, as their cell walls are made of {{cellulose}} instead of chitin, they are diploid in their vegetative state, and they contain <b>coenocytic</b> hyphae (lacking crosswalls), called a protist. [...] Also, they reproduce asexually with motile biflagelette zoospores that require water to move towards and infect a host. Sexually, they reproduce with structures called antheridia, oogonia, and oospores.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most other}} zygomycete fungi, the Zoopagomycotina have cell walls {{containing}} chitin {{and they have}} <b>coenocytic</b> (nonseptate) hyphae. Their vegetative body consists of a simple, branched, or unbranched thallus. Asexual reproduction is by arthrospores (in Helicocephalum), chlamydospores, uni- or multi-spored sporganiola; sporangiospores of multi-spored formed in simple or branched chains (merosporangia), usually from a vesicle or stalk. Many produce haustoria. Where observed, the sexual spores (zygospores) are globose and unornamented. The hyphae used during sexual outcrossing is similar to vegetative hyphae {{or in some cases}} may be slightly enlarged.|$|E
50|$|The thallus is {{filamentous}} {{and much}} branched {{and may be}} packed into a mass. It is <b>coenocytic,</b> having multi-nucleate cells consisting of cytoplasm contained within a cylindrical cell wall. There are no septae and the many discoid chloroplasts, nuclei and other organelles are free {{to move through the}} organism. The whole organism may consist of a single cell and in the genus Caulerpa this may be several metres across. In the genus Halimeda, whole seabed meadows may consist of an individual, single-celled organism connected by filamentous threads running through the substrate.|$|E
50|$|Non-articulated {{laticifer}}s {{begin their}} growth from the meristematic tissue of the embryo, termed the laticifer initial, and can exhibit continual growth throughout {{the lifetime of}} the plant. Laticifer tubes have irregularly edged walls and a larger inner diameter than the surrounding parenchyma cells. In {{the development of the}} cell, elongation occurs via karyokinesis and no cell plate develops resulting in <b>coenocytic</b> cells which extend throughout the plant. These cells can reach up to tens of centimeters long and can be branched or unbranched.They are thought to have a role in wound healing and as defense against herbivory, as well as pathogen defense, and are often used for taxonomy.|$|E
50|$|Chaetomium cupreum {{is known}} only as a sexually {{reproducing}} species and no asexual form has been reported. Ames originally reported C. cupreum to possess a homothallic mating system but this was later contradicted by Tveit in 1955 who determined the species to be heterothallic. Sexual reproduction in C. cupreum involves the formation of ascogonia arising as lateral outgrowths of the vegetative mycelium. In early developmental stages, the ascogonia are coiled and <b>coenocytic</b> with septa forming as the ascogonia mature. The terminal cell of each ascogonium will become a long trichogyne which functions as the receptive organ. Male reproductive structures, antheridia are commonly absent in Chaetomium.|$|E
50|$|Amoebidium {{species are}} single-celled, cigar-shaped or tubular in {{vegetative}} growth form (= thallus), and {{attach to the}} exoskeleton of various freshwater arthropod hosts (Crustaecea or Insecta) {{by means of a}} secreted, glue-like basal holdfast. The thalli are <b>coenocytic</b> (i.e. lack divisions within the cell) and are unbranched. Sexual reproduction is unknown. Asexual reproduction may proceed along two different routes: 1) the entire content of the cell divides into elongated, uninucleate spores (known as sporangiospores or endospores) with the cell wall breaking apart to release the spores or 2) the entire content of the cell divides to produce teardrop-shaped, motile amoeboid cells that disperse for a short time, then encyst and produce spores from the cyst (called cystospores).|$|E
50|$|P. colocasiae is an oomycete {{and is thus}} {{characterized}} by oospores and <b>coenocytic</b> hyphae. Oospores have very thick-walls which provide durable survival structures. As a result, oospores overwinter in soil, underground storage organs, or on leaf debris left in the field after harvest. However, inoculum does not survive for very long on leaf tissue. Other colocasia plants such as Elephant-ear and Dasheen are an additional means of survival for this pathogen. Finally, chlamydospores have been produced under ideal laboratory conditions in culture, and may {{also serve as a}} survival structure in addition to oospores. However, chlamydospores have not yet been observed in the field. Therefore, it is not known if chlamydospores are really part of the phytophthora colocasiae disease cycle.|$|E
