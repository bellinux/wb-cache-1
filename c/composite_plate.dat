50|$|A <b>composite</b> <b>plate</b> is {{basically}} a plate made out of composite materials, i.e. a resin and a fibre. Its mechanical evaluation is more detailed than a normal isotropic plate as it has different material properties in different directions. Composite materials are very light and strong and hence much used in aircraft and spacecraft industries. They are also readily available.|$|E
50|$|Modern motocross {{boots are}} usually nearly knee-high (about 16 inches in height) and {{made from a}} {{combination}} of leather, metal, plastic and/or man-made composite materials to create a very form-fitting, comfortable and tight boot. To allow a rider to easily get the boot on or off, the shaft of a motocross boot is designed to open lengthwise. Multiple adjustable straps (usually 3 to 4) are deployed along the foot, ankle and shaft of the boot to allow the rider to tighten the boot to his/her preferences and comfort. A curved plastic or <b>composite</b> <b>plate</b> covers the shin of the boot to protect the rider from debris that may be thrown from the front wheel of the motorcycle.|$|E

40|$|Shape {{memory alloy}} (SMA) wires were {{embedded}} within laminated <b>composite</b> <b>plates</b> {{to take advantage}} of the shape memory effect property of the SMA in improving post-buckling behavior of <b>composite</b> <b>plates.</b> A nonlinear finite element formulation was developed for this study. The plate-bending formulation used in this study was developed based on the first order shear deformation theory, where the von Karman’s nonlinear moderate strain terms were added to the strain equations. The effect of the SMA was captured by adding recovery stress term in the constitutive equation of the SMA <b>composite</b> <b>plates.</b> Values of the recovery stress of the SMA were determined using Brinson’s model. Using the principle of virtual work and the total Lagrangian approach, the final finite element nonlinear governing equation for the post-buckling of SMA <b>composite</b> <b>plates</b> was derived. Buckling and post-buckling analyses were then conducted on the symmetric angle-ply and cross-ply SMA <b>composite</b> <b>plates.</b> The effect of several parameters such as the activation temperature, volume fraction, and the initial strain of the SMA on the post-buckling behavior of the SMA <b>composite</b> <b>plates</b> were studied.

50|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>plate</b> {{material}} {{can be a}} combination of any two dissimilar metals to optimize heat transfer characteristics and improve griddle performance. A common variant of this construction, currently available, involves a core of aluminum laminated with type 304 stainless steel on either side. The heat transfer rate of aluminum is five times that of carbon steel, which maximizes heat transfer {{from the bottom of the}} plate to the cooking surface, and facilitates an even temperature distribution over the entire plate surface regardless of heat source. Type 304 stainless steel is medical grade, with a low level of porosity that reduces the penetration of cooking products into the surface, which causes sticking and flavor transfer - important performance metrics for commercial applications. This tends to significantly improve surface cleaning characteristics, especially in a commercial cooking environment, which can reduce cleaning labor and the need for consumable cleaning products.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon how}} form-fitting the boot is, {{to allow a}} rider to easily get the boot on or off, the shaft may be {{designed}} to open lengthwise. If so, Velcro or other hook-and-loop fasteners are typically used on the inner sides of the opening to allow the rider to close the boot over the foot, ankle and leg. This allows for some flexibility for the rider to control the boot's tightness. Some manufacturers also include an internal quick-lacing system between a soft inner leg and the harder outer shell of the boot shaft to further ensure a tight, but comfortable fit. The heel of a racing boot is typically very low: not more than 1/2-inch (13 mm), and sole of the heel and foot is typically rather smooth. A curved plastic or <b>composite</b> <b>plate</b> may be included to cover the shin of the boot to protect the rider's shin.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{buckling}} {{and thermal}} post-buckling behaviours of laminated <b>composite</b> <b>plates</b> are improved by embedding {{shape memory alloy}} wires within laminates of <b>composite</b> <b>plates.</b> The procedure {{is to use the}} recovery stress that is induced when the reverse transformation of the shape memory alloy from martensite to austenite phases is constrained. For aerospace applications where the source of the shape memory alloy heating is the high temperature environment itself, a study is conducted to see the effect of shape memory alloy in improving the thermal buckling and postbuckling of <b>composite</b> <b>plates.</b> Due to the temperature dependent nature of the composite matrix and the shape memory alloy, the finite element formulation developed here is in the incremental form. Solving this non-linear model using the developed in-house source code, critical loads are determined and the post-buckling paths of the shape memory alloy <b>composite</b> <b>plates</b> are traced. This study shows that by embedding the shape memory alloy within <b>composite</b> <b>plates,</b> the thermal buckling and post-buckling behaviours of <b>composite</b> <b>plates</b> can be improved substantially...|$|R

In addition to hard-kill and soft-kill APS, the developer uses a special paint that significantly reduces the vehicle's infrared signature.
