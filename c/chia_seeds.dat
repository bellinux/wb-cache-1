25|$|Although {{the best}} source of ALA is seeds, most seeds and seed oils are much richer in an n−6 fatty acid, {{linoleic}} acid. Exceptions include flaxseed (must be ground for proper nutrient absorption) and <b>chia</b> <b>seeds.</b> Linoleic acid is the other essential fatty acid, but it, and the other n−6 fatty acids, compete with n−3s for positions in cell membranes and have very different effects on human health.

2500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{essential}} fatty acids that you must consume (omega-3 and omega-6). Experts say that you need to eat a balanced amount of omega-3s and omega-6s. However, some estimate that Americans consume twenty times more omega-6s than omega-3s. There is a theory that an imbalance of essential fatty acids may lead to mental disorders such as depression, hyperactivity and schizophrenia, but it still lacking evidences. An omega-3 deficient diet increases omega-6 levels in the brain disrupting endocannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens contributing to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice. Sources of omega-3 include flax seeds, <b>chia</b> <b>seeds,</b> walnuts, sea vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and cold water fish. [...] You can find sources of omega-6 in walnuts, hazelnuts; sunflower, safflower, corn, and sesame oils.|$|E
2500|$|Vegetarian diets can be low in {{omega-3 fatty}} acids (O3FA). Major {{vegetarian}} sources of O3FA include algae, hempseeds and hempseed oil, walnuts, flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, olive oil, canola (rapeseed) oil, avocado and <b>chia</b> <b>seeds.</b> However, diets lacking fish, eggs, or generous amounts of sea vegetables (seaweed) generally lack a direct source of long-chain O3FA such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Vegetarian diets may also have a high ratio of O6FA to O3FA, which inhibits the conversion of short-chain fatty acids such as alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA), found in most vegetarian O3FA sources, to EPA and DHA. Short-term supplemental ALA {{has been shown to}} increase EPA levels but not DHA levels, suggesting poor conversion of the intermediary EPA to DHA. DHA and EPA supplements derived from microalgae are available.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil on heat shock protein (HSP) and related parameters in diet-induced obese rats. Methods: Animals were divided in six groups: control, high-fat and high-fructose diet (HFF), and HFF with <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> or <b>chia</b> oil in short (6 -wk) and long (12 -wk) treatments. Plasma indicators of glucose tolerance and liver damage, skeletal muscle expression of antioxidant enzymes, and proteins controlling oxidative energy metabolism were determined. The limit of significance was set at P < 0. 05. Results: The HFF diet induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and altered parameters related to obesity complications. The consumption of <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> or <b>chia</b> oil did not reduce body weight gain or abdominal fat accumulation. However, <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil in both treatments improved glucose and insulin tolerance. Chia oil in both treatments induced expression of HSP 70 and HSP 25 in skeletal muscle. Short treatment with <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> increased expression of HSP 70, but not HSP 25. Chia oil in both treatments restored superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase expression. Extended treatment with <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and short treatment with chia oil restored peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator- 1 alpha (PGC- 1 alpha) expression. Conclusion: Chia oil restored the antioxidant system and induced the expression of a higher number of proteins than <b>chia</b> <b>seed.</b> The present study demonstrated new properties and molecular mechanisms associated with the beneficial effects of <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil consumption in diet-induced obese rats.

40|$|Using rhizosphere-scale {{physical}} measurements we {{test the}} hypothesis that plant exudates gel together soil particles and on drying they enhance soil water repellency. Barley and maize root exudates were compared with <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> exudate, a commonly used root exudate analogue. Sandy loam and clay loam soils were treated with root exudates at 0. 46 and 4. 6 mg exudate g- 1 dry soil, and <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> exudate at 0. 046, 0. 46, 0. 92, 2. 3 and 4. 6 mg exudate g- 1 dry soil. Soil hardness and modulus of elasticity were measured at - 10 kPa matric potential using a 3 mm diameter spherical indenter. Water sorptivity and repellency index of air-dry soil were measured using a miniaturized infiltrometer device with a 1 mm tip radius. Soil hardness increased by 28 % for barley root exudate, 62 % for maize root exudate, and 86 % for <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> exudate at 4. 6 mg g- 1 concentration for sandy loam soil. For a clay loam soil, root exudates did not affect soil hardness, whereas <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> exudate increased soil hardness by 48 % at 4. 6 mg g- 1 concentration. Soil water repellency increased by 48 % for <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> exudate and 23 % for maize root exudate, but not for barley root exudate at 4. 6 mg g- 1 concentration for sandy loam soil. For clay loam soil, <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> exudate increased water repellency by 45 %, whereas root exudates did not affect water repellency at 4. 6 mg g- 1 concentration.

HFF diet induced weight gain, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in plasma and liver of animals. Compared to HFF group <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and <b>chia</b> oil (12 and 6 weeks) intake increased plasma reduced thiol (GSH) levels, plasma catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. In the liver glutathione reductase (GRd) activity was enhanced, while CAT and GPx activities did not change. There were no differences in plasma and liver superoxide dismutase activity among chia diets and HFF group. <b>Chia</b> (<b>seed</b> and oil) intake did not modify liver lipid peroxidation, but was able to reduce plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 8 -isoprostane levels increased by HFF group. Plasma and hepatic antioxidant capacity values were increased in <b>chia</b> <b>seed</b> and oil groups about 35 % and 47 %, respectively, compared to HFF group.

The chia oils were characterized with regard to fatty acid (FA) composition, antioxidant properties (ABTS, DPPH and FRAP), Peroxide Index (PI), TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and tocopherol. The yield of the extracted oil was 25. 7 - 32. 2 % with CSE and 27. 8 - 31. 8 % by SC-CO 2. The oils mainly contained unsaturated fatty acids (84. 6 - 88. 1 %), the total concentration was similar between the different extraction methods. The ratio of omega- 6 /omega- 3 fatty acid was 0. 40, being markedly better than that reported for other vegetable oils.
