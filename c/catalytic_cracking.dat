Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. U. S. governmental agencies are calling for strict environmental regulations on the quality of gasoline. Fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracked</b> naphtha is an important blending component of the gasoline pool. The majority of the sulfur in the gasoline pool comes from these cracked naphthas. Therefore, increased regulations win require the removal of sulfur from fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracked</b> naphtha. The hydrodesulfurization processes used to remove sulfur also saturate olefins and reduce octane number. As the sulfur is removed by hydrogenation, the C 6 to CIO olefins become saturated. It has been observed through experimentation that the reactivity of the olefins with hydrogen and the change in octane number depend on the carbon number and type of the olefins. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the reaction kinetics and develop correlations for C 6 to CIO olefin saturation reactions. Data from pilot plant studies at the Texaco Research and Development Lab in Port Arthur, Texas were examined. From the data collected and the correlations that are developed, a more complete understanding of the olefin saturation mechanism in the hydrodesulfurization of FCC naphtha was developed...|$|R

25|$|Since {{crude oil}} {{generally}} contains only 10 to 40 percent of hydrocarbon constituents in the gasoline range, refineries typically use a fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> unit (FCCU) process to convert {{high molecular weight}} hydrocarbons into smaller and more volatile compounds, which are then converted into liquid gasoline-size hydrocarbons. Alkylation processes transform low molecular-weight alkenes and iso-paraffin molecules into larger iso-paraffins with a high octane number.

40|$|<b>Catalytic</b> {{oxidative}} <b>cracking</b> of naphtha is conceptually {{an alternative}} process to steam cracking. The performance of sol–gel synthesized Li/MgO in oxidative cracking of hexane {{as a model}} compound of naphtha, has been studied and {{compared to that of}} conventionally prepared catalyst. At a temperature as low as 575 °C, Li/MgO shows reasonable hexane conversions (28 mol%) and excellent selectivity to light olefins (60 mol%). It is proposed that hexane activation occurs on the catalyst surface via the Li+O− defect sites, where O− active sites abstract hydrogen from a secondary carbon atom. The formed hexyl radical in gas phase and in the presence of molecular oxygen will then undergo a complex radical chemistry resulting in a product mixture of C 1 –C 5 hydrocarbons (paraffins and olefins) as well as combustion products. Presence of oxygen in the feed is crucial to prevent coking, and to regenerate the catalyst surface through reaction with adsorbed surface hydrogen atoms, thus maintaining catalyst activity. Oxygen also plays a significant role in accelerating radical chemistry in gas phase. Unlike steam <b>cracking,</b> <b>catalytic</b> oxidative <b>cracking</b> results in a relatively higher ratio of high olefins (butylenes + propylene) to ethylene. Thus presence of the catalyst provides a better control over product distribution.

25|$|At that time, just a {{few years}} after the Russian Revolution, Russia was desperate to develop {{industry}} and earn foreign exchange, so their oil industry eventually did obtain much of their technology from foreign companies, largely American. At about that time however, fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> was being explored and developed and soon replaced most of the purely thermal cracking processes in the fossil fuel processing industry. The replacement was however not complete; many types of cracking, including pure thermal cracking, still are in use, depending {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the products required to satisfy market demands. Thermal cracking remains important however, for example in producing naphtha, gas oil, and coke, and more sophisticated forms of thermal cracking have been developed for various purposes. These include visbreaking, steam cracking, and coking.|$|E
25|$|Cracking breaks larger {{molecules}} {{into smaller}} ones. This {{can be done}} with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of free-radicals. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> process involves the presence of acid catalysts (usually solid acids such as silica-alumina and zeolites), which promote a heterolytic (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion.

25|$|These {{are used}} for {{high-temperature}} Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (nearly 340nbsp&°C) to produce low-molecular-weight unsaturated hydrocarbons on alkalized fused iron catalysts. The fluid-bed technology (as adapted from the <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of heavy petroleum distillates) was introduced by Hydrocarbon Research in 1946–50 and named the ‘Hydrocol’ process. A large scale Fischer–Tropsch Hydrocol plant (350,000 tons per annum) operated during 1951–57 in Brownsville, Texas. Due to technical problems, and lacking economy due to increasing petroleum availability, this development was discontinued. Fluid-bed Fischer–Tropsch synthesis has recently been very successfully reinvestigated by Sasol. One reactor with a capacity of 500,000 tons per annum is now in operation and even larger ones are being built (nearly 850,000 tons per annum). The process is now used mainly for C2 and C7 alkene production. This new development {{can be regarded as}} an important progress in Fischer–Tropsch technology. A high-temperature process with a circulating iron catalyst (‘circulating fluid bed’, ‘riser reactor’, ‘entrained catalyst process’) was introduced by the Kellogg Company and a respective plant built at Sasol in 1956. It was improved by Sasol for successful operation. At Secunda, South Africa, Sasol operated 16 advanced reactors of this type with a capacity of approximately 330,000 tons per annum each. Now the circulating catalyst process is being replaced by the superior Sasol-advanced fluid-bed technology. Early experiments with cobalt catalyst particles suspended in oil have been performed by Fischer. The bubble column reactor with a powdered iron slurry catalyst and a CO-rich syngas was particularly developed to pilot plant scale by Kölbel at the Rheinpreuben Company in 1953. Recently (since 1990) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch slurry processes are under investigation for the use of iron and cobalt catalysts, particularly for the production of a hydrocarbon wax, or to be hydrocracked and isomerised to produce diesel fuel, by Exxon and Sasol. Today slurry-phase (bubble column) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch synthesis is regarded by many authors as the most efficient process for Fischer–Tropsch clean diesel production. This Fischer–Tropsch technology is also under development by the Statoil Company (Norway) for use on a vessel to convert associated gas at offshore oil fields into a hydrocarbon liquid.|$|E

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} <b>catalytic</b> oxidative <b>cracking</b> (COC) of hexane as a model compound of naphtha is reported. The design is based on experimental data which are elaborated through a structural design method to a process flow sheet. The potential of COC {{as an alternative to}} steam cracking (SC) is discussed through comparing the key differences between the two processes. The presence of Li/MgO catalyst in the COC process (i) induces hexane cracking at lower operation temperatures (575 °C) than in SC (800 °C) and (ii) controls the olefin distribution by increasing the ratio of (butylene[*]+[*]propylene) /ethylene. The product distribution, and thus the separation train of both processes, is different. <b>Catalytic</b> oxidative <b>cracking</b> is designed to maximize propylene and butylene production, while steam cracking is designed to maximize ethylene production. In comparison to SC, the COC process is more energy efficient and consumes 53 % less total duty for a production capacity of 300 kton/year of light olefins. However, a preliminary economic evaluation illustrates that the loss of valuable feedstock as a result of combustion of part of the naphtha feed makes the COC process economically less attractive than SC...|$|R
