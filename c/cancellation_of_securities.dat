As a result, the province of Central Java became the region with the largest <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> local regulation in Indonesia, which is as many 90 -local regulations cancelled. The <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> local regulation implicates the obstacles in the implementation of development and district and municipal programs in Central Java - Indonesia.

The method of writing uses a normative approach with qualitative analysis to detect the level of synchronization and harmonization of the application of local regulations. The results indicate that the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> local regulation by the Governor as the representative of the central government shows an erroneous logic of the implementation of local autonomy.
