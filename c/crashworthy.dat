5|$|On June 24, 2010, WMATA {{adopted a}} six-year capital {{spending}} plan totalling $5 billion. The plan is funded by the $3 billion from the 2008 Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and increased funding from the participating jurisdictions. The plan includes rebuilding much of its infrastructure for improved safety. The NTSB had recommended replacing Metrorail's oldest series of railcars as not <b>crashworthy,</b> and the spending plan would replace those cars.|$|E
5|$|The {{coaches are}} {{primarily}} hauled by MPI MPXpress series locomotives. The current model, the 4000-horsepower MP40PH-3C, {{is more powerful}} that their predecessors, the EMD F59PH. They are capable of pulling or pushing trains of 12 coaches instead of 10. More than 60 of these locomotives have been ordered since their introduction in 2006, with a further 16 types of an even more powerful model, the MP54AC, to enter service in coming years. Opposite the locomotive, trains are bookended by cab cars, which are coaches with driver controls incorporated into them. While most of them closely resemble ordinary coaches, GO Transit began upgrading their rail fleet with newly designed, more <b>crashworthy</b> cab cars {{in the summer of}} 2015, incorporating an improved visibility, safety features and comfort for train crews.|$|E
25|$|The UTTAS {{requirements}} for improved reliability, survivability and lower life-cycle costs resulted in {{features such as}} dual-engines with improved hot and high altitude performance, and a modular design (reduced maintenance footprint); run-dry gearboxes; ballistically tolerant, redundant subsystems (hydraulic, electrical and flight controls); <b>crashworthy</b> crew (armored) and troop seats; dual-stage oleo main landing gear; ballistically tolerant, <b>crashworthy</b> main structure; quieter, more robust main and tail rotor systems; and a ballistically tolerant, <b>crashworthy</b> fuel system.|$|E
25|$|HH-60L (no {{official}} name assigned): UH-60L extensively modified with medical mission equipment. Components include an external rescue hoist, integrated patient configuration system, environmental control system, on-board oxygen system (OBOGS), and <b>crashworthy</b> ambulatory seats.|$|E
25|$|The AS332 Super Puma {{is powered}} by a pair of Turbomeca Makila 1A1 {{turboshaft}} engines which drive the rotorcraft's four-bladed main rotor and five-bladed tail rotor as well two separate hydraulic systems and a pair of electrical alternators. Fuel is housed in six internal fuel tanks, additional auxiliary and external tanks can be equipped for extended flight endurance. For safety, the fuel tanks use a <b>crashworthy</b> plumbing design and fire detection and suppression systems are installed in the engine bay. The monocoque tail boom is fitted with tail rotor strike protection, the forward portion of the boom accommodated a luggage compartment. The retractable tricycle landing gear is designed for high energy absorption qualities.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 can be {{equipped}} with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an ice protection system for operations within cold climates. It can also {{make use of the}} In-Hover Flight Refuelling System (HIFR) as well as additional internal and external fuel tanks to conduct extended range missions. Other equipment includes a wire strike protection system, rappelling system, hoist, cargo hook, search light and various seating options, including <b>crashworthy</b> foldable seats. For performing maritime operations, such tasked NH90s are typically equipped with the Harpoon deck-locking system, automatic main rotor blade and tail folding mechanisms, and other deck handling systems to conduct all-weather ship-borne operations; it is also typically outfitted with dipping sonar and sonobuoy processing equipment.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Aérospatiale {{commenced}} {{development of}} a new medium transport helicopter based on its SA 330 Puma. The project was publicly announced at the 1975 Paris Air Show. While the new design maintained a similar generator layout to the preceding AS 330, it was powered by two of the new and more powerful Turbomeca Makila turboshaft engines, which drove a four-bladed main rotor which made use of composite materials. A great level of attention was paid to making the new model better withstand damage. A more robust fuselage structure was adopted along with a new <b>crashworthy</b> undercarriage, the rotor blades are also able to withstand a level of battle damage, as are the other key mechanical systems across the rotorcraft.|$|E
25|$|Sicking {{has devoted}} {{his career to}} {{designing}} impact energy management systems, specifically focusing on <b>crashworthy</b> safety systems. Sicking has developed numerous “next generation” designs that have significantly reduced the risk of injury and fatality to motorists, from highway drivers to NASCAR racers. His first global success was the ET-2000, the first energy absorbing guardrail terminal – a device that sits over {{the end of a}} guardrail, flattening the guardrail when it is hit by a vehicle. The first study of the device showed that out of 400 crashes, there were three injuries and no fatalities—reducing the risk by a factor of 10. But even with detailed research data and real-world results showing the product a success, Sicking says he gets the most satisfaction from a personal testimonial.|$|E
25|$|The SH09 {{is offered}} with various {{different}} layout configurations; the default of these options has {{a total of}} four passenger seats present in addition to a pair in the front for the pilots, all of which are fully adjustable in height and length. In a high density configuration, five seats are installed in the rear position along with two more passenger seats inline with the pilot's own, which loses the option of the floor window. The use of Kevlar-threaded <b>crashworthy</b> fuel tanks, which are built into the wall and floor of the cargo hold, freed up space to allow for fully adjustable passenger seats in the cabin. The cargo hold is sized to accommodate 10 items of baggage, while the fuel tanks are sized to provide for an endurance of nearly five hours. The rear clamshell door and high-mounted tail boom is thought to potentially be attractive to North American-based air ambulance operators.|$|E
500|$|The crew {{compartment}} has shielding between the cockpits, such {{that at least}} one crew member can survive hits. The compartment and the rotor blades are designed to sustain a hit from [...] rounds. The airframe includes some [...] of protection and has a self-sealing fuel system to protect against ballistic projectiles. The aircraft was designed to meet the crashworthiness requirements of MIL-STD-1290, which specifies minimum requirement for crash impact energy attenuation to minimize crew injuries and fatalities. This was achieved through incorporation of increased structural strength, <b>crashworthy</b> landing gear, seats and fuel system.|$|E
2500|$|The SD60F {{was ordered}} and is {{operated}} by Canadian National {{and has a}} full-width cowl body and <b>crashworthy</b> [...] "safety cab" [...] with a four-piece windshield.|$|E
2500|$|The UH-60 can be {{equipped}} with stub wings {{at the top of}} fuselage to carry fuel tanks or various armaments. The initial stub wing system is called External Stores Support System (ESSS). It has two pylons on each wing to carry two [...] and two [...] tanks in total. The four fuel tanks and associated lines and valves form the external extended range fuel system (ERFS). U.S. Army UH-60s have had their ESSS modified into the <b>crashworthy</b> external fuel system (CEFS) configuration, replacing the older tanks with up to four total [...] <b>crashworthy</b> tanks along with self-sealing fuel lines. The ESSS can also carry [...] of armament such as rockets, missiles and gun pods. The ESSS entered service in 1986. However, {{it was found that the}} four fuel tanks obstruct the field of fire for the door guns; thus, the external tank system (ETS), carrying two fuel tanks on the stub wings, was developed.|$|E
50|$|The UTTAS {{requirements}} for improved reliability, survivability and lower life-cycle costs resulted in {{features such as}} dual-engines with improved hot and high altitude performance, and a modular design (reduced maintenance footprint); run-dry gearboxes; ballistically tolerant, redundant subsystems (hydraulic, electrical and flight controls); <b>crashworthy</b> crew (armored) and troop seats; dual-stage oleo main landing gear; ballistically tolerant, <b>crashworthy</b> main structure; quieter, more robust main and tail rotor systems; and a ballistically tolerant, <b>crashworthy</b> fuel system.|$|E
50|$|The YUH-61 was {{designed}} to meet the UTTAS requirements for improved reliability, survivability and lower life-cycle costs, resulting in features such as dual-engines with improved hot and high altitude performance, and a modular design (reduced maintenance footprint); run-dry gearboxes; ballistically tolerant, redundant subsystems (hydraulic, electrical and flight controls); <b>crashworthy</b> crew (armored) and troop seats; dual-stage oleo main landing gear; ballistically tolerant, <b>crashworthy</b> main structure; quieter, more robust main and tail rotor systems; and a ballistically tolerant, <b>crashworthy</b> fuel system.|$|E

50|$|<b>Crashworthy</b> {{systems and}} devices prevent or reduce the {{severity}} of injuries when a crash is imminent or actually happening. Much research is carried out using anthropomorphic crash test dummies.|$|E
5000|$|HAL's Rotary Wing Research & Design Centre, {{informed}} the press during Aero India 2011 that the LCH is [...] "probably the most agile {{design in the}} world because of its rotor". HAL said LCH is of 5.5 tonne class, like the Dhruv, it is powered by two HAL/Turbomeca Shakti turbo-shaft engines and inherits many technical features of the Advanced Light Helicopter. The features that are unique to LCH are sleek and narrow fuselage, tri-cycle <b>crashworthy</b> landing gear, <b>crashworthy</b> and self-sealing fuel tanks, armour protection, nuclear, and low visibility features which make the LCH lethal, agile and survivable.|$|E

5000|$|Martin-Baker also {{manufactures}} what {{it calls}} [...] "crashworthy" [...] seats for helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. , over 20,000 <b>crashworthy</b> seats have been delivered. The Martin-Baker company continues as a family-run business, run by the two sons of the late Sir James Martin.|$|E
50|$|The ALH Mk-III with Shakti engines {{has very}} good high {{altitude}} performance operating at altitudes over 6 km. It comes with seating for 14 fully equipped troops. DGCA has praised its <b>crashworthy</b> design {{as a few}} accidents have not caused any fatalities.|$|E
50|$|In the Dugald train {{disaster}} of September 1947, a Canadian National Railway passenger train consisting of older wooden-bodied passenger cars {{collided with a}} transcontinental passenger train made up of newer steel cars, resulting in severe damage and fatalities on the older train. This accident led to the retirement of the less <b>crashworthy</b> wooden cars.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, it {{acquired}} Simula, Inc. {{a developer}} and producer of military seating systems, the Cockpit Air Bag System (CABS) for US Army helicopters, the Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) armor system, and parachutes. Simula developed and produced the first <b>crashworthy</b> armored crew seats for the US Army UH-60 Black Hawk and AH-64 Apache helicopters.|$|E
50|$|The UH-60 can be {{equipped}} with stub wings {{at the top of}} fuselage to carry fuel tanks or various armaments. The initial stub wing system is called External Stores Support System (ESSS). It has two pylons on each wing to carry two 230 gal and two 450 gal tanks in total. The four fuel tanks and associated lines and valves form the external extended range fuel system (ERFS). U.S. Army UH-60s have had their ESSS modified into the <b>crashworthy</b> external fuel system (CEFS) configuration, replacing the older tanks with up to four total 200 gal <b>crashworthy</b> tanks along with self-sealing fuel lines. The ESSS can also carry 10000 lb of armament such as rockets, missiles and gun pods. The ESSS entered service in 1986. However, {{it was found that the}} four fuel tanks obstruct the field of fire for the door guns; thus, the external tank system (ETS), carrying two fuel tanks on the stub wings, was developed.|$|E

50|$|The {{technology}} base pioneered for the UH-60 Black Hawk and the AH-64 Apache {{was established}} by AATD in the late 60s and 70s, and much of technological advancements have been developed and applied since then. These include elastomeric bearings, elastic pitch beam tail rotor blade, <b>crashworthy</b> subsystems (e.g., fuel systems, landing gear, seating, structure), vibration reduction, aircrew and passenger restraint systems, Cockpit Air Bag System (CABS), Wire Strike Protection System (WSPS), the General Electric T700 and LHTEC T800 engines.|$|E
50|$|Security and Survivability (S&S) {{consists}} of 3 Functional Areas: Platform Survivability (PS), Individual Protection Systems (IPS) and Advanced Materials. Platform Survivability Product lines include armored, <b>crashworthy,</b> and armored-crashworthy seating for aerospace products along with mineblast attenuating seats for vehicles. IPS produces individual small arms and fragmentation protection solutions, such as ESAPI and XSAPI armor, mostly for military customers. In July 2010, {{it was announced}} that Security and Survivability will cease to exist on 1 January 2011. The functional areas of S&S will be assigned to Global Tactical Systems (GTS) or the BAE Systems Products Group.|$|E
50|$|The crew {{compartment}} has shielding between the cockpits, such {{that at least}} one crew member can survive hits. The compartment and the rotor blades are designed to sustain a hit from 23 mm rounds. The airframe includes some 2500 lb of protection and has a self-sealing fuel system to protect against ballistic projectiles. The aircraft was designed to meet the crashworthiness requirements of MIL-STD-1290, which specifies minimum requirement for crash impact energy attenuation to minimize crew injuries and fatalities. This was achieved through incorporation of increased structural strength, <b>crashworthy</b> landing gear, seats and fuel system.|$|E
50|$|The Surion is {{equipped}} with various survivability and damage reduction features. Both the airframe and the cockpit have been made bulletproof against small arms fire. The airframe, tail rotor, and the rotor blades used on both the main and tail rotors are of a <b>crashworthy</b> construction; anti-explosion sealed fuel tanks are also used. The main gearbox is capable of flying for a limited period after suffering the loss of lubricating oil. Various electronic defensive measures are incorporated onto the Surion, such as a countermeasures dispenser system (CMDS), radar warning receiver (RWR), laser warning receiver (LWR).|$|E
50|$|With {{the dwindling}} {{availability}} of these older vehicles, smaller full-sized vehicles of the 1980s and 1990s are more frequently encountered today. A separate class of demolition derby for compact cars is increasing in popularity. Compact car events {{have the advantage}} of an abundant supply of usable vehicles, which also tend to be more mobile and thus, more entertaining to fans. Being largely front-wheel drive vehicles, their back ends can sustain considerable amounts of damage before the vehicle is immobilized. However, this increased speed, coupled with the fact that compact cars tend to be less <b>crashworthy,</b> makes injuries more frequent.|$|E
50|$|The SW-4 {{is capable}} of {{transporting}} up to five people, including a pilot, in <b>crashworthy</b> seats; passengers are provided {{with a high level}} of external visibility and comfort, an optional vibration absorption system is also offered. The main cabin can be rapidly reconfigured between passenger and cargo-carrying configurations and is accessed via two sliding doors on either side of the cabin, a dedicated baggage compartment is also present beneath the main cabin. PZL- Świdnik stated that multi-role operations had been a high priority during the SW-4's development; and that the rotorcraft is well-suited to passenger transport, primary and advanced training, patrol and surveillance missions.|$|E
50|$|The HAL Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) is a 3-tonne light helicopter. According to HAL, it {{possesses}} a cruise speed of 235kmh, maximum speed of 260kmh, service ceiling {{of up to}} 6.5 km, a range of 350 km, a maximum take-off weight of 3.12 tonne and an empty weight of 1.91 tonne. The LUH will be capable of accommodating a maximum of two pilots and six passengers, all of which shall be seated on <b>crashworthy</b> seats; externally, {{it is capable of}} carrying cargoes of up to 1 tonne underslung. It will be able to undertake various missions, including emergency medical services (EMS), troop transport, utility, search and rescue (S&R), VVIP, aerial reconnaissance and surveillance missions.|$|E
50|$|On December 2, 2015, {{the report}} of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada found that the driver of the bus was most likely distracted by the video screens that he was {{required}} to monitor as part of his job. The report also made recommendations to Transport Canada to develop guidelines for the use of in-vehicle video screens to reduce distraction, to develop crashworthiness standards for passenger buses, to equip passenger buses with <b>crashworthy</b> event data recorders, and to develop specific guidance for grade separation. The last recommendation of the report was for the City of Ottawa to review the need for grade separation at the level crossings at Woodroffe Avenue, Transitway and Fallowfield Road.|$|E

50|$|The Boeing Model 360 {{differed}} from its brethren CH-46 and CH-47 tandem rotor helicopters by incorporating extensive amounts of composite materials in structural and dynamic components, namely in advanced rotor heads composed of fiberglass and graphite composites, along with graphite fuselage frames and longerons. The {{exterior of the}} craft integrated a Nomex core, surfaced by a Kevlar woven mesh with graphite-strengthened edges. The two tandem four-bladed counter-rotating rotors were each driven by Avco Lycoming AL5512 turboshaft engines mounted {{on either side of}} the rear fuselage. In another departure from its military brethren, the Model 360 had no external sponsons containing the landing gear or fuel, the tricycle landing gear instead retracting into the main fuselage. Fuel was contained in three <b>crashworthy</b> cells below the cabin floor.|$|E
