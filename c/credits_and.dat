40|$|This paper investigates and quantifies the {{relationship}} between the macroeconomic business cycle <b>and</b> bank-granted <b>credit</b> in South Africa for the period 1985 to 2009. The main question that this research seeks to answer is what role do banks play in amplifying the business cycle and what is the impact of this on the macroeconomy? The outcomes of the econometric model support the hypothesis that a positive relationship exists between bank-extended <b>credit</b> <b>and</b> the business cycle. The vector autoregression technique was used to prove {{the relationship}} between <b>credit</b> <b>and</b> the underlying cycle. The analysis shows that a two-way relationship exists between <b>credit</b> <b>and</b> the coincident indicator, <b>credit</b> <b>and</b> insolvencies <b>and</b> <b>credit</b> <b>and</b> prime. Results from the vector error correction model show a significant short-run relationship of equilibrium in the cointegrating equation between <b>credit</b> <b>and</b> the coincident indicator. This corroborates the underlying theory that credit is a unifying variable that rapidly responds to shocks emanating from the dynamic interaction of cointegrating variables in the economy...|$|R
