The bridge was constructed in the Qiantang River and Yangtze River Deltas and Hangzhou Bay, which all experience some of the highest tidal bore forces on the planet. [...] The location of the bridge is also prone to earthquakes, as well as extremely high winds during typhoon season. The bridge form and construction material selections were based on strength against all the different forces the bridge would face.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> {{have good}} stability, optimum use of {{structural}} materials, aesthetic, relatively low design and maintenance costs, and efficient structural characteristics. Therefore, {{this type of}} bridges {{are becoming more and}} more popular and are usually preferred for long span crossings compared to suspension bridges. A cable-stayed bridge consists of one or more towers with cables supporting the bridge deck. In terms of cable arrangements, the most common type of <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> are fan, harp, and semi fan bridges. Because of their large size and nonlinear structural behaviour, the analysis of these types of bridges is more complicated than conventional bridges. In these bridges, the cables are the main source of nonlinearity. Obtaining the optimum distribution of post-tensioning cable forces is an important task and plays a major role in optimizing the design of <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>bridges.</b> An optimum design of a cable-stayed bridge with minimum cost while achieving strength and serviceability requirements is a challenging task. In this thesis, an advanced and comprehensive numerical model is used to obtain the post-tensioning forces and the optimum design of the three types of cable-stayed bridge. The numerical method is based on finite element, B-spline curves, and real coded genetic algorithm. The optimization accounts for all the variables that define the geometry and cross-section of the bridge. Comparison between the three types, in terms of post-tensioning forces and cost, is carried out in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to find a useful results on the deck stiffness selection in long span <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>bridges</b> at the conceptual stage of design. Decision making involving deck stiffness selection and the choice of the number and spacing of cables to meet deflection criteria is complex and the engineer needs guidance on making early design decisions intuitively. With several assumptions, a model with pinned at one end and clamped at the other end with odd number of cables equally spaced in fan pattern originating from the clamped end was analyzed using stiffness matrix method. At the end of the stiffness matrix analysis, design guidance graphs for (deflection/span length) with deck stiffness was obtained for different number of cables for the worst case of loading for the model with uniformly distributed load throughout the bridge deck and an abnormal type of point loading in the mid span. The deflection limitations for highway bridges in general and cable suspended bridge were included in the graph to obtain the minimum deck stiffness. These, graphs achieved finally from the analysis are worthwhile in the first stage of providing design guidance at the conceptual design in the deck stiffness selection of long span <b>cable</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>bridges...</b>|$|R
