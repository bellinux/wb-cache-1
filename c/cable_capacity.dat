50|$|Since May 2010, Pemba Island {{has had a}} 75-kilometer, 25-megawatt, subsea {{electrical}} link directly to mainland Tanzania. The cable project was financed through a 45 million euro grant from Norway and contributions of 8 million euros from the Zanzibar government and 4 million euros from the Tanzanian national government. The project ended years of dependence on unreliable and erratic diesel generation subject to frequent power cuts. Only about 20 percent of the <b>cable's</b> <b>capacity</b> was being used in January 2011, so it is anticipated that the cable will meet the island's needs for 20 to 25 years.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new combinatorial optimization problem {{that can be}} used to model the deployment of broadband telecommunications systems in which optical fiber cables are installed between a central office and a number of end-customers. In this capacitated network design problem the installation of optical fiber <b>cables</b> with sufficient <b>capacity</b> is required to carry the traffic from the central office to the end-customers at minimum cost. In the situation motivating this research the network does not necessarily need to connect all customers (or at least not with the best available technology). Instead, some nodes are potential customers. The aim is to select the customers to be connected to the central server and to choose the <b>cable</b> <b>capacities</b> to establish these connections. The telecom company takes the strategic decision of fixing a percentage of customers that should be served, and aims for minimizing the total cost of the network providing this minimum service. For that reason the underlying problem is called the Prize-Collecting Local Access Network Design problem (PC-LAN). We propose a branch-and-cut approach for solving small instances. For large instances of practical importance, our approach turns into a mixed integer programming (MIP) based heuristic procedur...|$|R

40|$|Cable median {{barriers}} {{are widely used}} {{across the country to}} prevent cross-median crashes. Several years ago, the Midwest States Pooled Fund Program contracted with the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility (MwRSF) to develop a new, non-proprietary, high-tension, 4 -cable median barrier. In the Fall of 2011 and following two failed full-scale vehicle crash tests on prototype barrier systems, it was determined that design modifications were necessary to improve barrier performance. In addition, members of the Midwest States Pooled Fund Program desired to redirect the development effort. Both of the barrier system failures which prompted the re-design effort could be partially attributed to {{the manner in which the}} cables were attached to the posts. Therefore, the cable-to-post attachments at all four cable heights were to be re-designed. The first step in this effort was to determine the minimum design loads associated with horizontal and vertical curves as a function of post spacing. Once the design loads were known, target capacities for the lateral and vertical cable release out of the cable-to-post attachments were determined. The target vertical and lateral <b>cable</b> release <b>capacities</b> for the lower three cables were 225 lb (1. 00 kN) and 6. 00 kips (26. 7 kN), respectively. The top cable-to-post attachment had a target range of 100 to 200 lb (445 to 890 N) for both the lateral and vertical <b>cable</b> release <b>capacities.</b> MwRSF performed seventy dynamic component tests, forty-five static component tests, and one bogie impact test on prototype cable-to-post attachments. Finally, a cable-to-post attachment, consisting of a bolted tabbed bracket, was recommended for use with the lower three cables and provided lateral and vertical <b>cable</b> release <b>capacities</b> of 6. 10 kips (27. 1 kN) and 346 lb (1. 54 kN), respectively. Further, a top cable-to-post attachment, consisting of a straight brass rod with bent ends, was recommended for placement in a notch and provided a vertical and lateral <b>cable</b> release <b>capacity</b> of approximately 175 lb (778 N).

50|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} tendency {{in recent years to}} expand submarine <b>cable</b> <b>capacity</b> in the Pacific Ocean (the previous bias always having been to lay communications cable across the Atlantic Ocean which separates the United States and Europe).

This is in part a response to the emerging significance of Asian markets in the global economy.|$|E
50|$|A one-hour timeshifted {{service of}} the channel - then known as UKTV G2 - began to operate on 1 November 2004, under the name UKTV G2 +1.

However, with increased pressures on analog <b>cable</b> <b>capacity</b> since the late 1990s, many systems have dropped the channel or moved it to digital cable.|$|E
50|$|TAT-1 (Transatlantic No. 1) was {{the first}} transatlantic {{telephone}} cable system. It was laid between Gallanach Bay, near Oban, Scotland and Clarenville, Newfoundland between 1955 and 1956 by the cable ship Monarch. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, initially carrying 36 telephone channels. In the first 24 hours of public service there were 588 London-U.S. calls and 119 from London to Canada. The <b>capacity</b> of the <b>cable</b> was soon increased to 48 channels. Later, an additional three channels were added by use of C Carrier equipment. Time-assignment speech interpolation (TASI) was implemented on the TAT-1 cable in June 1960 and effectively increased the <b>cable's</b> <b>capacity</b> from 37 (out of 51 available channels) to 72 speech circuits. TAT-1 was finally retired in 1978. Later coaxial cables, installed through the 1970s, used transistors and had higher bandwidth.

All tests were conducted on standard 5 / 8 ~ (15. 9 mm) 7 -strand cable grouted using type 10 Portland cement pastes. The results indicate that <b>cable</b> bolt <b>capacity</b> most critically depends on: (i) the cement properties, which are primarily controlled by water: cement ratio; (//) the embedment length; and (iii) the radial confinement acting on the outer surface of the cement annulus. The material properties of cement paste vary with the water: cement ratio of the mix. The use of low water: cement ratio grouts (< 0. 40 by wt) can increase peak <b>cable</b> bolt <b>capacities</b> by 50 - 75 %.

40|$|Technological {{innovations}} {{and growing}} consumer demand {{have led to}} a variety of design and expansion problems in telecommunication networks. In particular, local access net- works have received a lot of attention, since they account for approximately 60 % of total investments in communication facilities. In this paper we consider the Local Access Network Expansion Problem, in which growing demand can be satisfied by expanding <b>cable</b> <b>capacities</b> and/or installing concentrators in the network. The problem is known to be NP-hard. We present a pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming algorithm, with time complexity O(nB 2) and storage requirements O(nB), where n refers {{to the size of the}} network, and B to an upper bound on concentrator capacity. The cost structure in the network is assumed to be decomposable, but may be non-convex, non-concave, and node and edge dependent otherwise. Computational results indicate that the algorithm is very efficient and can solve medium to large scale problems to optimality within (fractions of) seconds to minutes. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Dynamic {{spectrum}} management (DSM) aims {{to increase the}} utilization of <b>cable</b> <b>capacity</b> by adapting the spectra of digital subscriber line (DSL) systems to the real network environment. In this paper we present a new DSM algorithm: the constrained normalized-rate iterative algorithm (C-NRIA).

This reflects many business scenarios where a number of users must be guaranteed a specific service.
