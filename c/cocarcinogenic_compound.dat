40|$|Rat mast cells, passively {{sensitized}} with monoclonal mouse IgE antibody, were stimulated with multi-valent antigen, and {{an increase}} in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + was determined by using the fluorescent probe quin- 2. The increase in quin- 2 fluorescence reached maximum within 20 sec after the antigen challenge and then gradually declined. A substantial increase in quin- 2 fluorescence was observed in the presence of EGTA, indicating that bridging of cell-bound IgE antibody molecules by antigen induced not only Ca 2 + influx but also mobilization of intracellular Ca 2 +. Phosphatidylserine added to the medium enhanced both the antigen-induced histamine release and the increase in quin- 2 fluorescence and slowed {{the rate at which the}} quin- 2 signal returned to basal levels. Both the antigen-induced increase in quin- 2 fluorescence and histamine release were inhibited by pretreatment of mast cells with inhibitors of methyltransferases, theophylline, or cromoglycate. It was also found that methyltransferase inhibitors and theophylline inhibited not only stimulus-dependent calcium influx but also release of bound calcium from intracellular stores. Other secretagogues, compound 48 / 80 (1 microgram/ml) and Ca ionophore A 23187 (0. 1 microM), induced a rapid increase in cytoplasmic Ca 2 + in rat mast cells and subsequent histamine release. In contrast, the <b>cocarcinogenic</b> <b>compound</b> phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate caused histamine release without increasing the quin- 2 fluorescence...|$|E
40|$|Cigarette smoke induces {{carcinoma}} of the larynx in Syrian golden hamsters and is active as a tumor promoter in hamsters pretreated with a low dose of a PAH, nitrosamine, or nitrosamide. These tumorigenic effects are only observed with total smoke, {{but not with the}} gas phase alone. This demonstrates that the tumorigenic agents reside primarily in the particulate phase. According to fractionation experiments, a number of four- and five-ring aromatic hydrocarbons serve as the major tumor initiators in tobacco smoke. Tumor promoters reside primarily in weakly polaric neutral subfractions and in the weakly acidic portion of the particulate matter and include certain unsaturated hydrocarbons and phenolic <b>compounds.</b> <b>Cocarcinogenic</b> activity is a characteristic feature of tobacco smoke and its particulates. Among the cocarcinogens formed during combustion are catechols and certain nontumorigenic aromatic hydrocarbons and terpenes. Nicotine may also serve as a cocarcinogen as is indicated by preliminary data. The action of tumor promoters and cocarcinogens in tobacco carcinogenesis, the precursors for tobacco smoke promoters and cocarcinogens, and methods for their reduction in smoke are discussed...|$|R
