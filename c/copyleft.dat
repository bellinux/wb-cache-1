5|$|FreeBSD has {{similarities}} with Linux, {{with two}} major differences {{in scope and}} licensing: FreeBSD maintains a complete operating system, i.e. the project delivers kernel, device drivers, userland utilities and documentation, as opposed to Linux delivering a kernel and drivers only and relying on third-parties for system software; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license {{as opposed to the}} <b>copyleft</b> GPL used by Linux.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an active}} access and {{education}} programme, hosting visits from students, workshops with artists, presenting interpretative information and offering some work experience placements within the gallery. project.ARNOLFINI is an online experimental web site with dumps of digital media related to Arnolfini exhibitions and events, past and present, which may be reorganised by any online user, utilising resources {{on the web site}} to create new works and projects under a <b>copyleft</b> license.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{difference}} between Linux {{and many other}} popular contemporary operating systems is that the Linux kernel and other components are free and open-source software. Linux {{is not the only}} such operating system, although it {{is by far the most}} widely used. Some free and open-source software licenses are based on the principle of <b>copyleft,</b> a kind of reciprocity: any work derived from a <b>copyleft</b> piece of software must also be <b>copyleft</b> itself. The most common free software license, the GNU General Public License (GPL), is a form of <b>copyleft,</b> and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the GNU Project.|$|E
50|$|Where <b>copylefted</b> art {{has a large}} {{audience}} of modest means or a small {{audience of}} considerable wealth, the act of releasing the art may be offered for sale. See Street Performer Protocol. This approach {{can be used for}} the release of new works, or can be used for the conversion of proprietary works to <b>copylefted</b> works. See Blender.|$|R
50|$|All IAA artwork {{has been}} <b>copylefted,</b> with {{permission}} {{for use as}} long as it is attributed.|$|R
50|$|Often <b>copylefted</b> artistic creations {{can be seen}} to have a (supporting) {{publicity}} function, promoting other, more traditionally copyrighted creations by {{the same}} artist(s). Artists sticking to an uncompromising <b>copylefting</b> of the whole of their artistic output, could, in addition to services and consultancy, revert to some sort of patronage (sometimes considered as limiting artistic freedom), or to other sources of income, not related to their artistic production (and so mostly limiting the time they can devote to artistic creation too). The least that can be said is that <b>copylefting</b> in art tends toward keeping the art thus produced as much as possible out of the commercial arena - which is considered as an intrinsic positive goal by some.|$|R
25|$|Although the two {{licenses}} work {{on similar}} <b>copyleft</b> principles, the GFDL is not {{compatible with the}} Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.|$|E
25|$|The Open Source Hardware Association {{recommends}} seven licenses which {{follow their}} open-source hardware definition. From the general <b>copyleft</b> licenses the GNU General Public License (GPL) and Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, from the HW specific <b>copyleft</b> licenses the CERN Open Hardware License (OHL) and TAPR Open Hardware License (OHL) {{and from the}} permissive licenses the FreeBSD license, the MIT license, and the Creative Commons Attribution license. Openhardware.org recommended in 2012 the TAPR Open Hardware License, Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 and GPL 3.0 license.|$|E
25|$|Open Content {{licensing}} and Public Domain dedications {{provide the basis}} for open collaboration and content sharing across open-source projects of particular interest to Hebrew readers and students of Judaism. The importance of compatible licensing cannot be understated. In the summer of 2009, content across the Wikimedia Foundation adopted new Open Content licensing in response to incompatibilities between the GNU Free Document license and the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) <b>copyleft</b> license. After this, other non-Wikimedia Foundation projects using Open Content licensing were finally able to exchange content with Wikipedia and Wikisource under a common standard <b>copyleft.</b> This license transition was also significant because Wikisource provided a transcription environment available for multi-user collaboration. With the switch to an Open Content <b>copyleft</b> license, users could collaborate on transcriptions at Wikisource without concern for license incompatibility of the resulting digital editions.|$|E
50|$|The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is a {{software}} license originally {{written for the}} LaTeX system. Software distributed {{under the terms of}} the LPPL can be regarded as free software; however, it is not <b>copylefted.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2008, bits of GPL-licensed code {{were removed}} from the library. While those code bits were {{independent}} from the main CDK library, and no <b>copylefting</b> was involved, to reduce confusions among users, the ChemoJava project was instantiated.|$|R
5000|$|In art, making {{commercial}} services {{out of a}} <b>copylefted</b> creation {{is more difficult to}} do in practice than in software development. Public performances could be considered as one of a few possibilities of providing such [...] "services".|$|R
25|$|The FSF {{holds the}} {{copyrights}} on many {{pieces of the}} GNU system, such as GNU Compiler Collection. As holder of these copyrights, it {{has the authority to}} enforce the <b>copyleft</b> requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL) when copyright infringement occurs on that software.|$|E
25|$|The GCC runtime {{exception}} permits {{compilation of}} proprietary and free software programs with GCC and usage of free software plugins. The availability of this exception {{does not imply}} any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the <b>copyleft</b> requirements of the license of GCC.|$|E
25|$|Stallman {{pioneered the}} concept of <b>copyleft,</b> which uses the {{principles}} of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify and distribute free software, and is the main author of free software licenses which describe those terms, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL), {{the most widely used}} free software license.|$|E
50|$|Windows {{programs}} {{written with}} Cygwin run {{on top of}} a <b>copylefted</b> compatibility DLL that must be distributed with the program, along with the program's source code. MinGW does not require a compatibility layer, since MinGW-based programs are compiled with direct calls to Windows APIs.|$|R
50|$|The GNU Project categorizes {{software}} by copyright status: free software, {{open source}} software, public domain software, <b>copylefted</b> software, noncopylefted free software, lax permissive licensed software, GPL-covered software, the GNU operating system, GNU programs, GNU software, FSF-copyrighted GNU software, nonfree software, proprietary software, freeware, shareware, private software and commercial software.|$|R
50|$|PowerDesk's main {{competitors}} are Total Commander, XYplorer, ZTreeWin amongst commercial software and Midnight Commander and Explorer++ amongst free and/or <b>copylefted</b> software; a comprehensive table {{can be found}} in Wikipedia as part of the article Comparison of file managers. PowerDesk had a 2.5 of 5 rating at CNet as of 15 July 2014.|$|R
25|$|The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a 501(c)(3) {{non-profit}} organization founded by Richard Stallman on 4 October 1985 {{to support the}} free software movement, which promotes the universal freedom to study, distribute, create, and modify computer software, with the organization's preference for software being distributed under <b>copyleft</b> ("share alike") terms, such as with its own GNU General Public License. The FSF was incorporated in Massachusetts, USA, where it is also based.|$|E
25|$|LibreOffice {{also used}} some changes from Apache OpenOffice. In 2013, 4.5% of new commits in LibreOffice 4.1 came from Apache contributors; in 2016, only 11 commits from Apache OpenOffice were merged into LibreOffice, {{representing}} 0.07% of LibreOffice's commits for the period. LibreOffice earlier rebased its LGPLv3 codebase on the Apache OpenOffice 3.4 source code (though it used MPL v2, not the Apache Licence) to allow wider (but still <b>copyleft)</b> licensing under MPL v2+ and LGPL v3+.|$|E
25|$|The CNT journal CNT, or Periódico CNT (CNT Journal), {{operates}} autonomously. Its directorship and headquarters {{are chosen}} in a congress or national plenary. The directorship manages its distribution, printing, sales, and subscriptions, {{as well as}} selecting from among articles submitted. The chosen director attends the CNT National Committee's meetings on a non-voting basis. The Secretary General of the CNT is responsible for writing Periódico CNT's editorial page. Periódico CNT is published monthly, under a Creative Commons <b>copyleft</b> license and it is available in printed and online format.|$|E
5000|$|The conference {{discussed}} issues {{pertaining to}} the Asian Digital Commons, Free/Libre and Open Source Software, business models and collaborative models, Intellectual Property Rights, patents, copyrights, <b>copylefts,</b> the grey economy {{and its impact on}} the Asian [...] "developing world", ideas of the Creative Commons, alternate law practices, access to knowledge (a2k), Open Access, open alternatives, peer-to-peer (P2P) practices and open standards.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{excluding}} {{some notable}} exceptions like the Debian Project (which is expressly noncommercial {{and committed to}} free software on principle), most Linux distributors don't actively seek to limit their usage of proprietary software or restrict the proliferation of non-free licenses in connection with their distributions. There {{appears to be no}} real reason why an exploitation of commercial services surrounding <b>copylefted</b> creations would not be possible in small-scale business, which as a business concept is no more complex than making money with a [...] "public domain" [...] recipe for brewing coffee - successfully exploited by so many cafeteria owners. However, there are few examples so far of SMEs having risked such a leap for their core business. UserLinux, a project set up by Bruce Perens, supports the emergence of such small-scale business based on free software, that is, <b>copylefted</b> or otherwise freely licensed computer programs. The UserLinux website showcased some case studies and success stories of such businesses.|$|R
50|$|Street Performer Protocol is {{an early}} {{description}} of a type of threshold pledge system. SPP is the threshold pledge system encouraging the creation of creative works {{in the public domain}} or <b>copylefted,</b> described by Steven Schear and separately by cryptographers John Kelsey and Bruce Schneier. This assumes that current forms of copyright and business models of the creative industries will become increasingly inefficient or unworkable in the future, because of the ease of copying and distribution of digital information.|$|R
25|$|In April 2011 Oracle stopped {{development}} of OpenOffice.org and laid off the remaining development team. Its reasons {{for doing so}} were not disclosed; some speculate that {{it was due to}} the loss of mindshare with much of the community moving to LibreOffice while others suggest it was a commercial decision. In June 2011 Oracle contributed the OpenOffice.org trademarks and source code to the Apache Software Foundation, which Apache re-licensed under the Apache License. IBM, to whom Oracle had contractual obligations concerning the code, appears to have preferred that OpenOffice.org be spun out to the Apache Software Foundation above other options or being abandoned by Oracle. Additionally, in March 2012, in the context of donating IBM Lotus Symphony to the Apache OpenOffice project, IBM expressed a preference for permissive licenses, such as the Apache license, over <b>copyleft</b> license. The developer pool for the Apache project was seeded by IBM employees, who, from project inception through to 2015, did the majority of the development.|$|E
25|$|In the past, Firefox was {{licensed}} solely {{under the}} MPL, then version 1.1, which the Free Software Foundation {{criticized for being}} weak <b>copyleft,</b> as the license permitted, in limited ways, proprietary derivative works. Additionally, code only licensed under MPL 1.1 could not legally be linked with code under the GPL. To address these concerns, Mozilla re-licensed most of Firefox under the tri-license scheme of MPL 1.1, GPL 2.0, or LGPL 2.1. Since the re-licensing, developers were free to choose the license under which they received most of the code, to suit their intended use: GPL or LGPL linking and derivative works when one of those licenses is chosen, or MPL use (including the possibility of proprietary derivative works) if they chose the MPL. However, on January 3, 2012, Mozilla released the GPL-compatible MPL 2.0, and {{with the release of}} Firefox 13 on June 5, 2012, Mozilla used it to replace the tri-licensing scheme.|$|E
500|$|Conservapedia {{allows users}} to [...] "use any of the content on this site with or without attribution." [...] The {{copyright}} policy also states, [...] "This license is revocable only in very rare instances of self-defense, such as protecting continued use by Conservapedia editors or other licensees." [...] It also does not permit [...] "unauthorized mirroring." [...] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has raised concerns {{about the fact that}} the project is not licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) or a similar <b>copyleft</b> license, stating that [...] "eople who contribute [...] are giving them full control of the content, which may lead to unpleasant results." ...|$|E
5000|$|Flemming {{claims that}} filmmaking {{can now be}} [...] "as {{inexpensive}} as writing novels" [...] and that the <b>copylefting</b> practice {{is a way for}} new artists to gain notice and distribution in a marketplace dominated by large corporations. Free Cinema was inspired by the Free Software Movement, which is guided by similar principles of freedom. Flemming is also the owner and operator of Fair Use Press, which distributes e-books critical of public figures such as Bill O'Reilly and Arnold Schwarzenegger for their stance on intellectual property law.|$|R
5000|$|Code {{licensed}} under a permissive {{free software}} licence, {{such as the}} BSD license, {{can be incorporated into}} <b>copylefted</b> (for instance, GPL'd) projects. Such code is thus [...] "GPL-compatible". There is no need to secure the consent of the original authors. In contrast, code under the GPL cannot be relicensed under the BSD license without securing the consent of all copyright holders. Thus the two licenses are compatible, but (unless such consent has been obtained) the combination as a whole must be distributed {{under the terms of the}} GPL and not the permissive license.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{distributors}} of Linux-based systems (like Red Hat and Mandriva) {{might have had}} some ups and downs in finding a successful construction (or business model) for setting up such businesses, but in time it was shown to be possible to base a business on a commercial service surrounding a <b>copylefted</b> creation. One well-known example is Mandrake, {{which was one of}} the first companies to succeed on the stock market after the implosion of large parts of the IT market in the early 21st century. They also had success in convincing government bodies to switch to their flavor of Linux.|$|R

2500|$|From 1991 until 2001, GPL {{enforcement}} {{was done}} informally, [...] usually by Stallman himself, often with assistance from FSF's lawyer, Eben Moglen. Typically, GPL violations {{during this time}} were cleared up by short email exchanges between Stallman and the violator. In the interest of promoting <b>copyleft</b> assertiveness by software companies to the level that the FSF was already doing, in 2004 Harald Welte launched gpl-violations.org.|$|E
2500|$|Apache OpenOffice {{inherits}} its {{handling of}} file formats from OpenOffice.org, excluding some which were supported only by <b>copyleft</b> libraries, such as WordPerfect support. There is no definitive {{list of what}} formats the program supports other than the program's behaviour. [...] Notable claimed improvements in file format handling in 4.0 include improved interoperability with Office Open XML, although it cannot write Microsoft's newer XML formats like DOCX, only read.|$|E
50|$|MP3 is both {{patented}} and entrenched, {{as noted}} by Richard Stallman in 2001 (in justifying a liberal license for Ogg Vorbis):there is (…) the danger that people will settle on MP3 format {{even though it is}} patented, and we won't be *allowed* to write free encoders for the most popular format. (…) Ordinarily, if someone decides not to use a <b>copylefted</b> program because the license doesn't please him, that's his loss not ours. But if he rejects the Ogg/Vorbis code because of the license, and uses MP3 instead, then the problem rebounds on us—because his continued use of MP3 may help MP3 to become and stay entrenched.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} GLAFF, {{a large-scale}} versatile French lexicon extracted from Wiktionary, the collaborative online dictionary. GLAFF contains, for each entry, inflectional features and phonemic transcriptions. It distinguishes {{itself from the}} other available French lexicons by its size, its potential for constant updating and its <b>copylefted</b> license. We explain how we have built GLAFF and compare it to other known resources in terms of coverage {{and quality of the}} phonemic transcriptions. We show that its size and quality are strong assets that could allow GLAFF to become a reference lexicon for French NLP and linguistics. Moreover, other derived lexicons can easily be based on GLAFF to satisfy specific needs of various fields such as psycholinguistics...|$|R
50|$|If {{a program}} is free but not <b>copylefted,</b> then some copies or {{modified}} versions {{may not be}} free. A software company can compile the program, with or without modifications, and distribute the executable file as a proprietary software product. The X Window System illustrates this approach. The X Consortium releases X11 with distribution terms that make it noncopylefted free software. If you wish, {{you can get a}} copy which has those distribution terms and is free. However, nonfree versions are available and workstations and PC graphics boards for which nonfree versions are the only ones that work. The developers of X11 made X11 nonfree for a while; they were able to do this because others had contributed their code under the same noncopyleft license.|$|R
