In this test chamber, wind speeds can exceed 240 kilometres per hour, temperatures range from -40 to +60 °C and relative humidity ranges from 5 to 95 per cent. The <b>climatic</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> has a unique variable nozzle that can optimize the airflow from 7 to 13 square metres (and larger) allowing for an unprecedented range of vehicle and test property sizes. Coupled with this feature is a large flexible chassis dynamometer that is integrated into an 11.5-metre turntable.

Its origin dates to the year 1952, and the Second Meeting of the AGARD <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> and Model Testing Panel in Rome, Italy, when it was decided to define two standard <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model configurations (AGARD-A and AGARD-B) to be used for exchange of test data and comparison of test results of same models tested in different <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The idea was to establish standards of comparison between <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> and improve the validity of <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> tests. Among the standard <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> models, AGARD model configuration B (AGARD-B) has become by far the most popular. Initially intended for the supersonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> the AGARD-B configuration has since been tested in many <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> at a wide range of Mach numbers, from low subsonic (Mach 0.1), through transonic (Mach 0.7 to 1.4) to hypersonic (Mach 8 and above).

40|$|The Swedish {{truck and}} bus {{manufacturer}} Scania {{has a number}} of test facilities to support the R&D department and for verification of vehicle properties. The latest addition is the <b>climatic</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> Chassis Dynamometer 7 (CD 7) which can fit trucks and buses for full scale testing and maintain temperatures in the range from - 35 to 50 degree Celsius in the flow circuit, furthermore it can generate both rain and snow conditions. This means that vehicles can be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner at many critical driving conditions. However, since CD 7 is a new facility {{there is a need to}} tune and interpret the results generated in the tunnel and translate them to true, on road conditions. In this project the airflow and temperature distribution in the <b>climatic</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> were studied by means of the CFD solver PowerFLOW based on the Lattice Boltzmann method. As a first step the wind tunnel was simulated empty to check the case set up and to understand the basic flow features in the empty tunnel. In the second step a Scania truck was added to the wind tunnel set up, a truck that also exists as a physical test vehicle at Scania R&D. Thirdly, the same vehicle model was simulated in road like conditions to give a reference for comparison. Lastly, a measurement campaign was performed in the <b>climatic</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> in order to get data for comparison and validation of the simulation results. Simulation results show that CD 7 displays an overestimate of wind tunnel airspeed. To match heat exchanger mass flow and recirculation temperatures at 30 km/h it is shown that CD 7 should indicate closer to 35 km/h. At this low speed range 5 km/h has a strong effect on recirculation of hot air into the cooling package which translates to 1 C increase of air temperature into the charge-air cooler. It also corresponds to an increase of 2 C of the cooling capacity of the vehicle at 30 km/h. Also the temperature in the front air intake system increases by 3 C which is also a significant change that could affect the tuning of the engine. One degree Celsius is within the measurement accuracy of a thermal test at Scania. The simulations at 85 km/h give a corresponding correction of the tunnel velocity around 10 km/h, which means that it is consistently about 10 % off. The experimental results show conformity with the simulations and also support the claim that CD 7 indicates an overestimate of the actual airspeed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wind is {{not always}} a steady flow. It can oscillate, {{producing}} blasts. However, most of the current numerical models of drifting snow are constrained by one major assumption: forcing winds are steady and uniform. Moreover, very few studies have been done to verify this hypothesis, {{because of the lack of}} available instrumentation and measurement difficulties. Therefore, too little is known about the possible role of wind gust in drifting snow. In order to better understand the effect of unsteady winds, we have performed both experiments at the <b>climatic</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> at the CSTB (Centre Scientifique et Technique des Bâtiments) in Nantes, France, and in situ experiments on our experimental high-altitude site, at the Lac Blanc Pass.
