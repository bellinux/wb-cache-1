25|$|Passengers {{paying a}} <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> at a fare machine at an LRT station are issued a transit ticket, which is {{validated}} as an LRT ticket after being time-stamped. This ticket is valid both {{as proof of}} payment and as a transfer. Transfers allow the passenger to transfer from the LRT to a bus, from a bus to the LRT and between buses, and is valid for 90 minutes from {{the time it was}} stamped. Passengers paying a <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> or validating a ticket on a bus obtain a transfer at the time the fare is paid. Transfers also serve as proof of payment for 90 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The fare for Peel's {{accessible}} {{services is}} based on the <b>cash</b> <b>fares</b> of its parallel conventional transit services: Brampton Transit and MiWay. The fare would be equal to the cheaper amount of those two <b>cash</b> <b>fares.</b> As of April 1, 2013, MiWay and Brampton Transit have equal <b>cash</b> <b>fares,</b> both being $3.50, hence a one-way trip also costs $3.50, regardless of distance travelled.|$|R

25|$|Greater {{ridership}} in the 1980s {{prompted the}} writing and passing {{of a student}} referendum that added a $13 fee to registration costs to create the fare-less system. Students who paid their registration fees could ride the bus by simply showing their registration card with a valid registration sticker, or board for a <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> of $0.50. This referendum made Unitrans an even more convenient method of transportation for students attending UC Davis.|$|E
25|$|Provincial {{legislation}} passed in June 2014 dissolved {{the position of}} the Regional Transportation Commissioner. Prior to this time, the Regional Transportation Commissioner approved all <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> increases greater than the rate of inflation. The Commissioner also approved TransLink's plans for annual customer satisfaction surveys, its customer complaint process, and any proposed sale of major assets. The Regional Transportation Commissioner operated separately from the Mayors' Council, the TransLink Board of Directors, and TransLink staff.|$|E
25|$|Several options {{exist for}} adding value to a SmartRider card. The AutoLoad system, which allows Transperth to {{directly}} debit from a passenger's bank account, attracts a 20% discount {{from the normal}} <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> per journey (less than the discount applied to 40-trip MultiRiders under the previous system), while all other methods of adding value attract a 10% discount (less than 10-trip MultiRiders). When a SmartRider card is first purchased, a minimum credit of $10.00 {{in addition to the}} card cost must be added. The card has a maximum limit of $256.00.|$|E

25|$|Thunder Bay Transit fares {{were last}} {{increased}} on May 1, 2009. Exact <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> on Thunder Bay Transit is $2.50, and {{children under the}} age of eight ride free when accompanied by an adult. Bus tickets can be purchased in groups of 10 for $17.50, and twenty ride punch passes can be purchased for $31.00. Tickets and twenty ride passes are transferablethey can be shared by many people at one timeand twenty ride passes do not expire. A transfer pass can be obtained when boarding with cash, tickets or a twenty ride pass, and allows passengers to change buses up to two times for the price of one fare. Transfer passes have a one-hour time limit and are non-transferablethey can be used only by the person to whom they are issued.|$|E
25|$|As {{this route}} is {{contracted}} {{with a private}} company, fares are high. A monthly pass costs $232, while one-way <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> is $12. Because of this, some Embrun residents instead take OC Transpo route #232, which has a stop at a park and ride lot 8km north of Embrun. This is considerably cheaper (Route #232 costs $119 for a monthly pass and $4.65 for one-way), but less convenient, as OC Transpo does not service the community itself, meaning Embrun residents have to drive 8km {{to the park and}} ride lot to ride OC Transpo. Route 232 also has later scheduled times—the latest trip on the 232 arrives in Ottawa for 8:20am, and leaves Ottawa at 5:15pm, which is much more convenient for Embrun residents who work 9-5 workweeks.|$|E
25|$|Card users {{sometimes}} {{forget to}} touch in or touch out, {{are unable to}} find the yellow readers {{or it may be}} too crowded to touch out. Such card users have either received penalty fares by revenue inspectors, been charged a maximum <b>cash</b> <b>fare,</b> or been prosecuted in courts which can issue high penalties. Card users are also penalised for touching {{in and out of the}} same station within a two-minute period. The system applies two penalty fares (one for touching in, and one for touching out) to passengers who touch in, wait more than twenty minutes for a train, but are unable to travel because there are no trains, baulk at the waiting, and touch out. This is because the system assumes that, after such a long delay, the passenger has traveled to another station where they have failed to touch out and failed to touch in, thus resulting in two penalty fares.|$|E
5000|$|Riders {{wishing to}} pay <b>cash</b> <b>fares</b> for GO bus service {{will need to}} pay the regular GO fare for the {{applicable}} zones, not the DRT fare.|$|R

25|$|The <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> for Muni Metro, like Muni buses, {{effective}} July 1, 2017, is $2.75 {{for adults}} and $1.35 for youth ages 5–17, seniors, and the disabled. Like Muni buses, the Muni Metro operates on a proof-of-payment system; on paying a fare, the passenger will receive a ticket good for travel on any bus, historic streetcar, or Metro vehicle for 90 minutes. Payment methods depend on boarding location. On surface street sections {{in the south and}} west of the city, passengers can board {{at the front of the}} train and pay their fare to the train operator to receive their ticket; those who already have a ticket, or who have a daily, weekly, or monthly pass, can board at any door of the Metro streetcar. Subway stations have controlled entries via faregates, and passengers usually purchase or show Muni staff a ticket in order to enter the platform area. Faregates closest to an unmanned Muni staff booth open automatically if a passenger has a valid pass or transfer that cannot be scanned. Muni's fare inspectors may board trains at any time to check for proof of payment from passengers.|$|E
500|$|The <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> is $2.75, {{the same}} fare {{as on the}} New York City Subway and MTA Regional Bus Operations. Fares are paid on entry and exit only at St. George and Tompkinsville. Rides not {{originating}} or terminating at St. George or Tompkinsville are free. Prior to the 1997 introduction of [...] "one-fare zone" [...] that came along with free transfers from the SIR to the subway system and MTA buses by using the MetroCard, fares were collected by the conductors on the trains for passengers boarding at stops other than St. George. In the past, passengers often avoided paying the fare by exiting at Tompkinsville, and taking a short walk to the St. George ferry terminal. Because of this, the MTA installed turnstiles at Tompkinsville, along with a new stationhouse which opened on January 20, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|However, Transperth has {{maintained}} that the default fare is [...] "equal to the <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> on the assumed basis that a passenger who has failed to tag off has travelled to the final destination of that particular bus, train or ferry service", and that the four-zone rate only applies to rail travel. During the implementation trial phase, the default fare was charged at the <b>Cash</b> <b>Fare</b> less the customer's discount based on how they last reloaded their card. With {{the opening of the}} Mandurah railway line, the default fare for travel on all train services was increased to a seven-zone fare, due to the ability of passengers to transfer trains without tagging off/on.|$|E
2500|$|Milwaukee County Transit System The Green Line MetroExpress offers {{service to}} {{downtown}} and north shore suburbs. Regular Route 80 also serves the Airport (from Oak Creek to downtown and north side). Fare card vending machine is located by baggage claim #1 (or pay $2.25 <b>cash</b> <b>fare</b> on board).|$|E
