5|$|Matrices {{which have}} a single row are called row vectors, and those {{which have a}} single column are called column vectors. A matrix which has {{the same number of}} rows and <b>columns</b> is called a square matrix. A matrix with an {{infinite}} number of rows or <b>columns</b> (or both) is called an infinite matrix. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no <b>columns,</b> called an empty matrix.|$|E
5|$|The Lovejoy <b>Columns,</b> {{located in}} Portland, Oregon, United States, {{supported}} the Lovejoy Ramp, a viaduct that from 1927 to 1999 carried the western {{approach to the}} Broadway Bridge over the freight tracks {{in what is now}} the Pearl District. The <b>columns</b> were painted by Greek immigrant Tom Stefopoulos between 1948 and 1952. In 1999, the viaduct was demolished but the <b>columns</b> were spared due to the efforts of the architectural group Rigga. For the next five years, attempts to restore the <b>columns</b> were unsuccessful and they remained in storage beneath the Fremont Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{consists}} of parchment, originally in double sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four <b>columns</b> (48 lines per column) with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight <b>columns</b> thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of <b>columns</b> in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two <b>columns</b> per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 uncial letters.|$|E

5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid <b>columns,</b> hollow <b>columns,</b> plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the {{ice crystals}} {{is determined by the}} air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the <b>columns</b> and plates tend to {{be at the top of}} the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only the <b>columns,</b> plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the <b>columns,</b> and these <b>columns</b> are much longer than normal.|$|E

Drainage systems of these buildings are also well planned, and terra cotta pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits. Large ponds were attached to some monasteries, such as the Kuttam Pokuna (twin pond). Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries. Buildings were constructed using timber, bricks and stones. Stones were used for foundations and <b>columns,</b> while brick were used for walls. Lime mortar was used for plastering walls.|$|E

5|$|During the Renaissance, architects {{aimed to}} use <b>columns,</b> pilasters, and entablatures as an {{integrated}} system. The Roman orders types of <b>columns</b> are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. These {{can either be}} structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall {{in the form of}} pilasters. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or <b>columns</b> with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti {{was one of the first}} to use the arch on a monumental. Renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.|$|E

5|$|During {{the evening}} of 7 August 1944, the attacking forces formed up in six <b>columns,</b> four {{vehicles}} wide, comprising tanks, Kangaroo APCs, half tracks, self-propelled anti-tank guns and Mine flail tanks. At 23:00, Bomber Command commenced the bombardment of German positions along the Caen front. At 23:30, the armoured <b>columns</b> began their advance behind a rolling barrage. Movement was slow at first, many APC drivers became disorientated by the dust caused by the vehicles. Several vehicles became stuck in bomb craters. Simonds had arranged several methods for the <b>columns</b> to maintain direction; some vehicles were fitted with radio direction finders, the artillery fired target-marking shells, Bofors 40 mm guns fired bursts of tracer {{in the direction of}} the advance. In spite of all these measures, there was still confusion. Several vehicles collided or were knocked out.|$|E
5|$|During this period, {{the style}} of the {{building}} was changed from heavy Romanesque into Early English Gothic. Although the base Norman <b>columns</b> were left alone, lancet pointed arches were placed over them in the triforium and some heavy <b>columns</b> were substituted with clustered pillars. The steeple was erected in 1221 and the cathedral was rededicated by Bishop Roger Niger in 1240.|$|E

5|$|If {{infinite}} matrices {{are used}} to describe linear maps, then only those matrices can be used all of whose <b>columns</b> have but {{a finite number of}} nonzero entries, for the following reason. For a matrix A to describe a linear map f: V→W, bases for both spaces must have been chosen; recall that by definition this means that every vector in the space can be written uniquely as a (finite) linear combination of basis vectors, so that written as a (column) vectorv of coefficients, only finitely many entries v'i are nonzero. Now the <b>columns</b> of A describe the images by f of individual basis vectors of V in the basis of W, which is only meaningful if these <b>columns</b> have only finitely many nonzero entries. There is no restriction on the rows of A however: in the product A·v there are only finitely many nonzero coefficients of v involved, so every one of its entries, even if it is given as an infinite sum of products, involves only finitely many nonzero terms and is therefore well defined. Moreover, this amounts to forming a linear combination of the <b>columns</b> of A that effectively involves only finitely many of them, whence the result has only finitely many nonzero entries, because each of those <b>columns</b> do. One also sees that products of two matrices of the given type is well defined (provided as usual that the column-index and row-index sets match), is again of the same type, and corresponds to the composition of linear maps.|$|E
