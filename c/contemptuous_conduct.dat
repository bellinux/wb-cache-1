60|$|The <b>contemptuous</b> <b>conduct</b> of Hartley {{in their}} last interview, had done {{something}} to shake his comrade's confidence in {{the truth of this}} reasoning, and to lead him to suspect that he was playing a very sordid and unmanly part, in trifling with the happiness of this amiable and unfortunate young woman. It was in this doubtful humour that he repaired to the Swan Inn, where he was anxiously expected by his friend the Captain.|$|E
40|$|Contempt {{proceedings}} {{before the}} International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda suffer from two procedural defects: the hearings run afoul {{of the principle of}} legality and fail to afford calibrated procedural protection for accused contemnors. First, this Note contends that these two tribunals properly rely on their inherent powers to codify procedural rules for contempt proceedings. However the tribunals 2 Ì† 7 inherent power to prosecute contempt does not allow the courts to punish <b>contemptuous</b> <b>conduct</b> that has not been explicitly proscribed. Such a prosecution contravenes the principle of legality, which provides that criminal responsibility may attach to conduct only when there is a known preexisting prohibition of that behavior. Second, this Note claims that while the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda may promulgate procedural rules governing contempt hearings, they are not empowered to create criminal contempt laws. Even though contempt proceedings before the tribunals are ostensibly noncriminal, they may be functionally criminal because they can impose substantial penalties. Whether criminal or noncriminal, because the proceedings may lead to severe sanctions, they lack the appropriate procedural protections that should accompany potential property and liberty deprivations...|$|E

"The record {{indicates}} the Court of Appeals {{was concerned about}} the tone of the letter; petitioner concedes that the tone of his letter was 'harsh,' and, indeed it can be read as ill-mannered. All persons involved in the judicial process - judges, litigants, witnesses, and court officers - owe a duty of courtesy to all other participants. The necessity for civility in the inherently contentious setting of the adversary process suggests that members of the bar cast criticisms of the system in a professional and civil tone. However, even assuming that the letter exhibited an unlawyerlike rudeness, a single incident of rudeness or lack of professional courtesy - in this context - does not support a finding of <b>contemptuous</b> or contumacious <b>conduct,</b> or a finding that a lawyer is 'not presently fit to practice law in the federal courts.' Nor does it {{rise to the level of}} 'conduct unbecoming a member of the bar' warranting suspension from practice." ...|$|R
