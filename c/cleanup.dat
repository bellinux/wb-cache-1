5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, <b>cleanup</b> is performed overnight to remove confetti and other debris from Times Square before it is re-opened to the public the following morning. Few traces of the previous night's celebration remain after the <b>cleanup</b> process is completed: following the 2013â€“14 drop, the New York City Department of Sanitation estimated that by 8:00a.m., it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square, using 190 workers from their own crews and the Times Square Alliance.|$|E
5|$|During ashfall events large {{demands are}} {{commonly}} placed on water resources for <b>cleanup</b> and shortages can result. Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} firefighting {{and can lead to}} a lack of water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and may need to advise the public to utilise <b>cleanup</b> methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than hoses).|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Hanford site {{represented}} {{two-thirds of}} the nation's high-level radioactive waste by volume. Hanford is currently the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States and {{is the focus of}} the nation's largest environmental <b>cleanup.</b> Besides the <b>cleanup</b> project, Hanford also hosts a commercial nuclear power plant, the Columbia Generating Station, and various centers for scientific research and development, such as the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the LIGO Hanford Observatory.|$|E

Since then, the group has {{organized}} over 60 community service <b>cleanups</b> and formed an Adopt-A-Shoreline Program that comprises 14 groups that clean habitually littered areas three times per year. As of late 2014, 3,400 volunteers have removed 9,500 bags of trash (enough to fill 30 large dumpsters) and nearly 3,600 tires.http://issuu.com/_aca/docs/2014_fall_newsletter/1 ...|$|R
5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal <b>cleanup</b> deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the <b>cleanup</b> to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford <b>cleanup</b> budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E

5|$|On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, {{with four}} nuclear bombs aboard {{as part of}} Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while {{attempting}} an emergency landing at Thule Air Base, Greenland. The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination, the <b>cleanup</b> (Project Crested Ice) lasting until September of that year. Following closely on the Palomares incident, the <b>cleanup</b> costs and political consequences proved too high to risk again, so SAC ended the airborne alert program the following day.|$|E
5|$|The spill <b>cleanup</b> {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The birds are often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the <b>cleanup</b> efforts.|$|E

5|$|Weapons {{production}} at the plant was halted after a combined FBI and EPA raid in 1989. Due {{to the end of}} the Cold War, changes in nuclear weapons policy, and years of protests, the Rocky Flats Plant was shut down, with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site. The site's mission then changed to <b>cleanup.</b> The Rocky Flats Plant was declared a CERCLASuperfund site in 1989 and began its transformation to a <b>cleanup</b> site in February 1992. Removal of the plant and surface contamination was largely completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with federal and state agency support and stakeholder input. The <b>cleanup</b> effort decommissioned and demolished over 800 structures; removed over 21 tons of weapons-grade material; removed over 1.3 million cubic meters of waste; and, treated more than 16 million gallons of water. Four groundwater treatment systems were also constructed. The site achieved regulatory closure in 2006.|$|E
