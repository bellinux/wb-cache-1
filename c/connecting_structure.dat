5|$|The {{auxiliary}} Marōdo Shrine at Itsukushima Shrine originates {{from the}} 13th-century Kamakura period, and the honden and haiden of the Kibitsu Shrine {{date from the}} 15th-century Muromachi period. In the late 16th century and early 17th century, during the Momoyama period, gongen-zukuri was introduced as a new plan of building shrines. The main hall was joined to the oratory via a <b>connecting</b> <b>structure</b> called the ai-no-ma, derived from the hachiman-zukuri style. Examples of gongen-zukuri are the honden at Kitano Tenman-gū and Ōsaki Hachiman Shrine. Tōshō-gū dates from the Edo period and was completed in 1636. It is a complex assembly of richly adorned shrines, temples and a mausoleum. Such complexes {{are a result of}} the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism which began to appear during the Heian period; Kitano Tenman-gū, built in 947 for the spirit of Sugawara no Michizane, was the first of these byō or jingū-ji.|$|E

40|$|When two {{adjacent}} single {{degree of}} freedom (SDOF) structures dynamically well separated, connected by appropriate viscous damper (Passive Control), their response to the horizontal loads reduced significantly. The soil-structure interaction change the performance of <b>connected</b> <b>structure</b> system. In this paper the influence of soil properties and damping characteristics on <b>connected</b> <b>structure</b> system is analyzed. The introduction of soil-structure interaction requires a mathematical model for the foundation and surrounding soil. The governing equation of equilibrium have been formulated. A range of soil properties and soil damping characteristics are chosen which gives broad picture of <b>connected</b> <b>structure</b> system behavior on influence of soil-structure interaction. The soil damping characteristics have major influence, but poisson’s ratio has a minor influence. It is concluded that the response of <b>connected</b> <b>structure</b> system on soft soil are more critical than those supported on very stiff soils. Various other energy dissipating systems to <b>connect</b> the adjacent <b>structures</b> to control the response are suggested. © IACMA...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of two adjacent single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) <b>structures</b> <b>connected</b> with a viscous damper is studied under base acceleration. The base acceleration is modelled as harmonic excitation {{as well as}} stationary white-noise random process. The governing equations of motion of the connected system are derived and solved for relative displacement and absolute acceleration responses of <b>connected</b> <b>structures.</b> The response of structures {{is found to be}} reduced by connecting with a viscous damper having appropriate damping. For undamped SDOF structures, the closed-form expressions for optimum damping of viscous damper for minimum steady state as well as minimum mean square relative displacement and absolute acceleration of either of the <b>connected</b> SDOF <b>structures</b> are derived. The optimum damper damping is found to be functions of mass and frequency ratio of two <b>connected</b> <b>structures.</b> Further, numerical results had indicated that the damping of the <b>connected</b> <b>structures</b> does not have noticeable effects on the optimum damper damping and the corresponding optimized response. This implies that the derived closed-form expressions for optimum damper damping of undamped structures can also be used in practical applications for damped structures.

40|$|In this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{behavior}} of two identical adjacent <b>structures</b> <b>connected</b> with viscous dampers is investigated under base acceleration. The base acceleration is modeled as harmonic excitation {{as well as}} stationary white-noise random process. Each adjacent structure is modeled as a two-degree-of-freedom system. The governing differential equations of motion of the coupled system are derived and solved for relative displacement and absolute acceleration responses. A parametric study is conducted to study the influence of important system parameters on the response behavior of damper <b>connected</b> <b>structures.</b> The important parameters considered are excitation frequency, mass ratio, and stiffness ratio of the structure. It is observed that the viscous damper is quite effective in controlling the dynamic response of identical <b>connected</b> <b>structures.</b> For a given coupled structure and excitation, {{it is found that}} there exists an optimum value of damping coefficient of damper for which the peak responses under harmonic excitation and the mean square response quantities under stationary white-noise excitation attain the minimum value. The close-form expressions for optimum parameter and corresponding response are derived for an undamped system. Finally, it is observed that the damping ratio of the <b>connected</b> <b>structures</b> does not have noticeable effects on the optimum damper damping. This implies that the proposed close-form expressions of undamped structures can be used for the damped <b>connected</b> <b>structures</b> as well. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
