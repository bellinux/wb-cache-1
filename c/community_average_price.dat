50|$|The most {{expensive}} and largest housing {{markets in the}} U.S. are {{in the state of}} California, so {{there are a number of}} <b>communities</b> where <b>average</b> housing <b>prices</b> hover between US$1-2 million. Generally, the Central Valley in northern California is the least expensive area, as is the Inland Empire in Southern California, though prices in these regions are still much more expensive than most other areas of the country, to the point that there are also communities in these areas where housing <b>prices</b> <b>average</b> around the $1 million mark. The agricultural central counties have some of the highest poverty rates in the state.|$|R
30|$|Competitive {{tendering}} and entry {{regulations are}} difficult to combine, particularly in smaller markets. Still, {{in the case of}} Norway this has not had dramatic consequences, probably {{because of the lack of}} competition in rural <b>communities.</b> On <b>average,</b> unit <b>prices</b> have dropped, but there are reports of isolated cases of higher prices. In general, the quality of the service has improved, although there are examples to the contrary. This research has shown that, within the Norwegian regulatory framework, the challenge has not been to maintain services to the outermost rural areas, as was the case in Sweden, but to maintain the service in communities between these areas and regional centres. This could be attributed to the fact that in the outermost rural areas the entry regulation protects the incumbent from competition. In the in-between areas, where the markets are larger, the taxi service industry is faced with much stiffer competition from the minibus industry, which is not entry regulated, and has a different cost structure.|$|R
50|$|This {{increased}} {{market liquidity}} led to institutional traders splitting up orders according to computer algorithms {{so they could}} execute orders at a better <b>average</b> <b>price.</b> These <b>average</b> <b>price</b> benchmarks are measured and calculated by computers by applying the time-weighted <b>average</b> <b>price</b> or more usually by the volume-weighted <b>average</b> <b>price.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this study, moving <b>average</b> <b>price</b> {{stabilization}} schemes {{were analyzed}} {{under the assumption}} of rational expectations. It was shown that moving <b>average</b> <b>price</b> schemes may induce cyclical behavior into market prices where no cyclical pattern previously existed. Moving <b>average</b> <b>price</b> stabilization schemes are important to Canadian agricultural policy analysis because they are a characteristic of stabilization programs in Canada. Indeed, the Agricultural Stabilization Act, introduced in 1975, and the Gross Revenue Insurance Program, introduced in 1991, use moving <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> to calculate returns to producers.

50|$|One {{benchmark}} conceptually situated between <b>average</b> <b>price</b> {{paid and}} <b>average</b> <b>price</b> charged is the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> displayed. Marketing managers who seek a benchmark that captures {{differences in the}} scale and strength of brands’ distribution might weight each brand’s price in proportion to a numerical measure of distribution. Typical measures of distribution strength include numeric distribution, ACV (%), and PCV (%).|$|R
5000|$|Another useful {{benchmark}} is the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> {{that customers}} pay for brands {{in a given}} category. This average can be calculated {{in at least two}} ways: (1) as the ratio of total category revenue to total category unit sales, or (2) as the unit-share weighted <b>average</b> <b>price</b> in the category. Note that the market <b>Average</b> <b>Price</b> Paid includes the brand under consideration. Note also that changes in unit shares will affect the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid. If a low-price brand steals shares from a higher-priced rival, the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid will decline. This would cause a firm’s price premium (calculated using the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid as a benchmark) to rise, even if its absolute price did not change. Similarly, if a brand is priced at a premium, that premium will decline as it gains share. The reason: a market share gain by a premium-priced brand will cause the overall <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid in its market to rise. This, in turn, will reduce the price differential between that brand and the market average[...] [...] [...] To calculate the price premium using the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid benchmark, managers can also divide a brand’s share of the market in value terms by its share in volume terms. If value and volume market shares are equal, there is no premium. If value share is greater than volume share, then there is a positive price premium.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} these {{strategies}} is usually measured by comparing the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> at which the entire order was executed with the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> achieved through a benchmark execution for the same duration.

At times, the execution price is also compared {{with the price of}} the instrument at the time of placing the order.|$|R

50|$|The post-trade process {{involves}} first {{recording the}} data from previous trading periods, including trade timing, arrival <b>price,</b> <b>average</b> execution <b>price,</b> and relevant details about market movement. These data are then measured and compared to several benchmarks, such as the volume-weighted <b>average</b> <b>price,</b> time-weighted <b>average</b> <b>price,</b> participation-weighted <b>average</b> <b>price,</b> or {{a variety of other}} measures. Implementation shortfall is a commonly targeted benchmark, which is the sum of all explicit and implicit costs. Sometimes, an opportunity cost of not transacting is factored in. After measurement, costs must be attributed to their underlying causes. Finally, this analysis is used to evaluate performance and monitor future transactions.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{association}} between the <b>average</b> timber <b>price</b> and selected economic variables.

It turns out that the real price of wood is decreasing in the long-term perspective. There is a significant increase on price of firewood.

50|$|Calculation of the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid {{requires}} {{knowledge of}} the sales or shares of each competitor. A much simpler benchmark is the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> charged - the simple unweighted <b>average</b> <b>price</b> of the brands in the category. This benchmark requires knowledge only of prices. As a consequence, the price premium calculated using this benchmark is not affected by changes in unit shares. For this reason, this benchmark serves a slightly different purpose. It captures the way a brand’s price compares to prices set by its competitors, without regard to customers’ reactions to those prices. It also treats all competitors equally in the calculation of the benchmark price. Large and small competitors are weighted equally when calculating <b>average</b> <b>price</b> charged.|$|R

This analysis is done on a consumer electronic good, which is extremely seasonal and rife with product entry and exit, unlike previous research in this area. We find that an increase in demand elasticity partially explains lower than expected <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> but not entirely. We are also able to rule out loss-leader and price rigidity theories of low prices. Finally, we find that entry and exit of camcorders does not significantly change <b>average</b> <b>prices.</b> ...|$|R
