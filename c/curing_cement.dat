Hydration was monitored {{with a number}} of instrumental techniques: X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Backscattered Electron (BSE) imaging in conjunction with Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS NMR). The mechanical strength of the pastes was likewise determined at different ages, while mercury intrusion porosimetry was used to establish porosity and pore size distribution. The results confirmed that <b>curing</b> <b>cement</b> at higher temperatures tended to increase the early age hydration rate significantly and decrease longterm compressive strength. The decline in 28 -day compressive strength in pastes cured at high temperatures was attributed to their higher porosity and less uniform microstructure. The FTIR and MAS NMR findings indicated that polymerization was more intense in the calcium silica hydrate gel (C–S–H) formed in pastes cured at high temperatures than in the gel formed in pastes cured at low temperatures. No substantial temperature-induced differences were found between cements with and without fly ash additions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{all but one}} of the acrylic {{bone cement}} brands used in {{cemented}} arthroplasties, N,N-dimethyl- 4 -toluidine (DMPT) serves as the activator of the polymerization reaction. However, many concerns have been raised about this activator, all related to its toxicity. Thus, various workers have assessed a number of alternative activators, with two examples being N,N-dimethylamino- 4 -benzyl laurate (DMAL) and N,N-dimethylamino- 4 -benzyl oleate (DMAO). The results of limited characterization of cements that contain DMAL or DMAO have been reported in the literature. The present work is a comprehensive comparison of cements that contain one of these three activators, in which the values of a large array of their properties were determined.

Material and Method: A 37 -year old male patient came to our clinic searching for fast and economic solution for his unsatisfactory smile appearance. Thought clinical examination multiple diastemas were found (around 2 mm wide or less) between central incisors, central and lateral incisor, lateral incisor and canine in {{the left and right}} maxillary quadrant and poor tooth proportion. There was an old direct composite veneer on the tooth number 9, so we removed it. A wax- up was made for visualization and treatment plan. This case was additive, meaning that tooth reduction is not necessary. Final impressions were taken and sent to the laboratory where six veneers were made with technical composite (Adoro® Ivoclar Vivadent).

40|$|Abstract. Articial Neural Networks (ANNs) have {{recently}} been introduced as an ecient articial intelligence modeling technique for applications involving {{a large number of}} variables, especially with highly nonlinear and complex interactions among input/output variables in a system without any prior knowledge about the nature of these interactions. Various types of ANN models are developed and used for dierent problems. In this paper, an articial neural network of the feed-forward back-propagation type has been applied for the prediction of density and compressive strength properties of the cement paste portion of concrete mixtures. The mechanical properties of concrete are highly in uenced by the density and compressive strength of concrete cement paste. Due to the complex non-linear eect of silica fume on concrete cement paste, the ANN model is used to predict density and compressive strength parameters. The density and compressive strength of concrete cement paste are aected by several parameters, viz, water-cementitious materials ratio, silica fume unit contents, percentage of super-plasticizer, <b>curing,</b> <b>cement</b> type, etc. The 28 -day compressive strength and Saturated Surface Dry (SSD) density values are considered as the aim of the prediction. A total of 600 specimens were selected. The system was trained and validated using 350 training pairs chosen randomly from the data set and tested using the remaining 250 pairs. Results indicate that the density and compressive strength of concrete cement paste can be predicted much more accurately using the ANN method compared to existing conventional methods, such as traditional regression analysis, statistical methods, etc...|$|E

40|$|Background: Strategies {{to improve}} {{mechanical}} strength, neovascularization, and the regenerative capacity of allograft include both {{the addition of}} skeletal stemcells and the investigation of novel biomaterials to reduce and ultimately obviate the need for allograft altogether. Use of bone cement is a common method of stabilizing implants in conjunction with impacted allograft. <b>Curing</b> <b>cement,</b> however, can reach temperatures in excess of 70 °C, which is potentially harmful to skeletal stem cells. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of setting bone cement on the survival of human adult skeletal stem cells within tissue-engineered allograft and a novel allograft substitute. Methods: Milled allograft and a polymer graft substitute were seeded with skeletal stemcells, impacted into a graduated chamber, and exposed to curing bone cement. Sections were removed at 5 -mm increments from the allograft-cement interface. A quantitative WST- 1 assay was performed on each section as a measure of remaining cell viability. A second stage of the experiment involved assessment of methods to potentially enhance cell survival, including pretreating the allograft or polymer by either cooling to 5 °C or coating with 1 % Laponite, or both. Results: There was a significant drop in cellular activity in the sections taken from within 0. 5 cm of the cement interface in both the allograft and the polymer (p < 0. 05), although there was still measurable cellular activity. Pretreatment methods did not significantly improve cell survival in any group. Conclusions: While the addition of bone cement reduced cellular viability of tissue-engineered constructs, this reduction occurred only in close proximity to the cement and measurable numbers of skeletal stem cells were observed, confirming the potential for cell population recovery. Clinical Relevance: These studies highlight a potential pitfall when translating tissue-engineering strategies, but indicate that the use of bone cement should not necessarily be ruled out during the application of cell populations and biomaterials in tissue regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: During polymerization, polymethyl {{methacrylate}} bone cements have complex viscoelastic characteristics. Within a short working time they transform from dough-like consistencies to solid cements. Therefore, {{the time at}} which a cement is introduced to cancellous bone surfaces and subjected to pressure is important, to achieve optimum flow and mechanical interdigitation. Achieving adequate mechanical interlock increases the area for load transfer and reduces localized bone–cement interface stresses. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the flow characteristics for commercial bone cements as a function of time and calculate the apparent viscosities for the curing bone cements. The capillary extrusion method was used to measure the rate of flow of the <b>curing</b> <b>cement,</b> by means of a melt flow index apparatus, which was manufactured in-house. The tests were conducted using nozzles of different lengths and under two loads. This enabled the power index value, n, and the pressure at the die entry, P 0, to be calculated for each material with respect to time. Once the flow characteristics were determined, a series of formulae were used to calculate the shear rates, c, the shear stresses, t, and the apparent viscosities, ga, of the curing bone cements. The results indicated that acrylic bone cements are non-Newtonian, pseudoplastic materials, since the power index values are less than 1. 0 during the curing stage. The consistency indices, K, were calculated from the shear stress versus shear rate data. The apparent viscosities of the cements were found to increase with respect to increases in time. Clinically, it was considered desirable to inject and pressurize the cement into the medullary canal while its viscosity is relatively low in order to obtain maximum interdigitation into cancellous bone, provided adequate containment and a means of pressurization can be achieved. The pseudoplastic character of bone cements is responsible for their reduction in viscosity with increased shear rate, a property that may be exploited to enhance penetration with appropriate delivery...|$|E
40|$|In cement based systems, the {{residual}} stresses {{are created by}} internal expansion. This provides toughening by the release of {{the residual}} stresses as the macro-crack propagates. While circumstantial evidence of the residual stresses exist (e. g. micro-crack formation leading to permanent deformation in flexural tests), {{it is very difficult to}} observe the mechanism in action. The quantitative estimate of the changes occurring in such cement-based systems is challenging due to the anisotropy and complexity of the material. Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques were used in this research to observe the mechanism in action. An ultrasound technique is used to examine strength development and an acoustic emission (AE) technique is used to examine micro-structural changes, micro-cracks, crack initiation, crack propagation, crack arrests and crack bridging in plain concrete samples including samples containing admixtures and waste materials. The NDT techniques were found to be accurate in being able to measure compressive strength, with good correlation between both standard mechanical testing and NDT techniques. It was shown that admixtures could be effectively used to alter the properties of a <b>curing</b> <b>cement</b> mortar. This work has also demonstrated that ultrasound can be successfully used to determine the compressive strength of concrete from an early age. The ability to pre-determine the strength of concrete through correlation with NDT test parameters may reduce the time spent waiting on concrete to set and to obtain results using standard mechanical testing methods. The findings in this research present the effect admixtures had on the curing process of the cement based material. The introduction of certain additives into mortars have demonstrated an increase in both the rate of initial hardening and the magnitude of the compressive strength attained over the curing period depending on the mixture specification. The additives considered have been shown to actively alter and enhance the chemical process of curing from the start of hydration. Some additives that accelerate the curing process (accelerators) were found to lower the compressive strength of concrete using the ultrasound technique. Additives that caused an increase in the final strength of mortar also increased its toughness. The significant contributions in this research enabled observation of micro-structural changes and failure behaviour under compressive and flexural loading conditions on an on-line basis. The results obtained are encouraging and lead to increased understanding of cracking mechanisms in concrete containing various types of additives and aggregates. The application of the AE technique allowed the failure of interfacial bonding to be observed. The variation of the aggregate size and its effect on the monitored waveforms was established and the parameters in the AE signals are directly related to crack propagation (grain bridging/micro-mechanism) and strength of interfacial bonding. These findings have greatly contributed to the understanding of the concrete behaviour under complex conditions where no other technique could provide such valuable information on an online basis...|$|E

40|$|Geopolymer cement was {{evaluated}} as wellbore sealing material for carbon dioxide geosequestration application. <b>Curing</b> of <b>cement</b> system in saline water and strength testing in triaxial stress state condition under lateral confinement {{is relevant to}} primary cementing in CO 2 geosequestration wellbore in saline aquifer. Geopolymer <b>cement</b> was <b>cured</b> in saline water (both at ambient conditions for 28 days and heated (60 °C) conditions for 12 hours) and tested for triaxial strength {{at different levels of}} lateral confinement. Normal water and few other curing techniques were also studied both for geopolymer and API ‘G’ cement. Results reported were compared to evaluate the suitability of saline water for <b>curing</b> of geopolymer <b>cement.</b> Unconfined compression test results showed higher strength for curing in saline water than normal water. Besides, testing strength under lateral confinement demonstrated the material failure behavior from brittle to plastic...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to use an in vitro model to measure caries at the dentine restoration interface of bonded composite resin and auto <b>cure</b> glass ionomer <b>cement</b> restorations and to measure the amount of surface degradation occurring in the restorative materials. METHODS: Specimens of auto <b>cure</b> glass ionomer <b>cements</b> (Riva Fast, Fuji IX Fast, Ketac Molar Quick and Fuji VII) and bonded composite resin restorations (Ice, SDI) were placed separately at the dentino-enamel junction of 10 recently extracted human third molar teeth, disinfected and placed into the overflow from a continuous culture of S. mutans for two weeks. Restorations were sectioned and prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Restoration tooth interfaces were photographed and the distance from the surface of the teeth to the surface of the restorations measured. EPMA of percentage weights of calcium, phosphorous and fluoride were made outwards from the restoration surface 130 pm at a depth of 10 microm below the surface of the dentine. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the surface heights of composite resin, auto <b>cure</b> glass ionomer <b>cements</b> compared to teeth surfaces. Percentage weights of calcium and phosphorus levels were similar to non-demineralized dentine in the auto <b>cure</b> glass ionomer <b>cement</b> samples but there were significant reductions in mineral content of dentine adjacent to bonded composite resin restorations. Fluoride levels were mixed. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that placing a bonded composite resin restoration into dentine affords little protection to the surrounding tooth from caries attack although insignificant degradation of the restorative surface occurs. Placing a glass ionomer cement restoration into dentine protects the surrounding tooth from caries but degradation of the restoration surface occurs.

Significant differences in flow rates, depending on the period of <b>curing</b> of <b>cement</b> pastes and {{on the type of}} testing solution, have been observed. Among the effects that influence the permeation process, an osmotic pressure that originates when distilled water is forced through disk-shaped specimen, has been considered...|$|R

50|$|The {{testing method}} was first {{developed}} at the University of South Florida. It relates the heat generated by <b>curing</b> of <b>cement</b> to the integrity and quality of drilled shafts, augered cast in place (ACIP) piles and other concrete foundations. In general, a shortage of competent concrete (necks or inclusions) is registered by relative cool regions; the presence of extra concrete (over-pour bulging into soft soil strata) is registered by relative warm regions.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{applicability}} of the ultrasonic wave transmission method to estimate the initial setting time of an arbitrary cement paste is discussed. Ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements were fully automated and measured continuously. The Vicar Needle Test was used {{in order to determine the}} initial setting time of cement pastes. Different cement pastes were prepared in order to check the influence of the water/cement ratio, type of <b>cement,</b> <b>curing</b> temperature, <b>cement</b> fineness, and some clinker compositions, on the relationship between the initial setting time and ultrasonic pulse velocity. It was found that the initial setting time of an arbitrary cement paste can be estimated very accurately by the time the first inflection point appears on the ultrasonic pulse velocity curve. Moreover, it can be estimated quite accurately by the time the ultrasonic pulse velocity reaches a fixed value, close to the value of the ultrasonic pulse velocity in water...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{test the}} {{solubility}} of dual cure resin modified resin cement {{in a food}} simulating solution and the shear bond strength compared to conventional Glass ionomer cement. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The materials tested were self-adhesive dual <b>cure</b> resin modified <b>cement</b> and Glass Ionomer (GIC). Twenty Teflon moulds {{were divided into two}} groups of tens. The first group was injected and packed with the modified resin cement, the second group was packed with GIC. To test the solubility, each mould was weighed before and after being placed in an analytical reagent for 30 days. The solubility was measured as the difference between the initial and final drying mass. To measure the Shear bond strength, 20 freshly extracted wisdom teeth were equally divided into two groups and embedded in self-cure acrylic resin. Four mm sections of stainless steel bands were cemented to the exposed buccal surfaces of teeth under a constant load of 500 g. Shear bond strength was measured using a computer controlled materials testing machine and the load required to deband the samples was recorded in Newtons. RESULTS: GIC showed significantly higher mean weight loss and an insignificant lower Shear bond strength, compared to dual <b>cure</b> resin <b>Cement.</b> CONCLUSION: It was found that dual <b>cure</b> resin modified <b>cement</b> was less soluble than glass ionomer cement and of comparable bond strength rendering it more useful clinically for orthodontic band cementation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of curing {{temperature}} on the hydration, microstructure, compressive strength, and transport of cement pastes modified with TiO 2 nanoparticles. These characteristics of cement pastes were studied using non-evaporable water content measurement, X-ray diffraction (XRD), compressive strength test, electrical resistivity and porosity measurements, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was shown that temperature enhanced the early hydration. The <b>cement</b> pastes <b>cured</b> at elevated temperatures generally showed an increase in compressive strength {{at an early age}} compared to the <b>cement</b> paste <b>cured</b> at room temperature, but the strength gain decreased at later ages. The electrical resistivity of the <b>cement</b> pastes <b>cured</b> at elevated temperatures was found to decrease more noticeably at late ages compared to that of the room temperature <b>cured</b> <b>cement</b> paste. SEM examination indicated that hydration product was more uniformly distributed in the microstructure of the <b>cement</b> paste <b>cured</b> at room temperature compared to the <b>cement</b> pastes <b>cured</b> at elevated temperatures. It was observed that high temperature curing decreased the compressive strength and electrical resistivity of the cement pastes at late ages in a more pronounced manner when higher levels of TiO 2 nanoparticles were added...|$|R
