50|$|Mushikamado, or movable Kamado-style cookers are {{now made}} {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including high fire ceramics, refractory materials, double wall insulated steel, traditional terra cotta, and a mix of Portland cement and crushed lava rock. Outer surfaces also vary from a high gloss ceramic glaze, paint, a textured stucco-like surface and ceramic tiles. Modern ceramic and refractory materials decrease cracking - a common fault in the original Japanese design. Portland cement is still associated with cracking problems. In addition to the outer ceramic shell there is also a ceramic or stainless steel bowl inside the unit to hold charcoal. There is a draft opening in the lower side of the unit to provide air to the charcoal, as well as a <b>controllable</b> <b>vent</b> {{in the top of the}} dome lid for air to exit the cooker. Temperature is controlled by adjusting these two vents. One or more grids are suspended over the fire to provide the cooking surface(s) for the food. Finally, most Kamado-style cookers have a hole drilled in the lid to allow the insertion of the stem of a dial-type thermometer for monitoring the cooking temperature of the cooker. The high end kamados have layers of insulation which create low-airflow cooking conditions and are self-opening. Digital temperature control devices can be installed using a small blower to regulate airflow.|$|E

This paper {{deals with}} the on-line control of pa tially {{observed}} discrete event systems (DES), The goal is to restrict he behavior of the system within a prefix-closed legal language while accounting {{for the presence of}} uncontrollable and unobservable events. In the spirit of recent work on the on-line control f partially observed DES (Heymann and Lin 1994) and on variable lookahead control of fu ly observed DES (Ben Hadj-Alouane etal. 1994 c), we propose an approach where, following each observable event, a control action is c mputed-line using an algorithm of linear worst-case complexity. This algorithm, called VLP-PO,has the following additional properties: (i) the resulting behavior is guaranteed to be a maximal controllable and observable sublanguage of the legal language; (ii) different maximals may be generated by varying the priorities assigned to the controllable even~:s, a parameter ofVLP-PO; (iii) a maximal containing the supremal controllable and normal sublanguage of the legal language can be generated by a proper selection of <b>controllable</b> <b>vent</b> priorities; and (iv) nooff-line calculations are necessary. We also present a parallel/distributed version of the VLP-PO algorithm called DI-VLP-PO. This version uses several communicating agents that simultaneously run (on-line) identical versions of the algorithm but onpossibly different parts of the system model and the legal language, according to the structural properties of the system and the specifications. While achieving the same behavior as VLO-PO, DI-VLP-PO runs at a total complexity (for computation and communication) that is significantly lower than its sequentia...|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is made for the process plant comprising a heated extruder {{with one or more}} <b>controllable</b> <b>vents.</b> USE - For discontinuous extrusion of fiber reinforced plastic strands based on natural polymers incorporating natural reinforcing fibers. ADVANTAGE - Voids or inclusions in the extruded product are reduced and the risks of high gas pressure build up are reduced...|$|R
25|$|Rack {{design on}} Panorama Elite, II and III {{contained}} window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate {{was used as}} trim to connect the window edge to the rack. On Supreme the first versions used the same technique but the racks were swaddled in crash protection {{on each side of}} the passenger service unit that was fitted front to back. The service unit used were the same as the Panorama Elite, two <b>controllable</b> <b>vents</b> and a reading light with a rocker switch. The cushioning had a four pointed star engraved into it at intervals. From the Mark III the racks had flatter sides that had no connection to the cant rail. The demisters were located on the edge of the rack within a laminate strip. The PVC or maybe ABS material that coated the underneath of the rack was usually black. This was the final design of rack and saw Supreme through to the end of the series. Those racks utilized flatter service units with eyeball vents and a flat lens on the reading light.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} of The new Panorama Elite {{was to the}} usual high standard that everyone had come to expect from a leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified & well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked & easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square <b>controllable</b> air <b>vents.</b> The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches {{in front of the}} driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous dashboards hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & light assembly as {{the final version of the}} Panorama I. The racks were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design.|$|R
40|$|The {{methodology}} of discrete-event systems (DESs) and supervisory control {{is applied to}} a he-restoration problem, aiming to increase the steady-state security level of a power network during restoration. An example using the IEEE 14 -bus system serves to demonstrate {{the potential of the}} DES formulation in the control of power networks, and to introduce the basic tools and techniques that this formulation offers. Unlike other types of controllers, a DES-based supervisory controller does not serve to specify the exact control action at each state of the network. Rather, it defines an envelope of allowable actions. Within that envelope local controllers make specific decisions to satisfy local performance indices. This approach allows the creation of multi-level non-conflicting hierarchical control procedures, which are particularly attractive to managing large-scale systems. Each level in the hierarchical control structure defines the envelope of operation for the lower-level controllers through the enabling and disabling of <b>controllable</b> e <b>vents.</b> Component failure such as line or generator outages are formulated as uncontrollable events. Synthesis procedures for DES-based supervisory controllers can then be applied to synthesize hierarchical control for large power networks...|$|R
