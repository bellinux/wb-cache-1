40|$|This thesis {{describes}} studies {{into the}} psychometric properties of a Swedish language version of the Adolescent Drug Abuse Diagnosis (ADAD) instrument. The psychometric properties of this instrument have been examined in two previous studies: an American study was conducted by the developers of the interview, Friedman and Utada (1989), and a Swiss study was undertaken by Bolognini et al. (2001). The American and the French (as used in the Swiss study) versions of ADAD exhibit good validity and reliability, in the form of both interrater reliability and {{the internal consistency of the}} <b>composite</b> <b>scores.</b> Study I evaluated {{the psychometric properties}} of the Swedish version of the ADAD interview in normal adolescents and adolescents with antisocial problems. It was found that the instrument has good interrater reliability, that the <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> exhibit moderate internal consistency, and that the concept validity was acceptable and similar to that of the American and Swiss versions. The results also showed that the problem areas of ADAD produced meaningful correlations. The interviewer ratings, the adolescent’s ratings and the <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> were compared and discussed. Some problems concerning the <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> were discovered and will need to be analyzed in future studies. Study II investigated the utility and problems associated with the <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> in the ADAD within and between normal adolescents and adolescents with antisocial problems. When comparing interviewer severity ratings and <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> within the two groups, the <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> were found to behave differently to the interviewer ratings. For normal adolescents, the <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> are generally higher than the interviewer ratings, but for the adolescents with antisocial problems the reverse is true. The interviewer severity ratings seem to be the most appropriate outcome when the objective is to separate antisocial and normal groups of adolescents from each other. The difference between the two groups is smaller as measured by <b>composite</b> <b>scores.</b> The <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> appear to function as viable indicators of current problems in all areas except for Medical and Alcohol problem area. The critical items within the Medical and Alcohol <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> are explored and discussed.   Study III investigated the concurrent and predictive validity of the ADAD Psychological status and problem area. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between the ADAD, Youth Self Report (YSR) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores. The predictive validity of this problem area of the ADAD was tested by exploring its correlations with the YSR, BDI, and DICA problem ratings; moderate correlations were observed, suggesting that in clinical practice, the ADAD Psychological status and problem area may be a useful tool for the assessment and measurement of current psychological problems. The utility obtained by making decisions using the test is substantial. Overall, the results of these studies indicate that the Swedish version of ADAD appears to be a psychometrically good instrument for assessing the severity of adolescents’ problems and their need for treatment, but there are some problems with the Medical and Alcohol <b>composite</b> <b>scores...</b>|$|R

This article proposes an original weighting scheme of CSR strengths and concerns, at the sector level, which is proportional to media and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) scrutiny.

Moreover, findings suggest that firms that {{are exposed to the}} closest scrutiny are usually criticized on one single dimension: for instance, banks for bad corporate governance, and basic-resource firms for environmental damage. <b>Composite</b> <b>scores</b> based on equal weights hence misrepresent CSP and the difference in CSR between sectors...|$|R

Quality of standing balance might {{be more sensitive to}} detect age-related differences. Objective: To study age-related {{differences in}} quality of standing balance, center of pressure (CoP) movement was evaluated using a wide range of CoP parameters in several standing conditions in healthy young and old participants. Methods: In 35 healthy young (18 - 30 years) and 75 healthy old (70 - 80 years) participants, CoP movement was assessed in eight standing conditions on a force plate, including side-by-side, one-leg, semi-tandem and tandem stance, both with eyes open and eyes closed. Direction-specific CoP <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> were calculated from standardized single CoP parameters (mean amplitude, amplitude variability, mean velocity, velocity variability and range) in anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) direction. Linear regression analysis was used to detect age-related differences in single CoP parameters and <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> - adjusted for gender, height and weight. Results: Overall, single CoP parameters were higher in old compared to young participants, but no single CoP parameter consistently demonstrated the largest effect size for all standing conditions. Age-related differences were demonstrated for CoP <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> in AP direction (tandem eyes open; semi-tandem eyes closed; p < 0. 001). CoP <b>composite</b> <b>scores</b> in ML direction were consistently higher for all standing conditions in old compared to young participants (p < 0. 001).
