40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} behaviour of gelatine gels {{as a function}} of test rate and gelatine concentration was determined through lubricated uniaxial <b>compression</b> and wire <b>cutting</b> <b>tests.</b> Similar to other reported literature, it was observed that the fracture stress and strain of the gels were strongly strain rate dependent whereas the strain rate effect was insignificant on the deformation/stiffness properties. The wire <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> led to values of energy release rate, Gc, being determined {{as a function of}} cutting rate. It was found that at small rates (up to 10  mm/min), the value of Gc for the 10 % w/w gelatine concentration was constant at an approximate value of 1. 1  J/m 2. For higher values of test rate, Gc increased such that the log Gc versus log cutting rate data were well approximated with a line of slope equal to 0. 5. An analytical model describing this behaviour is suggested which takes into account the fluid flow of the water through the polymeric porous gel structure. In addition, a numerical simulation of the uniaxial compression was performed using a poroelastic material model. The model enabled the effect of the strain rate on the stress in the solid network and the pore pressure to be determined. A failure criterion based on maximum solid stress was suggested which led to a reasonable agreement with the experimental failure stress and strain data as a function of strain rate...|$|R

The specimens were loaded monotonically out-of-plane {{in control of}} displacement and the tests were stopped at three different damage levels. Each loading level activates different failure mechanism that can influence on residual strength of material. After each quasi-static test, the damaged plate was cut by a diamond saw to obtain tensile specimens. After <b>cutting,</b> <b>compression</b> <b>test</b> carried out by using acoustic emission to monitor the process. Depend on loading level the damage value was variant as it caused different residual strength that was related to acoustic emission signals activities. There is a relation between AE signal energy and mechanical energy that can follow to evaluate the residual strength of panels in different loading level in sandwich panels. Results show that the using AE method having mechanical results can be effective in residual strength and progressive damage evolution...|$|R

In our single-grit cutting，the measured cutting forces with CBN and diamond grains were largely different. For further under- standing of the difference，friction behavior in cutting {{is most important}} characteristic to be solved. So, orthogonal <b>cutting</b> <b>test</b> has been performed to measure friction angle on a carbon steel wilh CBN，diamond compax，and grain tools. And, the <b>cutting</b> <b>test</b> in SEM was also performed to observe chip formation. There are no differences between friction angles of CBN and diamond lools in ordinary <b>cutting</b> <b>test.</b> However，there is great difference in slow and short distance <b>cutting</b> <b>test.</b> Diamond tools showed significantly small friction angle at about first cutting of lmm. In the cutting in SEM，the diamond compax and grain tool show a large shear angle and flow type chip，while CBN compax and grain tool show small shear angle with shear type chip. Therefore, diamond tool keeps a small friction coefficient during short cutting distance, and the phenomenon was shown in high speed single grit <b>cutting</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

This paper proposes a methodology {{to address this problem}} using orthogonal <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> and Genetic Algorithm (GA). First, an analytical model which calculates the dynamic characteristics occurring in the primary shear zone is introduced; then, orthogonal <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> are carried out, to record the following mechanical characteristics with the analytical model: shear stresses, shear strains, strain rates, cutting temperatures; afterwards, GA is employed to obtain the constitutive parameters from these characteristics; at last, the finite element method (FEM) simulations of the <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> are performed to evaluate the predictive accuracies of the obtained parameters.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel methodology to characterize material plastic behavior within a practical range of stresses, strains, strain rates, and temperatures {{encountered in the}} metal cutting process. The methodology is based on integrating a newly developed analytical model with quasi-static <b>tests</b> and orthogonal <b>cutting</b> experiments that incorporate a laser heating system. Friction and heat transfer models are developed to describe the tribological and thermal interactions at the tool-chip interface. These models are implemented in a FEM package {{in order to improve}} the accuracy of the simulation of the machining process. The new analytical model, which is developed to predict the distributions of the stress, the strain, the strain rate, and the temperature in the primary shear zone, is based on conceptual considerations, as well as characterization of the plastic deformation process through comprehensive FEM simulations. Orthogonal cutting experiments at room temperature and preheated conditions were carefully designed. While the <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> at room temperature provided the constitutive data encountered in the primary shear zone, the preheated <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> were designed to capture the material behavior at the high level of temperature and strain encountered in the secondary shear zone. In these preheated <b>cutting</b> <b>tests,</b> a laser beam was employed. Quasi-static tests were also utilized to identify some of the coefficients in the constitutive equations, in order to improve the convergence to a unique solution for the constitutive law. Evaluation criteria were developed to assess the performance of constitutive equations. Based on the developed methodology and the evaluation criteria, a new constitutive equation for Inconel 718 has been proposed. This constitutive equation was further validated by Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) <b>tests</b> and <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> in conjunction with FEM simulations. The SHPB test data show an excellent agreement with the proposed material model. The <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> and the FEM simulation results also proved the validity of the proposed material constitutive law...|$|R

Some approaches have been developed and successfully implemented in industry. However, standard solutions allowing for a quick and easy application of this sensor monitoring method have not been found yet.

40|$|AbstractPrecise force {{measurements}} {{are often used}} {{for the development of}} machining processes. A key measure thereby is the specific cutting force, which comprises several factors such as cutting and work piece material as well as the cutting edge geometry. Therefore, it is vital for <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> to be as close to the real application as possible in order to guarantee a good alignment and transferability of the results. In many <b>cutting</b> <b>tests</b> carried out in a laboratory environment this cannot sufficiently be ensured.

Transformation {{of the data}} from the orthogonal <b>cutting</b> <b>test</b> results to oblique cutting process is applied, and the results are compared with actual oblique <b>cutting</b> <b>tests.</b> Effects of hone radius on cutting forces and flank contact length are also investigated.

For the chip flow angle, the predictions based on kinematic and force balance results yield better results than Stabler's chip flow law.
