40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} and cementing characteristics of single strand wire rope used as material of <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> for supporting ground around underground openings were investigated. Results of tension {{tests showed that}} Young's modulus of the wire rope was approximately {{equal to that of}} steel rod and that lateral deformation of the rope was about 30 % larger than that of steel rod. Results of pull out test of the wire rope buried in cement mortar showed that tensile force in the rope concentrates in the neighborhood of surface of surface of the mortar, and decreases exponentially torwards inside. Pull out load per unit buried length of the wire rope increased with the buried length. From the results of pull out tests, minimum buried length which brings tension break of the rope seems to be a little larger than one meter. The single strand wire rope used in this experiment seems to be about the same as the ordinary deformed steel rod for rock bolting in its axial rigidity or cementing characteristics. <b>Cable</b> <b>bolting</b> ground support seems to be effective for stabilizing large loosened ground around underground openings...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>bolt</b> {{supports}} {{are widely}} used as ground support in underground hard rock and coal mines. During the last two decades, the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> technology has improved significantly and new types of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts,</b> new grouts and new installation methods and pumps have been introduced and successfully developed. The design of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> is currently attempted by empirical methods based on rockmass characterization. However, until such methods do {{not take into account}} all the important parameters affecting the mechanical behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> namely, the type of cable geometry, grout quality, stiffness of the host medium, the amount of confining pressure and the presence of end anchorage and pretension. This thesis deals with the numerical modelling of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> considering all of the above mentioned factors. To evaluate the shear bond stiffness of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts,</b> which simulate the interface between the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> and the rockmass, a new empirical model is developed. A database with data of pull-out tests is constructed. Empirical relations were derived between the shear bond stiffness and the variation of confining pressure, the modulus of elasticity of host medium and the water:cement ratio. The relations were derived for three types of cables (standard cable, nutcase cable and garford bulb cable). A new numerical model using the finite element method is developed for the numerical simulation of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> Together with the empirical model for shear bond stiffness, the numerical model computes the load distribution along the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> and thus can simulate fully grouted, partially grouted, end anchored and tensioned <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> The model is implemented in an existing finite element code (e-z tools). Parametric analyses are performed on the new model, and proved useful in the demonstration of the role of each design parameter. A new design methodology is proposed to evaluate the load distribution along the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt.</b> Two case studies are presented: a stope hanging-wall support by <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> in a hardrock mine and a tailgate secondary supports in a coal mine. A comparison with measurements in the field shows good agreement with computed forces...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>bolting</b> and rock/rebar bolting are the {{two main}} {{reinforcement}} techniques used in underground coal mines to maintain the stability of openings. Due to the structural features of cable strands, cables and solid bolts behave differently in reinforcing rock strata. Since the generation of a cable model is different in a numerical program, and especially impossible in a 2 D program, some researchers tend to replace cable bolts with rebar bolts in numerical models, which is still pretty suspicious. To compare their performance differences when subjected in tension and/or in shear, numerical models of cable and rebar bolt were built and analysed using Flac 3 D program. The generated models of cables and rebar bolts were assigned identical geometrical dimensions and basic mechanical properties to ensure comparability. Attention was mainly given to the strength and stiffness of cables and rebar bolts both in tension and in shear.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of encapsulated <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> in {{the rock}} mass has been studied {{in the past to}} determine the load transfer capacity and their ultimate tensile strength. Past studies were mostly based on pull-out tests because of the ability of pull-out tests to be conducted both in the laboratory and in the field. Thus, a number of experimental and analytical models are available to determine the load transfer capacity of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> mainly in pull-out conditions. On the other hand, studies on the shear performance of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> are limited and are mostly based on experimental studies, which do not accurately simulate the real shear performance of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> The shear behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> is significantly affected by pretension load, <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> surface profile type, ultimate tensile capacity, rock mass strength and cementitious grout or chemical resin properties. None of the past research studies investigated the shear behaviour of various types of fully grouted <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> with varied pretension loads subjected to shearing.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> for ground support is increasing in underground coal mines worldwide. Currently, two methods of evaluating {{the performance of}} the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> are favoured: the short encapsulation pull test, and the shear test. The former method can be used both in the laboratory and in the field while the latter can be undertaken mainly in the laboratory. There are two methods of shear strength testing: single and double shear tests. This paper examines the double shear testing of several <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> currently marketed in Australia under various pre-tension stresses. Both plain and indented wire <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> were tested. It was found that the shear strength of the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> was a function of the wire geometry and initial pre-tension. Indented wire <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> were lower in shear strength than the plain wire <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> A mathematical model was proposed to evaluate the shear strength of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> using Fourier series and a linear relationship between shear and normal loads.

A classification of rock bolting reinforcement systems is presented, followed by the fundamental theory of the load transfer mechanism.

40|$|Fully grouted cable bolts {{have been}} used in the mining {{industry}} for more than fifty years. However, failure of <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> systems still occurs in mine sites, as a result of insufficient load transfer between the rock mass and the cable bolt. Numerous research studies have been conducted to understand the load transfer mechanism of cable bolts in the laboratory. However, there are many shortcomings in previous methods. This thesis aims to propose a new approach to study the load transfer mechanism of cable bolts. As part of this research, a modified Laboratory Short Encapsulation Pull Test (LSEPT) facility was developed. It was mainly composed of two parts, namely the embedment section and the anchor section. The influence of termination methods, borehole roughness and pre-confinement on the performance of cable bolts was investigated. The results show that the pre-confinement has a significant effect on the performance of cable bolts. The load transfer behaviour of two types of cable bolts, the Superstrand cable and the MW 9 cable, was studied. The influence of different parameters including the cable surface geometry, borehole size and confining medium strength was evaluated. The results show that bond failure of Superstrand <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> systems always occurred at the cable/grout interface. However, for the MW 9 cable installed in a standard borehole, bond failure occurred at the grout/rock interface in the weak confining medium. An analytical model was used to study the load transfer behaviour of cable bolts. Experimental results were adopted to validate this model. It was found that the cable/grout interface undergoes different stages in a pull-out test and the non-uniform shear stress distribution is more apparent in long embedment length. The shear performance of the Stratabinder grout in the constant normal stress and constant normal stiffness conditions was also studied. The results reveal that the low normal stiffness has little impact on the performance of the grout. FLAC 2 D software package was used to simulate the axial behaviour of cable bolts. The calibration process of samples and the pull-out performance of cable bolts were validated with experimental results. It was found that the modified surface geometry has an obvious influence on inducing more confining pressure in pull-out tests...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{behavior}} of fully grouted, untensioned cable bolts and their application to the stabilization of underground openings are investigated. The study program undertaken involves field, laboratory and numerical studies which aim to improve {{understanding of the role}} of passive <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> in rock mass support. The higher residual load carrying capacity of the cable and the grout-aggregate mix is compared with that of the conventional grout (cement + water). Based on the variational approach, an analytical model has been developed to calculate the distribution of shear bond stress along the embedded length of a cable bolt. A parametric study is then undertaken to illustrate the support behavior of cable bolts with different grout compositions. A special finite element for the cable bolt was formulated and integrated into existing finite element code called MSAP 2 D, in order to allow the simulation of cable bolts in underground excavations. A practical example is presented to demonstrate the effect of cable bolts on the stability of the opening. The simulation is carried out using the newly developed numerical model with cable bolt simulation capability...|$|E
40|$|The Laboratory Short Encapsulation Pull-out Test (LSEPT) {{has been}} used to test the {{performance}} of <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> under axial loading ever since the 1970 s.

40|$|Cable bolts are {{sometimes}} used in low-seam coal mines {{to provide support}} in difficult ground conditions. This paper describes <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> solutions at two low-seam coal mines in similar ground conditions. Both mines used support systems incorporating cable bolts {{as part of the}} primary support system. Two original cable bolt based support systems as well as two modified systems are evaluated to estimate their ability to prevent large roof falls. One of the support systems incorporated passive cable bolts, while the other used pre-tensioned cable bolts. The results and experience at the mines showed that the modified systems provided improved stability over the original support systems. The presence of the cable bolts is the most important contribution to stability against large roof falls, rather than the details of the support pattern. It was also found that a heavy steel channel can improve the safety of the system because of the 'sling' action it provides. Additionally, the analysis showed that fully-grouted rebar bolts load much earlier than the cable bolts, and pre-tensioning of the cable bolts can result in a more uniform distribution of loading in the roof.

40|$|Fully grouted cable bolts {{are widely}} used in {{underground}} excavations {{as a means of}} reinforcement to the surrounding rock mass and are {{regarded as one of the}} primary supporting tendons especially in deep and highly stressed rock conditions. Despite improvements in design over the past 40 years of <b>cable</b> <b>bolting</b> systems, slippage along the cable/grout interface is still a significant issue as it has an adverse impact on the load transfer between rock mass and cable bolts. In order to better understand this issue, a review was undertaken of previous theoretical analysis models of the load transfer mechanics. The results of this study are outlined in this paper highlighting the deficiencies as well as the range of application for each model. Based on those constitutive models, the influence of relevant factors on the bearing capacity and stiffness of cables such as grout quality and borehole diameter are described. Furthermore, since theories in rock joints are always adopted by researchers to study the behaviour of cable/grout interface, the similarities and differences between them are discussed. According to these analytical models, reasons for different performances of standard and modified cable bolts together with two different bond failure modes are concluded.

Both <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> were of sealed wire construction type, consisting of an outer 5. 5 mm diameter strand layer overlying the middle 3 mm diameter wire strands. Both layers are wrapped around a single solid 7 mm diameter strand wire core. The double shearing test was carried out in 40 MPa concrete blocks, contained in concrete moulds. The <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> were encapsulated in concrete using Minova/ Orica FB 400 pumpable grout.

In the worldwide mining industry the method of gateroad support reinforcement using <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> {{is considered to be}} effective. The experimental application of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> was performed in gateroad # 165 of the "Stepova" mine, Western Donbass, Ukraine, and required instrumental control of "support-rock mass" system conditions. Methods: Obtaining absolute displacement of "support-rock mass" system elements and extensometer anchors by means of levelling in order to improve the method of observation. Results: The peculiarities of geomechanical behaviour of rock mass in the roof of gateroads is investigated.

The system can simulate the work conditions of <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> being pulled off or break under different impact loads in the environment filled with thick mash gas. The system {{can also be used}} to research the failure mechanism of <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> support and to test the possibility of gas burn or explosion ignited by the sparks or high temperature. With AMESim software, we established a simulation model of the impact loading system and performed a performance simulation. Simulation results show that the designed experimental system can achieve a high-speed and a heavy impact load. So its dynamic performances can meet the requirements of <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> impact test. The experiment also shows that the experimental conditions are similar to that of the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> being pulled out in reality...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines is {{conducting}} research on <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> ground supports to assess their material and support properties, to provide design criteria for using <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> supports as roof control systems under various types of underground mining conditions, {{and to provide a}} mathematical model of <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> support systems. Part 1 describes laboratory studies of the support properties of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> made of conventional steel cables and provides recommendations on such topics as the use of thick grouts, selection of breather tubes, and reduction of water bleeding in cement-based grouts. The studies evaluated both single and double cables; effects of different embedment lengths, water-cement ratios, and grout curing temperatures on support strength; effects of use or nonuse of breather tubes; pumpability and water-bleeding properties of grouts; and the strength properties of sand-cement grouts. Part 2 will cover the strength characteristics of birdcage <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> supports, epoxy-coated <b>cables,</b> and cables with steel buttons attached...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> as a secondary support system in coal mines has substantially {{increased over the}} last decades. This development emphasises a prerequisite for {{a better understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> in combination of shear and axial loads, which is of interest to geotechnical engineers and designers of underground structures. Based on various research studies undertaken, analytical models have been proposed to assess the shear performance of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> with the aim of designing safe and sustainable rock structures. Recently, a shear strength model for <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> was proposed by Aziz et al., (2015). The model was based on Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and the Fourier series concept. The proposed analytical model was associated with a set of systematic experimental studies by which model coefficients were calibrated. This paper compares the performance of a number of proposed mathematical models against the experimental data and presents a model that simulates the shear behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts,</b> which is in agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the results of a study into the influence of size of the test sample on the maximum load carrying capacity of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> As part of the design for the standardisation of the laboratory pullout test, it was previously found that the size of the sample in which the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> is embedded can influence the behaviour of the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> in terms of the peak load carrying capacity. This testing was done with a low capacity plain strand <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> with the sample in an unconfined state. Confinement of the sample during testing better simulates the in situ condition of the interaction between the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> and surrounding rock mass. A test program was undertaken to assess whether there was any significant difference in the load carrying capacity with varying diameter of test samples and at different levels of confinement. A series of pull-out tests were conducted on <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> embedded into samples varying between 150 mm and 500 mm in diameter that were placed within a steel cylinder to provide confinement to the test samples. It was found maximum load varied with the test sample diameter up to some threshold diameter but that confinement pressure also had a significant effect o...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> as a secondary support system {{is an increasing}} trend in underground coal mines worldwide. The performances of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> have been evaluated under both axial and shear loading conditions. Two methods of testing cables for shear, single and double shear, have been recognised. This paper examines the shear behaviour {{of a variety of}} <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> under different pre-tension loads by double shear testing. Plain, spiral and the combination of both cable types were used in this study. The initial axial load and the type of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> are the main factors affecting their shear strength. By increasing the axial pre-tension load, the peak shear load occurs at lower shear displacement. The failure angle due to cable bending across the joint at different pre-tension loads varied between 41 ° and 49 °. This demonstrates that the ratio of axial and perpendicular displacements is almost constant and on average the failure occurs at about 45 °. A novel analytical model is proposed to evaluate the shear behaviour of pre-tensioned fully grouted <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> subjected to double shearing. Energy and Fourier Series methods were incorporated in the model to simulate the shear behaviour of <b>cable</b> <b>bolts.</b> The comparison of the experimental results with the proposed model shows a good agreement...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{is able to}} determine the pure shear strength of <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> under various shearing conditions. The proposed model is developed based on the Fourier series concept and a linear relationship between shear and normal forces generated during the <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> shearing. The conventional double shearing apparatus (MKII) was modified to evaluate the pure shear strength of <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> by removing the contribution of concrete blocks contact frictional force. The experimental results obtained from the modified double shear instrument (MKIII) was in good agreement with the proposed mode prediction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{compares the}} shear behavior of fiber glass (FG) bolt, rock bolt (steel rebar <b>bolt)</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> for the bolt contribution to bolted concrete surface shear strength, and bolt failure mode. Two double shear apparatuses of different size {{were used for}} the study. The tensile strength, the shear strength and the deformation modulus of bolt control the shear behavior of a sheared bolted joint. Since the strength and deformation modulus of FG bolt, rock <b>bolt</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> obtained from uniaxial tensile tests are different, their shear behavior in reinforcing joints is accordingly different. Test results showed that the shear stiffness of FG bolted joints decreased gradually from the beginning to end, while the shear stiffness of joints reinforced by rock <b>bolt</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt</b> decreased bi-linearly, which is clearly consistent with their tensile deformation modulus. The bolted joint shear stiffness was highly influenced by bolt pretension in the high stiffness stage for both rock <b>bolt</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolt,</b> but not in the low stiffness stage. The rock bolt contribution to joint shear strength standardised by the bolt tensile strength was the largest, followed by <b>cable</b> <b>bolts,</b> then FG bolts. Both the rock <b>bolts</b> and <b>cable</b> <b>bolts</b> tended to fail in tension, while FG bolts in shear due to their low shear strength and constant deformation modulus...|$|R
