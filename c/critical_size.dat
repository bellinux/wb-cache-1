25|$|In 1903, Svante Arrhenius {{published}} {{in his article}} The Distribution of Life in Space, the hypothesis now called radiopanspermia, that microscopic forms of life can be propagated in space, driven by the radiation pressure from stars. Arrhenius argued that particles at a <b>critical</b> <b>size</b> below 1.5 μm would be propagated at high speed by radiation pressure of the Sun. However, because its effectiveness decreases with increasing size of the particle, this mechanism holds for very tiny particles only, such as single bacterial spores. The main criticism of radiopanspermia hypothesis came from Shklovskii and Sagan, who pointed out the proofs of the lethal action of space radiations (UV and X-rays) in the cosmos. Regardless of the evidence, Wallis and Wickramasinghe argued in 2004 that the transport of individual bacteria or clumps of bacteria, is overwhelmingly more important than lithopanspermia in terms of numbers of microbes transferred, even accounting for the death rate of unprotected bacteria in transit.|$|E
25|$|The term colloid is used {{primarily}} {{to describe a}} broad range of solid-liquid (and/or liquid-liquid) mixtures, all of which contain distinct solid (and/or liquid) particles which are dispersed to various degrees in a liquid medium. The term is specific {{to the size of the}} individual particles, which are larger than atomic dimensions but small enough to exhibit Brownian motion. If the particles are large enough, then their dynamic behavior in any given period of time in suspension would be governed by forces of gravity and sedimentation. But if they are small enough to be colloids, then their irregular motion in suspension can be attributed to the collective bombardment of a myriad of thermally agitated molecules in the liquid suspending medium, as described originally by Albert Einstein in his dissertation. Einstein concluded that this erratic behavior could adequately be described using the theory of Brownian motion, with sedimentation being a possible long-term result. This <b>critical</b> <b>size</b> range (or particle diameter) typically ranges from tens of angstroms (10−10m) to a few micrometres (10−6m).|$|E

Tissue engineering (TE) of bone by combining bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with a porous scaffold, is considered a promising technique. In this study we investigated the potential of tissue engineered bone to heal a <b>critical</b> <b>sized</b> defect in the goat. Orthotopic bone formation was compared to ectopic bone formation in comparable constructs. TE constructs were prepared from goat BMSCs and porous biphasic calcium phosphate ceramic scaffolds. These constructs and scaffolds without cells were implanted paired in <b>critical</b> <b>sized</b> iliac wing defects. Comparable samples were implanted intramuscularly. After 9 (n= 7) and 12 (n= 8) weeks implantation, the samples were analyzed histomorphometrically. After 9 -weeks implantation in the iliac wing defect, significantly more bone apposition was found in the TE condition. After 12 weeks, the defects were almost completely filled with bone, but no significant advantage of TE was determined anymore. This contrasted with the intramuscular samples where TE implants showed significantly more bone at both time points. In conclusion, bone TE is feasible in <b>critical</b> <b>sized</b> defects.

2500|$|Protein {{precipitate}} formation {{occurs in a}} stepwise process. [...] First, a precipitating agent is added and the solution is steadily mixed. [...] Mixing causes the precipitant and protein to collide. Enough mixing time is required for molecules to diffuse across the fluid eddies. [...] Next, proteins undergo a nucleation phase, where submicroscopic sized protein aggregates, or particles, are generated. Growth of these particles is under Brownian diffusion control. Once the particles reach a <b>critical</b> <b>size</b> (0.1 µm to 10 µm for high and low shear fields, respectively), by diffusive addition of individual protein molecules to it, they continue to grow by colliding into each other and sticking or flocculating. This phase occurs at a slower rate. During the final step, called aging in a shear field, the precipitate particles repeatedly collide and stick, then break apart, until a stable mean particle size is reached, which is dependent upon individual proteins. The mechanical strength of the protein particles correlates with {{the product of the}} mean shear rate and the aging time, which is known as the Camp number. Aging helps particles withstand the fluid shear forces encountered in pumps and centrifuge feed zones without reducing in size.|$|E

Increased release of VEGF 165 (750. 4 ± 596. 8 ?g/ml) compared to BMP- 2 (136. 9 ± 123. 4 ?g/ml) was observed after 7 -days in culture. Thereafter, up till 28 days, an increased rate of release of BMP- 2 compared to VEGF 165 was observed.
