5000|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>locator</b> or cable {{avoidance}} tool (CAT) is {{an instrument}} used for detecting the presence and approximate location of buried services in advance of undertaking excavation works. It aims to avoid accidents while excavating. A number of types of detecting technology can be employed by such instruments, including use of magnetic fields, radio frequencies, signal generation, metal detectors, ground-penetrating radar and RFID.|$|E

Enhanced optical methods (infrared thermography, boroscopes, and fiberscopes) ? Acoustic emissions and vibration signature analysis ?

40|$|A <b>cable</b> fault <b>locator</b> is {{described}} for sensing faults such as short circuits in power cables. The apparatus includes {{a plurality of}} current transformers strategically located along a cable. Trigger circuits are connected {{to each of the}} current transformers for placing a resistor in series with a resistive element responsive to an abnormally high current flowing through that portion of the cable. By measuring the voltage drop across the resistive element, the location of the fault can be determined...|$|R
25|$|Fast pulse {{rise time}} rating, high {{dielectric}} strength (breakdown voltage), and low dissipation factor (high Q) are {{the reasons for the}} use of polypropylene film capacitors in fly-back tuning and S-correction applications in older CRT tube television and display equipment. For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as snubbers for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in time-domain reflectometer (TDR) <b>cable</b> fault <b>locators,</b> in welding machines, defibrillators, in high-power pulsed lasers, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.|$|R
40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis, <b>cable</b> fault <b>locators</b> are {{studied for}} use on the overhead electrode lines in the HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) Light project Caprivi Link. The <b>cable</b> fault <b>locators</b> studied operates with the principle of travelling waves, where a pulse is sent in the tested conductor. The time difference is measured from the injection moment to the reflection is received. If the propagation speed of the pulse is known {{the distance to the}} fault can be calculated. This type of unit is typically referred to as a TDR (Time Domain Reflectometer). The study is performed as a computer simulation where a simplified model of a TDR unit is created and applied to an electrode line model by using PSCAD/EMTDC. Staged faults of open circuit and ground fault types are placed at three distances on the electrode line model, different parameters of the TDR units such as pulse width and pulse amplitude along with its connection to the electrode line are then studied and evaluated. The results of the simulations show {{that it is possible to}} detect faults of both open circuit and ground fault types with a suitable TDR unit. Ground faults with high resistance occurring at long distances can be hard to detect due to low reflection amplitudes from the injections. This problem can somewhat be resolved with a function that lets the user compare an old trace of a “healthy” line with the new trace. The study shows that most of the faults can be detected and a distance to the fault can be calculated within an accuracy of ± 250 m. The pulse width of the TDR needs to be at least 10 μs, preferable 20 μs to deliver high enough energy to the fault to create a detectable reflection. The pulse amplitude seams to be of less significance in this simulation, although higher pulse amplitude is likely to be more suitable in a real measurement due to the higher energy delivered to the fault. The Hipotronics TDR 1150 is a unit that fulfil these requirements and should therefore be able to work as a line fault locator on the electrode line...|$|R
40|$|Partial {{discharge}} is a well-recognized {{precursor of}} failure of extruded dielectric power cables. A field diagnostic instrument that is capable {{to locate and}} pinpoint PD sites on shielded power cables in situ is in demand, as competition in the utility industry requires that cables have lower operating cost and higher reliability. An instrument system developed by the Electrical Insulation Research Center (EIRC) at the University of Connecticut comprises three subsystems: a PD location estimator, a <b>cable</b> position <b>locator,</b> and a PD pointer. This thesis deals {{with the development of}} digital PD location estimation algorithms and of the pointer instrumentation. ^ The performance of a PD location estimator which uses observations from time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements via the classical Cramer-Rao lower bound analysis is theoretically analyzed for the first time. As a result of this analysis, a guide for the selection of system design parameters is provided. Two PD location estimation algorithms are developed using the crosscorrelation method and the Estimate-Maximize (EM) algorithm. Both algorithms are tested using computer generated and field recorded data. The performance comparison between these two algorithms is inconclusive. The EM algorithm requires less computation power than the crosscorrelation method. ^ A novel PD pointer instrument is developed using PD sensors that measure external electromagnetic fields generated by the PD. The differential configuration of two PD sensors effectively reduces the environmental noise level and eliminates possible interference from the terminal reflections. Both laboratory and field test results are presented and discussed. The instrument pinpoints PD sites with high accuracy (± 2 in. in laboratory tests) and is easy to operate. ...|$|R
