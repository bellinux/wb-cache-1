The TERENA Certificate Service provides digital certificates that are recognised by the major browsers and devices to the user communities of participating NRENs in a cost-effective manner. The TERENA Academic Certification Authority Repository (TACAR) is a trusted online store of trust anchor certificates, related <b>certificate</b> <b>policies</b> and certificate practice statements registered by the Certification Authorities of organisations in the academic community. The eduGAIN service allows Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructures to interact, enabling the sharing of data between federations and providing an interconnection framework to applications willing to provide their services, content or resources to multiple federations. NRENum.net provides an ENUM service for academia. TERENA's Trusted Introducer service offers an accreditation and certification scheme for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Managing the {{security}} of complex cloud and networked computing environments requires crafting security policy—ranging from natural-language text to highly-structured configuration rules, sometimes multi-layered—specifying correct system behavior in an adversarial environment. Since environments change and evolve, managing security requires managing evolution of policies, which adds another layer, the change log. However, evolution increases complexity, and the more complex a policy, {{the harder it is}} to manage and update, and the more prone it is to be incorrect. This paper proposes hierarchical change mining, drawing upon the tools of software engineering and data mining, to help practitioners introduce fewer errors when they update policy. We discuss our approach and initial findings based on two longitudinal real-world datasets: low-level router configurations from Dartmouth College and high-level Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) <b>certificate</b> <b>policies</b> from the International Gri...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} PKI {{problems}} is currently the lack of interoperability at international level, which is greatly dependent on the automation of the cross-certification procedure using <b>Certificate</b> <b>Policies</b> (CP). This paper addresses the above-mentioned need by presenting an XML-based tool for the automated development and comparison of CPs, with main emphasis on healthcare environments. The CP tool is developed in JAVA and is characterized as flexible, standards-based and extendable, since all data representation is in XML. The implementation follows a prototype CP content standardization for healthcare using RFC 2527 Standard, whereas the CP comparison algorithm {{is based on a}} multi-criteria decision support system. The final aim of the CP tool is to serve as a baseline for an on-line automated cross-certification service, thus enhancing PKI co-operation and interconnection for several business sectors. ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Tax <b>Certificate</b> <b>Policy</b> and the Distress Sale Policy incentives for encouraging diversity, the 1978 Broadcast Policy Statement authorized the use of comparative credit or favorable consideration for minority applicants. These comparative hearings would award merit to applicants poised {{to contribute to the}} Commission's goal of broadening ownership inclusion, and their aim for a [...] "diversity of viewpoints". Earning this favorable consideration meant that the applicant would be an active participant in the facilities daily operations, and serve a practicable purpose to the community in terms of content and viewpoints. Eventually the Distress Sale Policy was overturned in 1987 by a 2-1 vote within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and later, the Tax <b>Certificate</b> <b>Policy</b> was repealed by congress in 1995 with perceived abuses being the reason. [...] In the 1990's the court would eliminate policies that awarded extra credit using race and gender as a basis for consideration. This period saw a movement away from policies concerning the use of gender or racial factors in comparative hearings and employment practices, and the 1996 Telecommunications Act eliminated the comparative hearing process for renewal of broadcast licensing entirely.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{trustworthiness}} of any Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) rests {{upon the}} expectations for trust, {{and the degree}} to which those expectations are met. Policies, whether implicit as in PGP and SDSI/SPKI or explicitly required as in X. 509, document expectations for trust in a PKI. The widespread use of X. 509 in the context of global e-Science infrastructures, financial institutions, and the U. S. Federal government demands efficient, transparent, and reproducible policy decisions. Since current manual processes fall short of these goals, we designed, built, and tested computational tools to process the citation schemes of X. 509 <b>certificate</b> <b>policies</b> defined in RFC 2527 and RFC 3647. Our PKI Policy Repository, PolicyBuilder, and PolicyReporter improve the consistency of certificate policy operations as actually practiced in compliance audits, grid accreditation, and policy mapping for bridging PKIs. Anecdotal and experimental evaluation of our tools on real-world tasks establishes their actual utility and suggests how machine-actionable policy might empower individuals to make informed trust decisions in the future...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{considerations for}} certificate issuing systems and certificate processing applications, and directory systems in environments that employ nonhierarchical public key infrastructures (PKIs). The observations and recommendations here, while applicable {{to almost any}} non-hierarchical PKI, are most relevant to situations where the establishment of interoperability among the PKIs of disparate organizations is a primary goal. They are based on our work with a PKI interoperability testbed comprised of a bridge certification authority (CA) interconnecting multiple PKIs based on CA products from several vendors. Our {{view is that the}} more sophisticated aspects of X. 509 certificate issuance and processing (e. g., <b>certificate</b> <b>policies</b> and mappings, name constraints) are tools that allow the PKI to establish the limits of security interoperability between organizations [1]. Consequently, we believe that the extensions for these X. 509 features should be routinely populated by certificate issuing systems, and expected and processed by certificate processing applications. The goal of the recommendations herein is to promote interoperability among the PKI relying parties, while still allowing the owning organizations to maintain security contro...|$|E

Prohibited uses are specified in the same way.|$|R
