5|$|Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African American {{woman whose}} cancer cells {{are the source}} of the HeLa <b>cell</b> <b>line,</b> the first immortalized <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> {{and one of the most}} {{important}} cell lines in medical research. An immortalized <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> will reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day. As was then the practice, no consent was obtained to culture her cells, nor were she or her family compensated for their extraction or use.|$|E
5|$|Lacks {{was treated}} with radium tube inserts as an {{inpatient}} and discharged {{a few days later}} with instructions to return for X-ray treatments as a follow-up. During her treatments, two samples were taken from Lacks's cervix without her permission or knowledge; one sample was of healthy tissue and the other was cancerous. These samples were given to George Otto Gey, a physician and cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins. The cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as the HeLa immortal <b>cell</b> <b>line,</b> a commonly used <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> in contemporary biomedical research.|$|E

25|$|Human trisomies {{compatible}} with live birth, other than Down syndrome (trisomy 21), are Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13). Complete trisomies of other chromosomes {{are usually not}} viable and represent a relatively frequent cause of miscarriage.

40|$|Five {{out of six}} human {{melanoma}} <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> tested {{were able}} to degrade in vitro a smooth muscle cell extracellular matrix in a plasmin- dependent way. In three of these five <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> this process was mediated by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) {{and in the other}} two <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). All melanoma <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> produced t-PA mRNA and protein, whereas only the two <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> showing u-PA-mediated matrix degradation produced u-PA mRNA and protein. These latter <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> also produced plasminogen activator inhibitor type- 1 (PAI- 1) and type- 2 (PAI- 2) mRNA and protein. u-PA receptor (u-PA-R) mRNA and binding of radiolabeled u-PA was found in all melanoma <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> The metastatic capacity of these <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> was studied in nude mice. All <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were able to develop primary tumors at the subcutaneous inoculation site. The production of plasminogen activators, their inhibitors and urokinase receptor by subcutaneous tumors corresponded with the production by the parental <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> in vitro. The two u-PA and PAI- 1 producing <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> showed the highest frequency to form spontaneous lung metastases after subcutaneous inoculation, whereas five of the six <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> formed lung colonies after intravenous inoculation. In conclusion, u-PA mediated matrix degradation in vitro and production of u-PA and PAI- 1 by human melanoma <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> correlated with their ability to form spontaneous lung metastasis in nude mice. No correlation was found with the ability to form lung colonies after intravenous injection. These findings suggest a role for u-PA and PAI- 1 in a relatively early stage of melanoma metastasis...|$|R

Salmonid <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> derived from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and chum salmon O. keta were designated RTE and RTE- 2 (rainbow trout embryo), RTT (rainbow trout tail), and SEH ("sake" or chum salmon embryo head). Nonsalmonid <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> derived from pond smelt Hypomesus olidus, chevron snakehead Channa striata, and goldfish Carassius auratus were designated WF- 1 ("wakasagi" fin), SHH (snakehead heart), and EPG (epithelioma papulosum of goldfish), respectively. Optimum growth {{for most of}} the <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> was observed in Eagle's minimum essential medium buffered with sodium bicarbonate (26 mM) or a combination of sodium bicarbonate (8. 9 mM) and tris (16 mM). Likewise, most of the <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> showed optimum growth at the lowest NaCl concentration tested (0. 116 M). Optimum growth temperatures ranged from 15 to 20 ℃ for the salmonid <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> and from 15 to 30 ℃ for nonsalmonid <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Except for RTT, the <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were heteroploid. Eleven fish viruses were used to test the susceptibility of these <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>lines</b> derived from salmonids developed cytopathic effects (CPE) when infected with 10 of the 11 fish viruses tested, except for RTT, which produced CPE with only 8 of the fish viruses. Six fish rhabdoviruses used in this study elicited a pronounced CPE when inoculated into nonsalmonid <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> EPG, WF- 1, and SHH.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the expression of}} glial and neuronal cytoskeletal proteins and their messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in established <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> derived from human primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) and malignant gliomas. Northern blot analyses revealed neurofilament (NF) protein mRNAs in 6 of 7 PNET <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> but no glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA. Six of these <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> contained mRNA for the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) known as MAP 1 b, whereas MAP 2 mRNAs were detected only in 1 of the PNET <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> These findings closely paralleled previously published data on the expression of these cytoskeletal proteins in {{the same group of}} PNET <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Although GFAP mRNA was detected in only 2 of 5 glioma <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> 4 of these <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> contained mRNAs for the low-molecular-weight (M(r)) NF protein (NF-L). Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of both GFAP and NF-L protein in 2 of the glioma <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> (U 251 MG and U 373 MG) that contained GFAP and NF-L mRNAs. Further, double immunofluorescence studies showed that GFAP and NF-L co-localized in the same glioma cells. In contrast, neither the middle- (NF-M) or high- (NF-H) M(r) NF proteins or their mRNAs were detected in any of these glioma <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Finally, MAP 1 b mRNA was expressed in all 5 glioma <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> whereas MAP 2 mRNAs were detected in only 3 of the <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> This is the first documentation of the expression of both glial-specific and neuron-specific cytoskeletal proteins in human malignant glioma-derived <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> These data may reflect the aberrant induction of neuron-specific gene products in some neoplastic glial <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Alternatively, our findings may indicate that some glioma <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> correspond to transformed bipotential human central nervous system precursors of cells restricted to a neuronal or glial lineage...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundNo {{comprehensive}} {{data are}} available on the molecular predictors of sensitivity to MET inhibitor in lung carcinomas. MethodsWe examined the efficacy of the MET inhibitor PHA 665752 in 41 <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> of non-small lung carcinoma to determine whether sensitivity to the MET inhibitor is correlated with the (1) genetic statuses of MET, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and KRAS, (2) MET phosphorylation and its downstream signaling pathways, or (3) epithelial-mesenchymal transition. ResultsOf the 41 cells, 8 were highly or intermediately sensitive to PHA 665752, and the remainder were PHA 665752 resistant. The sensitive cells (n = 8) included not only 4 of 4 MET-amplified <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> but also 2 of 11 KRAS-mutated <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> and 1 of 6 EGFR-mutated <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> Unlike the MET-amplified <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> both the MET-mutated <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were PHA 665752 resistant. High phospho-MET was not restricted to the four MET-amplified <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> To the contrary, it was also found in 9 of 37 MET-nonamplified <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> including 3 of 6 EGFR-mutated <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> and 4 of 11 KRAS-mutated <b>cell</b> <b>lines.</b> High phospho-MET was correlated with PHA 665752 sensitivity in the entire panel of <b>cell</b> <b>lines,</b> especially in the KRAS-mutated cells. The AKT and ERK pathways in the high phospho-MET <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> were dependent on MET activation in MET-amplified and KRAS-mutated cells but not in EGFR-mutated and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -amplified cells. ConclusionsMET amplification is an excellent predictor of PHA 665752 sensitivity but not the sole predictor. High phospho-MET and dependence of the AKT and ERK pathways on MET activation may predict sensitivity to PHA 665752, especially in KRAS-mutated <b>cell</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R
