I argue that the objective structure of information resources in cyberspace is not helpful for understanding the experience of individual accessibility in cyberspace. Instead, <b>cyberspatial</b> cognition is crucial in constituting the effective cyber-environment and shaping human <b>cyberspatial</b> behavior. I propose a behavioral model of cyber-accessibility and examine how notions underlying conventional accessibility measures such as impedance and opportunity set can be extended for measuring individual cyber-accessibility.

This suggests that behavioral theories and models may provide a theoretical foundation for cybergeography...|$|E

40|$|Cyber enthusiasts as {{far back}} as Rheingold (1994) have {{suggested}} that <b>cyberspatial</b> technologies such as the Internet have the potential to transform space-time relations and create new social spaces, thus ameliorating social conflict in these contested areas.

This article will analyse whether these technologies are changing the nature of territorial disputes and patterns of social interaction between Protestant and Catholic interface communities in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Interviews were conducted with nine community workers to investigate this issue. Focusing on the potential of social media as tools to facilitate inter-group contact, the paper argues that online interactions alone do not appear at present to have the potential to build the mutual understanding and trust that facilitate positive interface relationships, and indeed community workers fear they may exacerbate community tensions.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in the physics of <b>cyberspatial</b> objects (events, agents, processes) whose behaviors unfold in cyberspace, a manifold where geospatial, infospatial and temporal indices are required to distinguish one object from another and, for a given object, one state from another. Consequently, we propose a cyberspace-time (CST) reference framework for describing the dynamics of cyberphysical systems (CPS). A CPS is an information system (object, intelligent agent or event) whose behavior is defined in geospatial, infospatial and temporal terms. A CPS is responsible, in whole or in part, for observing and possibly reacting to cyberphysical events. As such it may be an observer-controller of other CPS, in client-server (peer-peer) or parent-child (superior-subordinate) configurations. CST is the <b>cyberspatial</b> analog of the classical space-time reference frames found in Newtonian and relativistic physics. Figure 1 – Situation Assessment Figure 1 expresses graphically the following problem: Two autonomous observers (rational 1 cyberphysical systems CPSa and CPSb), from their respective independent reference frames, are tasked with monitoring events related to a specific geophysical process. How do they identify, discover, bind to and observe (measure) the same process? How do (should) physical processes and their proxies (e. g., sensor and actuator subnets) represent their states and behaviors? How do the independent CPS observations compare; by what metrics?

This should illustrate both the three-dimensional consequences as well as the still visionary character of Benedikt’s ideas. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{separates}} {{the city and}} the street in order to examine them as concepts which order our experience of both <b>cyberspatial</b> worlds and the 'posturban' city. The extraordinary persistence of the flâneur and his successor, the cyberflâneur, despite both having been pronounced 'dead' {{can be attributed to the}} need to reconcile these concepts in the continued reproduction of urban subjectivities under the terms of global capitalism. However, there is a tension between the understanding of embodiment which the practice of flânerie mandates and new ontological concepts emerging from the way that the biological sciences now write the body. I will argue that new practices of spatial production which subvert the conceptual cartography of contemporary urban space can emerge from an understanding of the street as responsive to a posthuman performance of embodiment...|$|E

It critically appraises the PUoS and suggests that a way of advancing its methodological assumptions is through developing a “Public Engagemen with Ethics. ” On this basis, concerns about scientific journalism are more effectively contextualized and enhance the possibility of ensuring that non-experts are {{aware of the importance of}} any scientific innovation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{summarizes}} an analytic {{approach to}} describing {{the performance of}} cyberphysical systems (CPS), networked information systems responsible for the real-time governance of physical processes. In particular, we describe the dynamics of objects that interact in cyberspace. The approach {{is based on a}} cyberspace-time reference framework comprising three spatial domains plus time. The spatial domains include geospatial, infospatial and sociospatial references, the latter describing relationships among sovereign enterprises (rational agents) that choose to organize and interoperate for mutual benefit through transactions in both geospatial and infospatial domains. Of particular interest are notions of timeliness and value in cyberspace, especially as they relate to the real-time governance of physical processes and engagements with other cooperating CPS. Our interest, as with celestial mechanics, is in the formation and evolution of <b>cyberspatial</b> objects (stars) and the federated systems (galaxies) they form.

40|$|Abstract. Cultures are {{considered}} to be epistemologically heterogeneous, and it is assumed that epistemologically similar individuals exist across distinct cultures. Epistemological type is viewed as prior to, and trans-cendent of, nationality and culture. IdentifYing a shared epistemological basis for communication {{will be more likely to}} succeed in dialogical contexts where conformity to prevailing national stereotypes may fail. Two levels of communication are distinguished using Bohm's terms-explicate: (conformity to social and cultural symbolic norms and conven-tions) and implicate: (the level at which implicit communicative intention originates). <b>Cyberspatial</b> interactions potentially undermine normative cultural influences and permit multicultural or transcultural environments in which new codes extending from epistemological types, (rather than cultural) become possible, limited only by media potential and symbolis-ation itself. A theory with implications for an alternative to the homogenization of verbal communication is advanced, with a considera-tion of potential elements of codes for universal understandings. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a global growth in <b>cyberspatial</b> {{technologies}} accompanied by increasing speculation from academia and the media concerning their effect on social activities and relations. This article considers the role of cyberspace upon conventional Cartesian notions of space-time relations and evaluates its potential as a new social space. As such, the contention that cyberspace is radically transforming and restructuring social, cultural, political and economic aspects of contemporary, western society is critically reviewed. In particular, the changing nature of identity and community is explored. It is suggested that many of cyberspace’s effects on social relations can be understood within the context of spatial transformations. However, much current analysis is over-hyped and utopian, and needs to be re-situated within the ‘real’. In effect, the implications of cyberspace have to be placed within the context of broader social and economic processes taking place in the world today...|$|E
30|$|The multidimensional {{nature of}} this {{connectivity}} cannot be overemphasized. For its impacts go far beyond epiphenomenal features such as user friendly social media tools, or more comprehensive datasets. Rather, it entails a wholly new form of societal structure. It is not just one where anyone can be connected to anyone, from anywhere, at anytime (though this is significant enough). This expanded relational structure also means that individuals can be connected {{to any kind of}} information at any time, from anywhere. I have argued elsewhere (McGuire 2008) that the plurality of such relations—which underpin a state of hyperconnection, was rather overlooked in the rush to associate information technology with a ‘cyberspace’ where the old rules of human interaction somehow became ‘virtualised’ (Levy 1997). Instead, it now makes equal, if not more sense {{to think in terms of}} hyperspatial rather than <b>cyberspatial</b> urban environments. This is no mere terminological nuance. There are substantial explanatory resources to be gained from exploring analogies between the hyperconnected city and the spatial/‘hyperspatial’ relation previously discussed only by physicists and geometers (cf Pickover 1999; Mlodinow 2003).|$|E
40|$|Software is recoding and {{rescaling}} island space, assembling {{islands in}} new configurations of territoriality and governance. Paying attention to software-supported mobility, sovereignty and place-making offers a key terrain {{for thinking about}} the contemporary rescaling of Caribbean states, island territories, and the imaginary ‘offshore’ economies within them. Travel and leisure destinations, especially in the Caribbean, are being disembedded from national territories and repackaged as unique natural enclaves connected to global metropolitan transport, media, and data flows. Through a discussion of Zaha Hadid’s masterplan for a new resort on Dellis Cay in the Turks and Caicos Islands, the author explores how state space, informational space, and tourist space are converging in new fantasies of mobility, accessibility, and island paradise. The new software- supported spatialities, theorized as urban or metropolitan, are actually affecting remote Caribbean islands and other dispersed enclaves as much as (though in different ways than) ‘advanced’ urban regions. Indeed, as Caribbean states and territories adjust to complex new infrastructures and architectures of mobility, the deformations and refoldings of space described here may precociously prefigure processes of postcolonial urbanism that are restructuring private property, <b>cyberspatial</b> property, and state territory {{in other parts of}} the world. ...|$|E
40|$|Book summary: Cyber Reader is an {{anthology}} of extracts from key texts related {{to the theme of}} cyberspace – the virtual communicative space created by digital technologies. Approaching the subject from a variety of fields, including science fiction, this book reflects the multidisciplinary basis of cyberspace and illustrates how different disciplines can inform one another. Over forty texts are presented in chronological order, beginning with some precursors to cyberspace theory as we know it today. Writings by early theoreticians such as Charles Babbage and Alan Turing, or authors such as EM Forster, help to give a historical perspective to the subject, while texts on theoretical developments show the parallels between real and imagined worlds. Each extract is prefaced by a short introduction by editor Neil Spiller explaining key themes and terms and providing cross references to related texts. An extensive bibliography enables readers to pursue strands of study that interest them. Cyber Reader is an essential source book, introducing students and researchers to <b>cyberspatial</b> theory and practice. It will help readers understand the wealth of opportunities, both practical and theoretical, that cyberspace engenders and enable them to chart its impact on many disciplines...|$|E
40|$|The {{context for}} {{learning}} and education has altered dramatically {{over the last few}} years. We are witnessing shifts that will have a profound effect not only on the social and political orientation of nation states, but also on the ways in which we see ourselves and act upon and within the communities of which we are a part. These shifts will affect how we create meanings, messages and information for the proliferating electronic networks that now surround us. We will also have to re-examine how ideas circulate and how learning and knowledge can be acquired within a digital context. In fact, learning, as we have traditionally defined it, needs no longer be located within particular or specialized institutions. Learning now becomes an activity of problem solving applied to every aspect of daily life. The conjuncture of computers, networks, lifelong learning and a vast array of new tools for human interaction variously described through the tropes of the virtual and the <b>cyberspatial,</b> means that teachers will have to reinvent themselves. Virtual spaces generate hybrid environments for the interaction of people and computers. As we negotiate new relationships with these emergin...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This article explores {{different}} forms of openness and closure in two knowledge communities: the fictional world of Castalia in Hermann Hesse’s great work The Glass Bead Game, and the twenty-first-century <b>cyberspatial</b> universe of Wikipedia. These two worlds differ in some important respects, but they also share a number of educationally significant features in common. The authors compare the respective approaches to knowledge, decision-making and social organization in Castalia and Wikipedia. They argue that both {{can be seen as}} flawed knowledge communities, from which, nonetheless, much can be learned that is helpful in advancing current discussions of openness as an ideal. In recent years, ‘openness ’ has emerged as a key theme in discussions of education, scholarly communication and social life. Much has been written about open access publishing, open peer review, open source software, open education, open science, and open government. In this diverse, expansive body of work, reference has been made to academic books and articles, policy documents, reports, newspaper and magazine items, and a variety of web-based sources. Most of the materials on which discourses of openness have been based have been non-fictional. There is value, however, when contemplating the meaning of openness, its limits and its educationa...|$|E
40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) has the {{potential}} to impact human minds and bodies more than any previous technology. Researchers have unsuccessfully attempted three definitions of VR. The first, a definition by technological architecture, focuses on the different types of systems that have been developed. The second, a definition by human architecture, proposes that VR consists of psychological phenomena that users experience such as immersion and presence. The third, a definition by language architecture, uses the popular metaphor of cyberspace as a location to describe the experience. Although each attempt falls short of delivering a complete definition of VR, expanding the parameters the VR metaphor holistically promises to extend research of this new technology. The study of metaphorical language has progressed from previous reductionistic proposals that metaphors are merely a side effect of language, to current holistic approaches that suggest metaphors are central to human communication and understanding. Since changing a metaphor changes the concept, the choice of a VR metaphor is crucial. Cyberspace has {{the potential}} to be both the greatest threat and the greatest achievement of human society. The current metaphor of cyberspace is incomplete, focusing only on the location. This thesis proposes to extend the <b>cyberspatial</b> metaphor to launch, destination, and re-entry in order to better conceptualize VR. Researchers can reexamine previously ignored human elements and attempt to understand how to safely send cybernauts from reality to cyberspace and back...|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{tracks the}} human body in {{cyberspace}} as a popular cultural construct, from its origins in cyberpunk fiction in the 1980 s to the pervasion of <b>cyberspatial</b> narratives in contemporary fictions, along with its representations within wider cultural texts, such as film, the mainstream media, and on the Internet. Across the two respective sections of the thesis, I focus upon six recurring literal-metaphorical characters, entities or motifs which serve as points of collision, entanglement and reiteration {{for a wide variety}} of discourses. These figures—the avatar, the hacker, the nanotechnological swarm, the fursona, the caring computer, and the decaying digital—have varying cultural functions in their respective representations of the human/technological interface. Informed by theorists such as Donna Haraway (1991, 2008), N. Katherine Hayles (2001) and others, I trace both their origins and their shifting and (often increasingly prolific) representations from the 1980 s to the present. This allows me to uncover these figures’ registering of contextual discourses, and permits, in turn, an interrogation of the extent of their normative character, along with measuring how and to what extent, if any, these figures may offer alternative visions of human (and other) subjectivity. It also permits a rethinking of “cyberspace” itself. Section One analyses three figures that depict the human/technological interface as a space for reinscribing and reifying Cartesian dualistic views of human subjectivity, along with the exclusive and marginalising implications of the remapping of that dualism. The figures in Section One—the avatar, the hacker, and the nanotechnological swarm—have their roots in the 1980 s, and have stratified over time, commonly deployed in describing the human/technological interface. These figures function in first evoking and then managing the threats to the unified masculine subject posed by the altering human/machine relationship, policing rather than collapsing the subjective boundaries between them. They maintain and reiterate their attendant logics of identity, recapitulating an image of technology as the object of human invention, and never a contributor to the substantiation of the human subject. Science fiction–especially cyberpunk—has at least partially set the terms for understanding present-day relationships between humans and technologies, and those terms are relentlessly humanistic and teleological, despite their putatively postmodern and fragmentary aesthetic. The threat of the technological other is almost invariably femininecoded, and my work in this section is explicated particularly in the light of Haraway’s work and feminist theories of embodiment, including the work of Elizabeth Grosz (1994) and Margrit Shildrick (1997, 2002). Section Two analyses three emerging figures—ones not so clearly and widely defined in fiction and popular culture—that depict the human/technological interface as fundamentally co-substantiating, rather than the latter being the product of the former. Acting as nodes of connection and constitution for various phenomena both depicted in fiction and enacted/performed at the human/technological interface itself, these three figures—the fursona, the caring computer, and the decaying digital—demonstrate potential ways to understand the human/technological interface outside of conventional, dualistic discourses of transcendental disembodiment of a bounded subject-self. Deploying theoretical work on concepts such as Alison Landsberg’s notion of prosthetic memory (2004) and Brian Massumi’s reading of the “real-material-but-incorporeal” body (2002), as well as Haraway’s later work on companion species (2008), I position these figures as representative visions of technologically-mediated subjectivity that allow us to imagine our relationships with technology as co-operative, open and materially co-substantiating. I argue that they recover the potential to rupture the unified and dualistic mind-subject that is both represented and contained by the figures seen in Section One, while reflecting a more recognisably prosaic, ongoing transformation of subjective participants in human/technological encounters. In opening up these two respective clusters of human-technological figures, I map two attendant visions of cyberspace. The first is the most common: the smooth, Euclidean grid into which the discrete unified consciousness is projected away from the body, which is conflated with (a reductive understanding of) virtuality, and to which access is allowed or denied based on highly conventional lines of gender, race, sexuality and so on. The second vision is emerging: it is possible to view cyberspace as less of a “space” at all, and more of a technologically-mediated field of material implication—one which is not discrete from the putatively offline world, which is implicit in the subject formation of its users and participants, and accounts for, rather than disavowing, the physical, bodily substrate from which it is explicated.
