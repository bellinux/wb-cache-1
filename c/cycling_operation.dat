When implemented for a test system, the results show that dynamically modeling cycling costs reduces <b>cycling</b> <b>operation</b> and tends to change the merit order over time.

40|$|Certain {{developments}} in the electricity sector may result in suboptimal operation of base-load generating units in countries worldwide. Despite the fact they were not designed to operate in a flexible manner, increasing penetration of variable power sources coupled with the deregulation of the electricity sector could lead to these base-load units being shut down or operated at part-load levels more often. This <b>cycling</b> <b>operation</b> would have onerous effects on the components of these units and potentially lead to increased outages and significant costs. This paper shows the serious impact increasing levels of wind power {{will have on the}} operation of base-load units. Those base-load units which are not large contributors of primary reserve to the system and have relatively shorter start-up times were found to be the most impacted as wind penetration increases. A sensitivity analysis shows the presence of storage or interconnection on a power system actually exacerbates base-load cycling until very high levels of wind power are reached. Finally, it is shown that if the total cycling costs of the individual base-load units are taken into consideration in the scheduling model, subsequent <b>cycling</b> <b>operation</b> can be reduced. ...|$|E

We argue that, in the new context characterized by the increasing need for <b>cycling</b> <b>operation,</b> such simplified approaches do not realistically reflect the impact that these new operation regimes have on the OandM costs for both open and combined cycle gas turbines. We first review {{the role of the}} so-called long-term service agreements (LTSA), which is a commonly used type of contract offered by gas-turbine manufacturers to plant owners. We analyze how these contracts implicitly determine the maintenance intervals {{as a function of the}} operating regime, and, as a consequence, determine the impact of <b>cycling</b> <b>operation</b> on OandM costs. Based on this analysis, we develop a formulation based on linear constraints that makes possible a realistic modeling of OandM costs (as defined in LTSA contracts) in the unit commitment problem. This formulation is then tested using some examples, so as to illustrate how a proper modeling of these contracts significantly changes the scheduling resulting from the traditional unit commitment problem formulation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

In some cases, {{due to its}} impact on O&M costs, the cost of each start can significantly raise. The impact of this effect on spot prices depends on the pricing rules implemented: in some cases (non-linear pricing rules), these costs are compensated via discriminatory side payments and thus {{not included in the}} price formation while in others (aka linear) a single price per MWh is calculated to remunerate every single unit that is producing. These two alternative designs result lead for instance to a different remuneration for base-load plants.

40|$|Abstract- Developments in the {{electricity}} sector {{such as the}} integration of increasing levels of renewable power, mainly wind, and the deregulation of electricity markets have resulted in some unconventional operation of base-load units. These units, which were originally designed for continuous operation, are now being forced into more flexible or <b>cycling</b> <b>operation.</b> This <b>cycling</b> <b>operation</b> results in serious physical degeneration of the unit’s components and hence incurs substantial costs to the plant operator. Using a planning tool of the Irish electricity system, the impact of increasing wind penetration on {{the operation of the}} base-load units is modelled. The results show that as wind penetration on the system increased, the base-load units were required to start up and shut down more often. However the units found to be cycled the most were not those with the cheapest start-up cost, but in fact those units with the shortest synchronisation time 1. On the basis that the resulting cycling costs would increase the start-up costs of the base-load unit to some degree, the effect of increasing start-up costs on the operation of the base-load units was also examined. The results show that by increasing the start-up costs of base-load units, those units will be scheduled to operate in a more conventional base-loaded manner, the extent of which depends on the amount of wind power present. 1...|$|E

Induction heating is the most energy efficient industrial heating technology for many applications, but so far technical limitations has delayed large scale introduction. The difficulties relate to heating of large flat and curved surfaces, and, perhaps most important of all, the difficulties in achieving a uniform heat distribution. The efficiency of existing industrial induction heating systems on the market is often low, with clear demands for improvement. The {{first part of this}} work aims to improve the efficiency and manufacturability of induction heaters. By combining a newly developed core material, a silicon-iron powder composite, with litz wire for high frequency applications, very high efficiency heaters can be manufactured. The powder composite can be molded into any size and shape which allows building large, complex structures with integrated cooling. The results from this work have been commercialized and an increasing number of companies can benefit of substantial economical and energy savings in the production. The second part of the work concerns investigating a type of induction heating based on several coils, in order to achieve uniform heating. The method is called travelling wave and characterized by a fast propagating electromagnetic field that moves along the workpiece. The challenges related to multi-coil solutions are many, because of the interaction between the currents in the coils. The work contains results of the system behavior based on analytical models, simulation results of the heating pattern, and above all, experimental validation of the models.
