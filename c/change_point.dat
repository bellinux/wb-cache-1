Furthermore, the posterior mode of the locations of the <b>change</b> <b>points</b> is shown to be within O-p(log n) of the true locations of the <b>change</b> <b>points</b> where n is the sample size.

40|$|Identifying {{short and}} long range <b>change</b> <b>points</b> in an {{observed}} time series that consists of stationary segments is a common problem. These <b>change</b> <b>points</b> mark the time boundaries of the segments where the time series leaves one stationary state and enters another. Due to certain technical advantages, analysis is {{carried out in the}} frequency domain to identify such <b>change</b> <b>points</b> in the time domain. What is considered as a change may depend on the time scale. The results of the analysis are displayed in the form of graphs that display <b>change</b> <b>points</b> on different time horizons (time scales), which are observed to be statistically significant. The methodology is illustrated using several simulated and real time series data. The method works well to detect <b>change</b> <b>points</b> and illustrates the importance of analysing the time series on different time horizons. ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{nuclear power}} debate is a long-running {{controversy}} {{about the risks}} and benefits of using nuclear reactors to generate electricity for civilian purposes. [...] The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, as more and more reactors were built and came online, and [...] "reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies" [...] in some countries. [...] Thereafter, the nuclear industry created jobs, focused on safety and public concerns [...] mostly waned. In the last decade, however, with growing public awareness about climate change and the critical role that carbon dioxide and methane emissions plays in causing the heating of the earth's atmosphere, there's been a resurgence in the intensity nuclear power debate once again. [...] Nuclear power advocates and those who are most concerned about climate <b>change</b> <b>point</b> to nuclear power's reliable, emission-free, high-density energy and a generation of young physicists and engineers working to bring a new generation of nuclear technology into existence to replace fossil fuels. On the other hand, skeptics can point to two frightening nuclear accidents, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and subsequently the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, combined with escalating acts of global terrorism, to argue against continuing use of the technology. The debate continues today between those who fear the power of nuclear and those who fear {{what will happen to the}} earth if we don't use nuclear power. At the 1963 ground-breaking for what would become the world's largest nuclear power plant, President John F.

40|$|The {{extension}} of traditional data mining methods to time series has been effectively {{applied to a}} wide range of domains such as finance, econometrics, biology, security, and medicine. Many existing mining methods deal with the task of <b>change</b> <b>points</b> detection, but very few provide a flexible approach. Querying specific <b>change</b> <b>points</b> with linguistic variables is particularly useful in crime analysis, where intuitive, understandable, and appropriate detection of changes can significantly improve the allocation of resources for timely and concise operations. In this paper, we propose an on-line method for detecting and querying <b>change</b> <b>points</b> in crime-related time series with the use of a meaningful representation and a fuzzy inference system. <b>Change</b> <b>points</b> detection is based on a shape space representation, and linguistic terms describing geometric properties of the <b>change</b> <b>points</b> are used to express queries, offering the advantage of intuitiveness and flexibility. An empirical evaluation is first conducted on a crime data set to confirm the validity of the proposed method and then on a financial data set to test its general applicability. A comparison to a similar change-point detection algorithm and a sensitivity analysis are also conducted. Results show that the method is able to accurately detect <b>change</b> <b>points</b> at very low computational costs. More broadly, the detection of specific <b>change</b> <b>points</b> within time series of virtually any domain is made more intuitive and more understandable, even for experts not related to data mining...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the retrospective or off-line multiple change-point detection problem. Methods {{for exploring the}} space of possible segmentations of a sequence for a fixed number of <b>change</b> <b>points</b> may {{be divided into two}} categories: (i) enumeration of segmentations, (ii) summary of the possible segmentations in change-point or segment profiles. Concerning the first category, a forward dynamic programming algorithm for computing the top L most probable segmentations and a forward-backward algorithm for sampling segmentations are derived. Concerning the second category, a forward-backward dynamic programming algorithm and a smoothing-type forward-backward algorithm for computing two types of change-point and segment profiles are derived. The proposed methods are mainly useful for exploring the space of possible segmentations for successive numbers of <b>change</b> <b>points</b> and provide a set of assessment tools for multiple change-point models. We show using examples that the proposed methods may help to compare alternative multiple change-point models (e. g.
