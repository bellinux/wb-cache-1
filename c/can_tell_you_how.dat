Most locals <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> many days it would take to walk to most locations within the country. Walking often is the only way for people to get to their local villages anyway, as many local airstrips are in disrepair. The maintenance of airstrips is a Local Level Government responsibility, and many LLGs in the surrounding area are severely underfunded.|$|E
