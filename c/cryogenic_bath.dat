Historically most have been made of copper - a good electrical conductor - and operated near room temperature with water cooling (cooling is necessary to remove the heat generated by the electrical loss in the cavity). In the past two decades, however, accelerator facilities have increasingly found superconducting cavities to be more suitable (or necessary) for their accelerators than normal-conducting copper versions. The motivation for using superconductors in RF cavities is not to achieve a net power savings, but rather to increase the [...] "quality" [...] of the beam attunement. Though superconductors have very small electrical resistance, the little power they do dissipate is radiated at very low temperatures, typically in a liquid helium bath at 1.6 K to 4.5 K, and maintaining such low temperatures {{takes a lot of}} energy. The refrigeration power to maintain the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>bath</b> at low temperature in the presence of heat from small RF power dissipation is dictated by the Carnot efficiency, and can easily be comparable to the normal-conductor power dissipation of a room-temperature copper cavity.

40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} material construction has been devised for sensing coils of {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) magnetometers that {{are subject to}} a combination of requirements peculiar to some advanced applications, notably including low-field magnetic resonance imaging for medical diagnosis. The requirements in question are the following: The sensing coils must be large enough (in some cases having dimensions of as much as tens of centimeters) to afford adequate sensitivity; The sensing coils must be made electrically superconductive to eliminate Johnson noise (thermally induced noise proportional to electrical resistance); and Although the sensing coils must be cooled to below their superconducting- transition temperatures with sufficient cooling power to overcome moderate ambient radiative heat leakage, they must not be immersed in <b>cryogenic</b> liquid <b>baths.</b> For a given superconducting sensing coil, this combination of requirements can be satisfied by providing a sufficiently thermally conductive link between the coil and a cold source. However, the superconducting coil material is not suitable as such a link because electrically superconductive materials are typically poor thermal conductors. The {{heterogeneous material}} construction makes it possible to solve both the electrical- and thermal-conductivity problems. The basic idea is to construct the coil as a skeleton made of a highly thermally conductive material (typically, annealed copper), then coat the skeleton with an electrically superconductive alloy (typically, a lead-tin solder) [see figure]. In operation, the copper skeleton provides the required thermally conductive connection to the cold source, while the electrically superconductive coating material shields against Johnson noise that originates in the copper skeleton...|$|R
40|$|Low-temperature {{electronic}} transport measurements {{with high}} energy resolution require both effective low-pass filtering of high-frequency input noise and an optimized thermalization {{of the electronic}} system of the experiment. In recent years, elaborate filter designs {{have been developed for}} cryogenic low-level measurements, driven by the growing interest in fundamental quantum-physical phenomena at energy scales corresponding to temperatures in the few millikelvin regime. However, a single filter concept is often insufficient to thermalize the electronic system to the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>bath</b> and eliminate spurious high frequency noise. Moreover, the available concepts often provide inadequate filtering to operate at temperatures below 10 mK, which are routinely available now in dilution cryogenic systems. Herein we provide a comprehensive analysis of commonly used filter types, introduce a novel compact filter type based on ferrite compounds optimized for the frequency range above 20 GHz, and develop an improved filtering scheme providing adaptable broad-band low-pass characteristic for cryogenic low-level and quantum measurement applications at temperatures down to few millikelvin...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the strengthening of a shock wave propagating through an isobaric region of increasing density is presented. A new experimental configuration consisting of a pressure-driven shock tube mounted vertically with the test section partially immersed in a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>bath</b> is used. The resulting test gas density distribution consists of a uniform region of low density near the shock tube diaphragm, then a strong local gradient followed by another uniform region of high density. The Mach number of the shock initiated at the diaphragm is determined as the shock emerges from the gradient from velocity and temperature measurements for various initial conditions. The experimental data are compared with predictions from approximate theoretical models and a numerical integration of the exact flow equations for the shock-gradient interaction. The measured Mach numbers are considerably higher than these predictions indicating that the models are not adequate to represent the experimental configuration. Calculations show that the additional strengthening of the shock results from multiple interactions between waves generated within the gradient and flow nonuniformities due to the shock formation mechanism. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{real-time}} quantum feedback protocols, {{the record}} of a continuous measurement is used to stabilize a desired quantum state. Recent years have seen highly successful applications {{in a variety of}} well-isolated micro-systems, including microwave photons and superconducting qubits. By contrast, the ability to stabilize the quantum state of a tangibly massive object, such as a nanomechanical oscillator, remains a difficult challenge: The main obstacle is environmental decoherence, which places stringent requirements on the timescale in which the state must be measured. Here we describe a position sensor that is capable of resolving the zero-point motion of a solid-state, nanomechanical oscillator in the timescale of its thermal decoherence, a critical requirement for preparing its ground state using feedback. The sensor is based on cavity optomechanical coupling, and realizes a measurement of the oscillator's displacement with an imprecision 40 dB below that at the standard quantum limit, while maintaining an imprecision-back-action product within a factor of 5 of the Heisenberg uncertainty limit.

40|$|A dual {{cryogenic}} capacitive density sensor {{has been}} developed. The device contains capacitive sensors that monitor two-phase cryogenic flow density to within 1 % accuracy, which, if temperature were known, {{could be used}} to determine the ratio of liquid to gas in the line. Two of these density sensors, located a known distance apart, comprise the sensor, providing some information on the velocity of the flow. This sensor was constructed as a proposed mass flowmeter with high data acquisition rates. Without moving parts, this device is capable of detecting the density change within a two-phase cryogenic flow more than 100 times a second. Detection is enabled by a series of two sets of five parallel plates with stainless steel, cryogenically rated tubing. The parallel plates form the two capacitive sensors, which are measured by electrically isolated digital electronics. These capacitors monitor the dielectric of the flow essentially the density of the flow and can be used to determine (along with temperature) the ratio of cryogenic liquid to gas. Combining this information with the velocity of the flow can, with care, be used to approximate the total two-phase mass flow. The sensor can be operated at moderately high pressures and can be lowered into a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>bath.</b> The electronics have been substantially improved over the older sensors, incorporating a better microprocessor, elaborate ground loop protection and noise limiting circuitry, and reduced temperature sensitivity.

Each plate was numbered for identification and this can be noted on figure one, and plate flatness data. To determine the flatness of each uranium plate before stacking a number of measurements were taken. These included: (1) overall dimensions of each plate; (2) thickness of each plate at different locations on the plate; (3) ultrasound thickness test; (4) dial gauge front contour; and (5) dial gauge back contour.

For a rod to fit in the gap it was inserted and moved back and forth in the east-west direction. If the rod hung up at any point in the gap it was considered to large for the gap.

40|$|Over {{several decades}} {{interest}} {{has been devoted}} to the astronomical enigma of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). These are hundreds of absorption features of interstellar origin seen in the spectra of stars with different strengths and widths spread over the visible and near infrared (NIR). They are typically broader than atomic lines and concluded to be of molecular nature. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, long carbon-chain molecules, and fullerenes have been suspected as their carriers. Two of the DIBs showed coincident spectral features recorded in a neon matrix experiment for the fullerene C 60 +. Embedding molecules in a solid matrix are known to induce perturbations of the measured spectrum and consequently, the assignment was classified as tentative. An unambiguous identification of a specific molecule as a carrier can only be made upon measurements of its laboratory gas-phase spectrum under similar conditions as they are present in the interstellar medium. Nevertheless, the recent identification of the infrared signature of C 60, C 60 + and C 70 in the spectra of a protoplanetary and reflection nebula fueled their relevance as possible candidates. Optical and NIR spectroscopy of large molecules has strong demands on the employed method. Therefore, an existing apparatus was improved and a special spectroscopic technique was thought. The heart of the experiment was a radio-frequency ion trap in which a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>bath</b> of a neutral gas was created to confine and prepare the ionic species for further investigations. Electronic gas-phase spectra have been finally obtained by photofragmentation of weakly bound cation-helium complexes, which enabled a confident confrontation with astronomical observations. In the case of C 60 +, an unequivocal assignment of five DIBs has been achieved, and thus, the first identification of a carrier almost 100 years after their first detection. ...|$|E
