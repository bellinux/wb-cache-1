5|$|Around late 1224 {{or early}} 1225, Alice married Bohemond, eldest son of Bohemond IV, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. Pope Honorius ordered Eustorgius, Archbishop of Nicosia, to inquire into the {{legality}} of the marriage. Alice, who continued to regard herself as regent, wanted to appoint her new husband as bailli, but this appointment was opposed by all Cypriot barons. Alice then offered the office to Aimery Barlais, who was amenable, but the High Court ruled that Alice could not replace Philip of Ibelin who had been made bailli for the duration of her son's minority. Barlais left the island to join Alice, while his supporter, Gavin of Chenichy visited with the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, who had decided to launch a <b>crusade</b> <b>for</b> the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his success, Garfield was promoted to brigadier general, {{at the age of}} 30. After Marshall's retreat, Garfield's command was the sole remaining Union force in eastern Kentucky, and he announced that any men who had fought for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to their homes and lived peaceably and remained loyal to the Union. The proclamation was surprisingly lenient, as Garfield now believed the war was a <b>crusade</b> <b>for</b> eradication of slavery. Following a brief skirmish at Pound Gap, the last rebel units in the area were outflanked, and they retreated to Virginia.|$|E

25|$|The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine {{was a big}} {{supporter}} of his canonization, partly because he had ordained the need for its existence in every diocese and because it had received {{a great deal of}} episcopal criticism, and it was thought that by canonizing the pope who gave them their mandate, this would help inoculate against this criticism.

25|$|While {{this might}} suggest {{that there was no}} {{positive}} British contribution during the Raj era, that is not entirely the case. Missionaries' wives such as Martha Mault née Mead and her daughter Eliza Caldwell née Mault are rightly remembered for pioneering the education and training of girls in south India. This practice was initially met with local resistance, as it flew in the face of tradition. Raja Rammohan Roy's efforts led to the abolition of Sati under Governor-General William Cavendish-Bentinck in 1829. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's <b>crusade</b> <b>for</b> improvement in the situation of widows led to the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856.

25|$|In 1990 {{religion}} and politics intersected to impact {{the outcome of the}} Eighth District election in South Richmond. With the endorsements of black power brokers, black clergy and the Richmond <b>Crusade</b> <b>for</b> Voters, South Richmond residents made history, electing Reverend A. Carl Prince to the Richmond City Council. As the first African American Baptist Minister elected to the Richmond City Council, Prince's election paved the way for a political paradigm shift in politics that persist today. Following Prince's election, Reverend Gwendolyn Hedgepeth and the Reverend Leonidas Young, former Richmond Mayor were elected to public office. Prior to Prince's election black clergy made political endorsements and served as appointees to the Richmond School Board and other boards throughout the city. Today {{religion and}} politics continues to thrive in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Honorable Dwight C. Jones, a prominent Baptist pastor and former Chairman of the Richmond School Board and Member of the Virginia House of Delegates serves as Mayor of the City of Richmond.|$|E
