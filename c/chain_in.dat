We prove that such maximal chain cannot be found computably, not even hyperarithmetically: No hyperarithmetic set can compute maximal <b>chains</b> <b>in</b> all computable wpos.

40|$|Abstract. We discuss bijections {{that relate}} {{families}} of <b>chains</b> <b>in</b> lattices associated to an order P and families of interval orders dened {{on the ground}} set of P. Two bijections of this type have been known: (1) The bijection between maximal <b>chains</b> <b>in</b> the antichain lattice A(P) and the linear extensions of P. (2) A bijection between maximal <b>chains</b> <b>in</b> the lattice of maximal antichains A M (P) and minimal interval extensions of P. We discuss two approaches to associate interval orders to <b>chains</b> <b>in</b> A(P). This leads to new bijections generalizing Bijections 1 and 2. As a consequence we char-acterize the chains corresponding to weak-order extensions and minimal weak-order extensions of P. Seeking for a way of representing interval reductions of P by chains {{we came up with}} the separation lattice S(P). <b>Chains</b> <b>in</b> this lattice encode an interesting sub-class of interval reductions of P. Let S M (P) be the lattice of maximal separations in the separation lattice. Restricted to maximal separations the above bijection specializes to a bijection which nicely complements 1 and 2.

5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport <b>chain</b> <b>in</b> reverse, generating NADH.|$|E

Then we derive a second, alternative, expression for the total number of <b>chains</b> <b>in</b> L when d= 2. Setting n 1 =n 2 in this expression yields a new proof of a result of Stanley [Enumerative Combinatorics, vol. 2, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1999] relating the total number of chains to the central Delannoy numbers. We also conjecture a generalization of Stanley's result to higher dimensions...|$|R
