2500|$|Copper(II) nitrate, <b>Cu(NO3)2,</b> is an {{inorganic}} compound that forms a blue crystalline solid. [...] Anhydrous copper nitrate forms deep blue-green crystals and sublimes {{in a vacuum}} at 150-200°C. [...] Copper nitrate also occurs as five different hydrates, the most common ones being the trihydrate and hexahydrate.

Exploiting this reactivity, copper nitrate can be used to generate nitric acid by heating it until decomposition and passing the fumes directly into water. This method is similar to the last step in the Ostwald process. The equations are as follows: ...|$|E

If a piece of solid copper (Cu) were added to an aqueous solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3), the silver (Ag) would be replaced in a single displacement reaction forming aqueous copper(II) nitrate (<b>Cu(NO3)2)</b> and solid silver.

5000|$|For cations {{that take}} on {{multiple}} charges, {{the charge is}} written using Roman numerals in parentheses immediately following the element name. For example, <b>Cu(NO3)2</b> is copper(II) nitrate, because the charge of two nitrate ions (...) is 2 × −1 = −2, and since the net charge of the ionic compound must be zero, the Cu ion has a 2+ charge. This compound is therefore copper(II) nitrate. In the case of cations with a +4 oxidation state, the only acceptable format for the Roman numeral 4 is IV and not IIII.|$|E
