5|$|The School of International and Public Affairs extends {{invitations to}} {{heads of state}} and heads of {{government}} who <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City {{for the opening of}} the fall session of the United Nations General Assembly. In 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one of those invited to speak on campus. Ahmadinejad accepted his invitation and spoke on September 24, 2007, as part of Columbia University's World Leaders Forum. The invitation proved to be highly controversial. Hundreds of demonstrators swarmed the campus on September 24 and the speech itself was televised worldwide. University President Lee C. Bollinger tried to allay the controversy by letting Ahmadenijad speak, but with a negative introduction (given personally by Bollinger). This did not mollify those who were displeased {{with the fact that the}} Iranian leader had been invited onto the campus. Columbia students, though, turned out en masse to listen to the speech on the South Lawn. An estimated 2,500 undergraduates and graduates came out for the historic occasion.|$|E
5|$|To build {{a working}} nuclear reactor, the Montreal Laboratory {{depended}} on the Americans for heavy water from Trail, which was under American contract, {{but this was not}} forthcoming. An American request for Halban to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> to discuss heavy water with Fermi and Urey was turned down by the British, and the Americans brought cooperation to a standstill. By June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab had come to a halt. Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. The British government seriously considered going it alone on developing nuclear weapons, despite the cost and the expected length of the project. In August 1943, Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King hosted the Quebec Conference, at which Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt came together, and agreed to resume cooperation. The Quebec Agreement subsumed Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project, and established the Combined Policy Committee, on which Canada was represented by Howe, to control the Manhattan Project.|$|E

After three pilots done between 1968 and 1970, a network change to CBS, and the last name of the character changed to Bunker, the new sitcom was renamed All in the Family. The show {{was based on the}} BBC's Till Death Us Do Part, with Bunker based on Alf Garnett, but somewhat less abrasive than the original. O'Connor's Queens background and New York accent is said to have influenced Lear to set the show in Queens.|$|E

She arrived in New York on April 1979, with Brownmiller, Adrienne Rich, and Frances Whyatt contributing money to help her cover her living expenses while the organizing work progressed. Dolores Alexander was soon recruited as a fundraiser, and Barbara Mehrhof was hired as an organizer soon thereafter with the money that Alexander was able to raise.

500|$|On the 100th {{anniversary of}} the hotel in 1993, one {{publication}} wrote: [...] "It isn't the biggest hotel in New York, nor the most expensive. But {{when it comes to}} prestige, the Waldorf-Astoria has no peer. When presidents <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> they stay at the Waldorf-Astoria. Kings and queens make it their home away from home, as have people as diverse as Cary Grant, the Dalai Lama and Chris Evert. Some of them liked the hotel so well, they made their home there." [...] From its inception, the Waldorf was always a [...] "must stay" [...] hotel for foreign dignitaries. The viceroy of China, Li Hung Chang stayed at the hotel in 1896 and feasted on hundred-year-old eggs which he brought with him. Over the years many royals from around the world stayed at the Waldorf Astoria including Shahanshah of Iran and Empress Farah, King Frederick IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark, Princess Astrid of Norway, Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Martha of Norway, King Baudouin I of Belgium and Queen Fabiola, Prince Albert and Princess Paola of Belgium, King Hussein I of Jordan, Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, King Michael of Romania, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms, Mohammed Zahir Shah and Homaira Shah of Afghanistan, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit of Thailand, and Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan and many others. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip stayed at the hotel during their first visit to America on October 21, 1957, and a banquet was held for them in the Grand Ballroom. In the Bicentennial year in 1976, most of the heads of state from around the world and all of the Kings and Queens of Europe were invited to the hotel, and it also served the presidential candidates in the run up to the elections of that year.|$|E

He worked as a street peddler, selling videotapes, gloves and socks from the sidewalk along 14th Street during the day.|$|E
2500|$|EVOL itself {{represented}} an evolution of sorts for the band: {{in addition to}} increasingly melodic material {{and the impact of}} new drummer Shelley's playing, the record also dealt with themes of celebrity, particularly with songs like [...] "Madonna, Sean, and Me" [...] (also known as [...] "Expressway to Yr.

Signing to SST catapulted the band on to a national stage, something that did not happen to their peers in the New York underground. The mainstream music press subsequently began to take notice of the band. Robert Palmer of The New York Times declared that Sonic Youth was [...] "making the most startlingly original guitar-based music since Jimi Hendrix" [...] and even People praised EVOL as the [...] "aural equivalent of a toxic waste dump." [...] EVOL is also notable for a guest appearance by bass guitarist Mike Watt, a friend whom the band coaxed to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> after he was deeply depressed by the death of his bandmate, D.

After receiving some money, he leaves Denver for San Francisco to see Dean. Camille is pregnant and unhappy, and Dean has injured his thumb trying to hit Marylou for sleeping with other men. Camille throws them out, and Sal invites Dean to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> planning to travel further to Italy.

[...] Sal realizes she is right—Dean is the [...] "HOLY GOOF"—but also defends him, as [...] "he's got the secret that we're all busting to find out." [...] After a night of jazz and drinking in Little Harlem on Folsom Street, they depart. On the way to Sacramento they meet a [...] "fag", who propositions them. Dean tries to hustle some money out of this but is turned down. During {{this part of the}} trip Sal and Dean have ecstatic discussions having found [...] "IT" [...] and [...] "TIME". In Denver a brief argument shows the growing rift between the two, when Dean reminds Sal of his age, Sal being the older of the two. They get a 1947 Cadillac from a travel bureau that needs to be brought to Chicago. Dean drives most of the way, crazy, careless, often speeding over , bringing it in a disheveled state. By bus they move on to Detroit and spend a night on Skid Row, Dean hoping to find his homeless father. From Detroit they share a ride to New York and arrive at Sal's aunt's new flat in Long Island. They go on partying in New York, where Dean meets Inez and gets her pregnant while his wife is expecting their second child.|$|E
