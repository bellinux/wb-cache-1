Additionally, fancy rats are quite independent, loyal and easily trained, earning them comparison to both cats and dogs. This <b>comparison</b> <b>is</b> merited given fancy rats are considered more intelligent than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over {{twice as many}} Labradors {{registered}} as the next most popular breed.

25|$|Phase <b>{{comparison}}</b> <b>is</b> {{a comparison}} of the phase of two waveforms, usually of the same nominal frequency.

25|$|Upamāṇa (उपमान), comparison, analogy. Some Hindu schools {{consider}} it as a proper means of knowledge. Upamana, states Lochtefeld, may be explained with {{the example of a}} traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and <b>comparison</b> <b>is,</b> state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of <b>comparison</b> <b>is</b> formally called upameyam, the object of <b>comparison</b> <b>is</b> called upamanam, while the attribute(s) are identified as samanya.|$|E

25|$|<b>Comparison</b> <b>is</b> often {{implemented}} with a dummy subtraction, {{where the}} flags in the computer's status register are checked, {{but the main}} result is ignored. The zero flag indicates if two values compared equal. If the exclusive-or of the sign and overflow flags is 1, the subtraction result was less than zero, otherwise the result was zero or greater. These checks are often implemented in computers in conditional branch instructions.|$|E
25|$|Usually the echogenicity {{compared}} to the deltoid muscle is homogeneous intensified without dorsal echo extinction. Variability with reduced or intensified echo has also been found in healthy tendons. Bilateral <b>comparison</b> <b>is</b> very helpful when distinguishing and setting boundaries between physiological variants and a possible pathological finding. Degenerative changes at the rotator cuff often are found {{on both sides of}} the body. Consequently, unilateral differences rather point to a pathological source and bilateral changes rather to a physiological variation.|$|E
