50|$|A <b>cross-over</b> <b>study</b> in six healthy volunteers (median age 28 years) was {{conducted}} using single-dose pharmacokinetics of 5 mg clotiazepam drops, oral tablets, and sublingual tablets. The formulations had similar systemic availability. Compared with oral tablets, the sublingual route gave a lower peak concentration and a delayed peak time, while drops gave a greater maximum concentration {{with a similar}} peak time. The use of drops is suggested for a more marked initial effect and the sublingual route for easier administration, especially in the elderly.|$|E
40|$|It is {{possible}} that <b>cross-over</b> <b>studies</b> included in current systematic reviews are being inadequately assessed, because the current risk of bias tools do not consider possible biases specific to cross-over design. We performed this study to evaluate whether this was being done in <b>cross-over</b> <b>studies</b> included in Cochrane Systematic Reviews (CSRs). We searched the Cochrane Library (up to 2013 issue 5) for CSRs that included at least one cross-over trial. Two authors independently undertook the study selection and data extraction. A random sample of the CSRs was selected and we evaluated whether the cross-over trials in these CSRs were assessed according to criteria suggested by the Cochrane handbook. In addition we reassessed the risk of bias of these cross-over trials by a checklist developed form the Cochrane handbook. We identified 688 CSRs that included one or more <b>cross-over</b> <b>studies.</b> We chose {{a random sample of}} 60 CSRs and these included 139 <b>cross-over</b> <b>studies.</b> None of these CSRs undertook a risk of bias assessment specific for <b>cross-over</b> <b>studies.</b> In fact items specific for <b>cross-over</b> <b>studies</b> were seldom considered anywhere in quality assessment of these CSRs. When we reassessed the risk of bias, including the 3 items specific to cross-over trials, of these 139 studies, a low risk of bias was judged for appropriate cross-over design in 110 (79 %), carry-over effects in 48 (34 %) and for reporting data in all stages of the trial in 114 (82 %). Assessment of biases in cross-over trials could affect the GRADE assessment of a review's findings. The current Cochrane risk of bias tool is not adequate to assess <b>cross-over</b> <b>studies.</b> Items specific to cross-over trials leading to potential risk of bias are generally neglected in CSRs.

50|$|In {{determining}} bioequivalence, for example, {{between two}} {{products such as}} a commercially available Brand product and a potential to-be-marketed Generic product, pharmacokinetic studies are conducted whereby each of the preparations are administered in a <b>cross-over</b> <b>study</b> to volunteer subjects, generally healthy individuals but occasionally in patients. Serum/plasma samples are obtained at regular intervals and assayed for parent drug (or occasionally metabolite) concentration. Occasionally, blood concentration levels are neither feasible or possible to compare the two products (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids), then pharmacodynamic endpoints rather than pharmacokinetic endpoints (see below) are used for comparison. For a pharmacokinetic comparison, the plasma concentration data are used to assess key pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (Tmax), and absorption lag time (tlag). Testing should be conducted at several different doses, especially when the drug displays non-linear pharmacokinetics.|$|E
50|$|Specifically, in {{this study}} {{conducted}} by Patrick Jacobs and colleagues, 24 healthy, exercise trained men consumed either 4.5 grams of GPLC or a placebo on two different days separated by one week (double blind, <b>cross-over</b> <b>study</b> design). Ninety minutes following ingestion of the assigned treatment, subjects performed five, maximal effort cycle sprint's, each lasting 10 seconds in duration. They were given one minute of “active” recovery between each sprint. The peak and mean power output, {{as well as the}} blood lactic acid, was measured for both conditions. Results indicated that power output was up to 15% higher following the glycine propionyl-l-carnitine trials compared to placebo, while post-exercise blood lactic acid was 15-16% lower compared to placebo. These data are in reference to trained men performing repeated cycle sprints. Therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate these findings to other activities.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Determination {{of small}} sample size in some {{clinical}} trials {{is a matter of}} importance. In <b>cross-over</b> <b>studies</b> which are one types of clinical trials, the matter is more significant. In this article, the conditions in which determination of {{small sample size}} in <b>cross-over</b> <b>studies</b> are possible were considered, and the effect of deviation from normality on the matter has been shown. &# 13; Methods. The present study has been done on such 2 x 2 <b>cross-over</b> <b>studies</b> that variable of interest is quantitative one and is measurable by ratio or interval scale. The method of consideration is based on use of variable and sample mean"s distributions, central limit theorem, method of sample size determination in two groups, and cumulant or moment generating function. &# 13; Results. In normal variables or transferable to normal variables, there is no restricting factors other than significant level and power of the test for determination of sample size, {{but in the case of}} non-normal variables, it should be determined such large that guarantee the normality of sample mean"s distribution. &# 13; Discussion. In such cross over studies that because of existence of theoretical base, few samples can be computed, one should not do it without taking applied worth of results into consideration. While determining sample size, in addition to variance, it is necessary to consider distribution of variable, particularly through its skewness and kurtosis coefficients. the more deviation from normality, the more need of samples. Since in medical studies most of the continuous variables are closed to normal distribution, a few number of samples often seems to be adequate for convergence of sample mean to normal distribution...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn CF {{patients}} with mild or moderate lung disease, {{the most sensitive}} spirometric measure of response to dornase alfa is peripheral airflow. <b>Cross-over</b> <b>studies</b> in patients, already stabilised on dornase alfa, indicate that peripheral airflow shows greater improvement when it is administered 30 minutes before airway clearance therapy (ACT) rather than shortly after ACT. These {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that the major role of dornase alfa is to facilitate expectoration of sputum during ACT. When ACT is performed in the morning, efficacy and safety are similar when dornase alfa is inhaled before bedtime or upon awakening. Most patients may therefore choose the most convenient time of day to inhale dornase alfa provided that they wait at least 30 minutes before performing ACT.
