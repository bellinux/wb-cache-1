She was, indeed, sincerely attached to her incompetent guardian. He had never been unkind; his age spoke for him loudly; there was something appealing in his whole-souled quest of knowledge and innocent delight in the smallest mark of admiration; and, though the lawyer had warned her she was being sacrificed, Julia had refused to add to the perplexities of Uncle Joseph.|$|E

The borrower puts down $100,000 {{and takes out a}} mortgage of $400,000 amortized over 30 years.

Because of the lower interest rate, the monthly payment is reduced from $2,398 to $2,147. However, this saving in monthly payments comes with a trade-off.

50|$|By {{participating}} in the appreciation of the property, the lender takes an additional risk that is related to its value. Hence, {{whether this is a}} favorable trade-off depends on the conditions of the housing market. A shared appreciation mortgage differs from an equity-sharing agreement in that the principal of the loan is an unconditional obligation (to the extent collateralized by the property). Thus, if the property’s value decreases, the borrower would still owe whatever principal is outstanding, and if the borrower sells the property for a loss, the <b>contingent</b> <b>interest</b> is simply zero.|$|E

Because {{of the complexity of}} tax laws and terms tailored for individual situations, private, noncommercial mortgages involving shared appreciation should always be executed with the counsel of a real estate attorney.|$|E

Core concepts such as science, scientific research, community of competent practitioners, validation and authentication are developed in an explanatory and argued manner. The presentation of the concepts emphasizes the social, public and argumentative nature of science, as a system, and scientific research, as a process. Based on the articulation of these concepts, it is argued, and concluded, that the community of competent peers is the most suitable, by nature, to validate an investigation, and that legitimacy is a gradual process, carried out by society based on limited and historically <b>contingent</b> <b>interests</b> and values. In the light of these approaches, we introduce and challenge some conceptions and existing practices in our academic environments...|$|R

The paper claims that the reason for this, {{is the way in which}} actor-network theory’s anti-essentialist ontology seems to black box 'intentionality' and ethics of human agency as <b>contingent</b> <b>interests.</b> The purpose of this paper was to open the normative black box of commodification, and compare how Marxism, Habermas and ANT can deal with commodification and ethics in healthcare. Moreover, a new account of 'intentionality' in critical thinking was elaborated. Using Strawson's analysis of 'reactive attitudes and resentment,' the ethical implications of commodification in health care were examined as an assessment of intentions. Synthesizing critical theory with the relational materialism of actor-network theory, this article advances a new approach that seeks to bridge interdisciplinary boundaries, and guide actor-network theory in a critical and humanist direction.

40|$|Marisa Civardi’s {{research}} activity at Istituto di Statistica of Pavia University (where she started working in 1964 after obtaining {{a degree in}} Physics) is characterised by outstanding achievements {{in the use of}} quantitative methods of analysis applied to multidisciplinary social research. Her main research themes so far have been: changes in social structure and in life and working conditions, stratification phenomena and their perception, the status of applied research and the measurement of risk attitude of entrepreneurs, and the careers of a group of Political Science graduates. Marisa Civardi has subsequently conducted innovative research on the structural analysis of income distribution (that is the type of analysis that connects income distribution with the variables that are typical of any socio-economic system) and on inequality problems. In addition to investigating these issues from a methodological perspective, she has also identified recurring features and mutations in personal income distribution in Italy, and she has done research on the relations between functional and personal income distribution. This research includes the possibility of building Social Accounting Matrices (SAM), which {{can also be used to}} simulate redistributive policies. A relevant aspect of Marisa Civardi’s recent research is represented by the measurement of the effectiveness and efficiency of higher education. Her intensive experience as a manager of an important university together with her mainly government-funded {{research activity}} have enabled her to create innovative instruments for the evaluation of the university system, which can also be used to assess the students’ occupational possibilities.

40|$|In a Chapter 11 reorganization, senior {{creditors}} {{are entitled}} to insist upon being paid in full before anyone junior to them receives anything. In practice, however, departures from such 2 ̆ 2 absolute priority 2 ̆ 2 are commonplace. Explaining these deviations has been a central preoccupation of reorganization scholars for decades. By the standard law-and-economics account, deviations from absolute priority arise because well-positioned insiders take advantage of cumbersome procedures and inept judges. In this paper, we suggest that a far simpler and more benign force dominates bargaining in reorganization cases. “Deviations” from absolute priority are inevitable even in a world completely committed to respecting priority as long as asset values are uncertain. Uncertainty accompanies any valuation procedure. Bargaining in corporate reorganizations {{takes place in the}} shadow of this uncertainty, and standard models of litigation and settlement show that valuation uncertainty alone can explain many of the departures from absolute priority we see in large corporate reorganizations. Even where rational and well-informed senior investors expect the absolute priority rule to be strictly enforced, they must account for the uncertainty associated with any valuation. The possibility of an unexpectedly high appraisal will cause them to offer apparently out-of-the-money junior investors <b>contingent</b> <b>interests</b> in the reorganized business. The debate over absolute priority, the central principle of modern corporate reorganization law, has been misdirected for decades. It has failed to recognize that a substantive rule of absolute priority does not lead to an absolute priority outcome. A coherent account of absolute priority must incorporate relative priority. It must take account of the option value implicit in the junior investors 2 ̆ 7 right to insist on an appraisal...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. This mini-dissertation is {{primarily}} concerned with finding {{a solution to the}} problem regarding the repudiation of an inheritance by an insolvent. It is argued in the Wessels v De Jager case that when an insolvent repudiates an inheritance with the sole purpose of keeping the inheritance from being absolved by his creditors, such repudiation constitutes an act of insolvency. It is trite law that certain acts of insolvency can be rescinded in terms of section 26 of the Insolvency Act. To this end extensive use has been made of cases regarding this issue. Wessels v De Jager is the main point of departure regarding this study as it is the most recent case to establish a precedent. The court in Wessels found that the repudiation by an insolvent did not constitute an act of insolvency. In view thereof, it is suggested that the court erred in its finding in that the court based its decision primarily on the stipulation alteri. The stipulation alteri is an inherent contractual phenomenon. It is suggested that repudiation by an insolvent should be regarded as an act of insolvency. The corresponding reason for this premise is that when even at delatio certain rights exist. These rights are contingent or vested rights. The definition of asset in section 2 of the Insolvency Act is inclusive of <b>contingent</b> <b>interests.</b> Section 8 of the Insolvency Act stipulates that when an insolvent alienates his assets in such a way as to prejudice his creditors, such alienation constitutes a deed of insolvency. It is therefore argued that the repudiation of an inheritance by an insolvent heir is a deed of insolvency in terms of section 8 of the Insolvency Act which can be set aside by the court.
