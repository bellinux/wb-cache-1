25|$|The {{union of}} Venus and Mars held greater appeal for poets and philosophers, {{and the couple}} were a {{frequent}} subject of art. In Greek myth, the adultery of Ares and Aphrodite {{had been exposed to}} ridicule when her husband Hephaestus (whose Roman equivalent was Vulcan) caught them in the act by means of a magical snare. Although not originally part of the Roman tradition, in 217 BC Venus and Mars were presented as a <b>complementary</b> <b>pair</b> in the lectisternium, a public banquet at which images of twelve major gods of the Roman state were presented on couches as if present and participating.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a <b>complementary</b> <b>pair.</b> They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E

Golay sequences, which are pairs of binary sequences (i. e., all entries are ± 1) with zero autocorrelation, have been studied extensively, yet are known only in lengths 2 a 10 b 26 c. Ternary <b>complementary</b> <b>pairs</b> are pairs of (0, ± 1) -sequences with zero autocorrelation (thus, Golay <b>pairs</b> are ternary <b>complementary</b> <b>pairs</b> with no 0 's).

40|$|A set of {{sequences}} is complementary, if the sum {{of their}} periodic or nonperiodic autocorrelation function is zero. Infinite families of orthogonal designs, based on some weighing matrices of order 2 n, weight 2 n-k and spread σ, are constructed from two circulants matrices by using complementary sequences of zero non-periodic autocorrelation function, i. e. ternary <b>complementary</b> <b>pairs.</b> Moreover, a new measure is introduced, called ζ-efficiency, for ternary <b>complementary</b> <b>pairs</b> {{and some of its}} basic properties are explored. Using the notion of ζ-efficiency, some infinite classes of weighing matrices from ternary <b>complementary</b> <b>pairs</b> are constructed. Finally, a multiplication theorem for sequences with zero periodic autocorrelation function is given and its consequences are studied.

40|$|Summary. Stability {{selection}} was recently introduced by Meinshausen and Bühlmann {{as a very}} general technique designed to improve {{the performance of a}} variable selection algorithm. It is based on aggregating the results of applying a selection procedure to subsamples of the data. We introduce a variant, called <b>complementary</b> <b>pairs</b> stability selection, and derive bounds both on the expected number of variables included by <b>complementary</b> <b>pairs</b> stability selection that have low selection probability under the original procedure, and on the expected number of high selection probability variables that are excluded. These results require no (e. g. exchangeability) assumptions on the underlying model or {{on the quality of the}} original selection procedure. Under reasonable shape restrictions, the bounds can be further tightened, yielding improved error control, and therefore increasing the applicability of the methodology...|$|R
