5|$|Kearsley's {{version was}} a marked popular success. Over {{the next few}} years, the {{publishing}} house issued further editions in quick succession, adding still more non-Raspe material along the way; even the full-length Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, again not by Raspe and originally published in 1792 by a rival printer, was quickly subsumed {{into the body of}} stories. In the process of revision, Raspe's prose style was heavily modified; instead of his <b>conversational</b> <b>language</b> and sportsmanlike turns of phrase, Kearsley's writers opted for a blander and more formal tone imitating Augustan prose. Most ensuing English-language editions, including even the major editions produced by Thomas Seccombe in 1895 and F. J. Harvey Darton in 1930, reproduce one of the rewritten Kearsley versions rather than Raspe's original text.|$|E
500|$|The Conversation poems {{were grouped}} in the 20th century by {{literary}} critics who found similarity in focus, style and content. The series title was devised to describe verse where Coleridge incorporates <b>conversational</b> <b>language</b> while examining higher ideas {{of nature and}} morality. [...] The works are held together by common themes, in particular they share meditations on nature and man's place in the universe. In each, Coleridge explores his idea of [...] "One Life", a belief that people are spiritually connected through a universal relationship with God that joins all natural beings.|$|E
