2500|$|The <b>control</b> <b>test</b> {{effectively}} imposed liability {{where an}} employer dictated both what work {{was to be}} done, {{and how it was}} to be done. This is aptly suited for situations where precise instructions are given by an employer; it can clearly be seen that the employer is the causal link for any harm which follows. If on the other hand an employer does not determine how an act should be carried out, then the relationship would instead be one of employer and independent contractor. This distinction was explained by Slesser LJ: ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1909, Harris chaired {{a meeting}} of representatives of England, Australia and South Africa which {{launched}} the Imperial Cricket Conference and agreed rules to <b>control</b> <b>Test</b> cricket between the three nations. In 1926, he presided at a meeting at The Oval, when {{it was agreed that}} [...] "governing bodies of cricket in countries within the Empire to which cricket teams are sent, or which send teams to England" [...] should be eligible for ICC membership. The meeting had the effect of creating three new Test-playing nations: West Indies, New Zealand and India.|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, as {{the duties}} of {{employees}} have grown ever more specialised and far reaching, the <b>control</b> <b>test</b> has seen less primary use in establishing liability. It is difficult to state for example that a hospital administrator controls the method and actions of a professional doctor, despite liability having been clearly established in such cases. Different formulations of the test have been proposed, {{in an attempt to}} rectify these problems. One such formulation focuses on the ability of an employer to specify where and when tasks be carried out, and with whose tools and materials.|$|E

The experiment was carried under undrain shear condition via 3 typed-tests: Monotonic <b>test,</b> stress <b>controlled</b> <b>test,</b> strain <b>controlled</b> <b>test.</b> The results was followed: (1) As to Monotonic test, angle of shear resistance of chi-bishi sand is bigger than Thyoura sand, regardless of relation density. (2) According to Stress and Strain <b>controlled</b> <b>test,</b> Chi-bishi sand had shown larger value of liquefaction resistance.

2500|$|In 1994, Billman {{used his}} model of SCD {{to test the}} ability of omega-3 {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids to prevent fatal arrhythmias. In the test, eight dogs otherwise susceptible to ventricular fibrillation were given a direct infusion of fish oil. [...] Seven of the eight did not have VF during the test. Five of five animals re-tested in a follow-up <b>control</b> <b>test</b> (i.e. without treatment) had VF. The observed effect most likely resulted {{from a combination of}} direct chemical interaction on the cardiac cell membrane and a reduced heart rate caused by the omega-3s. [...] The study was picked up by a nationally syndicated columnist, and thus reported in various popular media outlets. [...] Follow-up studies in 1997 and 1999 confirmed the results (P<0.005) and found both eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (found in fish oil), as well as α-Linolenic acid (found in vegetable oil) to have antiarrhythmic effects.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Vainio {{started his}} season by {{finishing}} third at the Rotterdam Marathon {{with a personal}} record of 2:13:04. After the race he gave a doping sample in the test organized by the Finnish Athletics Association. The test did not have official status and was merely {{considered to be a}} <b>control</b> <b>test</b> to help avoid Finnish athletes getting caught at the tests performed in international championships. Therefore, only the so-called A-sample was taken and not the B-sample, which is used to ensure the test result after a positive A-sample. However, Vainio's A-sample was tested positive for anabolic steroids, and the head coach of the Finnish Athletics Federation, Antti Lanamäki, delegated Timo Vuorimaa, the head coach of long-distance runners, to inform Vainio about the test result. Vuorimaa informed Vainio only by mentioning that there was something strange in his test sample, not providing detailed information about the substance. Vainio believed that he had only been using [...] testosterone and not anabolic steroids at all. Therefore, his only action was to give up drug use a little bit earlier prior to the anticipated tests.|$|E
2500|$|Scope - A {{practical}} {{issue is}} whether {{the fact that an}} accused is labouring under a [...] "mental disability" [...] should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to know that what one is doing is wrong, or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a <b>control</b> <b>test</b> that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see Doyle v Wicklow County Council 1974) 55 IR 71. The Butler Committee recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an irrebuttable presumption of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis.|$|E

2500|$|Laboratory {{registries}} {{allow for}} the analysis of the incidence and prevalence of the target condition as well as trends in the level of control. For instance, an NIH-funded program called the Vermedx Diabetes Information System maintained a registry of laboratory values of diabetic adults in Vermont and northern New York State in the US with several years of laboratory results on thousands of patients. The data included measures of blood sugar control (glycosolated hemoglobin A1C), cholesterol, and kidney function (serum creatinine and urine protein), and were used to monitor the quality of care at the patient, practice, and population levels. [...] Since the data contained each patient's name and address, the system was also used to communicate directly with patients when the laboratory data indicated the need for attention. Out of <b>control</b> <b>test</b> results generated a letter to the patient suggesting they take action with their medical provider. Tests that were overdue generated reminders to have testing performed. The system also generated reminders and alerts with guideline-based advice for the practice as well as a periodic roster of each provider's patients and a report card summarizing the health status of the population. Clinical and economic evaluations of the system, including a large randomized clinical trial, demonstrated improvements in adherence to practice guidelines and reductions in the need for emergency room and hospital services as well as total costs per patient. The system has been commercialized and distributed to physicians, insurers, employers and others responsible for the care of chronically ill patients. It is now being expanded to other conditions such as chronic kidney disease.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{enterprises}} {{are highly}} dependent on Information Technology (IT) for accomplishing their objectives. In {{order to try to}} ensure that IT is aligned with the business objectives, an enterprise should ensure that it has effective IT controls for supporting its IT environment. Therefore, for checking the effectiveness of its IT environment, the enterprise’s IT environment is tested against the enterprise’s IT controls. So it is correct to state IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing</b> plays a crucial role in trying to ensure that the IT environ-ment of an enterprise is reliable for achieving the business goals. But it should be kept in mind that IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing</b> is a very challenging process. For instance, some of the challenges are the work effort required to complete the test, the speed of the test, accuracy, etc. Another challenge is the high cost of IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing.</b> During the accomplishment of the thesis, it has been observed that to solve the above-mentioned challenges, a lot of enterprises rely on Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques (CAAT) tools available in the market. After analyzing {{some of the most popular}} and widely used CAAT tools, it has been found out that such tools are helpful, but they are having their own challenges. For in-stance, they are not able to address all the requirements of IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing.</b> Further-more, CAAT tools are capable of performing specific tasks; they are not able to address all the issues related to IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing.</b> Their main challenge is the insufficient use of existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) data. The solution for having an effective IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing</b> process could be the appropriate use of enterprise’s existing ERP data which is of high quality. In fact, the data should be measured and analyzed appropriately, and it should be mapped to the IT controls in a correct way. Actually, it might be challenging and even expensive to implement such a system, but if such system is implemented once, and it could be used for several years with minor updates, then it would be worthy to implement it for a reliable IT <b>controls</b> <b>testing</b> in an enterprise environment...|$|R

The breathing pattern was evaluated at rest (standing and supine position during both relaxed breathing and deep breathing) and while performing clinical motor <b>control</b> <b>tests,</b> i. e. bent knee fall out and active straight leg raise. A blinded observer analyzed the breathing pattern of the participants using visual inspection and manual palpation. Costo-diaphragmatic breathing was considered as optimal breathing pattern. Subjects filled in visual analog scales for the assessment of pain intensity during the tests. At rest, no significant differences were found between the breathing pattern of patients and healthy subjects (P >  0. 05). In contrast, significantly more altered breathing patterns were observed in chronic LBP-patients during motor <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> (P =  0. 01). Changes in breathing pattern during motor <b>control</b> <b>tests</b> were not related to pain severity (P >  0. 01), but were related to motor control dysfunction (P =  0. 01) ...|$|R
