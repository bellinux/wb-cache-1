The second point is about deontology. The basic intellectual motivation that drives this second part of his argument is the following: there is something left out of the standard textbook accounts of language as consisting of syntax, semantics and phonology with an extra-linguistic pragmatics thrown in.

40|$|In {{order to}} proceed along an action sequence, an {{autonomous}} agent has {{to recognize that}} the intended final condition of the previous action has been achieved. In previous work, we have shown how a sequence of actions can be generated by an embodied agent using a neural-dynamic architecture for behavioral organization, in which each action has an intention and <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> These components are represented by dynamic neural fields, and are coupled to motors and sensors of the robotic agent.

40|$|Abstract—Robotic {{researchers}} face fundamental challenges when designing autonomous humanoid robots, {{which are}} able to interact with real dynamic environments. In such unstructured environments, the robot has to autonomously segment objects, detect and categorize relevant situations, decide when to initiate and terminate actions. As humans are very good in these tasks, inspiration from models of human sensory-motor and cognitive processes may help design more flexible and autonomous robotic control architectures. Recently, we have extended a neurally-inspired model for sequential organization with a representation of hierarchies of behaviors. Here, we implement this model on a robotic platform and demonstrate its functionality under constraints of a real-world implementation. The architecture generates hierarchically organized behavioral sequences on the Aldebaran’s humanoid robot NAO. The key dynamic components of serial organization – such as the intention, <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> (CoS), and interactions within the hierarchy – are coupled to robotic sensors and motors and bring about flexible and autonomous behavior. We also demonstrate how continuous in time neural-dynamic parts of the controller may be seamlessly integrated with preprogramed algorithmic behaviors, introducing flexibility, autonomy, and ability to learn, while avoiding unnec-essary complexity of the architecture.

40|$|Comunicação apresentada na European Conference on Educational Research, Lisboa, 2002 Ever {{since the}} 1930 s, Organizational Psychology has been devoting {{a great deal}} of {{attention}} to the study of job satisfaction. This has happened for three main reasons: historical and/or cultural (from both a historical and a cultural viewpoint, increasing value has been attached to the quality of life at work, which is regarded more and more as a space of personal development); functional (not only for its intrinsic value as psychological variable directly affecting behaviour, but also because job satisfaction is a construct with implications and consequences on other attitudes, at individual as well as at organizational level); and practical (it is a variable which can be easily measured and used). For a number of years, also teacher job satisfaction has been recognized as extremely important for implementing any type of education reform, for involving the teacher in life-long learning, for the quality of the teaching-learning process, and for satisfaction with life in general. This is the framework of the present empirical study, conducted with the objective of clarifying the aspects of teaching to be encouraged and the psychological processes to be promoted so as to obtain the best possible adjustment (as <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction)</b> between teachers' personal features and a professional activity requiring very specific characteristics...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that there are referential uses of definite descriptions. It is not as widely recognised that there are attributive uses of indexicals and other such paradigmatically singular terms. I offer {{an account of the}} referential/attributive distinction which is intended to give a unified treatment of both sorts of cases. I argue {{that the best way to}} account for the referential/attributive distinction is to treat it as semantically underdetermined which sort of proposition is expressed in a context. In certain contexts the proposition expressed will be a descriptive one, and in others it will be an object-dependent one. I appeal to Sperber and Wilson’s (1986) idea that the recovery of the content of an utterance involves pragmatic processes of enrichment of a representation of the logical form of the utterance. According to the account I offer, the first-level descriptive meaning associated with an expression (whether this is an indexical or a definite description) is pragmatically enriched and then used either to track an individual in the context, or is taken to lay down a <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> for an individual. The proposition that the listener takes the speaker to have expressed is recovered on the basis of considerations of relevance and contextually available information about the speaker’s directive intentions.

Each of these is independently motivated, but together they enable me to suggest solutions to several outstanding problems within action theory (deviant causal chains, the accordian effect, basic actions, etc.), to show how the logical structure of intentional action is strikingly like the logical structure of perceptions, and to construct on account of simple actions.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{notion of}} perceptual content is {{commonly}} {{introduced in the}} analysis of perception. It stems from an analogy between perception and propositional attitudes. Both kinds of mental states, it is thought, have <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> I try to show that on the most plausible account of perceptual content, it does not determine the conditions under which perceptual experience is veridical. Moreover, perceptual content must be bipolar (capable of being correct and capable of being incorrect), whereas perception as a mental state is not (if it is veridical, it is essentially so). This has profound consequences for the epistemological view that perception is a source of knowledge. I sktech a two-level epistemology which is consistent with this view. I conclude that the analogy between perception and propositional attitudes, from which the notion of perceptual is born, may be more misleading than it is usually thought. § 1 The notion of perceptual content Many philosophers of perception presently suppose that perceptual experience has a &quot;representational content &quot; which is distinct from the perceived scene itself. 1 The notion of perceptual content stems from an analogy between perception and propositional attitudes, lik...|$|R

40|$|Propositions {{have played}} a central role in {{philosophy}} of language since Frege. Propositions are generally taken to be the objects of propositional attitude, the meaning of sentences, the primary bearers of truth and falsehood, and the kinds of things that quantifiers in sentential position range over. As objects of propositional attitudes, propositions can be shared by different agents and moreover can be represented in one language or another. Thus, propositions are generally taken to be mind- and language-independent entities. In this paper, I want to argue that the notion of a proposition, given a range of philosophical problems as well as problems of linguistic adequacy, should be replaced by a different notion, for almost all the roles for which it has been invoked. The objects that are involved in propositional attitudes, that act as primary truth bearers, and that quantifiers in sentential position range over, I want to argue, are not propositions, but what I call attitudinal objects (or kinds of them). Attitudinal objects are entities like ‘John’s belief that S’, ‘John’s claim that S’, and ‘John’s desire to do X’.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} neurophysiological {{correlates}} of presupposition processing in <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and accommodation, comparing {{two types of}} triggers: definite descriptions and change-of-state verbs. Results showed that, for both types, the accommodation of presuppositions {{is associated with a}} biphasic N 400 -P 600 pattern at the processing point. With definite descriptions, we observed a more clear involvement of the N 400, while for change-of-state verbs the costs of accommodation were associated with a more pronounced P 600. Moreover, when conveyed by change of state predicates, presuppositions seem to elicit also a P 200 visible already at the trigger verb. The data nicely fit into the Linking-Updating model and support two main conclusions. First, presupposition accommodation is a sequential process unfolding through a biphasic ERP pattern presumably related to search for antecedent and discourse update. Second, the kind of presupposition trigger seems to affect the cognitive cost of presupposition accommodation at different processing times, with definite description capitalizing more on the earlier search for antecedent and change-of-state verbs capitalizing more on the later updating of the discourse mental model with the presupposed information. Overall, our findings suggest that the brain understands information taken for granted by going through a process whose time course involves several phases, differently modulated based on specific linguistic expressions...|$|R
