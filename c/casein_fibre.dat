50|$|Milk {{proteins}} {{have also}} been used to create synthetic fabric. Milk or <b>casein</b> <b>fibre</b> cloth was developed during World War I in Germany, and further developed in Italy and America during the 1930s. Milk fibre fabric is not very durable and wrinkles easily, but has a pH similar to human skin and possesses anti-bacterial properties. It is marketed as a biodegradable, renewable synthetic fibre.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to {{evaluate}} the effect of plant proteins (lupin protein or pea protein) and their combinations with soluble fibres (oat fibre or apple pectin) on plasma total and LDL-cholesterol levels. A randomised, double-blind, parallel group design was followed: after a 4 -week run-in period, participants were randomised into seven treatment groups, each consisting of twenty-five participants. Each group consumed two bars containing specific protein/fibre combinations: the reference group consumed casein + cellulose; {{the second and third}} groups consumed bars containing lupin or pea proteins + cellulose; the fourth and fifth groups consumed bars containing <b>casein</b> and oat <b>fibre</b> or apple pectin; the sixth group and seventh group received bars containing combinations of pea protein and oat fibre or apple pectin, respectively. Bars containing lupin protein + cellulose (- 116 mg/l, 24. 2 %), casein + apple pectin (- 152 mg/l, - 5. 3 %), pea protein + oat fibre (- 135 mg/l, - 4. 7 %) or pea protein + apple pectin (- 168 mg/ l, - 6. 4 %) resulted in significant reductions of total cholesterol levels (P< 0. 05), whereas no cholesterol changes were observed in the subjects consuming the bars containing casein + cellulose, <b>casein</b> + oat <b>fibre</b> or pea protein + cellulose. The present study shows the hypocholesterolaemic activity and potential clinical benefits of consuming lupin protein or combinations of pea protein and a soluble fibre, such as oat fibre or apple pectin...|$|R
40|$|The work {{covers the}} system {{containing}} the protein <b>casein</b> hydrolysates, food <b>fibres</b> and pectin. The {{aim is to}} investigate the process for heterophase hydrolysis of the proteins in presence of the food cellulose and pectin fibres by the electron microscopy and chemical kinetics methods. The influence of the pectin and cellulose fibres on the degree and depth of the casein hydrolysis has been studied, and the character in permolecular organization of the complexes generating during preoteolysis has been investigated. The method for electron-microscopic analysis of the complex multicomponent system - concentrated solutions of protein and pectin {{in the presence of}} the fibrous component has been developed. The model up-to-date foods on base of the protein hydrolysates, pectin and food fibres have been introduced.
