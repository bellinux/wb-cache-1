5|$|FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} cases {{linked to}} the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder believes in paranormal phenomena, while the skeptical Scully attempts to discredit them. In this episode, the pair investigate a possible conspiracy in the US Air Force and Mulder meets a mysterious informant who warns him {{to stay away from}} the case. Undeterred, Mulder continues and <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> to the truth about extraterrestrial life than ever before, only to have his progress taken away from him again.|$|E

25|$|The spokes {{appear to}} be a {{seasonal}} phenomenon, disappearing in the Saturnian midwinter and midsummer and reappearing as Saturn <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> to equinox. Suggestions that the spokes may be a seasonal effect, varying with Saturn's 29.7-year orbit, were supported by their gradual reappearance in the later years of the Cassini mission.|$|E

A mile past that junction and downtown, NY127, also bound for White Plains, forks left at Keeler Avenue as US 1 itself begins to trend more to the east into Rye, passing Rye Neck High School at the town line.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to find a present-day parallel. The withholding of copyright, though only an indirect financial penalty, was both an official act and a hostile signal. We do not seem to have a word for this kind of indirect pressure, though suppression of dissent <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> than censorship. Perhaps the modern 'naming and shaming' comes closest. The importance of respectability, reputation and public standing were critical in this case, as so often in traditional societies.|$|E

While the first Foundation has developed the physical sciences, the Second Foundation has been developing Seldon's mathematics and the Seldon Plan, along with their own use of mental sciences. The Second Foundation ultimately wears down the Mule, who returns to rule over his kingdom peacefully {{for the rest of}} his life, without any further thought of conquering the Second Foundation.|$|E

25|$|This {{reform was}} {{elaborated}} {{in order to}} attain an education system based {{on the development of}} competences rather than on the transmission of knowledge, and included the development of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees aimed to simplify comparison between qualifications across Europe. The flexibility and transparency enabled students to have their qualifications recognised more widely, facilitating freedom of movement around a more transparent EHEA (European Higher Education Area). This was aided by the establishment of a system of credits {{in the form of the}} European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and the adoption of the Diploma Supplement by all countries involved. One academic year corresponds to 60 ECTS-credits that are equivalent to 1500–1800 hours of study. The new model <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> to the North American and Japanese systems. It gives greater weight to practical training, intensive research projects and the way credits are measured reflects how hard a student has worked. The new evaluation methods reflect not only a student's performance on exams, but also his or her lab experiments, presentations, hours spent on study, innovation capacities and so forth.|$|E
500|$|Besides Proust, other {{possible}} literary influences include Borges and Nietzsche; Pauline Kael in her review comments that [...] "Roeg <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> to getting Borges {{on the screen}} than those who have tried it directly", while Mark Sanderson in his BFI Modern Classics essay on the film, finds parallels with Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil.|$|E

He's best at evoking the psycho-murky worlds {{in which his}} {{characters}} reside. The Penguin holds court in a penguin-crowded, Phantom of the Opera-like sewer home. Keaton hides in a castlelike mansion, which perfectly mirrors its owner's inner remoteness. Comic strip purists will probably never be happy with a Batman movie. But Returns <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> than ever to Bob Kane's dark, original strip, which began in 1939." [...] He described Walken as [...] "engaging", DeVito as [...] "exquisite" [...] and Pfeiffer as [...] "deliciously purry." ...|$|E

500|$|The phrase [...] "Roy of the Rovers" [...] {{has become}} a trope {{familiar}} to generations of British football fans and sports commentators, used to describe a memorable sporting achievement such as winning against the odds, or an unexpected comeback. The Guardian newspaper of 10 April 1995, for instance, described future England captain Alan Shearer as [...] "the classic working class sporting hero... everything legend demands an English centre-forward should be... As a striker he <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> to fitting the Roy of the Rovers fantasy than anyone else lately admired by English crowds". Shearer {{was at that time}} the leading goal-scorer for [...] "unfashionable" [...] Blackburn Rovers F.C., who {{were on the verge of}} winning the Premiership title.|$|E
500|$|The Eurasian tree sparrow's {{binomial}} name {{is derived}} from two Latin words: passer, [...] "sparrow", and montanus, [...] "of the mountains" [...] (from mons [...] "mountain"). The Eurasian tree sparrow was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 Systema Naturae as Fringilla montana, but, along with the house sparrow, it was soon moved from the finches (family Fringillidae) into the new genus Passer created by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The Eurasian tree sparrow's common name is given because of its preference of tree holes for nesting. This name, and the scientific name montanus, do not appropriately describe this species's habitat preferences: the German name Feldsperling ("field sparrow") <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> to doing so.|$|E
500|$|Craig first played Bond in the 2006 film Casino Royale, an {{adaptation}} of Fleming's novel {{of the same name}} and a reboot of the Eon series, which saw Bond earn his 00 status. Despite the negative press on his appointment, Craig was widely praised by critics and former Bonds after the release of Casino Royale, believing him to have been the first actor to truly nail Fleming's character in the book: Todd McCarthy, reviewing the film for Variety, considered that [...] "Craig <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> to the author's original conception of this exceptionally long-lived male fantasy figure than anyone since early Sean Connery", and {{he went on to say}} that [...] "Craig once and for all claims the character as his own", while Steven Spielberg called Craig [...] "the perfect 21st-century Bond".|$|E

500|$|Pluto is {{the largest}} and second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System, and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object {{directly}} orbiting the Sun. It {{is the largest}} known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—about one-sixth {{the mass of the}} Moon and one-third its volume. It has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49 astronomical units or AU (4.4–7.4 billion km) from the Sun. This means that Pluto periodically <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance with Neptune prevents them from colliding. [...] Light from the Sun takes about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5 AU).|$|E
500|$|Animation {{historian}} Michael Barrier {{wrote that}} Belle [...] "becomes {{a sort of}} intellectual less by actually reading books, it seems, than by hanging out with them", but says that the film <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> than other [...] "Disney-studio" [...] films to [...] "accepting challenges {{of the kind that}} the finest Walt Disney features met". David Whitley writes in The Idea of Nature in Disney Animation that Belle is different from earlier Disney heroines in that she is mostly free from the burdens of domestic housework, although her role is somewhat undefined {{in the same way that}} [...] "contemporary culture now requires most adolescent girls to contribute little in the way of domestic work before they leave home and have to take on the fraught, multiple responsibilities of the working mother". Whitley also notes other themes and modern influences, such as the film's critical view of Gaston's chauvinism and attitude towards nature, the cyborg-like servants, and the father's role as an inventor rather than a merchant.|$|E
500|$|The time loop {{continues}} ad nauseam, {{though each}} time Pam speaks to Mulder, he <b>comes</b> <b>closer</b> {{to being able}} to remember her. She is finally able to convince him that events are repeating themselves, and before he is killed by the blast, Mulder begins repeating [...] "he's got a bomb" [...] to himself, in an attempt to recall it the next time around. In the following iteration of the day Mulder finds himself repeating the phrase in the bank, and acting on his hunch, calls Scully and then confronts Bernard before he begins the holdup, changing events on a fundamental level. Scully, acting on Mulder's phone call, brings Pam into the Bank. Mulder and Pam convince Bernard to give up and walk out with Pam. The sirens of the approaching Police response become audible and Bernard becomes agitated and attempts to shoot Mulder, but Pam throws herself in front of Mulder as he fires. As she lies dying, she admits, [...] "This never happened before." [...] Bernard collapses to his knees, horrified by what he has done, and is peacefully arrested. The bomb blast averted, time continues as normal.|$|E
