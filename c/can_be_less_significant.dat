40|$|Entrepreneurs {{are often}} {{perceived}} to be creative and risk taking (Kreuger, 2002). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate entrepreneurs’ response to a failure namely a bankruptcy. People react differently to a bankruptcy and tend to blame different things as the cause. Some blame themselves while others blame things out of their control. These differences can have an impact on the learning process and how easy the entrepreneur moves on after the failure. These findings can be used for situations when dealing with failures and entrepreneurial activities. There is no single theory already existing for this topic, therefore several theories have been looked at and used for the analysis. The theories can be divided into five main areas: entrepreneurship, failure, entrepreneurial response to failure, factors affecting responses to failure and learning. Entrepreneurship is treated as the creation of new economic activity (Davidsson, 2004) and entrepreneurial traits (Kreuger, 2002) are considered in the analysis. Locus of control is an important trait since it shows the ability of the entrepreneur to think that they are in control of the environment. (Rotter, 1966) In order to explain the cause of a bankruptcy people tend to use certain attributions. Locus of causality refers to whether a person blames internal or external causes and stability whether these causes are changeable in the future or not. (Martinko, 1995) Several factors will influence the response to a bank-ruptcy and in this thesis motivation for the start-up, culture and separation of the company are looked upon. After a failure an entrepreneur can learn false lessons (McGrath & Cardon, 1997) and stop any entrepreneurial activities. However failure can also be positive if something true has been learnt. (Wiklund, 2006) This report is an exploratory type of study and a case study was conducted where five cases were used with entrepreneurs that have run companies that have gone bankrupt. A qualitative method was used and the empirical findings were gathered trough interviews which were then analysed with the support from the theoretical framework. In the analysis new models were created that showed patterns we found comparing the in-terviews. It also includes discussion about how culture affects the blaming factors of fail-ure. The factors that an entrepreneur is blaming the failure on are much depending on to what degree they possess entrepreneurial traits. This paper also suggest that how personally an entrepreneur takes his/her failure depends mostly on how financially dependent they were on their company and also how experienced they were from failure. Another finding was also that all the participants agreed that it is not a supportive business culture in the Jönköping region. Another conclusion is that entrepreneurs that blame their failure on in-ternal factors learn more from it, but this learning <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>significant</b> due to earlier ex-perience from failure...|$|E
40|$|Deformational {{control of}} {{structures}} has its greatest exponent in large dams monitoring, which, {{depending on their}} structural typology, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> subjected to movements generally based on both the pressure that they upport and the temperature. The designer usually calculates the theoretical displacements that the dam will suffer onsidering the hydrostatic thrust and the temperature, {{but it is also}} true that these displacements are theoretical and they do not often fit to the real movements, due to the uncertainties that arise during the onstruction of any dam and make the final structure have changes which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> more or <b>less</b> <b>significant</b> with respect to the originally projected one. However, it is worth mentioning that they are usually lower than those theoretically calculated. The present research work focuses on a potential correlation and the subsequent determination of an mpirical model that allows calculating the deformation by means of a polynomial fit, working on the basis of temperature observations held over 14 years. This empirical model is contrasted and validated with the observations taken during the following year, and although it is only valid for the dam where the test has been made (“La Cohilla” Dam), the methodology is suitable for any other structure...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of microelectronics, a rapid {{technological}} development {{has taken place in}} recent decades, which has influenced not only daily life, but also the tools of doctors. For example, motion tracking is frequently and successfully used in medicine and has enabled a number of new treatment techniques. In medical applications a variety of motion tracking systems is used, mostly based on magnetic and optical motion tracking. Both, however, have significant drawbacks in the operating room (OR) environment: whereas magnetic tracking systems are sensitive to metals, which are common in the OR, optical tracking systems are cumbersome to use in the OR because of the line-of-sight problem. In general, these systems are often expensive compared to the cost of each intervention, and therefore their use is not justified in many cases. In contrast, there is the current trend of miniaturization: electronic cameras are getting smaller and cheaper. This thesis proposes that using miniaturized cameras for tracking, the disadvantages of existing tracking systems can compensated in specific medical applications, because they can be positioned much closer to the point of interest. Also, poorer image quality (compared to high quality dedicated tracking cameras) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> <b>significant</b> under certain circumstances. This hypothesis is investigated for two specific applications. An MRI compatible optical head tracking system was developed to track the motion of the patient's head using circular, planar, single-colored markers on the patient's forehead. Cameras are positioned inside the MRI scanner, mounted directly to the head coil. Because of the poor image quality of the cameras, algorithms used in off-the-shelf infrared tracking systems had to be adapted to meet clinical requirements (patient convenience and comfort, usability by medical personnel) and environmental conditions in the MRI scanner. For this tracking system, a cross-calibration procedure was developed utilizing water-filled spheres forming a virtual calibration phantom. It thus differs from known methods in which structures visible in MRI, and structures visible in video images are different; corresponding calibration phantoms therefore need to be manufactured and/or measured precisely. The head motion tracking system was evaluated theoretically, in laboratory, and clinically in experiments with healthy subjects. In a clinical project in which MRI scans were acquired repeatedly {{over a long period of}} time at a low resolution, a virtual head immobilization was achieved using the optical head motion tracking system. Furthermore, a navigation system for ultrasound-guided puncture was developed. It presents the doctor a visualization of the needle's course and the projected intersection point with the ultrasound image plane overlayed on the ultrasound image. For this purpose, an optical needle tracking system consisting of two low-cost cameras attached to the ultrasound transducer was developed. From these cameras' images, the needle is extracted using an edge-based method. Its position and orientation is determined relative to the ultrasound transducer, and the course of the needle and the intersection point with the ultrasound image plane is overlayed on the ultrasound image. The navigation system has been evaluated theoretically and in the laboratory on an ultrasound phantom. Doctors were involved in the evaluation who perform ultrasound-guided punctures in their daily work. It was shown that accuracy could be improved compared to the state of the art...|$|E
