5|$|In melody-dominated homophony, {{accompanying}} voices provide <b>chordal</b> {{support for}} the lead voice, which assumes the melody. Some popular music today might be considered melody-dominated homophony, voice typically taking on the lead role, while instruments like piano, guitar and bass guitar normally accompany the voice. In many cases, instruments also take on the lead role, and often the role switches between parts, voice taking the lead during a verse and instruments subsequently taking solos, during which the other instruments provide <b>chordal</b> support.|$|E
5|$|The spans were {{assembled}} on site. Staging {{was laid}} and rails {{put in place}} to carry a travelling crane. The long beams were hoisted in place first, followed by the vertical bracings, and then the outer and inner plates of the top <b>chordal</b> trusses and the diagonals. The whole structure was bolted together at first, and later riveted by blacksmiths using hand-operated forges. Some individual spans were completed within a week, with contractors being complimented on the efficiency of their work.|$|E
5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening {{at the door of}} the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex <b>chordal</b> structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.|$|E
5|$|Now {{beginning}} to compose independently, Rachmaninoff's next project {{was a group}} he titled Three Nocturnes, and is regarded as his first serious attempt at writing for the piano. The first nocturne, in F-sharp minor, was written 14-21 November 1887, and has three parts: a beginning and an end in andante cantabile and a central section in allegro. The slower andantes are gentle sections, influenced by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, while the allegro is unnatural and stiff and unusually fast for a nocturne. The second piece, in F major, followed on 22-25 November, also contains a slower portion coupled with a quick section. No. 3, in C minor, {{took more than a}} month to compose, dated from 3 December 1886 to 12 January 1887. With a <b>chordal</b> texture spread over the entire keyboard, it is reminiscent of the music of Robert Schumann. The nocturnes were published posthumously in Moscow in 1949, but were not assigned an opus number.|$|E
5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace – Trio: Un poco più lento. The A {{section of}} the scherzo uses a playful leaping rolled chord figure that is rhythmically and harmonically {{reminiscent}} of the opening bars of the sonata. The B section {{is dominated by the}} juxtaposition of two distant tonal realms. It commences in C-major for a rollicking theme that is abruptly interrupted by a downward-rushing C-sharp minor scale without any modulatory preparation, in a striking cyclic reference to the climax of the preceding movement's middle section. Following this outburst, the B section quietly ends in C-sharp minor a grace-note melody identical in contour to a figure from the theme of the Andantino (2–1–7–1–3–1), before modulating back to the movement's tonic. C major returns in the concluding A section, this time more tonally integrated into its A-major surroundings, by modulatory sequences. The ternary form trio in D major uses hand crossing to add melodic accompaniment to the <b>chordal</b> theme, and is rhythmically and harmonically based on the opening of the Allegro.|$|E
5|$|I. Allegro. The sonata {{begins with}} a forte, heavily {{textured}} <b>chordal</b> fanfare emphasizing a low A pedal and duple-meter stepwise diatonic ascent in thirds in the middle voices, followed immediately by quiet descending triplet arpeggios punctuated by light chords outlining a chromatic ascent. These highly contrasting phrases provide the motivic material {{for much of the}} sonata. The second theme is a lyrical melody written in four-part harmony. The exposition follows standard classical practice by modulating from tonic (A) to dominant (E) for the second theme, even preparing the latter tonality with its own V – the only first movement {{to do so in the}} mature Schubert. Despite this traditional approach, both exposition themes are built in an innovative ternary form, and in each resulting 'B' section a highly chromatic development-like section based on the exposition's second phrase modulates through the circle of fourths, only to return to the tonic. This novel structure creates a sense of harmonic movement without actually committing to a thematic modulation, and is one of the techniques Schubert uses to achieve a sense of scale in the movement. The development proper is based on a scalar variation of the second theme heard at the end of the exposition. Here, in contrast to the striking modulatory excursions nested in the exposition, the tonal plan is static, shifting constantly between C major and B major (later B minor). After the development theme is finally stated in the tonic minor, the dramatic retransition has the unconventional role of only shifting to the major mode to prepare the recapitulation, rather than fully preparing the tonic key (which in this case has already been established). The recapitulation is traditional – staying in the tonic, and emphasizing the tonic minor and the flat submediant (F major) as subdominant tonalities. The coda restates the first theme, this time in a much more 'hesitant' manner, pianissimo and with further allusions to subdominant tonalities. The movement ends with serene arpeggios; however, for the penultimate chord, Schubert chose a striking Italian sixth on II, instead of the more usual dominant or diminished seventh chords. This choice is not arbitrary – it is a final statement of the chromatically-based ascending minor second motive that pervaded the movement, a motive that will be reversed into a descending minor second in the following movement.|$|E
5|$|IV. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto. The finale has {{the same}} {{structure}} {{as that of the}} previous sonata. Many elements of this movement imply large-scale resolution of harmonic and thematic conflicts established earlier in this and even the two previous sonatas. The main rondo theme opens with an 'empty' octave on G, which resolves to C minor, subsequently interpreted as ii of V in B-flat major. Brendel asserts that this theme, beginning in the ambiguous G/Cm, functions as a resolution of the troubling G trill presented in {{the very beginning of the}} sonata, using G to resolve to F major as V of B-flat. The second theme, in ternary form, is written in the traditional key of the dominant, with a central section in D major; it consists of an extended, characteristically Schubertian stepwise melody played over an uninterrupted flow of semiquavers. This second theme uses the same melodic contour (5-8-7-6-6-5-(5-4-4-3)) of the remarkable C major modulation in the final A section of the second movement, implying further connotations of conflict resolution. After an abrupt end to the second theme and a pregnant pause, a minor dotted-rhythm <b>chordal</b> theme in F-minor suddenly enters fortissimo, elaborating and modulating before sublimating into a pianissimo version of itself in the parallel major. This third theme is highly similar in rhythm and melodic contour as well as left hand pattern to the tarantella of the C minor sonata, which may not be a coincidence when considering the overall high level of cyclic connection between the sonatas. This theme evolves into a rhythmic segue that leads seamlessly back to the main theme of the rondo. The development section, based entirely on the rhythmic pattern of the main rondo theme, is characterised by juxtaposed eighth notes and triplets, reaching a climax on C-flat major, from which the bass descends in chromatic modulation eventually to G in an extended diminuendo to return to the main theme. In the coda, the main theme is fragmented in a manner also similar to the finale of the previous sonata; in a highly chromatic and unstable progression, the octave on G here descends through G-flat to F, in an extension of the G-G-F resolution of the theme. After finally reaching this dominant preparation for the final time, the movement closes with an exceedingly triumphant and affirming presto section that totally resolves all dramatic conflicts in the sonata and the series.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the k-trees {{are their}} own <b>chordal</b> completions, {{and form a}} {{subclass}} of the <b>chordal</b> graphs. <b>Chordal</b> completions {{can also be used}} to characterize several other related classes of graphs.|$|E
25|$|The clique graphs of <b>chordal</b> graphs are the dually <b>chordal</b> graphs.|$|E
25|$|Other superclasses of <b>chordal</b> graphs include forests, weakly <b>chordal</b> graphs, cop-win graphs, odd-hole-free graphs, even-hole-free graphs, and Meyniel graphs. <b>Chordal</b> graphs are {{precisely}} the graphs {{that are both}} odd-hole-free and even-hole-free (see holes in graph theory).|$|E
25|$|From the definition, split graphs {{are clearly}} closed under complementation. Another {{characterization}} of split graphs involves complementation: they are <b>chordal</b> graphs the complements {{of which are}} also <b>chordal.</b> Just as <b>chordal</b> graphs are the intersection graphs of subtrees of trees, split graphs are the intersection graphs of distinct substars of star graphs. Almost all <b>chordal</b> graphs are split graphs; that is, in the limit as n goes to infinity, the fraction of n-vertex <b>chordal</b> graphs that are split approaches one.|$|E
25|$|K-trees are <b>chordal</b> graphs {{in which}} all maximal cliques and all maximal clique {{separators}} have the same size. Apollonian networks are <b>chordal</b> maximal planar graphs, or equivalently planar 3-trees. Maximal outerplanar graphs are a subclass of 2-trees, and therefore are also <b>chordal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Strongly <b>chordal</b> graphs are graphs {{that are}} <b>chordal</b> and contain no n-sun (for n≥3) as an induced subgraph. Here an n-sun is an n-vertex <b>chordal</b> graph G {{together}} {{with a collection of}} n degree-two vertices, adjacent to the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle inG.|$|E
25|$|The largest maximal clique is {{a maximum}} clique, and, as <b>chordal</b> graphs are perfect, {{the size of}} this clique equals the {{chromatic}} number of the <b>chordal</b> graph. <b>Chordal</b> graphs are perfectly orderable: an optimal coloring may be obtained by applying a greedy coloring algorithm to the vertices in the reverse of a perfect elimination ordering.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chordal</b> graphs are {{a subset}} of the perfect graphs. They may be {{recognized}} in polynomial time, and several problems that are hard on other classes of graphs such as graph coloring may be solved in polynomial time when the input is <b>chordal.</b> The treewidth of an arbitrary graph may be characterized {{by the size of the}} cliques in the <b>chordal</b> graphs that contain it.|$|E
25|$|This {{equivalence}} between pathwidth and interval thickness {{is closely}} {{analogous to the}} equivalence between treewidth and the minimum clique number (minus one) of a <b>chordal</b> graph of which the given graph is a subgraph. Interval graphs are a special case of <b>chordal</b> graphs, and <b>chordal</b> graphs can be represented as intersection graphs of subtrees of a common tree generalizing the way that interval graphs are intersection graphs of subpaths of a path.|$|E
25|$|The {{family of}} <b>chordal</b> graphs {{may be defined}} inductively as the graphs whose {{vertices}} {{can be divided into}} three nonempty subsets A, S, and B, such that A∪S and S∪B both form <b>chordal</b> induced subgraphs, S is a clique, and there are no edges from A to B. That is, they are the graphs that have a recursive decomposition by clique separators into smaller subgraphs. For this reason, <b>chordal</b> graphs have also sometimes been called decomposable graphs.|$|E
25|$|Apollonian {{networks}} {{are examples of}} maximal planar graphs, graphs to which no additional edges can be added without destroying planarity, or equivalently graphs that can be drawn in the plane so that every face (including the outer face) is a triangle. They are also <b>chordal</b> graphs, graphs in which every cycle of four or more vertices has a diagonal edge connecting two non-consecutive cycle vertices, and {{the order in which}} vertices are added in the subdivision process that forms an Apollonian network is an elimination ordering as a <b>chordal</b> graph. This forms an alternative characterization of the Apollonian networks: they are exactly the <b>chordal</b> maximal planar graphs or equivalently the <b>chordal</b> polyhedral graphs.|$|E
25|$|Every {{complete}} graph Kn has treewidth n1. This is most easily seen using {{the definition of}} treewidth in terms of <b>chordal</b> graphs: the {{complete graph}} is already <b>chordal,</b> and adding more edges cannot {{reduce the size of}} its largest clique.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} of perfect elimination orderings {{is finding a}} maximum clique of a <b>chordal</b> graph in polynomial-time, while the same problem for general graphs is NP-complete. More generally, a <b>chordal</b> graph can have only linearly many maximal cliques, while non-chordal graphs may have exponentially many. To list all maximal cliques of a <b>chordal</b> graph, simply find a perfect elimination ordering, form a clique for each vertex v together with the neighbors of v that are later than v in the perfect elimination ordering, and test whether each of the resulting cliques is maximal.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>chordal</b> graph is a strangulated graph, a graph {{in which}} every {{peripheral}} cycle is a triangle, because peripheral cycles are a special case of induced cycles. Strangulated graphs are graphs that can be formed by clique-sums of <b>chordal</b> graphs and maximal planar graphs. Therefore, strangulated graphs include maximal planar graphs.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemaic graphs are graphs {{that are}} both <b>chordal</b> and {{distance}} hereditary.|$|E
25|$|Equivalently, the treewidth of G is {{one less}} than {{the size of the}} largest clique in the <b>chordal</b> graph {{containing}} G with the smallest clique number. A <b>chordal</b> graph with this clique size may be obtained by adding to G an edge between every two vertices that both belong to {{at least one of the}} sets Xi.|$|E
25|$|In any graph, a vertex {{separator}} {{is a set}} of vertices {{the removal}} of which leaves the remaining graph disconnected; a separator is minimal if it has no proper subset that is also a separator. According to a theorem of , <b>chordal</b> graphs are graphs in which each minimal separator is a clique; Dirac used this characterization to prove that <b>chordal</b> graphs are perfect.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{characterization of}} <b>chordal</b> graphs, due to , involves trees and their subtrees.|$|E
25|$|Any kind of <b>chordal</b> tuning can be achieved, {{simply by}} using the notes in the chord and tuning the strings to those notes. For example, Asus4 has the notes A, D, E. By tuning the strings to only those notes, it creates a <b>chordal</b> Asus4 tuning. Since power chords only use two notes, fifth chord tuning use repeats of those two notes.|$|E
25|$|A cograph is a graph all {{of whose}} minimal <b>chordal</b> {{completions}} are trivially perfect graphs.|$|E
25|$|For <b>chordal</b> graphs, and {{for special}} cases of <b>chordal</b> graphs such as {{interval}} graphs and indifference graphs, the greedy coloring algorithm {{can be used}} to find optimal colorings in polynomial time, by choosing the vertex ordering to be the reverse of a perfect elimination ordering for the graph. The perfectly orderable graphs generalize this property, but it is NP-hard to find a perfect ordering of these graphs.|$|E
25|$|A perfect {{elimination}} {{ordering of}} a <b>chordal</b> graph is an ordering of its vertices such that, for each vertex v, the neighbors of v that occur later than v in the ordering form a clique. The prefixes of perfect elimination orderings of a <b>chordal</b> graph form an antimatroid. Antimatroids also describe some {{other kinds of}} vertex removal orderings in graphs, such as the dismantling orders of cop-win graphs.|$|E
25|$|A {{representation}} of a <b>chordal</b> graph as an intersection of subtrees forms a tree decomposition of the graph, with treewidth equal to one less than {{the size of the}} largest clique in the graph; the tree decomposition of any graph G can be viewed in this way as a {{representation of}} G as a subgraph of a <b>chordal</b> graph. The tree decomposition of a graph is also the junction tree of the junction tree algorithm.|$|E
25|$|A {{connected}} graph {{with at least}} two vertices has treewidth 1 if and only if it is a tree. A tree has treewidth one by the same reasoning as for complete graphs (namely, it is <b>chordal,</b> and has maximum clique size two). Conversely, if a graph has a cycle, then every <b>chordal</b> completion of the graph includes at least one triangle consisting of three consecutive vertices of the triangle, from which it follows that its treewidth is at least two.|$|E
25|$|Interval graphs are the {{intersection}} graphs of subtrees of path graphs, {{a special case}} of trees. Therefore, they are a subfamily of <b>chordal</b> graphs.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{features}} of Passereau's chansons {{include the use}} of quick declamation, <b>chordal</b> passages with occasional polyphony, generally syllabic word setting, satirical and ribald subjects, and catchy rhythms.|$|E
25|$|The treewidth of G is {{one less}} {{than the number of}} {{vertices}} in a maximum clique of a <b>chordal</b> completion chosen to minimize this clique size.|$|E

25|$|The {{complement}} of any interval graph is a comparability graph. The comparability relation is called an interval order. Interval graphs {{are exactly the}} graphs that are <b>chordal</b> and that have comparability graph complements.|$|E
