25|$|Devil May Cry 2 {{begins with}} Dante meeting an associate, Lucia, in a museum. She invites him to Dumary Island, where he meets her mother, Matier. She asks {{for his help}} in {{fighting}} Arius, a businessman who wields demonic power and is planning to use a collection of magic artifacts, the Arcana, to call forth a devil lord known as Argosax. Dante flips a coin, {{and based on the}} result, he decides to help. Lucia confronts Arius, who reveals that she was his creation. Shortly afterward, Lucia gives Dante the last of the Arcana before leaving to face Arius alone. Dante then encounters Matier who asks Dante to take the Arcana to save Lucia from Arius. Lucia attacks Arius, though he captures her. Dante arrives and trades the Arcana for Lucia, then attacks Arius, who escapes. A large stream of energy strikes the Ouroboros tower and a portal to the demon world is opened. Dante and Lucia argue over who will enter, but Dante flips his coin to determine that he will be the one to go. After Dante departs, Arius returns to the human world, though Lucia goes on to defeat him. Within the portal, Dante fights and defeats the partially summoned Argosax. Finding the portal <b>closed</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> Dante instead drives further into the demon realm on a motorcycle. In the aftermath of the battle, Matier insists to Lucia that Sparda returned from a similar trip. Sometime later in Dante's shop, Lucia muses about Dante and examines the coin he gave her, discovering it is two-headed. Outside the sound of a motorcycle echoes, and Lucia leaves to investigate. The player is not shown {{whether or not it is}} Dante.|$|E

Boris explains that he felt bad about yelling at Minka, and had gone to look for her mother's wine glasses, but had become locked inside when the door <b>closed</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> (it can't open from the inside).

60|$|Lady Harman {{stood for}} some moments {{regarding}} the paper-covered door that had <b>closed</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> Then she bared her white forearm and pinched it--hard.|$|E

60|$|He {{led the way}} to {{the wood}} where the horses were tethered, and the captain, Joe, and Darry came <b>close</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|You {{conceive}} the master's amazement {{to see the}} Deputy-Governor come toiling up {{the entrance}} ladder, with Blood following very <b>close</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
