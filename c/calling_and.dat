5|$|The striped honeyeater {{has most}} often been {{observed}} singly or in twos, and occasionally in small flocks. When not breeding {{it has been}} recorded feeding in loose mobile groups, drinking in mixed groups with miners, and travelling in small groups. It engages in {{a high level of}} social activity, including perching closely and allopreening, and when feeding in groups chasing, <b>calling</b> <b>and</b> scolding. The non-breeding striped honeyeater is vocal, calling while feeding and perching, though only occasionally calling in flight. It has been recorded engaged in a display of wing raising and <b>calling,</b> <b>and</b> performing duets and call-and-response song.|$|E

5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, <b>calling</b> <b>and</b> bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E
5|$|Remain in Light {{was named}} the best album of 1980 by Sounds, ahead of The Skids' The Absolute Game, and by Melody Maker, while The New York Times {{included}} it in its unnumbered shortlist of the 10best records issued that year. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists, notably at number two, behind The Clash's London Calling, by Robert Christgau, and at number six by NME. It featured at number three—behind London <b>Calling</b> <b>and</b> Bruce Springsteen's The River—in The Village Voices 1980 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, which aggregates the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Moses {{begins with}} Moses' asking God about {{the purpose of}} creation. Moses is told in this account that God made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life. The book also {{provides}} an enlarged account of the Genesis creation narrative and expands the story of Enoch, the ancestor of Noah. In the narrative, Enoch speaks with God, receives a prophetic <b>calling,</b> <b>and</b> eventually builds a city of Zion so righteous that it was taken to heaven. The book also elaborates and expands upon foreshadowing the coming of Christ, in effect Christianizing the Old Testament.|$|E

We focus on the share of <b>calls</b> <b>and</b> texts for each rank; note that since we are counting time slots, there are slots with both channels present.|$|R

5|$|India Knight, {{a novelist}} and {{columnist}} for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 {{that she had}} been reading The Cuckoo's <b>Calling</b> <b>and</b> thought it was good for a début novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply. Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E
5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. The mating season, which lasts for about three weeks, coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that the animals are in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth, and the conception rate is often as high as 95%. The mating season, or rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased <b>calling</b> <b>and</b> territorial behaviour. The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus.|$|E
5|$|The Sabor {{meets in}} public {{sessions}} in two periods; the first from 15 January to 30 June, {{and the second}} from 15 September to 15 December.

5|$|The black currawong is a {{loud and}} vocal species, {{and makes a}} variety of calls. Its main call is {{markedly}} different from the pied or grey currawongs and {{has been described as}} a combination of alternating kar and wheek sounds, killok killok, or even akin to part song and part human laughter. Although often noisy when flying in flocks, it can be silent when seeking prey or thieving food. Before or around dawn and at nightfall appear to be periods of increased <b>calling,</b> <b>and</b> birds are reported to be more vocal before rain or storms. Parents also make a long fluting whistle to summon their young.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, who applauded its instrumentation. It became a commercial success, charting {{in the top}} ten in the United States and Australia, and also charting in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. In 2001, the song was certified 2x Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and also became the most played radio track of that year in the United States. The official music video for the song premiered on Vh1.com on December 7, 2000. In the video, Wade is seen singing the lyrics of the song in many locations around a town. The band went on tours with Matchbox Twenty and 3 Doors Down as an opening act before going on their first headline tour that featured American rock band The <b>Calling</b> <b>and</b> American singer Michelle Branch.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease <b>calling</b> <b>and</b> become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E

25|$|Trogons are {{territorial}} and monogamous.
