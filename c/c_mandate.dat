In 1917, Japan had made secret agreements with Britain, France and Italy that guaranteed their annexation of these territories. With Britain, there was a mutual agreement, Japan also agreeing to support British annexation of the Pacific islands south of the equator. Despite a generally pro-Chinese view on behalf of the American delegation, Article 156 of the Treaty of Versailles transferred German concessions in Jiaozhou, China to Japan rather than returning sovereign authority to China. The leader of the Chinese delegation, Lou Tseng-Tsiang, demanded that a reservation be inserted before he would sign the treaty. The reservation was denied, and the treaty was signed by all the delegations except that of China. Chinese outrage over this provision led to demonstrations known as the May Fourth Movement.

40|$|At least 120 {{million of}} the world's {{children}} aged 5 to 14 worked full-time in 1995, most of them under hazardous, unhygienic conditions, for more than 10 hours a day. This is an old problem worldwide but particularly so in Third World countries in recent decades. What has changed, with globalization, is our awareness of these child laborers. (The International Labor Organization distinguishes between"child work,"which could include light household chores and could have some learning value, and"child labor,"a pejorative phrase.) By bringing together the main theoretical ideas, the author hopes to encourage both more theoretical research and empirical work with a better theoretical foundation. Among other things, the author observes that: a) The problem is most serious in Africa, where the child-labor participation rate is 26. 2 percent. The rate is 12. 8 percent in Asia. But since 1950, the trend is a decline in that participation rate worldwide. For most Latin American countries, the decline is notable but less marked than in Asia. In large parts of Africa, including Ethiopia, {{the problem has been}} extremely persistent, but even there the trend is downward. b) Child labor has not always been considered evil, and there is no consensus on why it began to decline. In some (not all) countries legislative acts declared it illegal, in some there were rules about compulsory education, and increasing prosperity generally made families less likely to experience poverty if their children weren't working. <b>c)</b> <b>Mandating</b> compulsory education is regarded as more effective than outlawing child labor, because attendance at school is easier to monitor, but some experts believe economic progress is the answer to the problem. The justification for many interventions is that the state is more concerned about the well-being of children than parents are; the author believes such an assumption to be wrong when child labor occurs as a mass phenomenon rather than as isolated abuse. The author argues that, in some economies, the market for labor may exhibit multiple equilibria, with one equilibrium having low adult wage and a high incidence of child labor and another equilibrium exhibiting high adult wage and no child labor. The model is used to provide a framework for analyzing the role of international labor standards.

This dissertation was meant to identify district practices and programs leading to improved Latino access to higher education. The research highlighted CVUSD does not have a comprehensive district strategy. The data also showed CVUSD has not increased Latino college matriculation rates and, in fact, the achievement gap between Latino and White students has further increased.; This dissertation has four main recommendations for unified school district leaders regarding Latino access to higher education: (a) mandate matriculation between district middle schools and high schools in areas of curriculum; (b) make district and school information easily accessible in Spanish for Latino families; (<b>c)</b> <b>mandate</b> programs across all high schools focusing on increasing Latino student achievement; (d) research practices of other unified school districts in improving Latino achievement; (e) increase strategy sharing in the district between school principals and faculty.; This study has four additional recommendations for school-site leaders within unified school districts: (a) increase Latino parent participation; (b) increase college information to Latino parents; (c) define college-readiness and provide teacher training; (d) define college-readiness and provide teacher training.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to explore factors and {{contexts}} that influenced and motivated individuals to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA, commonly called Obamacare, is also known as the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange (NMHIX). The study is specifically designed to examine the participants’ lived experiences and opinions regarding the acquisition, or opposition to health care insurance coverage. I have employed the hermeneutic phenomenological research methodology to conduct this study. Nine self-identified Hispanic residents of the San Miguel County (SMC) participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews. The research site for the current study was the SMC located in northern New Mexico (NM). The major findings in this study revealed the following response patterns: (a) participant’s memory of having health care insurance while growing up was divided among those that had health care insurance and those who did not have health care insurance or those who had state supported health care insurance such as Medicaid; (b) Trusted sources such as family and friends are methods that were used to obtain and learn about the NMHIX; (<b>c)</b> <b>Mandate</b> and penalty assessments for not having the health care insurance coverage was the number one motivational factor to enrolling in the NMHIX; (d) Participants had more negative experiences than positive in the enrollment process; (e) Nearly 90 % of the respondents felt they have benefited from having health care insurance coverage, and; (f) The findings revealed that if participants had the authority to change something with health care insurance coverage, participants would like co-payments and deductibles reduced or eliminated. The results of this research provide a venue to strengthen the implementation of the ACA. In addition, there may be the notion to rethink and systematize ideas that enable and support local communities to operate as health communication channels aiding citizens navigate the optimal use of health care insurance.

A 52 -year-old male patient with multiple atherogenic risk factors was admitted for non-healing pedal ulcer and absent distal pulses.

The saphenous vein graft was of satisfactory quality and the procedure went routinely. Acute graft thrombosis on postoperative day 0 was recognized immediately and prompted an emergent surgical revision. No technical errors or anatomical/mechanical causes for failed reconstruction were found and the graft was successfully thrombectomized using a Fogarty balloon-catheter. Graft rethrombosis, however, ensued after several hours. Considering the absence of threatening limb ischemia and the idiopathic recurrent thrombosis, raising suspicion of prothrombotic state, conservative treatment was pursued.

40|$|This paper adopts an epistemic {{community}} framework to explicate the dual role of epistemic communities as influencers of accounting policy within regulatory space and as implementers who effect change within {{the domain of}} accounting. The context is the adoption and implementation of fair value accounting within local government in New South Wales (NSW). The roles and functions of Australian local government are extensive, and include the development and maintenance of infrastructure, provision of recreational facilities, certain health and community services, buildings, cultural facilities, and in some cases, water and sewerage (Australian Local Government Association, 2009). The NSW state Department of Local Government (DLG) is responsible for legislation and policy development to ensure that local councils are able to deliver ‘quality services to their communities in a sustainable manner’ (DLG, 2008 c). These local councils receive revenue from various sources including property rates, government grants and user-pays service provision. In July 2006 the DLG issued Circular 06 - 453 to councils (DLG, 2006 <b>c),</b> <b>mandating</b> the staged adoption of fair value measurement of infrastructure assets. This directive followed the policy of NSW State Treasury (NSW Treasury, 2007), 4 and an independent inquiry into the financial sustainability of local councils (LGSA, 2006). It {{was an attempt to}} resolve the inconsistency in public sector asset valuation in NSW Local Governments, and to provide greater usefulness and comparability of financial statements. 5 The focus of this study is the mobilization of accounting change by the DLG within this wider political context. When a regulatory problem arises, those with political power seek advice from professionals with relevant skill and expertise (Potter, 2005). This paper explores the way in which professionals diffuse accounting ‘problems’ and the associated accounting solutions ‘across time and space’ (Potter, 2005, p. 277). The DLG’s fair value accounting policy emanated from a ‘regulatory space’ (Hancher and Moran, 1989) 6 as a result of negotiations between many parties, including accounting and finance professionals. Operating within the local government sector, these professionals were identified by the DLG as being capable of providing helpful input. They were also responsible for the implementation of the new olicy within local councils. Accordingly they have been dentified as an pistemic community with the ability to ranslate regulatory power by changing he domain of ccounting (Potter, 2005, p. 278). 7 The paper is organised as follows. The background to the LG’s decision to require the introduction of fair value accounting for infrastructure assets is explored. Following this, the method of the study is described, and the {{epistemic community}} framework outlined. In the next sections, evidence of the influencing and implementing roles of epistemic groups is provided. Finally, conclusions are drawn about the significance of these groups both within regulatory space in developing accounting regulation, and in embedding change within the domain of accounting...|$|R
