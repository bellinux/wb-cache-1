40|$|In {{the article}} the author {{considers}} {{a problem of}} an optimal way <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> during the pre-crisis period (deciding between ruble and foreign currency borrowings). It is obvious that {{during the period of}} stable economic growth, when currency pair rate (for example, ruble - USA dollar) doesn't change significntly, the lower interest rate <b>of</b> foreign <b>currency</b> loans makes them a cheaper way <b>of</b> <b>borrowing.</b> But during a crisis an abrupt growth <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> pair rate can make foreign currency loan a more expensive way <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> (as compared to ruble loan). The author suggests a scenario-based method of decision making about an optimal way <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> during a pre-crisis period, which affords to calculate a threshold meaning <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> pair rate, after which a foreign currency loan becomes more expensive. Application of the method is illustrated on the example of a situation in a telecommunication sector in Russian Federation during <b>currency</b> crisis <b>of</b> 2014. A detailed analysis if the situation in the sector in the last pre-crisis year (2013) is provided. Structures of debt burdens of the leading companies (Vimpelcom, MTS and Megafon) are considered. Percent shares <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> loans, shares <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> types and according interest rates are provided.

40|$|The {{demand for}} real M 2 in the Czech Republic is {{positively}} influenced by real output and {{negatively associated with}} the deposit rate, the koruna/euro exchange rate, and the euro interest rate. The coefficient of real output for the demand for real M 1 is insignificant. Hence, depreciation of the koruna or a higher euro interest rate would help raise Czech real output. The Box-Cox transformation test shows that the log-linear form for real M 1 and M 2 demand cannot be rejected at the 5 % level while the linear form for real M 1 and M 2 demand can be rejected at the 5 % level. The CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests show that parameters in the demand for both real M 1 and M 2 demand are stable. In comparison, real M 2 is a better monetary aggregate. wealth effect, stability tests, <b>currency</b> substitution, cost <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> effect, capital mobility effect, Box-Cox transformation...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{question}} of why a government would default on debt denominated in its own currency. Using a newly constructed dataset of 14 emerging markets, we document that the private sector continues to borrow from abroad in foreign currency while sovereigns increasingly borrow from foreigners in local currency. Because depreciation can be very costly for a corporate sector with a currency mismatch due to foreign currency liabilities, emerging market sovereigns may still prefer to default on local currency sovereign debt rather than inflate the debt away. Using our cross-country dataset, we show that a higher reliance on external foreign currency corporate financing is associated with a higher default risk on sovereign debt. We quantify the effects of corporate balance sheet mismatch on sovereign credit risk by introducing local currency sovereign debt and private currency mismatch into a standard sovereign debt model. The model demonstrates how the <b>currency</b> composition <b>of</b> corporate <b>borrowing</b> affects the sovereign’s incentive to inflate or default in times of fiscal stress. Reductions in the share of private external debt in foreign currency can lead to significant reductions in sovereign default risk. A calibration of the model generates the empirical patterns <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> and credit risk in local currency sovereign debt documented in Du and Schreger (2015) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how net income, non－performing loans, and operational fixed－assets of main bank {{are associated with}} the agency costs <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms. Results <b>of</b> this study indicate that the association between non－performing loans and the agency costs <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms is statistically positive and the association between operational fixed－assets and agency costs <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms is statistically negative. This implies that non－performing loans and operational fixed－assets of main bank are significantly associated with the agency costs <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms. Specifically, non－performing loans increase the agency costs <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms, whereas operational－fixed assets decrease the agency costs <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms. These results suggest that non－performing loans and operational fixed－assets are significantly associated with not only banks themselves but also the agency costs <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> firms.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} the choice between local and foreign currency debt by firms facing exchange rate risk and hedging possibilities in small open economies. The model shows that the <b>currency</b> composition <b>of</b> debt and the optimal level of hedging are both endogenously determined as optimal firms’ responses to a tradeoff between the lower cost <b>of</b> <b>borrowing</b> in foreign debt and the higher risk involved due to exchange rate uncertainty. Both debt composition and hedging depend on common factors such as foreign exchange risk and financial default, interest rates, the size of net worth and costs of exchange rate risk management. Results of the model are broadly consistent with lending and hedging behavior of the corporate sector in small open economies recently hit by a currency crisis. In particular, the model is able to explain why, unlike predictions of previous work in the literature <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> crisis, the collapse of the fixed exchange rate regime in Brazil in early 1999 did not cause a major change in the <b>currency</b> composition <b>of</b> debt and the hedging behavior of the corporate sector...|$|R
