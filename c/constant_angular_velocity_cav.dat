25|$|Data is {{generally}} written to floppy disks in sectors (angular blocks) and tracks (concentric rings {{at a constant}} radius). For example, the HD format of 3½-inch floppy disks uses 512 bytes per sector, 18 sectors per track, 80 tracks per side and two sides, {{for a total of}} 1,474,560 bytes per disk. Some disk controllers can vary these parameters at the user's request, increasing storage on the disk, although {{they may not be able}} to be read on machines with other controllers. For example, Microsoft applications were often distributed on 3½-inch 1.68 MB DMF disks formatted with 21 sectors instead of 18; they could still be recognized by a standard controller. On the IBM PC, MSX and most other microcomputer platforms, disks were written using a <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CAV)</b> format, with the disk spinning at a constant speed and the sectors holding the same amount of information on each track regardless of radial location.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{storage is}} {{important}} for many applications from hybrid vehicles to off-peak electric power to rotating machinery. A flywheel offers the combination of high energy density and high power density not attainable with other energy storage medium. In many situations, it is desirable to store energy at a <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity.</b> This work proposes a novel self-governing fluidic variable inertia flywheel that can maintain a <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> {{across a range of}} energy storage. The fluidic flywheel uses a piston to separate the liquid filled chamber from a chamber vented to atmosphere. A force balance is created on the piston due to the radial pressure gradient of the liquid reacted by a constant force spring. Energy added to the system is stored in equally two forms: increases the kinetic energy of the flywheel at a <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> and increasing the potential energy of the constant force spring. A design example demonstrates that the fluidic flywheel enables a <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> with an order of magnitude lower mass moment of inertia than a conventional flywheel. This promising technology enables a simple <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> energy storage system, yet requires future work in numerous areas. I...|$|R

50|$|Other {{factors that}} affect data storage density include: the {{existence}} of multiple layers of data on the disc, the method of rotation (Constant linear velocity (CLV), <b>Constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CAV),</b> or zoned-CAV), the composition of lands and pits, and how much margin is unused {{is at the center}} and the edge of the disc.|$|E

Very old CD-ROM drives read with a constant linear velocity (CLV) design, however (usually 12× or slower). Sega achieved the higher density by decreasing {{the speed of the}} disc to half and by letting the standard CD-ROM components read at the normal rate thus nearly doubling the disc's data density. This method allowed Sega to use cheaper off-the-shelf components when building the Dreamcast.|$|E
50|$|The GameCube Game Disc (DOL-006) is {{the game}} medium for the GameCube, created by Matsushita (Panasonic), and later {{extended}} for use on the Wii through backward compatibility. The GameCube Game Disc is a 1.5 GB, 8 cm miniDVD based technology which reads at a <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CAV).</b> It was chosen by Nintendo to prevent copyright infringement of its games, to reduce cost by avoiding licensing fees to the DVD Forum and to reduce loading times. This also prevents the consoles from being used as general DVD players.|$|E
50|$|A higher {{amount of}} precompensation {{is needed to}} write data in sectors that are closer {{to the center of}} the disk. In <b>{{constant}}</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CAV)</b> recording, in which the disk spins at a constant speed no matter where the data is written, the sectors closest to the spindle are packed tighter than the outer sectors and so require a slightly different timing to write the data in the most reliable way. CAV recording is used by most floppy disk systems and by older hard disk systems; the term CAV is not applicable to non-circular media, such as magnetic tapes. On magnetic tapes, precompensation is usually constant throughout the tape.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{recording}} media formats: cylinder records versus disc records. In 1877 Thomas Edison invented sound recording and reproduction using tinfoil {{wrapped around a}} pre-grooved cylinder, and in 1888 he introduced the wax [...] "Edison cylinder" [...] as the standard record format. In the 1890s Emile Berliner began marketing disc records and players. By the late 1890s cylinders and discs were in competition. Cylinders were more expensive to manufacture and the wax was fragile, but most cylinder players could make recordings. Discs saved space and were cheaper and sturdier, but due to the <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CAV)</b> of their rotation, the sound quality varied noticeably from the groove near the outer edge to the inner portion nearest the center; and disc record players could not make recordings.|$|E

5000|$|By {{increasing}} {{the speed at}} which the disc is spun, data can be transferred at greater rates. For example, a CD-ROM drive that can read at 8× speed spins the disc at 1600 to 4000 rpm, giving a linear velocity of 9.6 m/s and a transfer rate of 1200 KiB/s. Above 12× speed most drives read at <b>Constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CAV,</b> constant rpm) so that the motor is not made to change from one speed to another as the head seeks from place to place on the disc. In CAV mode the [...] "×" [...] number denotes the transfer rate at {{the outer edge of the}} disc, where it is a maximum.20× was thought to be the maximum speed due to mechanical constraints until Samsung Electronics introduced the SCR-3230, a 32x CD-ROM drive which uses a ball bearing system to balance the spinning disc in the drive to reduce vibration and noise. As of 2004, the fastest transfer rate commonly available is about 52× or 10,400 rpm and 7.62 MiB/s. Higher spin speeds are limited by the strength of the polycarbonate plastic of which the discs are made. At 52×, the linear velocity of the outermost part of the disk is around 65 m/s. However, improvements can still be obtained using multiple laser pickups as demonstrated by the Kenwood TrueX 72× which uses seven laser beams and a rotation speed of approximately 10×.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an adaptive-speed/CAV algorithm which regulates the disc velocity in a CD-ROM system to accomplish high data throughput (bit rate) during continuous playback and {{low power consumption}} during continuous data access. The adaptive-speed profile is based upon quasi-CLV control which allows drive optimisation towards both data throughput and access time. The presented algorithm can automatically distinguish between two operating modes-continuous access and continuous playback. By detecting the state of continuous access, the CD-ROM drive switches its spindle-motor loop into a <b>constant</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> (<b>CAV)</b> mode, avoiding therefore the acceleration/braking of the motor, and thus reducing the power consumption. By detecting the state of continuous playback, the spindle motor will be set to follow an adaptive-speed profile which is highly optimized for data transfer rate.
