5000|$|The X-Canceled-By: {{convention}} {{states that}} the operator of a <b>cancelbot</b> should provide a consistent, valid, and actively monitored contact email address for their <b>cancelbot</b> in the X-Canceled-By: header, both to identify the canceler, {{and to provide a}} point of contact in case something goes wrong or questions arise regarding the cancelbot's operations.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} uses of a <b>cancelbot</b> was by microbiology professor Richard DePew, to remove anonymous postings in science newsgroups. Perhaps the most well known early <b>cancelbot</b> was used in June 1994 by Arnt Gulbrandsen within minutes of the first post of Canter & Siegel's second spam wave, as it was created in response to their [...] "Green Card spam" [...] in April 1994.Usenet spammers have alleged that cancelbots are a tool of the mythical Usenet cabal.|$|E

Starting in 1995, large numbers of rogue cancels were posted to the newsgroup by a <b>cancelbot</b> dubbed [...] "Cancelbunny", mainly against critical articles containing portions of the [...] "Advanced Technology" [...] documents. To counteract this, other programs were used to repost the canceled articles. In parallel with this, floods of articles containing excerpts of publicly available Church of Scientology material were spammed to the newsgroup. (In a nine-day period in May 1996, an estimated 20,000 messages were sent.) ...|$|E
