500|$|The company touted Cosby's {{education}} and rapport with adults and children. The campaign {{was aimed at}} parents, rather than children, as was the campaign for the Commodore 64. [...] Cosby was {{the face of a}} mystery rebate program, offering reimbursements of between $3 and $1,000. J. Fred Bucy, who was head of Texas Instruments' home <b>computer</b> <b>operation</b> in 1983, scrapped Cosby's advertisements to focus on the product's educational value. Radio Shack vice-president of marketing David Beckerman said, [...] "A celebrity draws attention to the product. Even if we had President Reagan on our ads, we wouldn't sell any more computers. A product sells itself. A celebrity causes indirect sales." [...] Cosby, along with entrepreneur James Bruce Llewellyn, bought stock in a Philadelphia Coca-Cola bottler in 1983 as part of the company's push to increase African American participation in the company. This was, in part, a response to pressure by Jesse Jackson's PUSH campaign.|$|E
