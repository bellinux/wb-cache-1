Eyewitnesses also denied being warned by the police, saying that if they had known of the police presence then women and <b>children</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Many Flemish {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} eastern England during the 12th century, {{and they were}} persecuted after Henry II became king in 1154; {{a large number of}} them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the Battle of Fornham fought between Henry II and Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. Paul Harris has suggested that the green children's Flemish parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of Fornham St Martin, slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds, where a settlement of Flemish fullers existed at that time. They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit. Disoriented, bewildered, and dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes, the <b>children</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> presented a very strange spectacle to the Woolpit villagers. The children's colour could be explained by green sickness, the result of a dietary deficiency. Brian Haughton considers Harris's explanation to be plausible, and the one most widely accepted, although not without its difficulties. For instance, he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man like Richard de Calne would not have recognised the language spoken by the children as being Flemish.|$|E
5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the <b>children</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E

The main bed is an oak box bed dating to 1712, obtained from Star House in Baldersdale in 1962. Originally a defensive house in its own right, the lower level of the Old House is an undercroft, or vaulted basement chamber, with 1.5 metre thick walls - in times of attack the original tenant family would have retreated here with their valuables, although in its later use as the farm managers house, it is now presented as a storage and work room, housing a large wooden cheese press.

500|$|Sherwood also infused {{her works}} with {{political}} and social messages dear to evangelicals during the teens and twenties, such as the crucial role of missions, the value of charity, the evils of slavery {{and the necessity of}} Sabbath observance. She wrote Biblically based introductions to astronomy and ancient history so that <b>children</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> Christian textbooks. As Cutt argues, [...] "the intent of these (as indeed of all Evangelical texts) was to offset the deistic tendency to consider knowledge an end in itself." [...] Sherwood also revised classic children's books to make them appropriately religious, such as Sarah Fielding's The Governess (1749). [...] Sherwood's efforts to make religion more palatable through children's fiction were not always regarded favorably by the entire evangelical community; The Evangelical Magazine harshly reviewed her Stories Explanatory of the Church Catechism (1817), complaining that it was overly reliant on exciting fictional tales to convey its religious message.|$|E

500|$|The Sutherland Room lies at {{the rear}} east wing {{of the house and}} was once the bedroom of the Earl of Althorp in the first few centuries of the house when it was fashionable for the {{occupants}} to sleep on the ground floor and guests to sleep on the first floor. This was still the case during the Holland restoration, and as a result the room was ignored, so it retains many of the earlier mouldings not seen in many other parts of the house. It contains two fireplaces made by John Vardy and James Stuart which were originally situated in Spencer House, and the room has the original 17th-century cornice. The paintings in the room were selected by the current owner Charles Spencer to honour John, Third Earl Spencer and his passion for foxhunting. After it ceased usage as a bedroom, on special occasions the room would be full of life; on Christmas Day the room would be [...] "transformed into a Christmas fairyland, with clockwork Santas, snowmen and angels all spinning and chiming in the candlelight".

500|$|In 1939, the British {{government}} had drawn up evacuation {{plans for the}} British and other European residents of Hong Kong, which was a Crown colony of the United Kingdom (UK) at the time. [...] The War Office by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff thought the city would inevitably fall to Japanese forces {{in the event of}} an attack, so it should not be reinforced with more defensive forces. [...] The presence of a large number of British women and <b>children</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been an [...] "embarrassment" [...] for the government when the Japanese forces take Hong Kong, and additionally it was thought the internment of thousands of British civilians would cause unnecessary suffering and serve the Japanese as propaganda material. In July 1940, the colonial government of Hong Kong received orders from the UK to proceed with the evacuations. [...] By 3 August, all service families and registered non-service British women and children were moved to the Philippines. However, the hurried compulsory evacuations prompted criticism from many evacuees, their husbands, and their employees, who felt the evacuations were premature and unnecessary. According to Bernice Archer and Kent Fedorowich, respectively of the University of Essex and the University of the West of England, the local Chinese population were angered by their exclusion from the evacuations and condemned the plans as racist. Additionally, the plans excluded British passport holders who were not of European ancestry. Amidst the criticism, the government subsequently made the evacuations non-compulsory. [...] Existing evacuations already ordered were cancelled provided evacuees volunteered for [...] roles, such as nursing or administrative work.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Museum Board {{was looking to}} have more museums in Newcastle and thought the Holy Jesus Hospital could be used. The fact that the {{building}} had stood empty for decades meant that {{the condition of the}} building had suffered greatly. The restoration cost Â£67,000, the money coming from the John George Joicey bequest and a new roof was needed. During the restoration some of the original fabric of the building such as door frames, doors and walls on the top floor were lost. In 1970 John George Joicey Museum opened. During this time the soup kitchens were joined to the Holy Jesus Hospital. The first floor rooms were used for teaching the history of Newcastle from the Roman period to the present date. There were period rooms illustrating living styles from the early Stuart to late Victorian periods. Much of the collection was donated by bequest by John George Joicey, a Gateshead businessman and owner of the mining company James Joicey & Co. ltd, and after whom the museum was named. Joicey was also a prominent donor to the Laing Art Gallery. The tower of the hospital had the Alnwick Armoury and the Shotley Bridge Sword makers displays on the first and second floors. The Shotley Bridge Sword makers were sword makers and knifemakers from Solingen, Germany who settled in Shotley Bridge, Durham, in 1690. [...] The soup kitchen was mainly used as a Victorian schoolroom where children were dressed and taught as Victorian <b>children</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been. There were also audio-visual presentations that illustrated the Tyne Flood of 1771 and the Great Fire of 1854. Part of the museum was devoted to the Northumberland Hussars and the 15th and 19th Regiments of the King's Royal Hussars. The museum's location combined with the cityâ€™s underpasses and roads system made access to the museum difficult and it was little visited.|$|E

2500|$|United Kingdom: The UK {{introduced}} universal BCG immunization in 1953, {{and until}} July 2005, the UK policy was to immunize all school children between 10 and 14 years of age, and all neonates born into high-risk groups. The injection was given only once during an individual's lifetime (as {{there is no}} evidence of additional protection from more than one vaccination). BCG was also given to protect people who had been exposed to tuberculosis. [...] The peak of tuberculosis incidence is in adolescence and early adulthood, and the MRC trial showed efficacy lasted a maximum of 15 years. Routine immunization with BCG for all school children was scrapped in July 2005 because of falling cost-effectiveness: whereas in 1953, 94 <b>children</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be immunized to prevent one case of TB, by 1988, the annual incidence of TB in the UK had fallen so much, 12,000 <b>children</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be immunized to prevent one case of TB.

2500|$|Although some popular {{histories}} of Halloween have characterized trick-or-treating {{as an adult}} invention to re-channel Halloween activities away from Mischief Night vandalism, {{there are very few}} records supporting this. Des Moines, Iowa is the only area known to have a record of trick-or-treating being used to deter crime. Elsewhere, adults, as reported in newspapers from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s, typically saw it as a form of extortion, with reactions ranging from bemused indulgence to anger. Likewise, as portrayed on radio shows, <b>children</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to explain what trick-or-treating was to puzzled adults, and not the other way around.

[...] The National Confectioners Association reported in 2005 that 80 percent of adults in the United States planned to give out confectionery to trick-or-treaters, and that 93 percent of children, teenagers, and young adults planned to go trick-or-treating or participating in other Halloween activities.|$|E
