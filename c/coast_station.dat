5|$|To be {{completed}} by 2030, the 1.6-kilometre extension will run from Punggol through Punggol North including the new Punggol Downtown. The extension is for future residents in Punggol North to have train access to the city centre {{as well as other}} parts of Singapore. On 7 June 2017, it was announced by Second Minister for Transport Ng Chee Meng that the North-East Line extension will open in 2023 instead, a few years ahead of the expected opening date. The single station extension will span 1.6km and will serve the future Punggol North area.

25|$|The Telegraphy Administration {{proposed}} in 1913 that all ship radios should be {{operated by the}} agency. Motivations included a desire to accelerate installation of such systems, difficulties controlling systems, which {{was at the time}} a problem with shortcomings on private telephone networks, and to avoid private monopolies. The proposal was dismissed by the government For the <b>coast</b> <b>stations</b> there were no proposals of permitting private installations. Funding was kept down, as it was competing with grants to expand the telephony network. Lack of <b>coast</b> <b>stations</b> caused ship-owners to not install ship radios, which again caused the authorities to down-prioritize construction of <b>coast</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{establishment}} of relayed VHF stations proved {{the reliability of}} unmanned stations, and the Telecommunications Administration started a process to unman the least trafficked coast radio stations. Proposals of remote controlling stations often resulted in a heated local debate, in part caused by the press claiming that the stations would be closed instead of simply moving the employees. One {{of the advantages of}} remote controlling was that instead of having one person on duty, there would be two, of which one person would be a dedicated emergency transmission listener and one would handle other correspondence. In smaller stations there was only one employee for both tasks. An often-used argument against unmanning was that the operators had local knowledge. Operators were often {{from other parts of the}} country and typically did not have sufficient local knowledge for their section of the coastline for it to make a difference. Search and rescue operations would always be coordinated by the police and not the <b>coast</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
