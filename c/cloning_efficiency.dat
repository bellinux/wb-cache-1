40|$|AbstractThe {{seamless}} ligation cloning extract (SLiCE) {{method is}} a novel seamless DNA cloning tool that utilizes homologous recombination activities in Escherichia coli cell lysates to assemble DNA fragments into a vector. Several laboratory E. coli strains {{can be used as}} a source for the SLiCE extract; therefore, the SLiCE-method is highly cost-effective. The SLiCE has sufficient cloning ability to support conventional DNA cloning, and can simultaneously incorporate two unpurified DNA fragments into vector. Recently, many seamless DNA cloning kits have become commercially available; these are generally very convenient, but expensive. In this study, we evaluated the <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiencies</b> between a simple and highly cost-effective SLiCE-method and a commercial kit under various molar ratios of insert DNA fragments to vector DNA. This assessment identified that the SLiCE from a laboratory E. coli strain yielded 30 − 85 % of the colony formation rate of a commercially available seamless DNA cloning kit. The <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of both methods were highly effective, exhibiting over 80 % success rate under all conditions examined. These results suggest that SLiCE from a laboratory E. coli strain can efficiently function as an effective alternative to commercially available seamless DNA cloning kits...|$|R
50|$|As it is {{previously}} explained, Musashi2 {{is part of}} {{a family}} of RNA-binding proteins. It belongs to the RNA-processing group of proteins which are associated with the transcription factor SOX2 during the early stages of differentiation. Sox2 is known to be essential during embryogenesis and in the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. This RNA-binding protein has a high influence on it too, since the gain or loss of self-renewal capacity and the extent of differentiation depends on Msi2 levels.Although both of the isoforms of this protein are needed to the maintenance of the self-renewal, they are different on a functional way and they play different roles in some aspects of the process. For example, only isoform 1 expression is related to the <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency</b> of embryonic stem cells.|$|E

Here, 13620 cloned embryos derived from excellent pigs were transferred into 79 surrogate gilts, and 119 live cloned piglets were eventually generated. During cloning, group of cloned embryos derived from excellent Landrace or Large white pigs presented no significant differences of cleavage and blastocyst rates, blastocyst cell numbers, surrogate pregnancy and delivery rates, average numbers of piglets born and alive and cloning efficiencies, and group of 101 - 150, 151 - 200 or 201 - 250 cloned embryos transferred per surrogate also displayed a similar developmental efficiency. When estrus stage of surrogate gilts was compared, group of embryo transfer on Day 2 of estrus showed significantly higher pregnancy rate, delivery rate, average number of piglets born, average alive piglet number or <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency</b> than group on Day 1, Day 3, Day 4 or Day 5, respectively (P< 0. 05). And, {{in comparison with the}} preovulation and postovulation groups, group of surrogate gilts during periovulation displayed a significantly higher overall <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency</b> (P< 0. 05). Further investigation of surrogate estrus stage and ovulation status displayed that ovulation status was the real factor underlying estrus stage to determine the overall <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency.</b> And more, follicle puncture for preovulation, not transfer position shallowed for preovulation or deepened for postovulation, significantly improved the average number of piglets alive and <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency</b> (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Impaired {{development}} of embryos produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is mostly associated with faulty reprogramming of the somatic nucleus to a totipotent state {{and can be}} improved by treatment with epigenetic modifiers. Here we report that addition of 100 μM vitamin C (VitC) to embryo culture medium for at least 16 h post-activation significantly increases mouse blastocyst formation and, when combined {{with the use of}} latrunculin A (LatA) during micromanipulation and activation procedures, also development to term. In spite of this, no significant effects on pluripotency (OCT 4 and NANOG) or nuclear reprogramming markers (H 3 K 14 acetylation, H 3 K 9 methylation and DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation) could be detected. The use of LatA alone significantly improved in vitro development, but not full-term development. On the other hand, the simultaneous treatment of cloned embryos with VitC and the histone deacetylase inhibitor psammaplin A (PsA), in combination with the use of LatA, resulted in <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiencies</b> equivalent to those of VitC or PsA treatments alone, and the effects on pluripotency and nuclear reprogramming markers were less evident than when only the PsA treatment was applied. These results suggest that although both epigenetic modifiers improve <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> possibly through different mechanisms, they do not show an additive effect when combined. Improvement of SCNT efficiency is essential for its applications in reproductive and therapeutic cloning, and identification of molecules which increase this efficiency should facilitate studies on the mechanism of nuclear reprogramming and acquisition of totipotency...|$|R

In addition, IL- 4 can enhance CTL {{activity}} in MLC, but blocks IL- 2 induced lymphokine activated killer cell activity in PBL. In our study, the <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> Ag-specific CTL activity and non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity of CTL clones generated in IL- 2 were compared to those generated in IL- 4. In a first experiment, T cells were stimulated with the EBV-transformed B cell line JY and cloned 7 days later with feeder cells and either IL- 2 or IL- 4. In a second experiment, stimulation of the T cells was carried out in the presence of IL- 2 plus anti-IL- 4 antibodies or IL- 4 plus anti-IL- 2 antibodies in order to block the effects of IL- 4 and IL- 2, respectively, produced by the feeder cells. Although the <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in the second experiment were lower than those obtained in the first experiment, the <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiencies</b> obtained with IL- 2 or IL- 4 were similar in both experiments. The overall proportion of TCR alpha beta+ T cell clones cytotoxic for the stimulator cell JY established in IL- 2 or IL- 4 were comparable. A striking difference between the clones obtained in IL- 2 or IL- 4 was that {{a large proportion of the}} clones obtained in IL- 4 expressed CD 4 and CD 8 simultaneously, whereas none of the clones isolated in IL- 2 were double positive. Also gamma delta+ T cell clones could be established with IL- 4 as a growth factor. TCR gamma delta+ T cell clones isolated in either IL- 2 or IL- 4 were CD 4 -CD 8 - or CD 4 -CD 8 +, but the proportion of CD 4 -CD 8 + clones isolated in IL- 4 was higher. Interestingly, one TCR gamma delta+ clone isolated in IL- 2 was CD 4 +CD 8 -. Most of the TCR alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ CTL-clones isolated in IL- 2 lysed the NK cell sensitive target cell K 562. In contrast, only a small proportion of the TCR alpha beta+ or TCR gamma delta+ CTL clones isolated in IL- 4, lysed K 562.

We previously demonstrated that approximately 1 out of 40 Lin 2 Sca- 1 + CD 49 f high (LSC) prostate basal epithelial cells possess the capacities of stem cells for self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. We show here that treating LSC cells with the ROCK kinase inhibitor Y- 27632 increases their <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency</b> by 8 fold in an in vitro prostate colony assay. Y- 27632 treatment allows prostate colony cells to replate efficiently, which does not occur otherwise. Y- 27632 also increases the <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency</b> of prostate stem cells in a prostate sphere assay and a dissociated prostate cell regeneration assay. The increased <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency</b> is due to the suppression of the dissociation-induced, RhoA/ROCK activation-mediated apoptosis of prostate stem cells.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has indicated that growth factors {{play an important role in}} normal and malignant cell growth. Previous work in this laboratory established that RPMI- 2650, a cell line derived from a human carcinoma, produces growth factors including TGF-a, TGF- 3 and an autocrine factor. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate whether growth factor production is a property of all cells, or of a sub-population of cells. If high-producer clones were available it would greatly facilitate production of material for purification and characterisation. In order to answer this question it was necessary to isolate clones of RPMI- 2650. A number of experimental variables were examined, with the objective of improving <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Initially, basic parameters related to the environment of the cells were examined : The use of a basal medium consisting of DMEM:HamsF 12 (1 : 1) gave a higher <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency</b> then MEM or DME. Choice of a suitable batch of serum was very important, and serum concentration was important in determining the size of the colonies. It was also found that trypsinizing cells at 4 °C gave better cloning efficiencies than trypsinization at 37 °C. On the other hand, use of gas atmosphere with reduced oxygen tension caused a decrease in <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Feeder cells proved to be of considerable significance. The use of mitomycin C-treated feeder cells consistently improved the <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency</b> of RPMI- 2650 cells; Mouse 3 T 3 or human RPMI- 2650 cells were both effective as feeders. Use of RPMI- 2650 conditioned medium and pre-coating of culture dishes with DEAE dextran gave a marginal improvement in <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Transfer of cells from the initial clone to a larger growth area proved difficult. This problem was largely overcome by a procedure involving transfer of cells to a small volume of medium (in 96 -well microplates) following trypsinization using a cloning ring. Using this improved procedure, twenty independent clones of RPMI- 2650 were isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Many of the clones appeared morphologically distinct from one another. Fourteen of the clones were examined for <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiency</b> in monolayer and agar, and for production of TGF-a, TGF- 3 and autocrine factors. Considerable variation between clones was observed in all of these properties. All clones examined, however, produced significant amounts of growth factors. It was concluded that growth factor production is not a property confined to a small sub-population of RPMI- 2650 cells in culture. The techniques developed in this thesis should facilitate future work in preparing clonal populations of human cancer cells. The finding that TGF-a and TGF-S production is a general property of the carcinoma cells studied, rather than a property of a sub-population, suggests that production of these growth factors may be related in some way to the process of carcinogenesis...|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{a number of}} developmentally regulated transcription factors for expression in Merkel cells and MCC cell lines and demonstrated that their expression patterns may be prognostic in MCC. We have shown that human Merkel cells from adult scalp hair follicle and from neonatal foreskin epidermal sheets express Brn- 3 c and HATH 1. In addition, results demonstrate that the novel Merkel binding activity complex MNF contains Brn- 3 c. Moreover, Classic lines which retain neuroendocrine phenotype, are slow growing in culture, grow in suspension and {{are thought to be}} less aggressive, retain Brn- 2, Brn- 3 c and HATH 1 expression, whereas Variant suspension lines which no longer express NE markers retain Brn- 2 and Brn- 3 c expression, but lack HATH 1. Further, Type IV Variant lines which grow as adherent monolayers have shorter doubling times, are more radiation- resistant and have higher <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in soft agar, all thought to be indicative of aggressive tumours, have reduced or no Brn- 2 proteins and lack expression of Brn- 3 c and HATH 1 transcription factors.

40|$|The {{isolation}} of carbohydrate variants from cultures of HeLa and conjunctival cells was described. Factors {{inherent in the}} cell culture system, such as parent populations and dialyzed serums, {{have been shown to}} influence the outcome of variant isolations. Established stable variants incorporated significantly more pentoses or lactate into various cell fractions than the parent cultures. Besides their abilities to propagate continuously in the selecting environments, the variants multiplied slower, were more susceptible to sub-zero preservation and the cytotoxic effect of D- 2 -deoxyglucose, showed lower <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and were less susceptible to the deleterious effect of glucose oxidase. The ribose variants also differed from the parent cultures in morphological appearance such as formation of multinucleated cells and ring-shaped colonies. They converted more ribose into other component sugars of mucopolysaccharides than the parent cultures. Preliminary analyses of the mucopolysaccharides extracted from the ribose variants and parent cultures showed large difference in their carbohydrate (Molisch-positive materials) and DNA ratios. Evidence suggests that a sequence of interrelated events from genetic selection to primitive morphogenesis has been established...|$|R
40|$|Adult {{stem cells}} {{represent}} unique populations of undifferentiated cells with self-renewal capacity. In many tissues, stem cells divide {{less often than}} their progeny. It has been widely speculated, but largely untested, that their undifferentiated and quiescent state may make stem cells more efficient as donors for cloning by nuclear transfer (NT). Here, we report the use of nuclei from hair follicle stem cells and other skin keratinocytes as NT donors. When keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs) were used as NT donors, 19 liveborn mice were obtained, 9 of which survived to adulthood. Embryonic keratinocytes and cumulus cells also gave rise to cloned mice. Although <b>cloning</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were similar (< 6 % per transferred blastocyst), success rates were consistently higher for males than for females. Adult keratinocyte stem cells were better NT donors than so-called transit amplifying (TA) keratinocytes in both sexes (1. 6 % vs. 0 % in females and 5. 4 % vs. 2. 8 % in males). Our findings reveal skin {{as a source of}} readily accessible stem cells, the nuclei of which can be reprogrammed to the pluripotent state by exposure to the cytoplasm of unfertilized oocytes...|$|R
