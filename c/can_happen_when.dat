Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E

25|$|Some synthetases also mediate a editing {{reaction}} to ensure high fidelity of tRNA charging. If the incorrect tRNA is added (aka. the tRNA {{is found to}} be improperly charged), the aminoacyl-tRNA bond is hydrolyzed.

25|$|Sometimes, females {{choose not}} to {{struggle}} and simply acquiesce to forceful matings. This <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> they decide {{that the cost of}} resisting would be greater than the cost of mating. They use submission to avoid further harassment or aggression, which could end in death or injury. This is often seen in primate species, such as chimpanzees and hamadryas baboons.|$|E
50|$|Competition {{for food}} or space while the salmon {{are in their}} lake {{residence}} period <b>can</b> exist.

It <b>can</b> also <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> resources are in short supply. Interspecific competition can also occur and can lead to interactive segregation, which is when species emphasize their differences in diet and habitat to avoid competition. Interspecific competition can affect the growth rates of the salmon if their access to resources is limited.|$|R

25|$|An unintentional denial-of-service {{can occur}} when a system ends up denied, {{not due to}} a {{deliberate}} attack by a single individual or group of individuals, but simply due to a sudden enormous spike in popularity. This <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> an extremely popular website posts a prominent link to a second, less well-prepared site, for example, {{as part of a}} news story. The result is that a significant proportion of the primary site's regular userspotentially hundreds of thousands of peopleclick that link {{in the space of a}} few hours, having the same effect on the target website as a DDoS attack.

25|$|Psychologist Daniel Wegner {{has argued}} that an introspection {{illusion}} contributes to belief in psychokinesis. He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the underlying neural mechanisms are outside awareness. Hence, though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own free will, the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory of apparent mental causation acknowledges the influence of David Hume's view of the mind. This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an illusion of control. This <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> <b>when</b> an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link. As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on magical thinking in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a basketball player taking a series of free throws. When they were instructed to visualize him making his shots, they {{felt that they had}} contributed to his success. Other experiments designed to create an illusion of psychokinesis have demonstrated that this depends, to some extent, on the subject's prior belief in psychokinesis.|$|E

500|$|After {{a two-month}} courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had {{met on the}} set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a {{relationship}} at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997). As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, [...] "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common.
