40|$|The Solid Rocket Motor Witness Test was {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} potential for using thermal infrared imagery {{as a tool for}} monitoring static tests of solid rocket motors. The project consisted of several parts: data acquisition, data analysis, and interpretation. For data acquisition, thermal infrared data were obtained of the DM- 9 test of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Motor on December 23, 1987, at Thiokol, Inc. test facility near Brigham City, Utah. The data analysis portion consisted of processing the video tapes of the test to produce values of temperature at representative test points on the rocket motor surface as the motor cooled down following the test. Interpretation included formulation of a numerical model and evaluation of some of the conditions of the motor which could be extracted from the data. These parameters included estimates <b>of</b> the <b>insulation</b> remaining following the tests and the thickness <b>of</b> the <b>charred</b> layer <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> {{at the end of the}} test. Also visible was a temperature signature of the star grain pattern in the forward motor segment...|$|R
40|$|Further {{development}} of a two-dimensional thermal analysis code (G 2 DHeat) to include internal decomposition and <b>charring</b> ablation <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> materials is presented. An overview of the structural changes made to the program code by implementing an implicit solution routine, including source term is given, before testing and verification of accuracy is performed. A kinetic model for decomposition reactions, as well as routines for handling the generated gas from the decomposition reactions, changes concerning the material properties and erosion of surface material are implemented and explained. Comparisons of results are made with similar results obtained by commercial programs. Possible reasons affecting the results are pointed out, before additional comparisons with experimentally observed measurements are performed. Based on the simulated results it is concluded that {{a great deal of}} testing remains for proper validation of the program. How to include better boundary conditions for simulating charring ablation is suggested and recommended for further {{development of}} the program. </p...|$|R

Coatesville residents began packing their suitcases and keeping them by their front doors so they can leave town at a moment's notice; at least one resident had her children sleep fully dressed in the same room, in case she had to gather {{them up in the}} middle of the night. One resident told the city council, [...] "Every night, you wonder if tonight's the night your porch is going to be set on fire."

They say, 'If someone is on my front porch, God help them.'" [...] Coatesville fire chief Kevin Johnson described the arsons as [...] "a form of terrorism" [...] and The New York Times said of Coatesville during the time: [...] "With its desolate streets and boarded-up row houses, the city feels like a place whose will has slipped away. ...

40|$|Assembly joints {{of modern}} solid-rocket motor cases are usually sealed with {{conventional}} O-ring seals. The 5500 F combustion gases produced by rocket motors are kept {{a safe distance}} away from the seals by thick layers <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> and by special compounds that fill assembly split-lines in the insulation. On limited occasions, NASA has observed <b>charring</b> <b>of</b> the primary O-rings {{of the space shuttle}} solid-rocket nozzle-assembly joints due to parasitic leakage paths opening up in the gap-fill compounds during rocket operation. Thus, solid-rocket motor manufacturer Thiokol approached the NASA Lewis Research Center about the possibility of applying Lewis braided-fiber preform seal as a thermal barrier to protect the O-ring seals. This thermal barrier would be placed upstream of the primary O-rings in the nozzle-to-case joints to prevent hot gases from impinging on the O-ring seals (see the following illustration). The illustration also shows joints 1 through 5, which are potential sites where the thermal barrier could be used...|$|R

From {{the perspective of}} the cryogenics systems, {{foam insulation}} is feasible. Feasibility is based on the criteria of a total heat load to the internal cooling coils of 4000 W or less.

The second set <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> option considers that the vessel dimensions can be increased. In this case, 18 inches <b>of</b> <b>insulation</b> are applied along with a shield.
