40|$|Surface antigens on hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) enable {{prospective}} isolation and characterization. Here, we compare the cell-surface phenotype of hematopoietic repopulating cells from murine yolk sac, aorta-gonad-mesonephros, placenta, fetal liver, and bone marrow {{with that of}} HSCs derived from the in vitro differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (ESC-HSCs). Whereas c-Kit marks all HSC populations, CD 41, CD 45, <b>CD</b> 34, <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 150 were developmentally regulated: the earliest embryonic HSCs express <b>CD</b> 41 <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 34 <b>and</b> lack <b>CD</b> 45 <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 150, whereas more mature HSCs lack <b>CD</b> 41 <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 34 <b>and</b> express <b>CD</b> 45 <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 150. ESC-HSCs express <b>CD</b> 41 <b>and</b> <b>CD</b> 150, lack <b>CD</b> 34, <b>and</b> are heterogeneous for CD 45. Finally, although CD 48 was absent from all in vivo HSCs examined, ESC-HSCs were heterogeneous {{for the expression of}} this molecule. This unique phenotype signifies a developmentally immature population of cells with features of both primitive and mature HSC. The prospective fractionation of ESC-HSCs will facilitate studies of HSC maturation essential for normal functional engraftment in irradiated adults...|$|R

40|$|Background: CT-P 13, {{the first}} biosimilar {{monoclonal}} antibody to infliximab (IFX), {{has been confirmed}} to be efficacious in inducing remission in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of CT-P 13 therapy in Crohn’s disease (<b>CD)</b> <b>and</b> ulcerative colitis (UC), and to identify predictors of sustained clinical response during a 54 -week CT-P 13 treatment period. Patients and methods: Patients with <b>CD</b> <b>and</b> UC, who were administered CT-P 13, were prospectively enrolled. Clinical response was assessed at week 14 and week 54. Predictive factors for disease outcome at week 54 were evaluated. Results: 57 <b>CD</b> <b>and</b> 57 UC patients were included; 55 <b>CD</b> <b>and</b> 49 UC patients completed the induction therapy <b>and</b> 50 <b>CD</b> <b>and</b> 46 UC patients completed the 54 -week treatment period. Clinical remission was achieved in 65. 5 % of <b>CD</b> <b>and</b> 75. 5 % of UC patients at week 14. Rate of continuous clinical response was 51 % in both <b>CD</b> <b>and</b> UC at week 54. None of the examined parameters were predictive to the clinical outcome neither in CD, nor in UC. Conclusion: This study confirmed the long-term efficacy and safety of CT-P 13 therapy in IBD.
