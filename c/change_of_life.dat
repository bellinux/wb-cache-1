[...] "I knew Miss Pellissier in Paris at the 'Ambassador's,' and I know her now, but I am convinced {{that there is some}} mystery in connexion with her <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> She is curiously altered in many ways.

60|$|A {{few days}} after the {{interview}} noticed in the last chapter, Lord George Bentinck returned to Welbeck. Some there were who thought him worn by the exertions of the session, and that an unusual pallor had settled upon that mantling and animated countenance. He himself never felt in better health or was ever in higher spirits, and greatly enjoyed the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and that change to a scene so dear to him.|$|E

60|$|In all, five vessels {{were seized}} and plundered while lying at Darien. All was not, however, going well; for while they lay there, a terrible {{sickness}} broke out among them. Whether this {{was from the}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> or from any noxious thing which they ate, or merely from the heat, none could say; but, very shortly, the illness made great ravages among them. First died Charles Clift, one of the quartermasters.|$|E
60|$|Emma shed indignant tears, and {{protested that}} it was cruel to bring up his past faults; talked of the Christian duty of {{forgiving}} the returning sinner; and when Lady Elizabeth showed that he had very recently been engaged in his usual courses, Theresa, with a sensible face and reasonable voice, argued that ordinary minds could not enter into {{the power of the}} Church's work, and adduced many cases of equally sudden <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{there came}} forth a summons for Mr. Stand-fast (this Mr. Stand-fast was he whom the pilgrims found upon {{his knees in}} the Enchanted Ground), for the {{messenger}} brought it him open in his hands; the contents thereof were, that he must prepare for a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> for his Master was not willing {{that he should be}} so far from Him any longer.

60|$|He {{looked about}} {{in that very}} place for his own image, but another man stood in his {{accustomed}} corner, and, though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch.

60|$|The <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> {{was great}} indeed; the marquis had thrown {{himself into the}} thick of all that was going on, and his salon was crowded every evening {{with those of the}} nobility who still {{remained}} In Paris. But he was regarded as by no means a man of extreme views, and many {{of the leaders of the}} party of the Gironde with whose names Harry was familiar were also frequent visitors--Roland, Vergniaud, Lanjuinais, Brissot, Guader, Lebrun, and Condorcer.|$|E
60|$|Although the Pathfinder did {{not dare}} to look at Mabel while he made this direct allusion to his <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> he {{would have given the}} world to know whether she was listening, and what was the {{expression}} of her countenance.

60|$|Charles {{did not say}} so, but Mart {{knew that}} he was lumped among the other poverty-stricken, {{worthless}} members of the family.

[...] "Sprout," [...] quoth the man, [...] "what's this you tell us?

6000|$|... 'I trust, sir,' rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, with decent resignation, 'it is not {{necessary}} that you should do anything of that kind.

60|$|It is {{needless to}} {{multiply}} these instances; enough {{has been said}} to justify the statement that, {{in view of the}} immense diversity of known animal and vegetable forms, and the enormous lapse of time indicated by the accumulation of fossiliferous strata, the only circumstance to be wondered at is, not that the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> as exhibited by positive evidence, have been so great but that they have been so small.|$|R
60|$|The {{survival}} of childhood, in the mature human being, betrays itself most readily {{in the sex}} that bears children.

60|$|I had still, however, some {{advantages}} in my favor. In {{spite of my}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> I retained that indescribable something which always distinguishes the gentleman; that something which dwells in a man's air and deportment, and not in his clothes; and which it is as difficult for a gentleman to put off as for a vulgar fellow to put on. The company generally felt it, and {{used to call me}} little gentleman Jack. The girl felt it too; and in spite of her predilection for my powerful rival, she liked to flirt with me. This only aggravated my troubles, by increasing my passion, and awakening the jealousy of her parti-colored lover.|$|E
60|$|This {{change in}} the {{appearance}} and demeanour of her daughter filled Lady Annabel with anxiety and alarm. In vain she expressed to Venetia her conviction of her indisposition; but Venetia, though her altered habits confirmed the suspicion, and authorised the inquiry of her parent, persisted ever in asserting {{that she had no}} ailment. Her old medical attendant was, however, consulted, and, being perplexed with the case, he recommended change of air. Lady Annabel then consulted Dr. Masham, and he gave his opinion in favour of change of air for one reason: and that was, that it would bring with it what he had long considered Venetia to stand in need of, and that was <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

It was a concern which brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.|$|E
