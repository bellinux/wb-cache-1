Rossi and Magnani have developed ranked sociograms, which is a BioFabric-like presentation where the node ordering is based upon a ranking metric. This approach attaches semantic meaning to the length of the edge lines, and can be used to visualize the assortativity or dissortativity of a network.|$|E

40|$|Mobile Location-Based Services (mLBS) are {{currently}} driven by technology-centred development, {{as opposed to}} the needs of end users. Where users have been made a focus, the research generally concerns issues of overall system appearance, functionality, information content and interaction methods, with little emphasis on <b>cartographic</b> <b>representations.</b> This paper describes the initial stages of an attempt to fill this void through the application of a User-Centred Design (UCD) methodology for optimising <b>cartographic</b> <b>representations</b> within mLBS. What follows is an account of the two user assessment activities adopted for the research. User Profiling involved defining a target user population via an online questionnaire. Analysis of the data produced a high-level overview of the attributes, behaviours and attitudes of Australian leisure-based travellers. User Task Analysis involved in-depth interviews with a subset of the users, in preparation for {{a deeper understanding of the}} population. The themes described in this paper represent an initial and necessary component of UCD, as applied to mLBS. Whilst the focus here is on a specific user group and context of use, it is envisaged that many of the concepts based upon the resulting user models will be relevant to mLBS in general...|$|R

50|$|In 1753, he sailed for Brazil {{into the}} very mouth of the Amazon River. Based on his surveys, Lorenz Kaulen made in 1753 a map of Maranhão {{district}} titled Mappa Viceprovinciae Societatis Iesu Maragnonii anno MDCCLIII concinnata. Its original is in Biblioteca de Évora in Portugal. Another map, Mapa da Ilha do Maranhão, made in 1757 again based upon Szentmartony's surveys, is also kept here. Between 1754-56, Father Szentmartony took part in expeditions to the Amazon and the Rio Negro. Upon the data obtained from his systematical astronomical surveys, in 1755 engineers Schwebel and Sturm made a regional map titled Mappa Geographico dos Rios.

50|$|The Crónica is {{remarkable}} in many ways. First, it has brilliant melding {{of writing and}} fine line drawings (398 pages of the book consist of Huaman Poma's famous full-page drawings). The work also includes Huaman Poma's 'Mapa Mundi de Reino de las Indias', a <b>cartographic</b> <b>representation</b> of the Inca Empire drawn in the Mappa mundi style favored by medieval European mapmakers, which placed Cusco, the Peruvian capital, {{at the center of}} the world. Second, the manuscript expresses the view of a provincial noble on the conquest, whereas most other existing expressions of indigenous views from the colonial era come from the nobility of Cusco, the ancient capital of the Incas). Third, the author frequently uses Quechua words and phrases in this primarily Spanish work, which provided material for scholars to learn more about Quechua.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the contemporary literary accounts and archaeological evidence, the Madaba Map preserves a sixth-century perception of the topography, cities, and monuments of the Mediterranean. The mosaic was discovered {{on the floor of}} the Church of St. George in Madaba, Jordan, and has been dated from 560-565, less than twenty years after the inauguration of the Nea in 543, and it is the oldest surviving <b>cartographic</b> <b>representation</b> of the Holy Land. The map depicts the Mediterranean world from Lebanon in the North to the Nile Delta in the South, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert. The city of Jerusalem is given prominence by its size and the mosaicists’ devotion to the detail of its monuments. No city represented in the map is larger. The central location of Jerusalem in the mosaic further supports Jerusalem’s importance in the minds of the map’s creators.|$|E

40|$|Participation in the {{decision-making}} process is one of the principles of development research and technical cooperation. However, there are often communication difficulties between scientists or experts and local people linked with this activity, which result from different norms and values, as well as language barriers. Cartographic and other visual representations can be more effective than verbal communication in certain circumstances by resolving communication problems. But how are <b>cartographic</b> <b>representations</b> perceived by an essentially illiterate population untrained in map reading? And how should they be designed in order to be understood and accepted by the local people? In order to clarify these questions empirical research using <b>cartographic</b> and map-related <b>representations</b> was carried out in a rural region of the Bale mountains in Ethiopia. The research revealed that non-literate people, despite inexperience in map reading, are very good in map orientation and in understanding the subject matter concerned, as long as local and psycho-perceptual rules are taken into consideration. In addition, with the assistance of <b>cartographic</b> <b>representations</b> access to spatial knowledge can be gained using simple topics of daily life as a discussion base. During technical cooperation particularly high identification and acceptance by the local population was achieved through the incorporation of three dimensional terrain models. The direct integration of these results into a GTZ project running in Dodola, Ethiopia confirmed the suitability of three-dimensional terrain models as a means of communication for technical cooperation...|$|R

Bunge consistently argued that geometrical patterns and morphological laws express disadvantage and injustice under contemporary capitalism, and that identified patterns could be remedied by rational methods.|$|R

40|$|Firstly, {{this paper}} makes {{analyses}} on the geographical visualization and mapping functionality in GIS software which have some shortcomings. So, {{the idea of}} geographical information <b>cartographic</b> <b>representation</b> is presented {{to improve the quality}} of the geographical information visualization and to satisfy rules of traditional cartography. The digital <b>cartographic</b> <b>representation,</b> which tries to make a model of the mapping procedure based on traditional cartographic knowledge, creates a template-mapping model for cartographic symbols. This template-mapping model achieves the transformation from cartographic specifications to products. Meanwhile, it can well consider characteristics of respective geographical feature, the relations between this feature and other features, the relations between this feature and cartographic region. These three kinds of relations are described with quantity parameters which can be used to map a symbol template to a symbol instance responding to some one geographical feature. With this template-mapping model for cartographic symbol, we can visualize the respective feature’s property in detail and improve the quality of geographical visualization. Hydrology and transportation features are taken as two examples to verify the availability of this <b>cartographic</b> <b>representation</b> model. 1...|$|E
