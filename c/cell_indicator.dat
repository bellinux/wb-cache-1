40|$|Short {{hydrophobic}} peptides {{were previously}} shown to inhibit infectivity of para- and orthomyxoviruses. We tested {{the ability of}} a series of di- and tripeptides to interfere with cell fusion induced by bovine leukemia virus (BLV). Peptides containing a hydrophobic contribution and/or a positive net charge strongly enhanced syncytia formation induced by BLV on CC 81 <b>indicator</b> <b>cells.</b> The size of the multinucleated cells was strongly increased (up to 10 -fold) {{in the presence of the}} enhancer peptides whereas no effect was observed on the <b>indicator</b> <b>cells</b> in the absence of BLV. The peptides thus amplified the fusion process initiated by BLV envelope glycoproteins. The effect was dose-dependent at concentrations ranging from 20 to 640 microM and did not result from an increased expression of BLV proteins. The peptides did not compete with anti-gp 51 monoclonal antibodies for the recognition of eight well-defined epitopes of gp 51. We consequently hypothesize that the enhancer peptides interact with the membrane of BLV-producing <b>cells</b> and/or <b>indicator</b> <b>cells</b> and propose a model based on molecular modeling.

In the absence of AZA, the cells were able to grow under the low-CO 2 condition relying on their expressed hCAII, which led to the color change, while the sample without the <b>indicator</b> <b>cells</b> remained blue.

The emphasis is on comparison of the performance of adaptive RKDG method using different indicators, with an objective of obtaining efficient and reliable indicators to obtain better performance for adaptive computation to save computational cost. Both h-version and r-version adaptive methods are considered in the paper. The idea is to first identify "troubled cells" by different troubled-cell <b>indicators,</b> namely those <b>cells</b> where limiting might be needed and discontinuities might appear, then adopt an adaptive approach in these cells. A detailed numerical study in one-dimensional case is performed, addressing the issues of efficiency (less CPU cost and more accurate), non-oscillatory property, and resolution of discontinuities.

Live cell imaging of RPE-FUCCI (fluorescent, ubiquitination-based <b>cell</b> cycle <b>indicator)</b> <b>cells</b> after siRNA knockdown of CEP 164 revealed an overall quicker cell cycle than control cells, although early S-phase was significantly longer. Follow-up FACS experiments with renal IMCD 3 cells confirm that Cep 164 siRNA knockdown promotes cells to accumulate in S-phase. We demonstrate that this effect can be rescued by human wild-type CEP 164, but not disease-associated mutants. siRNA of CEP 164 revealed a proliferation defect over time, as measured by CyQuant assays. The discrepancy between accelerated cell cycle and inhibited overall proliferation {{could be explained by}} induction of apoptosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Depletion of {{replication}} factors often causes {{cell death}} in cancer cells. Depletion of Cdc 7, a kinase essential for initiation of DNA replication, induces cancer cell death {{regardless of its}} p 53 status, but the precise pathways of cell death induction have not been characterized. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have used the recently-developed <b>cell</b> cycle <b>indicator,</b> Fucci, to precisely characterize the cell death process induced by Cdc 7 depletion. We have also generated and utilized similar fluorescent <b>cell</b> cycle <b>indicators</b> using fusion with other cell cycle regulators to analyze modes of cell death in live cells in both p 53 -positive and -negative backgrounds. We show that distinct cell-cycle responses are induced in p 53 -positive and -negative cells by Cdc 7 depletion. p 53 -negative cells predominantly arrest temporally in G 2 -phase, accumulating CyclinB 1 and other mitotic regulators. Prolonged arrest at G 2 -phase and abrupt entry into aberrant M-phase {{in the presence of}} accumulated CyclinB 1 are followed by cell death at the post-mitotic state. Abrogation of cytoplasmic CyclinB 1 accumulation partially decreases cell death. The ATR-MK 2 pathway is responsible for sequestration of CyclinB 1 with 14 - 3 - 3 σ protein. In contrast, p 53 -positive cancer cells do not accumulate CyclinB 1, but appear to die mostly through entry into aberrant S-phase after Cdc 7 depletion. The combination of Cdc 7 inhibition with known anti-cancer agents significantly stimulates cell death effects in cancer cells in a genotype-dependent manner, providing a strategic basis for future combination therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the use of Fucci, and similar fluorescent <b>cell</b> cycle <b>indicators,</b> offers a convenient assay system with which to identify cell cycle events associated with cancer cell death. They also indicate genotype-specific cell death modes induced by deficient initiation of DNA replication in cancer cells and its potential exploitation for development of efficient cancer therapies...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasmas are a {{major cause}} of cell culture {{contamination}} and are especially troublesome during HAT selection. The enzyme adenosine phosphorylase (adoP) is present in all common mycoplasma species but is considered to have a low activity in mammalian cells. However, using an adoP screening test, we have observed that some cell cultures do possess an intrinsic adoP activity leading to false positive results. Moreover, as a false negative result, we encountered a variant of Mycoplasma orale (identified after cultivation on agar and immunostaining) which was not detectable with the adoP screening in cell culture supernatants and only at low levels in cell lysates. To increase the low signal/noise adoP ratio found there, we used an <b>indicator</b> <b>cell</b> line with low intrinsic activity. <b>Indicator</b> <b>cells</b> were inoculated with the test supernatant and the adoP activity of these infected cells were measured after lysis.

Several applications of the direct antibody rosetting procedure are described in further investigations with a series of pan-T monoclonal (CAMPATH) antibodies. These include the morphological examination of antibody-binding cells in cytocentrifuge smears, the separation of lymphocyte subsets by density gradient centrifugation, and the use of a rosette inhibition assay to identify monoclonal antibodies binding to the same (or closely associated) epitopes of the lymphocyte cell membrane...|$|R
