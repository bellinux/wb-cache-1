40|$|Abstract. The {{greater part}} of the {{horizontal}} <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> is occupied by the stratified and annular flows, which play important roles in condensation heat transfer coefficients. Both a volume of fluid (VOF) interface tracking method and k-ε two equations model was applied to analyze {{the characteristics of the}} stratified and annular flows for horizontal tubes, obtaining distribution of velocity, contours of both temperature and local condensation heat transfer coefficients. The computation shows that an annular flow having thinner liquid film attached on the inner surface of tubes appears at the inlet of the horizontal <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> because vapor exerts a higher interfacial shear stress on the gas-liquid interface, therefore, there are a higher local condensation heat transfer coefficients there. Next, as vapor quality decreases and condensate gravity increases along the <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> length, the condensation flow pattern transforms from the annular flow into the stratified flow in which local condensation heat transfer coefficients decreases and distributes unevenly along the circumference as liquid film {{at the bottom of the}} <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> become thicker. In addition, in the stratified flow, a wave structure is formed in the middle of the condensate pool at the bottom of the <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> because condensate on the top of the <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> slides into the bottom of the <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> and collapse each other. The heat transfer rate calculated by the present method is compared to those predicted from a Shah correlation, the agreement is found to be good, and both errors is within 7 %...|$|R

40|$|Eddy Current Testing (ECT) of <b>condenser</b> <b>tubes</b> is {{essential}} to maintaining good plant reliability and availability. Early identification of defects can allow for adequate remedial action and prevent forced outages caused by <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> leaks. The well-known catastrophic failure in the nuclear industry in Japan has not only raised concern in Japan over aging nuclear power plants, but has also raised concern over safe operations in the United States and around the world. Ongoing reliability and instability issues due to reported leaks in condensers have also been the topic for nuclear watchdogs. This focus on the nuclear plant condenser has brought to light the various levels of sophistication and capability in ECT.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of the study was}} to measure the success achieved by the way the Eddy Current Inspection Method was applied to the steam turbine <b>condenser</b> <b>tubes</b> of Khartoum North Power Station (KNPS), and to analyze the inspection result to recommend the optimum way of implementation. Adoption of this method was necessitated by the frequent <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> failure incidents that resulted in high generation losses and unplanned maintenance hours.

50|$|Generally {{the tubes}} {{are made of}} {{stainless}} steel, copper alloys such as brass or bronze, cupro nickel, or titanium depending on several selection criteria. The use of copper bearing alloys such as brass or cupro nickel is rare in new plants, due to environmental concerns of toxic copper alloys. Also depending on the steam cycle water treatment for the boiler, it may be desirable to avoid tube materials containing copper. Titanium <b>condenser</b> <b>tubes</b> are usually the best technical choice, however the use of titanium <b>condenser</b> <b>tubes</b> has been virtually eliminated by the sharp increases in the costs for this material. The tube lengths range to about 85 ft (26 m) for modern power plants, {{depending on the size}} of the condenser. The size chosen is based on transportability from the manufacturers’ site and ease of erection at the installation site. The outer diameter of <b>condenser</b> <b>tubes</b> typically ranges from 3/4 inch to 1-1/4 inch, based on condenser cooling water friction considerations and overall condenser size.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{engineered}} {{safety systems}} in the advanced boiling water reactor is a passive containment cooling system (PCCS) which is composed {{of a number of}} vertical heat exchanger. After a loss of coolant accident, the pressurized steam discharged from the reactor and the noncondensable (NC) gases mixture flows into the PCCS <b>condenser</b> <b>tube.</b> The PCCS <b>condenser</b> must be able to remove sufficient energy from the reactor containment to prevent containment from exceeding its design pressure. The efficient performance of the PCCS condenser is thus vital to the safety of the reactor. In PCCS <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> three flow conditions are expected namely the forced flow, cyclic venting and complete condensation modes. The PCCS test facility consists of steam generator (SG), instrumented condenser with secondary pool boiling section, condensation tank, suppression pool, storage tank, air supply line, and associated piping and instrumentation [...] The specific design of <b>condensing</b> <b>tube</b> is based on scaling analysis from the PCCS design of ESBWR.

The EIS diagrams showed a semicircle that was better defined as the experimental time increased, indicating the decreasing tarnishing resistance of the immersed specimens. The EIS results were validated using Kramers-Kronig relationships. SEM micrographs of biofouling indicated that the number of microorganisms on the SS surfaces increased with immersion time.

40|$|The {{diameter}} and configuration of tubes are important design parameters of power condensers. If a proper tube diameter is applied during {{the design of}} a power unit, a high energy efficiency of the condenser itself can be achieved and the performance of the whole power generation unit can be improved. If a tube assembly is to be replaced, one should verify whether the chosen <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> diameter is correct. Using a diameter that is too large increases the heat transfer area, leading to over-dimensioning and higher costs of building the condenser. On the other hand, if the diameter is too small, water flows faster through the tubes, which results in larger flow resistance and larger pumping power of the cooling-water pump. Both simple and complex methods can be applied to determine the <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> diameter. The paper proposes a method of technical and economic optimisation taking into account the performance of a condenser, the low-pressure (LP) part of a turbine, and a cooling-water pump as well as the profit from electric power generation and costs of building the condenser and pumping cooling water. The results obtained by this method were compared with those provided by the following simpler methods: minimization of the entropy generation rate per unit length of a <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> (considering entropy generation due to heat transfer and resistance of cooling-water flow), minimization of the total entropy generation rate (considering entropy generation for the system comprising the LP part of the turbine, the condenser, and the cooling-water pump), and maximization of the power unit’s output.
