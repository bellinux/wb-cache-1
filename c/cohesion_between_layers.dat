40|$|The {{xanthate}} anion in {{the structure}} of K[S₂ COnPr] displays the expected features, i. e. planar S₂CO chromophore and variation in C—S and C—O distances. The K cation exists in a distorted cubic geometry defined by an O₂S₆ donor set. Cubes are face-shared so as to form a layer structure with <b>cohesion</b> <b>between</b> <b>layers</b> afforded by hydrophobic interactions. A series of theoretical gas-phase structures have been calculated for isolated S₂COR anions. These show that there is a remarkable consistency in geometric parameters across the series. This observation indicates that the nature of the R substituent does not influence greatly the electronic structure of the central S₂CO chromophore...|$|E

The {{computational}} model {{based on the}} shallow mined-out areas was built by using FLAC 3 D, and the separation and dislocation characteristics of the layered roof in the mined-out areas were analyzed under different conditions.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the hydration and swelling behavior of four synthetic sodium saponite samples with general formula Nax(Si 4 x,Alx) (Mg 3) O 10 (OH) 2, where x = 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6, and 0. 7. The combination of gravimetric water adsorption measurements and X-ray diffraction experiments under controlled water pressure {{allows us to}} analyze the inß uence of layer charge on swelling mechanisms. When the layer charge increases, swelling occurs for lower values of the chemical potential, i. e., at lower relative pressure. In parallel, as the <b>cohesion</b> <b>between</b> <b>layers</b> increases with increasing layer charge, a greater amount of water is needed to initiate swelling for higher-charged samples. In this last case, due to the proximity of interlayer cations, the transition between the one layer and two-layer hydrate occurs before the sodium cations are surrounded by a complete hydration sphere. This study also shows that the one-layer or two-layer hydrates cannot be considered as deÞ ned states as {{they appear to be}} modiÞ ed with both layer charge and relative pressure...|$|E

Electron density profiles along depth of the films show formation of layers parallel to the substrate surface, when the film thickness is below 4 Rg, with layer spacing ~ 2 Rg. The pure electronic singlet 1 A 1 g -> 1 E 1 u indicates exciton interaction throughout film thickness, {{as evidenced by the}} lineshape, drop in extinction coefficient and size-dependent blue shift of the corresponding UV peak. Analysis of the total energy of the exciton as a function of film thickness shows that above the thickness of 4 Rg the exciton is delocalized over the film thickness through linear, molecular J-aggregates. The separations between these molecules in the two polystyrene samples match with the respective layer spacing obtained from x-ray reflectivity. Transition dipole moments of the molecules in this aggregate are parallel and each dipole is arranged at an angle of ~ 43 degrees with the axis of the linear chain. Below a film thickness of 4 Rg, as the molecular layers are formed, the exciton becomes localized within these layers. This localization is clearly indicated by the lineshape becoming comparable to isolated molecular bands, and by both the extinction coefficient and blue shift reaching maximum values and becoming size independent. Localization of excitons due to layer formation has been explained as caused by decrease of <b>cohesion</b> <b>between</b> <b>layers.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
