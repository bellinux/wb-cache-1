5|$|On 7 July 1961, {{the second}} prototype, XP836, {{performed}} its first take off conventionally. Continuing {{tests of the}} two prototypes proceeded to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> vertical take off and flight, a feat which was achieved on 8 September 1961. During September, the feat was repeated multiple times by both prototypes, transitioning from vertical to horizontal flight and vice versa, including instances in which the auto-stabiliser was intentionally disabled.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April 1996, Liverpool faced Newcastle United in a Premier League fixture at Anfield, {{during the}} 1995–96 season. Liverpool won the match, scoring four goals to Newcastle's three. The winning goal was scored by striker Stan Collymore {{in the second}} minute of {{stoppage}} time. Before the match, both clubs had lost their previous fixtures but still had a chance of winning the league and wanted to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> themselves and leaders Manchester United. Newcastle United, who were 12 points ahead in January, had suffered from poor performance throughout March, winning one match out of four that month. Liverpool had won six of their last nine league games during February and March, scored the most goals and conceded the fewest until this match.|$|E

5|$|The British fleet {{approached}} the French line in an oblique manner, leading to individual engagements as the British ships attempted {{to break through}} at several points. Around 9:30, the British flagship HMS Queen Charlotte cut the French line aft of Montagne, firing a devastating raking broadside that killed Montagnes commander, Captain Bazire. The ship astern of Montagne, Jacobin, attempted to prevent Queen Charlotte breaking through by accelerating to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> herself and her flagship; this left a gap behind her, between Jacobin and Achille, that HMS Brunswick, under Captain John Harvey, attempted to exploit to cut the line and assist Queen Charlotte. Achille accelerated and closed the gap, and Brunswick turned her fire against Vengeur, while Achille engaged HMS Ramillies and Valiant.|$|E
5|$|By August the {{division}} was {{still waiting to}} be deployed, but now plans envisioned using {{them as part of}} a larger force. Operation Transfigure involved {{the division}}, the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, the US 101st Airborne Division, and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade landing at Rambouillet St Arnoult, to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> Orléans and Paris. Operation Axehead, using the same force, was to seize the bridges over the River Seine in support of 21st Army Group. Operation Boxer, with the same force, was to seize Boulogne and assault V1 flying bomb sites. Near the end of the month, Operation Linnet, with the same units as before, was formulated to seize crossings over the Escaut. Operation Infatuate, drawn up in early September, involved the entire I Airborne Corps landing in Belgium to trap the retreating German armies in the Scheldt estuary, as well as aiming to threaten Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} drivers opened a gap {{from the rest}} of the field, as Webber set the fastest lap of the race so far on lap two with a time of 1:33.685. Hamilton {{attempted}} an overtake manoeuvre on Webber heading into turn twelve on lap three but was unable to get close to affect a pass. Alonso passed de la Rosa for twelfth place on the same lap and began to battle Kobayaski for eleventh. Hamilton attempted to pass Webber for a second time at turn twelve on lap four but could not get close enough. This was because Hamilton's car was more effective than Webber's; it allowed Webber to pull away through turn eight but Hamilton could <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> himself and Webber in the back straight by employing his car's F-duct. Hülkenberg passed di Grassi and Chandhok in turn eight to move up into 21st place by lap six, while Webber, Hamilton and Vettel traded the fastest lap with Hamilton quickest on the same lap. McLaren became aware of a higher than expected fuel consumption by the tenth lap and they ordered both their drivers to change engine modes in an effort to conserve fuel. Kobayashi made a pit stop on lap eleven which released Alonso into clean air; Alonso made his pit stop on the following lap for hard tyres and rejoined ahead of Kobayashi. The next few laps saw a large amount of activity in the pit lane. Vettel made his pit stop from third position on lap 15, and rejoined in front of Rosberg, while Button pushed hard in an attempt to move ahead of Vettel. Hamilton and Webber both made their pit stops on the following lap; Webber emerged in front as Hamilton's pit crew were slow to fit Hamilton's left-rear tyre. Hamilton fell to third place behind Vettel.|$|E

During the initial {{planning}} of the line, Sembawang station was only {{intended as a}} provisional station, to be built {{at a later date}} due to the underdevelopment of Sembawang. Kranji station was not planned. But on the second round of planning, the government decided to build these stations and omit Sungei Kadut station from the plan. Sungei Kadut station will be built later if the town's population justifies the necessity for the station. With the official opening of the Woodlands Extension on 10 February 1996, the Branch Line became part of the North South Line.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{starting}} with a huge deficit, Lommel United managed to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> them and the other teams by obtaining 10 points out of their first four matches, overtaking Cercle Brugge and virtually being saved from relegation. At that point, neither team was saved as OH Leuven and Tubize had 20 points and Cercle Brugge and Lommel United were only one point behind. On matchday five, Lommel United first lost against Cercle Brugge and one day later on 22 April 2017, Tubize beat OH Leuven resulting in both Tubize and Cercle Brugge to be saved. On 28 April 2017, the final match, OH Leuven and Lommel United played {{each other in a}} direct confrontation to avoid relegation, with OH Leuven needing only a draw. The match ended 1–0 resulting in the relegation of Lommel United.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Gettysburg the regiment, having 302 men {{present for}} duty, {{was in the}} brigade of Paul J. Semmes in the {{division}} of Lafayette McLaws. On the second day, July 2, 1863, the brigade initially constituted the divisional reserve. During McLaw's assault in the afternoon through Semmes' Brigade was called forward to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> the other brigades {{in front of the}} Wheatfield; the 50th taking an exposed position ahead of the brigade's left. The brigade then slugged it out against elements of Caldwell's division of Hancock's Corps before finally being repulsed. When the present commander of the 50th Georgia, Lt. Col. Kearse, was wounded McGlashan temporarily took command of the regiment until he was superseded later that day. He was subsequently promoted to lieutenant colonel. At Gettysburg the records of the regimental losses are unclear and conflicting; the most detailed however give the losses as 16 killed, 62 wounded and 14 missing. When the regimental commander, Col. William R. Manning, received a medical discharge on July 31 McGlashan was chosen to be his successor and was promoted to colonel.|$|E

This landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support, including that of Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. It {{was signed into law}} by Bush in early 2002. Many contend that the initiative has been successful, as cited by the fact that students in the U.S. have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since Bush signed [...] "No Child Left Behind" [...] into law.
