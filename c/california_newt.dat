2500|$|San Francisco garter snakes forage {{extensively}} in aquatic habitats. Adult snakes feed primarily on California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii), which are federally listed as threatened. They may also feed on juvenile bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), {{but they are}} unable to consume adults; in fact, adult bullfrogs prey on juvenile garter snakes, and may be a contributing factor in the population decline of the San Francisco garter snake.

If newly metamorphosed Pacific treefrogs are not available, the young garter snakes may not survive.

Here, we combined wetland surveys with a mesocosm experiment to examine the individual and combined effects of nonnative fish predators and nonnative bullfrogs on aquatic communities. Among 139 wetlands, nonnative fish (bass, sunfish, and mosquitofish) negatively influenced the probability of occupancy of Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), but neither invader correlated strongly with occupancy by <b>California</b> <b>newts</b> (Taricha torosa), western toads (Anaxyrus boreas), or California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii). In mesocosms, mosquitofish dramatically reduced the abundance of zooplankton and palatable amphibian larvae (P. regilla and T. torosa), leading to increases in nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton (through loss of zooplankton), and rapid growth of unpalatable toad larvae (through competitive release). Bullfrog larvae reduced the growth of native anurans but had no effect on survival. Despite strong effects on natives, invaders did not negatively influence one another, and their combined effects were additive. Our results highlight how the net effects of multiple nonnative species depend on the trophic level of each invader, the form and magnitude of invader interactions, and the traits of native community members...|$|R

Here, investigation evaluated the effects of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) on native aquatic communities over a gradient of nutrient availability. Our study consisted of (1) a laboratory experiment that assessed how body size of three native amphibian larvae – Pacific chorus frogs (Pseudacris regilla), western toads (Anaxyrus boreas) and <b>California</b> <b>newts</b> (Taricha torosa) – influenced the risk of mosquitofish predation and (2) a two-month-long outdoor mesocosm experiment that evaluated the influence of mosquitofish simulating wetland communities across a gradient of nutrient availability. In the laboratory study, chorus frog larvae demonstrated {{a significant relationship between}} body size and survival. In the mesocosm experiment, mosquitofish significantly reduced overall amphibian survival compared to non-fish treatments, but the magnitude of these effects varied among amphibian species and nutrient condition. However, for both newts and toads, survival in the presence of fish occurred only (newts) or was higher (toads) in the high nutrient concentration, indicating an interaction between fish presence and nutrients. Correspondingly, amphibians in the high nutrient conditions grew more rapidly {{over the course of the}} experiment. Fish also sharply reduced zooplankton abundance and thereby enhanced primary production. Importantly, however, mosquitofish total survival of offspring also increased strongly (3 ̆e 300...|$|R

40|$|Predation and {{parasitism}} {{are each}} important ecological processes within communities and ecosystems. However, {{the interactions between}} predation and parasitism may have significant consequences for transmission dynamics and disease in host populations. Predators play multiple roles including changing host densities, behavior, and morphology {{that could lead to}} different disease outcomes. Furthermore, direct predation on parasites can potentially lead to reduction in disease risk to host populations. Here, I used a combination of mathematical modeling, small-scale laboratory studies, and a semi-realistic mesocosm experiment to characterize parasite transmission dynamics, provide a predictive framework for the role of direct predation on parasites, and evaluate the direct and indirect (trait-mediated interactions) effects of multiple predators on transmission and infection. My study system included the trematode parasite, Ribeiroia ondatrae, larval amphibian hosts, and a suite of invertebrate and vertebrate species that co-occur in nature. Using laboratory experiments and maximum likelihood approach, I characterized non-linear functions as the most accurate representation of transmission. These models capture the saturation of infection at high exposure levels and subsequent experiments with anesthetized hosts suggest that parasite behavior may be an underlying mechanism for nonlinear relationships. Next, I identified damselfly larvae and juvenile mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as predators of R. ondatrae and <b>California</b> <b>Newts</b> (Taricha torosa) as alternative hosts. In transmission trials, both damselflies and newts reduced transmission by ~ 50 % through the independent mechanisms of consumption and infection. Additional experiments including a wider range of parasite species showed that predation on parasites is based on predator foraging mode (active vs. ambush) and body size, parasite size and light availability. In more realistic aquatic communities with multiple trophic levels, I found that the trait-mediated indirect effects of predators of parasites and predators of hosts, including reduced activity and morphological changes were associated with higher infection compared to communities with predators absent. My research demonstrates both the direct and trait-mediated roles of predation on disease dynamics and identifies direct predation on parasites as an important factor in transmission dynamics. Future research should evaluate patterns of predator diversity and abundance with the prevalence and pathology due to R. ondatrae in nature...|$|R
50|$|Taricha torosa {{was divided}} into two {{subspecies}} in 2007, when {{it was determined that}} the Sierra and coastal populations represent distinct evolutionary lineages. The authors elevated the former subspecies Taricha torosa ssp. sierrae to full species level and it is now known as Taricha sierrae, the Sierra Newt.

50|$|The genus Taricha {{consists}} of four species of newts in the family Salamandridae. Their common name is Pacific newts, sometimes also western newts or roughskin newts. The four species within this genus are the <b>California</b> <b>newt,</b> the rough-skinned newt, the red-bellied newt, and the sierra newt, {{all of which are}} found on the Pacific coastal region from southern Alaska to southern California, with one species possibly ranging into northern Baja California, Mexico.|$|E

50|$|Although many {{salamanders}} have cryptic colors {{so as to}} be unnoticeable, others signal their toxicity {{by their}} vivid coloring. Yellow, orange, and red are the colors generally used, often with black for greater contrast. Sometimes, the animal postures if attacked, revealing a flash of warning hue on its underside. The red eft, the brightly colored terrestrial juvenile form of the eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens), is highly poisonous. It is avoided by birds and snakes, and can survive for up to 30 minutes after being swallowed (later being regurgitated). The red salamander (Pseudotriton ruber) is a palatable species with a similar coloring to the red eft. Predators that previously fed on it have been shown to avoid it after encountering red efts, an example of Batesian mimicry. Other species exhibit similar mimicry. In California, the palatable yellow-eyed salamander (Ensatina eschscholtzii) closely resembles the toxic <b>California</b> <b>newt</b> (Taricha torosa) and the rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa), whereas in other parts of its range, it is cryptically colored. A correlation exists between the toxicity of Californian salamander species and diurnal habits: relatively harmless species like the California slender salamander (Batrachoseps attenuatus) are nocturnal and are eaten by snakes, while the <b>California</b> <b>newt</b> has many large poison glands in its skin, is diurnal, and is avoided by snakes.|$|E
50|$|A stocky newt with rounded snout, it {{ranges from}} light brown to olive or brownish-black on top, with the underside, {{including}} the head, legs, and tail, a contrasting orange to yellow.

They {{are similar to}} the <b>California</b> <b>newt</b> (Taricha torosa) but differ in having smaller eyes, yellow irises, V-shaped tooth patterns, and uniformly dark eyelids.
