40|$|Planning Board (TPB) engaged Vanasse Hangen Brustlin (VHB) {{to review}} the use of <b>cutlines</b> for model validation. TPB {{currently}} uses screenlines to compare estimated (model-forecasted) and observed traffic volumes at regional locations as part of validation; however, travel forecasting staff has expressed interest in applying <b>cutlines</b> for future validation tests to compare estimated and observed data at a more detailed level, particularly for forecasting work to support project planning studies. This memo concludes that TPB should consider placement of the recommended screenlines for its next model validation. Easily obtaining reliable observed data at screenline crossings is still a potential problem, so TPB staff may wish to consult with member jurisdictions to prioritize the list of new screenlines and possibly phase them into the validation tests over time. In terms of observed data, accessing the VDOT traffic engineering count database and eventually the freeway data archives for northern Virgina will provide two previously unused and robust observed data sets, but even more data are needed going forward, particularly if TPB puts an even greater emphasis {{on the use of}} smaller area screenlines.

50|$|Validating traffic {{simulation}} models requires comparing traffic {{estimated by the}} model to observed traffic on the roadway and transit systems. Initial comparisons are for trip interchanges between quadrants, sectors, or other large areas of interest.

These are typically called screenlines, <b>cutlines,</b> and cordon lines and may be imaginary or actual physical barriers. Cordon lines surround particular areas such as a city's central business district or other major activity centers. Transit ridership estimates are commonly validated by comparing them to actual patronage crossing cordon lines around the central business district.|$|R

The FVC areas have been subdivided into parallel longitudinal strips called virees. The virees are between 380 and 400  m long and about 30  m wide. The FVC South and North are subdivided into 27 and 19 virees respectively. The viree boundaries are marked in the field by <b>cutlines</b> through the undergrowth, with the viree numbers painted on trees adjacent to the boundaries. During 1997 the virees were further subdivided into segments or parcels, making it possible to allocate the trees to different site types (based on slope and aspect) that do not correspond with the viree boundaries. The segments or parcels were mapped, but are not marked in the field. Tree positions have been plotted in some of the virees. The height of the main canopy is 18 – 22  m (Van Daalen, 1991).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{technique}} for 3 D mesh segmentation using multiple 2 D pose footprints. Such {{problem has been}} targeted {{many times in the}} literature, but still requires further development especially in the area of automation. The proposed algorithm applies cognition theory and provides a generic technique to form a 3 D bounding contour from a seed vertex on the 3 D mesh. Forming the <b>cutlines</b> is done in both 2 D and 3 D spaces to enrich the available information for the search processes. The main advantage of this technique is the possibility to operate without any object-dependent parameters. The parameters that can be used will only be related to the used cognition theory and the seeds suggestion, which is another advantage as the algorithm can be generic to more than one theory of segmentation or to different criterion. The results are competitive against other algorithms, which use object-dependent or tuning parameters. This plus the autonomy and generality features, provides an efficient and usable approach for segmenting 3 D meshes {{and at the same time}} to reduce the computation load...|$|R

Due to the severe drought, reclaimed water was used in lieu of potable water to serve the thermal process that consumed water in excess of 100, 000 gpd.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} the analytical approach for estimating the wind energy potential at locations around buildings in urban areas that are suitable for installing Small Wind Turbines (SWT). This development is performed in three steps. In order to analyze the flow pattern in a typical urban geometry, the first step consisted of a series of numerical simulations, where an assumed urban configuration (specified building size and respective distances between the buildings) was varied with an incremental value, and for each analyzed configuration different incoming wind conditions (different reference wind velocity) were incrementally imposed. In the second step the velocity profiles in the characteristic <b>cutlines</b> around the central building under investigation were extracted from the respective realizations of urban flow numerical solutions, and an analytical expression was derived approximating all extracted velocity profiles to fit the best an assumed flow pattern. The derived analytical expression was cross-plotted with the results of a fully three-dimensional realistic urban flow numerical solution, and the obtained matching level was satisfactory. Finally, using the derived expression, in the third step the estimation of SWT energy output was defined based on the average wind velocity information at given location and the related urban configuration characteristics...|$|R
