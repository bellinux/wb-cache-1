50|$|Using a urinary catheter, radiocontrast is {{instilled in}} the bladder, and X-ray imaging is performed. <b>Cystography</b> {{can be used}} to {{evaluate}} bladder cancer, vesicoureteral reflux, bladder polyps, and hydronephrosis. It requires less radiation than pelvic CT, although it is less sensitive and specific than MRI or CT. In adult cases, the patient is typically instructed to void three times, after which a post voiding image is obtained to see how much urine is left within the bladder (residual urine), which is useful to evaluate bladder contraction dysfunction. A final radiograph of the kidneys after the procedure is finished is performed to evaluate for occult vesicoureteral reflux that was not seen during the procedure itself.|$|E
50|$|Pelvic floor {{dysfunction}} can {{be diagnosed}} by history and physical exam, {{though it is}} more accurately graded by imaging. Historically, fluoroscopy with defecography and <b>cystography</b> were used, though modern imaging allows the usage of MRI to complement and sometimes replace fluoroscopic assessment of the disorder, allowing for less radiation exposure and increased patient comfort, though an enema is required the evening before the procedure. Instead of contrast, ultrasound gel is used during the procedure with MRI. Both methods assess the pelvic floor at rest and maximum strain using coronal and sagittal views. When grading individual organ prolapse, the rectum, bladder and uterus are individually assessed, with prolapse of the rectum {{referred to as a}} rectocele, bladder prolapse through the anterior vaginal wall a cystocele, and small bowel an enterocele.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: A well {{performed}} vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA) allows {{an early}} catheter removal and <b>cystography</b> is mandatory to exclude urinary extravasation. Aim {{of the study}} is to investigate whether transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) is as reliable as <b>cystography</b> in detecting anastomotic leakage after radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) {{in order to avoid the}} use of X-rays. Methods: 50 patients (pts) underwent RRP. VUA integrity was assessed 7 days after surgery by <b>cystography</b> and subsequently by TRUS to assess the patency of VUA. Patients who showed extravasation at the cystogram underwent ultrasonography in order to evaluate the leakage shown with <b>cystography.</b> Results: Catheter was removed after 7 days in all patiens except 2 pts (4 %) showed extravasation at the <b>cystography</b> that was exactly detected at the TRUS investigation, therefore the catheter was maintained for another week. TRUS investigation, performed after <b>cystography,</b> also revealed the presence of a lymphocele and a retropubic hematoma, in two different patients, both completely asymptomatic and misdiagnosed at the <b>cystography.</b> Conclusions: Urinary leakage in the first days after RRP can be frequent and <b>cystography</b> is mandatory to assess VUA integrity, when early catheter removal is planned. TRUS as an alternative investigation technique to <b>cystography,</b> showed a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting extravasation and was also able to diagnose complications related to RRP that <b>cystography</b> didn't show...|$|E
30|$|The {{investigation}} {{of choice in}} our institution for suspected bladder injuries is retrograde <b>cystography.</b> Increasingly, retrograde CT <b>cystography</b> is being used with similar accuracy rates [1, 3 – 6]. To prevent false negatives, the bladder should be adequately distended with at least 250 – 300 ml of fluid; radiographs should be taken {{in at least two}} projections and include a postdrainage film to visualise extravasated contrast [9]. No postdrainage films are needed for CT <b>cystography.</b>|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Positional {{installation}} of contrast <b>cystography</b> (PIC <b>cystography)</b> represents a new method to identify vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) that is unrevealed by standard diagnostic procedures. It is performed by radiological {{examination of the}} vesicoureteral junction during cystoscopic {{installation of}} the contrast medium at the ureteral orifice. OBJECTIVE We studied the significance of PIC <b>cystography</b> to demonstrate VUR that failed to be revealed by standard voiding cystourethrography (MCUG), {{as well as the}} degree of the correlation of such a finding with endoscopic appearance and the position of the ureteral orifice (UO). METHOD The aim of the paper was to analyze a sample of 5 children (4 girls and 1 boy), aged 6 - 15 years (mean 9. 8 years) with recurrent febrile urotract infections, complicated with scarring changes of the renal parenchyma and normal findings on MCUG. The grade of VUR demonstrated by PIC <b>cystography</b> was classified using the standard hydrodistensional scale. RESULTS All 5 patients had VUR, disclosed by PIC <b>cystography,</b> of whom in 4 it was unilateral and in one bilateral. Of 5 patients, 4 had VUR grade I and one grade II. All the children with VUR detected by PIC <b>cystography</b> also had evident cystoscopic abnormalities in the position and/or configuration of the ureteral orifice at the same side, while at the side with normal finding on PIC <b>cystography,</b> the endoscopic finding was also within normal limits. CONCLUSION PIC <b>cystography</b> is the method of choice in the confirmation of VUR as the cause of recurrent urotract infection and its complications in children with a normal finding on standard MCUG. In all our patients with VUR verified by PIC <b>cystography,</b> at the same side we also revealed endoscopic changes in the position and/or configuration of UO...|$|E
30|$|Multidetector {{computed}} tomography (MDCT) <b>cystography</b> currently represents the modality of choice to image the urinary bladder in traumatized patients. In this review we present our experience with MDCT <b>cystography</b> applications outside the trauma setting, particularly for diagnosing bladder fistulas and leaks. A detailed explanation is provided concerning exam preparation, acquisition technique, image reconstruction and interpretation. Colovesical fistulas most commonly {{occur as a}} complication of sigmoid diverticular disease, and often remain occult after extensive diagnostic work-up including cystoscopy and contrast-enhanced CT. We consistently achieved accurate preoperative visualization of colovesical fistulas using MDCT <b>cystography.</b> Urinary leaks and injuries represent a non-negligible occurrence after pelvic surgery, particularly obstetric and gynaecological procedures: in our experience MDCT <b>cystography</b> is useful to investigate iatrogenic bladder leaks or fistulas. In our opinion, MDCT <b>cystography</b> should be recommended as the first line modality for direct visualization or otherwise confident exclusion of both spontaneous enterovesical fistulas and bladder injuries following instrumentation procedures, obstetric or surgical interventions.|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{volumetric}} CT <b>cystography</b> acquisition on multidetector (MD) scanners {{benefited from}} improved spatial resolution and image reconstruction on arbitrary planes. Allowing identification of small urine leaks {{in every possible}} direction, MDCT <b>cystography</b> approaches absolute sensitivity and specificity with no false-negative results reported [6, 7].|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} 47 {{children in}} whom vesicoureteric reflux was clinically suspected by both conventional radiological and indirect radionuclide <b>cystography.</b> Comparison {{of the two}} methods showed {{no significant difference in}} their accuracy in detecting vesicoureteric reflux.

3000|$|Historically, imaging {{modalities}} {{to evaluate}} a patient with suspected bladder injury have included retrograde <b>cystography,</b> CT retrograde <b>cystography,</b> and delayed CT <b>cystography.</b> The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each have been well discussed elsewhere [5, 9, 10]. Research indicates that even when retrograde <b>cystography</b> is strongly indicated, it is rarely performed because it is both resource and time consuming [9], factors that may have also contributed to historically high mortality rates for bladder rupture. Meanwhile, the combined abdominopelvic CT exam has become the modality of choice for EPs navigating nonspecific complaints. Conventional abdominal noncontrast CT has an accuracy rate of only 60.6 % for bladder injury compared to 95.9 % for the retrograde cystogram [9]. However, in a patient with worsening abdominal pain/distention and vital sign abnormalities, a CT scan will likely be the imaging modality of choice [...]...|$|E
30|$|During RALRP, the VUA {{is created}} with a Foley {{catheter}} in place. Traditionally, radiographic voiding <b>cystography</b> has been routinely performed after radical prostatectomy before catheter removal. Currently, the optimal interval between surgery and Foley catheter removal {{has still not}} been established. Early patient discharge and removal of the Foley catheter 8 – 10  days after RARLP without routine <b>cystography</b> are now accepted practice [6, 20 – 22].|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo compare colour Doppler {{ultrasonography}} (CDU) and retrograde <b>cystography</b> in {{the assessment}} of the patency of internal ureteral stents. Patients and MethodsThirty-two patients with 33 internal ureteral stents were evaluated for patency of the internal ureteral stent using both CDU and retrograde <b>cystography.</b> Real-time ultrasonography and CDU were performed before retrograde <b>cystography.</b> Stent patency was defined as seeing flow from the distal end of the stent in the urinary bladder or iodinated contrast in the renal pelvis. The two investigators had no prior knowledge of the other's results. After completion of both investigations, stent patency was proved by direct inspection of the stent after removal. ResultsBoth investigations showed the same result in 27 of the 33 stents. Stent patency was found if either investigation was positive. The accuracies of retrograde <b>cystography,</b> CDU and both were 73 %, 79 % and 85 %, respectively. ConclusionsCDU is a noninvasive method with high accuracy. Detection of flow at the distal end of the stent is helpful, but absence of flow may or may not indicate an obstructed stent and further investigation should be performed...|$|E
40|$|Conventional X-ray-based <b>cystography</b> uses {{radio-opaque}} materials, {{but this}} method uses harmful ionizing radiation {{and is not}} sensitive. In this study, we demonstrate nonionizing and noninvasive photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL) <b>cystography</b> using clinically relevant indocyanine green (ICG) in vivo. After transurethral injection of ICG into rats through a catheter, their bladders were photoacoustically and fluorescently visualized. A deeply positioned bladder below the skin surface (i. e., ~ 1. 5 – 5 mm) was clearly visible in the PA and FL image using a laser pulse energy of less than 2 mJ/cm 2 (1 / 15 of the safety limit). Then, the in vivo imaging results were validated through in situ studies. Our results suggest that dual modal <b>cystography</b> can provide a nonionizing and noninvasive imaging tool for bladder mapping...|$|E

40|$|Spontaneous bladder {{perforation}} is a {{very rare}} event. Prompt diagnosis of this injury is very important, particularly with intraperitoneal perforation, because mortality increases if surgical repair is delayed. Previous studies have reported that plain <b>cystography</b> is the primary modality of imaging study rather than relatively insensitive computed tomography (CT) when bladder perforation is suspected. We report here a rare case of spontaneous intraperitoneal perforation of the bladder associated with urothelial carcinoma with divergent histologic differentiation, as diagnosed with CT <b>cystography...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{endoscopic}} {{injection of}} Dx/HA {{in the management}} of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has become an accepted alternative to open surgery. In the current study we evaluated the value of <b>cystography</b> to detect de novo contralateral VUR in unilateral cases of VUR at the time of Dx/HA injection and correlated the findings of immediate post-Dx/HA injection <b>cystography</b> during the same anesthesia to 2 -month postoperative VCUG to evaluate its ability to predict successful surgical outcomes. The current study aimed to evaluate whether an intraoperatively performed cystogram could replace postoperative studies. But a negative intraoperative cystogram correlates with the postoperative study in only 80 %. Considering the 75 – 80 % success rate of Dx/HA implantation, the addition of intraoperative cystograms cannot replace postoperative studies. In patients treated with unilateral VUR, PIC <b>cystography</b> can detect occult VUR and prevent postoperative contralateral new onset of VUR...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, in {{patients}} with suspicion of VUA leak an additional focussed investigation with conventional radiographic <b>cystography</b> or MDCT <b>cystography</b> is recommended. At our department diluted iodinated CM to be used during MDCT <b>cystography</b> is prepared by removing 40 – 50  ml of normal saline from a 500 -ml bag and injecting a similar amount of non-ionic contrast agent (such as 350 mgI/ml iomeprol or 370 mgI/ml iopromide) into the same saline solution bag. The bag is then connected to standard tubing for intravenous infusions, filling the tube with diluted contrast to avoid instilling air in the bladder. With the patient supine on the CT scanner table, slow retrograde infusion is obtained by gravity. Differently from conventional MDCT <b>cystography</b> to investigate bladder trauma and spontaneous colovesical fistulas, in postoperative patients the injected CM volume should not exceed 150  ml because of concern about excessive pressure on the newly created VUA. The volumetric MDCT acquisition at sufficient bladder distension is visualised with multiplanar image reformations at CT angiography window settings (width 600 – 900 level 150 – 300 Hounsfield Units, HU) and by maximum intensity projection (MIP) or 3 D-VR techniques. The only potential pitfall of this technique is the possible occlusion of a limited anastomotic dehiscence by the Foley catheter balloon [8, 15, 16].|$|E
40|$|We prospectively {{investigated}} whether routine {{evaluation of}} the vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA) after radical prostatectomy can be waived. Primary integrity of the VUA was analysed by an intraoperative methylene-blue test (IMBT) and postoperatively by conventional <b>cystography.</b> Data on the IMBT, contrast extravasation and prostate volume as well as pad usage were collected prospectively. Significantly more patients with a primary watertight anastomosis demonstrated by the MBT had no leakage in the postoperative <b>cystography</b> (< 0. 001). In a multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for prostate size and surgeon, the positive correlation between IMBT and postoperative <b>cystography</b> remained statistically significant (= 0. 001). The IMBT is easy to perform, inexpensive, and timesaving. With it postoperative evaluation of VUA for integrity can be waived in {{a significant number of}} patients. Following our algorithm, the Foley can be removed without further testing of the VUA, whenever the IMBT detected no leakage...|$|E

30|$|In the past, {{suspected}} bladder {{injuries were}} investigated {{by means of}} conventional radiographic <b>cystography,</b> a time-consuming and cumbersome procedure in traumatized patients that provides very limited information on surrounding pelvic structures.|$|E
30|$|Bladder {{injuries}} {{occur in}} up to 8 % of cases with pelvic trauma [1]. Many clinical indicators are suggestive and should prompt the clinician to undertake further investigations. Mortality rates range from 11 % to 44 % [2], but this is commonly attributed to the associated polytrauma [3]. Conventional retrograde <b>cystography</b> has been considered {{the gold standard for}} investigating such patients [1, 4] and has a reported sensitivity of 100 % [1, 3 – 6]. More recently, computed tomography (CT) <b>cystography</b> has been used as an adjunct to trauma CT to evaluate bladder trauma, showing similar accuracy rates [6]. This procedure involves retrograde administration of contrast into the bladder through a catheter and performing a further scan in addition to the trauma CT. [6]. We describe two cases in which conventional retrograde <b>cystography</b> failed to detect a bladder rupture in patients with an associated pelvic fracture. In both cases, informed consent was obtained for inclusion in this report.

In group C, one patient had urinary leakage from the bladder to the vagina and rectum on the 18 th postoperative day after combined bladder and colorectal resection, protective ileostomy, and UNC via laparotomy. <b>Cystography</b> had been normal {{the day before and}} bladder catheter had been removed. No fistula was detected during CT urography but leakage came to an end following insertion of a new bladder catheter. After 2  weeks with this catheter, <b>cystography</b> and cystoscopy were normal and leakage vanished. The most common complication was hemorrhage and altogether 16 women in groups B and C received blood transfusions after the operations performed via laparotomy.|$|E
