All future development of the HDMI specification will take place in the HDMI Forum and will be built upon the HDMI 1.4b specification.

50|$|Unlike the Bertrand paradox, the {{situation}} of both companies charging zero-profit prices is not an equilibrium, since either <b>company</b> <b>can</b> raise its price and generate profits. Nor is {{the situation}} where one company charges less than the other an equilibrium, since the lower price <b>company</b> <b>can</b> profitably raise its price towards the higher price company's price. Nor is the situation where both companies charge the same positive-profit price, since either <b>company</b> <b>can</b> then lower its price marginally and profitably capture more of the market.|$|R

25|$|Australia and New Zealand have a {{dividend}} imputation system, wherein <b>companies</b> <b>can</b> attach franking credits or imputation credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax {{paid by the}} company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company tax paid generates one franking credit. <b>Companies</b> <b>can</b> attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 - company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders {{who are able to}} use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.|$|E
