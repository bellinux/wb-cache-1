5|$|Barbera took art {{classes at}} the Art Students League of New York and the Pratt Institute and was hired {{to work in the}} ink and paint {{department}} of Fleischer Studios. In 1932, he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and storyboard artist. He worked on cartoon series such as <b>Cubby</b> Bear and Rainbow Parades, and Tom and Jerry. This Tom and Jerry series starred two humans; it was unrelated to Barbera's later cat-and-mouse series. When Van Beuren closed down in 1936, Barbera moved over to Paul Terry's Terrytoons studio.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{film in the}} Eon series, Thunderball, was {{the third}} to portray Leiter and the {{producers}} chose a third actor to play the role, Rik Van Nutter. Van Nutter was married to Swedish actress Anita Ekberg {{at the time and}} the couple had dined with <b>Cubby</b> and Dana Broccoli after Ekberg had appeared in the Eon-produced Call Me Bwana. Van Nutter was subsequently offered the Leiter role without an audition, although he did have screen tests with some of the Bond girls.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the film}} {{was shot in the}} cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida, and Rio de Janeiro. The {{production}} team had considered India and Nepal as a location in the film but on arriving at those places to investigate, they found that it was inconceivable to write them into the script, particularly with time restrictions to do so. They decided on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, relatively early on, a city that <b>Cubby</b> Broccoli had visited on holiday, and a team was sent to that city in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the Carnival festival, which featured in the film.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1970s {{developments}} {{were reported}} on the project under the name James Bond of the Secret Service, but when producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project he brought on board scriptwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr. to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked Tom Mankiewicz, who had rewritten Diamonds Are Forever, to work on the script; however, Mankiewicz declined as he felt he was under a moral obligation to <b>Cubby</b> Broccoli. Connery then hired British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America.|$|E
5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. He lived in a <b>cubby</b> hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E

40|$|Strychnine-salt blocks were {{evaluated}} for effectiveness in killing porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) in pine forests in Oregon and California.

Only 4 of 32 marked porcupines exposed to bait were poisoned. Two died at <b>cubbies</b> and two died at trees. Other wildlife found poisoned at <b>cubbies</b> were seven unmarked porcupines, seven yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), five Nuttall 2 ̆ 7 s cottontails (Sylvilagus nuttallii), four deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) three golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), and one Douglas 2 ̆ 7 squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasii). Fewer nontarget animals [...] two unmarked porcupines, two yellow-pine chipmunks, and one northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) [...] died at tree sets. Bioassays with caged porcupines further indicated that strychnine alkaloid is an ineffective toxicant for porcupines...|$|R

As she is sleeping, the bear family returns and sees the result of Goldilocks' tampering. Papa Bear wakes Goldilocks up, and when she sees the bears in the bedroom, she screams and runs off.

25|$|Ottavini {{are small}} spinets or virginals at four foot pitch. Harpsichords at octave pitch were {{more common in}} the early Renaissance, but lessened in {{popularity}} later on. However, the ottavino remained very popular as a domestic instrument in Italy until the 19th century. In the Low Countries, an ottavino was commonly paired with an 8' virginals, encased in a small <b>cubby</b> under the soundboard of the larger instrument. The ottavino could be removed and placed on top of the virginal, making in effect a double manual instrument. These are sometimes called 'mother-and-child' or 'double' virginals.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} film {{debut in the}} Laurence Olivier Othello in 1965. He then played romantic leads, notably in the BBC {{television}} series, The Borderers (1968–70), {{in which he was}} swashbuckling Gavin Ker. As a result, Gambon was asked by James Bond producer <b>Cubby</b> Broccoli to audition for the role in 1970, to replace George Lazenby. His craggy looks soon made him into a character actor, although he won critical acclaim as Galileo in John Dexter's production of The Life of Galileo by Brecht at the National Theatre in 1980. But it was not until Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective (1986) that he became a household name. After this success, for which he won a BAFTA, his work includes such controversial films as The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, which also starred Helen Mirren.|$|E

Proprietors are able to do so under special agreements with the Chicago Cubs organization. Many Wrigleyville bars and restaurants (particularly on North Clark Street) feature sports-oriented themes. Bars such as Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers, Casey Moran's, Rockwood Place, Sports Corner and The <b>Cubby</b> Bear host the Cubs crowds near the Wrigley Field intersection of North Clark Street and West Addison Street.|$|E

[...] Under the plea agreement, he agreed to pay a $15,000 fine, give up hunting, fishing and trapping in Minnesota for 5 years and forfeit Cubby's taxidermied remains and the bow he used to shoot <b>Cubby.</b> In a statement that he posted on the duo's website on November 9, 2010, he apologized for his actions as well as the unethical manner in which he killed <b>Cubby.</b>|$|E
500|$|Adam {{later told}} UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian: [...] "No one was allowed in Fort Knox but because [...] <b>Cubby</b> Broccoli {{had some good}} connections and the Kennedys loved Ian Fleming's books I was allowed to fly over it once. It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade <b>Cubby</b> and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} [...] stories as to whom Ian Fleming {{personally}} wanted. Reportedly, Fleming favoured actor Richard Todd. In his autobiography When the Snow Melts, <b>Cubby</b> Broccoli said Roger Moore had been considered, {{but had been}} thought [...] "too young, perhaps a shade too pretty." [...] In his autobiography, My Word Is My Bond, Moore says he was never approached {{to play the role}} of Bond until 1973, for Live and Let Die. Moore appeared as Simon Templar on the television series The Saint, airing in the United Kingdom for the first time on 4 October 1962, only one day before the premiere of Dr. No.|$|E
500|$|Filming in Las Vegas {{took place}} mostly in hotels owned by Howard Hughes, {{since he was}} a friend of <b>Cubby</b> Broccoli. Getting the streets empty to shoot was {{achieved}} through the collaboration of Hughes, the Las Vegas police and shopkeepers association. The Las Vegas Hilton doubled for the Whyte House, and since the owner of the Circus Circus was a Bond fan, he allowed the Circus to be used on film and even made a cameo. The cinematographers said filming in Las Vegas at night had an advantage: no additional illumination was required due to the high number of neon lights. Sean Connery made the most of his time on location in Las Vegas. [...] "I didn't get any sleep at all. We shot every night, I caught all the shows and played golf all day. On the weekend I collapsed – boy, did I collapse. Like a skull with legs." [...] He also played the slot machines, and once delayed a scene because he was collecting his winnings.|$|E
500|$|Lucan's {{daily routine}} {{consisted}} of breakfast at 9:00am, coffee, {{dealing with the}} morning's letters, reading the newspapers, and playing the piano. He sometimes jogged in the park and, while he owned him, took his Doberman Pinscher for walks. Lunch at the Clermont Club was followed by afternoon games of backgammon. Returning home to change into evening dress, the earl typically spent {{the remainder of the}} day at the Clermont, gambling into the early hours, watched sometimes by Veronica. In 1956, while still working at Brandt's, he had written of his desire to have [...] "£2m in the bank", claiming that [...] "motor-cars, yachts, expensive holidays and security for the future would give myself {{and a lot of other}} people a lot of pleasure". He was described by his friends as a shy and taciturn man, but with his tall stature, [...] "luxuriant guardsman's moustache" [...] and masculine pursuits, his exploits made him popular. His profligacy extended to hiring private aircraft to take his friends to the races, asking a car dealer he knew to source an Aston Martin drophead coupé, drinking expensive Russian vodka and racing powerboats. In September 1966 he unsuccessfully screen tested for a part in Woman Times Seven, prompting him to automatically decline a later offer from film producer <b>Cubby</b> Broccoli, to screen test him for the role of James Bond.|$|E
