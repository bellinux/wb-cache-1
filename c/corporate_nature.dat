Jensen initially tried on his own to program the game in Visual Basic around 2004, but found he needed more help and proceeded to create an art style trailer by 2006. He had only intended to use the trailer {{as a means to}} recruit a programmer to help him, but the video attracted substantial interest in the project from across the Internet, eventually leading him to meet with Patti, who was also dissatisfied with his job. Their collaboration led to the founding of Playdead. Although Patti helped in the first few months with programming, he realised that the project was much larger than the two of them could handle, and Patti developed the business around the game's expanded development.|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to the synoptic gospels, the Fourth Gospel is markedly individualistic, {{in the sense that}} it places emphasis more on the individual's relation to Jesus than on the <b>corporate</b> <b>nature</b> of the Church. This is largely accomplished through the consistently singular grammatical structure of various aphoristic sayings of Jesus throughout the gospel. According to Richard Bauckham, emphasis on believers coming into a new group upon their conversion is conspicuously absent from John. There is also a theme of [...] "personal coinherence", that is, the intimate personal relationship between the believer and Jesus in which the believer [...] "abides" [...] in Jesus and Jesus in the believer. [...] According to C. F. D. Moule, the individualistic tendencies of the Fourth Gospel could potentially give rise to a realized eschatology achieved on the level of the individual believer; this realized eschatology is not, however, to replace [...] "orthodox", futurist eschatological expectations, but is to be [...] "only [...] correlative." [...] Some have argued that the Beloved Disciple is meant to be all followers of Jesus, inviting all into such a personal relationship with Christ. Beyond this, the emphasis on the individual's relationship with Jesus in the Gospel has suggested its usefulness for contemplation on the life of Christ.|$|E

30|$|Apart {{from using}} the method of interpretative textual {{analysis}} mentioned above, the comparative case approach is also applied to this study, as the author contrast the two firms with different <b>corporate</b> <b>natures</b> and their sustainability reporting practices. As to the choice of firms, namely the New Hope Liuhe Group and the Beidahuang Group (hereinafter “Liuhe” and “Beidahuang”), it is above all because that the two Chinese agribusinesses share some important attributes in common: both large in size and having important market power in their respective product domain, which could {{to a great extent}} provide us with some insight concerning the Chinese agribusinesses as a whole. Second, it is also because that their differences in terms of history, culture, image, the impacts of their products on nature and society, and the circumstances in which their reports were produced are tightly linked to the production of their annual sustainability reports. Investigating these elements can therefore allow us to {{have a better understanding of}} the complexity of the matter. And third, from a practical point of view, the availability of data also plays a decisive role: The facts that both firms are leading agribusinesses in their respective sector, and both are listed firms in Chinese Stock Exchanges make their financial and non-financial reports publicly available; whilst the high level executives of these two firms accepted to be interviewed by the author, which makes the collection of rather abundant interview data possible.|$|R

New Zealand provides a unique governance setting for the study, with significant blockholder presence and an inactive (relative to other developed countries) market for corporate control co-existing with a high number of outside directors. The evidence suggests that the proportion of outside directors on New Zealand boards is related to both the level of ownership and identity of the largest blockholder, with the latter influence dominating the former. The evidence regarding blockholder identity suggests that the number of outside directors is likely to be greatest when the stakeholder is governmental or <b>corporate</b> in <b>nature...</b>|$|R

Utilities typically move on to become boom operators or mixers themselves, taking over roles in the sound department previously held by their superiors. In studio based television production, the route for promotion from sound assistant is to sound technician/operator, and finally to sound supervisor. Formal qualifications are not specified for technicians in studio environments, although employers typically look for basic numeracy and literacy, and a solid foundation in maths and physics. Many applicants have A levels/H grades or have taken courses to certificate, diploma or degree level, such as ft2 (Freelance Film and Television Training). As the film and big budget narrative television industries are typically less <b>corporate</b> in <b>nature</b> than studio based television, utility technicians may have no training other than their experience from simply working in the sound department.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the special themed section on organizational interactions involving universities and firms {{that result in}} the commercialization of research and technology. Our objective is {{to shed light on}} some of the most vexing, yet under-researched predicaments research institutions encounter, despite their best efforts to advance commercialization. First, we synthesize and extend recent studies, including the papers in the special themed section. Next, we develop a taxonomy of modes of commercialization. Specifically, we consider internal approaches, quasi-internal approaches (e. g. incubators), university research parks, regional clusters, academic spin-offs and start-ups, licensing, contract research and consultancy, corporate venture capital, and open science and innovation. We also identify areas for further research at the individual (e. g. heterogeneity of entrepreneurial teams and experience; incentives), organizational and intra-university (e. g. <b>corporate</b> governance; <b>nature</b> of growth strategies; relationships with trading partners; boundary spanning activities) and technology levels (e. g. institutional context; reconfiguration of technology; valuation of technology).

50|$|The tax was {{collected}} through {{a system that}} reflected the divided, <b>corporate</b> <b>nature</b> of the Holy Roman Empire. Though the local territorial powers recognized {{the need for a}} common purse to protect and preserve The Empire, they were simultaneously unwilling to surrender power to The Emperor. Thus, instead of a direct tax collected by The Emperor, obligations were set through the Worms Reichsmatrikel on the individual Electors, Bishops, Princes, Prelates, Counts, Lords, Imperial Towns, and other political structures to provide a set number of horse and footmen, or a set amount of money based on the wages of the requested troops. The obligations of the territorial powers were based on a rough estimate of how wealthy each individual territory in The Empire was, with some of the larger, richer territories obligated to provide hundreds of men, while the smaller Lords provide as few as five. Through this system, almost 400 separate territories were obligated to pay something to The Empire, while leaving collection and payment of the tax up to the regional territorial powers, preserving local independence.|$|E

40|$|Using a model {{based on}} a {{trade-off}} between moral hazard incentives and gains from specialization, this paper explains why farming has generally not converted from small, family-based firms into large, factory-style <b>corporate</b> firms. <b>Nature</b> is both seasonal and random, and the interplay of these qualities generates moral haz-ard, limits the gains from specialization, and causes timing problems between stages of production. By identifying conditions in which these forces vary, we derive test-able predictions about the choice of organization {{and the extent of}} farm integration. To test these predictions we study the historical development of several agricultural industries and analyze data from a sample of over 1, 000 farms in British Columbia and Louisiana. In general, seasonality and randomness so limit the benefits of spe-cialization that family farms are optimal, but when farmers are successful in miti-gating the effects of seasonality and random shocks to output, farm organizations gravitate toward factory processes and corporate ownership.

40|$|In this paper, {{innovation}} activities {{of a firm}} are observed as its R&D spending and participation in three categories of innovation systems. The various factors that can influence a firm's innovation efforts are divided into, (i) firm location reflecting the regional milieu and (ii) firm attributes such as <b>corporate</b> structure, <b>nature</b> of the knowledge production, type of industry {{and a set of}} specific firm characteristics. The study is based on information about 2094 individual firms, which may be non-affiliated or belong to a group (multi-firm enterprise). The empirical analysis applies a novel data set to examine the influence of location versus a vector of firm attributes. Among innovative firms, the location of a firm does not influence neither the R&D intensity nor the frequency of interaction in horizontal and vertical innovation systems, when controlling the skill composition, physical capital intensity, industry, firm size and market extension. The paper contributes to the literature by observing that innovative firms have similar characteristics irrespective of where they are located, although the share of innovative firms differs between regions.

Using a unique provincial firm-level dataset, this paper investigates how <b>corporate</b> control <b>natures,</b> ownership concentration, and provincial differences in government quality and financial development jointly affect the value of Chinese listed companies. Firstly, central government control is generally associated with higher Tobin’s Q, while a negative premium is found for firms ultimately controlled by local governments. It then uses alternative concentration measures and an instrumental variable approach to confirm a nonlinear relationship between ownership concentration and Tobin’s Q, implying that firm value first decreases and then increases as blockholders own more shares. Further analysis reveals that government quality has a significant, positive moderating effect {{on the relationship between}} different corporate controllers and firm value, while the value implication of ownership concentration also depends on regional financial development.

50|$|Although {{the music}} {{industry}} developed over several decades, popular music drew ethnomusicologists’ attention by the 90s because a standardizing effect began to develop. The <b>corporate</b> <b>nature</b> surrounding popular music streamlined it into a framework that focused on slight deviations from the accepted norm, creating what Adorno calls “pseudo-individualism”; what the public would perceive as unique or organic would musically comply with standard, established musical conventions. Thus, a duality emerged from this standardization, an industry-driven manipulation of the public’s tastes to give people what they want while simultaneously guiding them to it. In the case of rock music, while the genre may have grown out of politicized forces and another form of meaningful motivation, the corporate influence over popular music became integral to its identity that directing public taste became increasingly easier. Technological developments allowed for easy dispersion of western music, causing the dominance of western music into rural and urbanized areas across the globe. However, because popular music assumes such a corporatized role and therefore remains subject {{to a large degree}} of standardization, ambiguity exists whether the music reflects actual cultural values or those only of the corporate sector seeking economic profit. Because popular music developed such a dependent relationship with media and the corporations surrounding it, where record sales and profit indirectly shaped musical decisions, the superstar person became an important element of popular music. From the fame and economic success surrounding such superstars, subcultures continued to arise, such as the rock and punk movements, only perpetuated by the corporate machine that also shaped the musical aspect of popular music.|$|E
30|$|After {{a review}} of the {{detailed}} disclosure in the two series of reports, we note that first, the different <b>corporate</b> <b>nature</b> of the two firms has greatly affected their respective positioning in the business, as well as their attitude towards sustainability management and reporting. Second, the composition of stakeholder group for the two firms is different, which is again linked to their different <b>corporate</b> <b>nature.</b> And third, if we relate the three aspects of information disclosed in the reports to the fundamental conceptual framework of sustainability reporting: the famous ‘Triple bottom line’ (TBL, cf. Elkington, 1997), it seems that the central part of all the reports—that is “food safety”—represents the financial dimension of sustainability (rather than the environmental and social ones); and that the ‘bottom lines’ have been set quite low in the sense that producing safe food is recognised as the most essential competence that guarantees the firm’s economic viability and ethical values. This is very likely due to the vulnerable nature of the agricultural industry itself in terms of its comparatively low profitability (da Silva et al., 2009; Gao, 2006; Saporta, 2011), and due to the broader socio-political context in China as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine why female {{directors}} were able to achieve success in the silent era of Hollywood, but were all but erased from the production process after the addition of sound. This will be accomplished by examining the lives and careers of prominent female directors in both the silent and sound eras of Hollywood, mainly Lois Weber, Alice Guy-Blache, Dorothy Arzner, Ida Lupino, and Elaine May. The career trajectories of these women will be compared with statistics about the employment of women in Hollywood at the time. The paper will also feature critical analysis about the roles of women both in front of and behind the camera, and how shifting ideas about gender roles impacted the work that women were able to find. Finally, the increasingly <b>corporate,</b> capitalistic <b>nature</b> of sound era Hollywood will be examined to provide context about the industry that female directors were edged out of.
