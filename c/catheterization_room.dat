This same year, Governor John C. West presided over the ground breaking ceremony for the $3.5 million ambulatory care, education, and administration building. The project was funded in 1970 by the Appalachia Fund and Spartanburg County. The building offered a modern outpatient service unit and an Emergency Department equal to the task of serving 40,000 patients a year. Outpatient services allowed family practice residents to care for their patients with an emphasis on avoiding hospitalization. The new facility offered complete outpatient services in X-Ray and medical laboratories and also included the physical therapy department, the medical records department, and the medical consortium between the hospital and the Medical University of South Carolina for the training of senior medical students.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{application}} of radionuclides in cardiology, fifty years ago, {{a lot of}} invasive and noninvasive techniques have been developed. Invasive methods, performed in the <b>catheterization</b> <b>room,</b> have increased our comprehension of physiopathological mechanisms in congestive heart failure and coronary insufficiency. Noninvasive methods have allowed assessment of regional left ventricular wall motion and ejection fraction of myocardial perfusion at rest and after exercise and of intracardiac shunts, in ambulatory patients. Most of these methods have been developed {{in the last two}} decades, and particularly in the last few years. Technical improvements, like scintillation cameras, computers and short-lived tracers, have considerably improved their possibilities. Newer techniques, like positron imaging with three-dimensional reconstruction, current use of ultra-short life indicators and further refinements in radio-immunoassays, will undoubtedly increase our fundamental and clinical knowledge of congenital and acquired heart diseases.

30|$|According {{to recent}} guidelines, extracorporeal {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (ECPR) {{may be considered}} for patients with cardiac arrest of potentially reversible etiology during a limited period of mechanical support in settings {{where it can be}} rapidly implemented [1, 2]. ECPR, as an alternative resuscitative method for patients with refractory cardiac arrest despite advanced cardiac life support, has been undertaken in the emergency department (ED), intensive care unit, or <b>catheterization</b> <b>room</b> [3]. Survival to discharge rates of ECPR have been reported to be 4 – 36 % for adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and 34 – 46 % for adult in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) [4 – 7]; survival to discharge rates following conventional CPR (CCPR) have been estimated at 10 – 20 % for cardiac arrest [8 – 11]. Although ECPR was associated with a better outcome than CCPR, the wide range of outcomes is likely to result from the use of different participant selection criteria, protocols, and strategies, according to relevant regional emergency medical services and hospital response systems [12 – 15].|$|E
40|$|A {{conventional}} Anger {{camera is}} not adapted to bremsstrahlung imaging and, as a result, even using a reduced energy acquisition window, geometric x-rays represent < 15 % of the recorded events. This increases noise, limits the contrast, {{and reduces the}} quantification accuracy. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of energy spectra showed that a camera based on a 30 -mm-thick BGO crystal and equipped with a high energy pinhole collimator is well-adapted to bremsstrahlung imaging. The total scatter contamination is reduced by a factor 10 versus a conventional NaI camera equipped with a high energy parallel hole collimator enabling acquisition using an extended energy window ranging from 50 to 350 keV. By using the recorded event energy in the reconstruction method, shorter acquisition time and reduced orbit range will be usable allowing {{the design of a}} simplified mobile gantry. This is more convenient for use in a busy <b>catheterization</b> <b>room.</b> After injecting a safe activity, a fast single photon emission computed tomography could be performed without moving the catheter tip in order to assess the liver dosimetry and estimate the additional safe activity that could still be injected. Further long running time MC simulations of realistic acquisitions will allow assessing the quantification capability of such system. Simultaneously, a dedicated bremsstrahlung prototype camera reusing PMT-BGO blocks coming from a retired PET system is currently under design for further evaluation. © 2014 Walrand, Hesse, Wojcik, Lhommel and Jamar...|$|E

MethodsBetween April 2005 and July 2007, 366 consecutive patients underwent CABG surgery, with (n = 112) or without (n = 254) concomitant 1 -stop PCI (hybrid), all with completion angiography before chest closure. Among the 112 1 -stop hybrid CABG/PCI patients, 67 (60 %) underwent a planned hybrid procedure based on pre-operative assessment, whereas 45 (40 %) underwent open-chest PCI (unplanned hybrid) based on intraoperative findings. ResultsAmong the 796 CABG grafts (345 left internal mammary artery, 12 right internal mammary artery/radial, and 439 veins), 97 (12 %) angiographic defects were identified. Defects were repaired with either a minor adjustment of the graft (n = 22, 2. 8 %), with intraoperative open-chest PCI (unplanned hybrid, n = 48, 6 %) or with traditional surgical revision (n = 27, 3. 4 %). Hybrid patients had clinical outcomes similar to standard CABG patients. ConclusionsRoutine completion angiography detected 12 % of grafts with important angiographic defects. One-stop hybrid coronary revascularization is reasonable, safe, and feasible.

40|$|Background: Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension is a complication of most congenital heart diseases. We sought {{to assess the}} effect of sildenafil on patients suffering from pulmonary {{arterial hypertension}} in association with congenital heart disease {{on the basis of}} clinical and echocardiographic parameters and compare the catheterization and treatment results so as to evaluate the predictive value of sildenafil on the operability of patients. Methods: After primary echocardiography, 21 patients were selected for the final study with a diagnosis of moderate-to-large ventricular septal defect and pulmonary artery hypertension. They were divided into 3 age groups: younger than one year, 1 to 2 years, and older than 2 years. Before and one hour after the consumption of sildenafil, the patients had their oxygen saturation and blood pressure measured. Additionally, the patients underwent echocardiography and cardiac catheterization.

Methods: To evaluate the clinical benefits of respiratory management using supraglottic airways (SGAs) under deep sedation while monitoring the bispectral (BIS) index during the PVAI and the durations from admission to the <b>catheterization</b> <b>room</b> to starting the radiofrequency energy delivery (Time α), and from starting the radiofrequency energy delivery to completion of the PVAI (Time β), X-ray time, frequency of dislocations of the three-dimensional maps (D 3 DM), procedure-related complications, and proportion of an AF-free rate 15 months after the PVAI (PAFFR) in patients who received deep sedation without SGAs (Group A: n= 48) and those with SGAs (Group B: n= 51) were evaluated. Results: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics, Time α (77 ± 3 versus 78 ± 2  min; p= 0. 816), complications of cardiac tamponade (2 % versus 2 %; p= 0. 966), or PAFFR (81 % versus 88 %; p= 0. 313) between the two groups. However, the Time β (84 ± 4 versus 67 ± 3; p= 0. 001), X-ray time (53 ± 2 versus 34 ± 2; p< 0. 001), and minor complications of nasal bleeding (25 % versus 0 %; p= 0. 001) were significantly shorter and lower in Group B than in Group A, in accordance with a reduction in the hypoxia (15 % versus 0 %; p= 0. 007) and D 3 DM (31 % versus 8 %; p= 0. 003).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of energy therapy Method on anxiety and incidence of cardiac dysrhythmia in patients under catheterization. "nThe investigated units consisted of 68 patients that were randomly assigned into 3 groups: 26 patients in case group, 21 patients in placebo group and 21 patients in control group. The case group underwent the course of study through energy therapy method for 10 - 15 minutes,one hour before catheterization. Furthemore, placebo group received mimic energy therapy within the same period of time, i. e (the method was the same as energy therapy except in this method no energy was transferred, and the procedure was unreal and mimicking). Moreover the control group received no treatment. "nFor collection of data, the questionare and observation checklist were used. "nThe anxiety of the patients was measured through speilberger anxiety -test, an hour before and during catheterization. "nThe cardiac dysrhythmia and dysrhythmia during catheterization were recorded on an observation checklist. "nThe results showed that energy therapy had a significant effect on the situational anxiety of the investigated units in case group and through energy therapy, their anxiety were reduced, (p= 000) however, it had no considerable effect on the anxiety related to the characteristic of the individuals.

40|$|ObjectiveDoppler echocardiography, {{including}} tissue Doppler imaging, {{is widely}} applied to assess diastolic left ventricular function using early transmitral flow velocity combined with mitral annular velocity as a noninvasive estimate of left ventricular filling pressures. However, {{the accuracy of}} early transmitral flow velocity/mitral annular velocity in patients with heart failure, particularly after extensive cardiac surgery, is debated. Global diastolic strain rate during isovolumic relaxation obtained with 2 -dimensional speckle-tracking analysis was recently proposed as an alternative approach to estimate left ventricular filling pressures. MethodsWe analyzed diastolic function in patients with heart failure after surgical ventricular restoration and/or restrictive mitral annuloplasty. Echocardiography, including tissue Doppler imaging and speckle-tracking analysis, was performed to determine early transmitral flow velocity/atrial transmitral flow velocity, isovolumetric relaxation time, deceleration time, early transmitral flow velocity/mean mitral annular velocity, strain rate during isovolumic relaxation, and early transmitral flow velocity/strain rate during isovolumic relaxation. These noninvasive indices were correlated with relaxation time constant Tau, peak rate of pressure decline, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure obtained in the <b>catheterization</b> <b>room</b> using high-fidelity pressure catheters. ResultsTwenty-three patients were analyzed 6 months after restrictive mitral annuloplasty (n = 8), surgical ventricular restoration (n = 4), or a combined procedure (n = 11). The strongest correlation with invasive indices, in particular left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, was found for strain rate during isovolumic relaxation (r = − 0. 76, P <. 001). Early transmitral flow velocity/mean mitral annular velocity did not correlate significantly {{with any of the}} invasive indices. Strain rate during isovolumic relaxation (cutoff value < 0. 38 s− 1) accurately predicted left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 16 mm Hg or more with 100 % sensitivity and 93 % specificity. ConclusionsIn a group of patients with heart failure who were investigated 6 months after cardiac surgery, early transmitral flow velocity/mean mitral annular velocity correlated poorly with invasively obtained diastolic indexes. Global strain rate during isovolumic relaxation, however, correlated well with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and peak rate of pressure decline. Our data suggest that global strain rate during isovolumic relaxation is a promising noninvasive index to assess left ventricular filling pressures in patients with heart failure after extensive cardiac surgery, including restrictive mitral annuloplasty and surgical ventricular restoration...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. In {{patients}} with chest pain suggestive of variant angina, we performed this prospective study {{to test the}} specificity and diagnostic validity of ergonovine echocardiography (detection of regional wall motion abnormality during bedside ergonovine challenge) as a screening procedure before coronary angiography. Background. Spasm provocation test outside the <b>catheterization</b> <b>room</b> has generally not been accepted as a safe diagnostic method. Methods. Ergonovine echocardiography was performed in 80 consecutive {{patients with}} chest pain syndrome after confirmation of negative treadmill or normal stress myocardial perfusion scan results using thallium- 201. A bolus of ergonovine maleate was injected at 5 -min intervals up to a total cumulative dosage of 0. 35 mg with echocardiographic monitoring of left ventricular wall motion. A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was also recorded every 3 min after each ergonovine injection. Positive test results were development of regional wall motion abnormalities or transient ST segment elevation or depression > 0. 1 mV in any single lead of the 12 -lead ECG. Coronary angiography was undertaken within 2 ± 4 days (mean ± SD) after ergonovine echocardiography, and the spasm provocation test with acetylcholine or ergonovine was performed in patients with normal angiographic findings or lumen diameter narrowing < 70 %. Results. On the basis of angiographic criteria, 56 patients had coronary vasospasm; this finding was later ruled out in 19 patients with near-normal angiographic results by a negative response on the spasm provocation test. In the remaining five patients, coronary spasm provocation was not performed because they revealed {{a high degree of}} fixed stenosis (lumen diameter narrowing 97 ± 4 %). Ergonovine echocardiography could diagnose coronary vasospasm before angiography, with a sensitivity of 91 % (51 of 56 patients, 95 % confidence interval [ci] 84 % to 98 %) and specificity of 88 % (21 of 24 patients, 95 % CI 75 % to 100 %). Of 53 patients showing regional wall motion abnormalities during ergonovine echocardiography, characteristic ST segment elevation in the simultaneously recorded ECG was observed in only 20 (38 %). There were no complications, including myocardial infarction or fatal arrhythmia, during the test. Conclusions. Ergonovine echocardiography before coronary angiography is safe and {{can be used as a}} reliable diagnostic screening test for coronary vasospasm in patients with negative treadmill or normal stress myocardial perfusion scan results. These findings suggest that invasive coronary angiography can be avoided in selected patients for the diagnosis of vasospastic angina...|$|E
