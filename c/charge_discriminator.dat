40|$|A {{symmetric}} positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) spectrometer using a charge-to-digital converters was designed. It {{is based}} on a coincidence circuit for the trigger and recording of the timing and the charge of the pulses of two scintillation detectors. The off-line data processing allows a detailed study of the spectrometer performance in function of the width of the digital <b>charge</b> <b>discriminator</b> windows for acceptance of the pulses as starts and stops. Some technical problems when working with BaF_ 2 scintillators were solved. The parasitic effect of the pileup and backscattered γ-rays on the PAL spectrum is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{monolithic}} {{prototype for}} the analogue readout of the Scintillator Pad Detector (SPD) of the LHCb Calorimeter is presented. A low power version that works at 3. 3 V {{has been designed}} using the 0. 8 µm BiCMOS technology of AMS. It consists on a <b>charge</b> <b>discriminator</b> with a dual path structure formed by an integrator, a pile-up correction, a subtractor and a comparator. The chip also includes a DAC and serial digital control interface to program {{the threshold of the}} discriminator. Design, simulation and test results for different prototypes of the circuit will be presented and described. I. INTRODUCTION. The LHCb calorimetry [1] has four elements: a hadroni...|$|E
40|$|The calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) {{directly}} binds to membrane transport proteins {{to modulate}} their function {{in response to}} changes in intracellular calcium concentrations. Because CaM recognizes and binds {{to a wide variety}} of target sequences, identifying CaM-binding sites is difficult, requiring intensive sequence gazing and extensive biochemical analysis. Here, we describe a straightforward computational script that rapidly identifies canonical CaM-binding motifs within an amino acid sequence. Analysis of the target sequences from high resolution CaM-peptide structures using this script revealed that CaM often binds to sequences that have multiple overlapping canonical CaM-binding motifs. The addition of a positive <b>charge</b> <b>discriminator</b> to this meta-analysis resulted in a tool that identifies potential CaM-binding domains within a given sequence. To allow users to search for CaM-binding motifs within a protein of interest, perform the meta-analysis, and then compare the results to target peptide-CaM structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank, we created a website and online database. The availability of these tools and analyses will facilitate the design of CaM-related studies of ion channels and membrane transport proteins...|$|E
40|$|A new hybrid imaging {{detector}} is described {{that is being}} developed {{for the next generation}} adaptive optics (AO) wavefront sensors. The detector consists of proximity focused microchannel plates (MCPs) read out by pixelated CMOS application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips developed at CERN ("Medipix 2 "). Each Medipix 2 pixel has an amplifier, lower and upper <b>charge</b> <b>discriminators,</b> and a 14 -bit chounter. The 256 x 256 array can be read out noiselessly (photon counting) in 286 us. The Medipix 2 is buttable on 3 sides to produce 512 x(n* 256) pixel devices. The readout can be electronically shuttered down to a terporal window of a few microseconds with an accuracy of 10 ns. Good quantum efficiencies can be achieved from the x-ray (open faced with opaque photocathodes) to the optical (sealed tube with multialkali or GaAs photocathode) ...|$|R

40|$|GOSSIPO- 3 is a {{demonstrator}} of a front-end chip {{designed in}} IBM 130 nm CMOS in collaboration between Nikhef (Amsterdam) and the Physics Department of the University of Bonn for the read-out of Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors. The prototype features <b>charge</b> sensitive amplifiers, <b>discriminators,</b> a high resolution Time to Digital Converter (TDC), two different Low Drop Out (LDO) voltage regulators for supply voltage {{control of the}} Time to Digital Converter, biasing circuits and control logic on a 2 × 1 mm 2 die. The chip can be operated in a time measuring mode or an event counting mode. Following the prototype announcement at the TWEPP 2009, measurement data on gain, noise performance, channel to channel ToT spread and LDO load step responses is now available. The measurement results confirm the high gain and low noise (ENC = 25 e−) predicted by simulations. Stable and reproducible time bin sizes of the TDC are also confirmed...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} monolithic {{active pixel}} detectors, by exploiting the triple well option {{available in a}} deep-submicron CMOS process. The novel features are the full analog signal processing and digital functionality implemented at the pixel level. The charge collecting element is realized using the deep N-well (DNW), the full in-pixel signal processing chain includes <b>charge</b> preamplifier, shaper, <b>discriminator</b> and latch. We report on the characterization of the two prototype chips, the first (APSEL 0) containing single-channel sensors, with different collecting electrode area, and the latter (APSEL 1) with several single pixel structures with improved noise figure implementing also an 8 x 8 matrix of 50 x 50 mu m(2) pixel area. So far, the pixel matrix has a simple row by row readout, successfully tested with clock frequency up to 30 MHz. The response of the sensors to infra-red laser, beta-rays and soft X-rays (from radioactive sources, (90) Sr and (55) Fe respectively) will be presented. The results achieved so far demonstrate {{the viability of the}} technology and suggest new design improvements implemented in the next prototype chips submission (APSEL 2) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} monolithic {{active pixel}} detectors that exploit the triple well option of CMOS 130 nm technology to implement analog and {{digital signal processing}} at the pixel level. The charge collecting element is realized using the deep N-well (DNW) and partially overlaps the analog circuit. With this scheme {{we were able to}} implement a full in-pixel signal processing chain, composed of a <b>charge</b> preamplifier, shaper, <b>discriminator,</b> and latch. This approach has been validated by a first prototype (APSEL 0), and we report here on the extensive measurements performed on the second prototype (APSEL 1), containing various single pixel structures with analog readout and an 8 times 8 matrix of 50 times 50 mum 2 pixels with sequential digital readout. For 900 mum 2 pixels the equivalent noise charge has been measured to be 40 e-, with a S/N ratio of about 30 for the 55 Fe 5. 9 keV signal. The matrix readout has been tested up to 30 MHz and the crosstalk between pixels characterized. The threshold dispersion and the noise of the pixels in the matrix have been measured through noise scans. These measurements confirm the viability of the triple well process for MAPS fabrication, and indicate the design improvements for the next prototype chip (APSEL 2) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{different}} approach {{to the design of}} CMOS MAPS has recently been proposed. By exploiting the triple well option of a CMOS commercial process, a deep n-well (DNW) MAPS sensor has been realized with a full in-pixel signal processing chain: <b>charge</b> preamplifier, shaper, <b>discriminator</b> and a latch. This readout approach beeing compatible with data sparsification will improve the readout speed potential of MAPS sensors. The first protoype chips, realized with STMicroelectronics 130 nm triple well process, proved the new design proposed for DNW MAPS is viable with a good sensitivity to photons from 55 Fe and electrons from 90 Sr. Extensive tests performed to characterize the second generation of the APSEL chips based on the DNW MAPS design are reported. Small 3 times 3 pixel matrices with full analog output have been tested with radioactive sources to characterize charge collection. Pixel noise equivalent charge (ENC) of 50 e- and signal-to-noise ratio for MIPs of about 14 have been measured. Improved pixel noise and reduced threshold dispersion (about 100 e-) have been measured in the 8 times 8 matrix with a sequential readout. Based on the new DNW MAPS design a dedicated fast readout architecture to perform on-chip data sparsification is currently under development. The aim is to incorporate in the same detector the advantages of the thin CMOS sensors and similar functionalities as in hybrid pixels...|$|R
