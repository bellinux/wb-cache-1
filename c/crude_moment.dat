40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} a chronological {{overview}} of the recent developments in the compounding of distributions. An attempt {{has been made to}} obtain a compound of zero truncated generalized negative binomial distribution (Ztgnbd) with that of Generalized Beta Distribution (GBD). Factorial and ordinary <b>crude</b> <b>moments</b> of some zero truncated compound distributions have also been discussed. The compound is then specialized by varying the value of β in ((Ztgnbd)) ...|$|R
5000|$|Earl Sweatshirt's verse {{focuses on}} his {{control over his}} image, saying that he wants his critics and interns to name him at least a synonym of menace. AbsolutePunk said Sweatshirt {{describes}} [...] "how his technical ability as a rapper makes his more <b>crude</b> <b>moments</b> much more interesting {{than they would be}} if he just came out and said vulgar things without veiling them with dizzying rhymes and metaphors." [...] Writing for Consequence of Sound, Mike Madden called the opening blasphemy lyric, “Promise Heron I’ll put my fist up after I get my dick sucked”, [...] "the Doris line that stays lodged in my head..." [...] Billboard described [...] "Hive" [...] as [...] "the first track Doris where Earl's rapping style (of trying to cram as many words into a short phrase as possible) starts to feel slightly repetitive", and found Sweatshirt's [...] "emphasis on syllables" [...] similar to that on his previous track [...] "Earl". Vince Staples' rap differentiates with Sweatshirt's, and references the Holocaust in which, according to SPIN, it [...] "injects the small-town terror vibes with some heavy subject matter..." ...|$|R
40|$|Lipases {{are natural}} {{catalysts}} widely employed to structure various lipids, {{fats and oils}} in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries. Despite their high potential in lipid biotechnology, current application of microbial lipases has been limited owing to high costs and limited availability. During the last two decades, research efforts have been directed towards the identification of low cost and GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) lipases sources. Plant lipases from species with oil seeds have been widely studied, though their application {{has turned out to}} be disappointing, due to low activity and transient expression during seed germination. In the early nineties, research into in non seed tissues showed high lipolytic activity in the latex of some species of Caricaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Asclepiadaceae. At the <b>moment,</b> <b>crude</b> dried latex from Carica papaya is the most studied biocatalyst in lipid synthesis and modification, but little is known about the physiological role of C. papaya lipase or the applications of other latex lipases. In this paper we report more than ten years of research into the characterisation of plant-latex lipases roles and applications...|$|R
