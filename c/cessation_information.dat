40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} current smokers’ communication format preferences for receiving smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> in a lung cancer screening setting. A cross-sectional correlational design using survey methodology with 159 screening-eligible current smokers was the method used. Data was dichotomized (digital versus traditional preference) and analyzed using Pearson’s chi-squared test, Mann-Whitney U test, and logistic regression. Race was a statistically significant predictor with White participants having four times greater odds of reporting preference for a digital format for receiving smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> such as social media and/or supportive text messages (OR: 4. 06; p = 0. 004). Lung cancer screening is a new venue where current long-term smokers can be offered information about smoking cessation while they are engaging in a health-promoting behavior and potentially more likely to contemplate quitting. It is important to consider the communication format preference of current smokers to support cessation uptake. This study is the first to examine communication format preference of current smokers in the context of the lung cancer screening venue. Key differences noted by race support the need for further research examining multiple formats of communication with efforts to maximize options in the cancer screening setting...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{work is a}} high-risk, {{transient}} occupation. Worksite {{outreach programs}} for cancer risk assessment are highly warranted because workers are exposed to both occupational and environmental carcinogens. We examined the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a paired cancer risk assessment and cancer prevention intervention using “lunch trucks ” among construction worksites as the delivery mechanism. Among the 57 completed questionnaires from construction workers on a Miami-Dade County construction high-rise apartment building site, there were 50 (88 %) males and 29 (51 %) white Hispanics. Over 54 % of the construction workers were current smokers of cigarettes, 3. 5 % chewed tobacco, and 19. 3 % smoked cigars. Of the current smokers, 80. 1 % expressed interest in quitting smoking, and 64. 9 % were willing to receive smoking cessation materials free of charge from a lunch truck at the construction site.

40|$|Objective. To {{identify}} {{predictors of}} injection cessation among Montreal active {{injection drug users}} (IDUs). Design. Subjects were selected from the St. Luc Cohort, a prospective study that has accrued IDUs since 1988. Subjects were eligible if they completed at least 3 visits between 1995 and 1999. Predictors of sustained and of short injection cessation were examined using logistic and Cox proportional regression. Results. Sustained injection cessation was negatively associated with injection frequency, {{a surrogate marker of}} addiction severity. Getting syringes at needle exchange programs or pharmacies impacted positively on the ability of moderate users to initiate and sustain injection cessation. Recent exposure to addiction treatment predicted the occurrence of a short injection cessation episode. This association was stronger among participants reporting longer exposure to treatment. Conclusion. These findings suggest that harm reduction and addiction treatment interventions can influence the occurrence of injection <b>cessation.</b> This <b>information</b> is important for social and health policy planning...|$|R
40|$|Parents of {{children}} with cancer use information to create knowledge about their child's disease. Information can help parents reduce chaos and create a feeling of control, but there are often obstacles to its acquisition, which {{has been described as}} similar to learning a new language. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe parents' experiences of acquiring and using information to create knowledge about their child's cancer during the course of the illness. The authors used qualitative content analysis on data from focus groups and individual interviews with 14 parents {{of children}} with cancer. Two themes were constructed: (a) feeling acknowledged as a person of significance included feeling safe and secure in spite of uncertainty, having one's hopes supported, and getting relief from other families' experiences; (b) feeling like an unwelcome guest included feeling abandoned at important milestones, feeling forced to nag for information, and feeling burdened by the obligation to inform others.

40|$|Background Whilst {{there has}} been no clear {{consensus}} on the potential for earlier diagnosis of lung cancer, recent research has suggested that the time between symptom onset and consultation can be long enough to plausibly affect prognosis. In this article, we present findings from a qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with patients who had been diagnosed with lung cancer (n[*]=[*] 11), and people who were at heightened risk of developing the disease (n[*]=[*] 14). Methods A grounded theory methodology was drawn upon to conduct thematic and narrative based approaches to analysis. Results The paper focuses on three main themes which emerged from the study: i) fatalism and resignation in pathways to help-seeking and the process of diagnosis; ii) Awareness of smoking risk and response to <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> and advice. iii) The role of social and other networks on help-seeking. Key findings included: poor awareness among participants of the symptoms of lung cancer; ambivalence about the dangers of smoking; the perception of lung cancer as part of a homogenisation of multiple illnesses; close social networks as a key trigger in help-seeking. Conclusions We suggest that future smoking cessation and lung cancer awareness campaigns could usefully capitalise on the influence of close social networks, and would benefit from taking a ‘softer’ approach...|$|E
40|$|The aim was {{to better}} {{understand}} structural fac-tors associatedwith uptake of automated tailored interventions for smoking cessation. In a pro-spective randomized controlled trial with inter-ventions only offered, notmandated, participants were randomized based on the following: web-based expert system (QuitCoach); text messaging program (onQ); both as an integrated package; the choice of using either or both; or a control condition informed of a static website (not con-sidered here). Participants were 3530 smokers or recent quitters recruited from two sources; those seeking smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>information,</b> mostly recruited over the phone, and a cold-contacted group recruited from an Internet panel. More participants (60. 1 %) initially accepted the inter-vention they had been offered than used it (42. 5 %).

40|$|Nicotine {{replacement}} therapy (NRT), {{in the form}} of gumand patches, is now sold in Canadian pharmacies with-out a prescription. This change has put pharmacists on the front line of contact with patients considering the use of NRT for smoking cessation. However, {{little is known about the}} readiness of Canadian pharmacists to assume this par-ticular role or, for that matter, to assume proactive smoking cessation roles with all patients who smoke. In particular, it is not known whether practising pharmacists want further education on topics related to smoking cessation. Pharmacists are well positioned to advise patients about quitting smoking. 1, 2 Furthermore, it has been shown that quit rates are higher among patients who receive smoking cessation advice from trained pharmacists paired with the use of NRT than among patients who use NRT without advice. 3 - 6 Advice from pharmacists is a cost-effective way for the health care system to deliver smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> 7 - 10; in addition, patients who receive such advice from pharmacists report high levels of satisfaction with the service. 11, 12 Despite the evidence that pharmacists can significantly affect patients ’ smoking habits, tobacco-related undergrad-uate education in Canada is less than ideal. 13, 14 In a US study, few practising community pharmacists reported that they had received training in advising patients on quittin...|$|E
40|$|Antismoking helplines {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of tobacco control efforts in many countries, including Italy. The demonstrated efficacy and the convenience of telephone based counselling have led to the fast adoption of antismoking helplines. However, information on how these helplines operate in actual practice is not often readily available. This paper provides an overview of the Italian Antismoking Helpline, an increasingly popular telephone service for tobacco problems operating in Italy since 2000. As many states, regions and nations are contemplating various telephone programs as part of large scale anti-tobacco campaigns, this paper briefly discusses the reasons the helpline is well suited to lead the cessation component of a comprehensive tobacco control program, how it operates and how it can be used in conjunction with other tobacco control activities. The Italian Antismoking Helpline provides Italians with free services that include counselling, <b>cessation</b> related <b>information,</b> self help quit kits and current legislation information.

40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{explored}} conditions and consequences of information systems adoption and use, few {{have focused on the}} final stages of the information system lifecycle. In this paper, I develop a theoretical and an initial empirical contribution to understanding individuals’ intentions to discontinue the use of an information system.

In this paper, I offer a new conceptualization of factors determining users’ intentions to discontinue the use of information systems. I then report on a preliminary empirical test of the model using data from a field study of information system users in a promotional planning routine in a large retail organization. Results from the empirical analysis provide first empirical support for the theoretical model.

40|$|Although the {{prevalence}} of smoking has declined among US adults, an estimated 22. 5 % {{of the adult population}} (45. 8 million adults) regularly smoked in 2002. Starting from this level, it will not be possible to achieve the Healthy People national health objectives of a reduction in {{the prevalence}} of smoking among adults to less than 12 % by 2010 unless the rate of smoking cessation substantially rises from its current average of about 2. 5 %/year. To achieve that goal it is imperative that we better understand what factors are associated with successful quitting so that policies and resources can be better targeted. We describe the socioeconomic characteristics of smokers who attempt to and successfully quit and show how those characteristics differ across three methods they use in their cessation behavior. The results highlight socioeconomic differences across the methods smokers use and provide evidence {{that can be used to}} better target smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> and resources to smokers most likely to use particular methods. Better targeting is likely to lead to more quits. While it is unlikely that cessation rates can be raised by enough to achieve the reduction in national smoking prevalence that the Healthy People initiative has set, a better understanding of who chooses which method will move us closer to that goal.

40|$|Background Smoking during {{pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} a number of health risks for mother and baby, such as stillbirth, low birth weight, preterm delivery, placenta pathology and SIDS. The preconceptional and prenatal period is considered as the ideal teaching moment for smoking cessation counseling, therefore women should be informed about benefits of smoking cessation programs. Purpose The national campaign in Belgium, in which counseling was partially reimbursed, had little success with pregnant women. Therefore we want to examine if gynecologists and midwives know the risks of smoking {{during pregnancy}}, what their attitudes are regarding smoking cessation and what they advise their clients. Method We used a qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews with gynecologists and midwives. We used content analysis to interpret the transcribed verbatim and to extract emergent themes and codes. In order to control subjectivity in analysis triangulation was used. Ethics approval was received from the Ethical Committee of the University Hospital of Ghent.

40|$|Abstract Background Tobacco use, {{particularly}} smoking, is {{the most}} preventable {{cause of death in}} the United States. More than 400, 000 premature deaths are associated with its use and the health care costs are in the billions. All health care provider groups should be concerned with patients who continue to smoke and use tobacco. The US Preventive Services Taskforce and Health People 2010 guidelines encourage providers to counsel smokers on cessation. Current studies, though limited regarding chiropractic advising practices indicate a low engagement rate when it comes to providing <b>cessation</b> <b>information.</b> Objective To test a campaign regarding initial impact aimed at increasing chiropractic interns advising on cessation and delivery of information to smokers on cessation. Discussion Chiropractic interns do engage patients on smoking status and can be encouraged to provide more cessation messages and information to patients. The initial impact assessment of this campaign increased the provision of information to patients by about 25 %. The prevalence of smoking among chiropractic patients, particularly at teaching clinics may be lower than the national averages. Conclusion Chiropractic interns can and should be encouraged to advise smokers about cessation. A systematic method of intake information on smoking status is needed and a standardized education protocol for chiropractic colleges is needed. Chiropractic colleges should assess the adequacy of their advising roles and implement changes to increase cessation messages to their patients as soon as possible. </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{assessed}} {{the association between}} smoking cessation and prospective weight change in the European population of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol, Cessation of smoking, Eating out of home And obesity (EPIC-PANACEA) project. METHODS: The study involved more than 300, 000 healthy volunteers, recruited between 1992 and 2000 in 9 European countries, who provided data on anthropometry and smoking habits at baseline and after a follow-up of 5 years on average. Adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models were used to obtain sex-specific summary estimates of the association between the change in smoking status and the annual change in weight. RESULTS: Smoking cessation tends {{to be followed by}} weight gain; when compared to stable smokers, annual weight gain was higher in men (0. 44 kg (95 %CI: 0. 36; 0. 52)) and women (0. 46 kg (95 %CI: 0. 41; 0. 52)) who stopped smoking during follow-up. When smokers who stopped smoking at least 1 year before recruitment were compared to never smokers, no major differences in annual weight gain were observed. The excess weight gain following smoking cessation appears to mainly occur in the first years following the cessation. CONCLUSIONS: When considering the benefits of smoking cessation, such findings strengthen the need for promoting <b>cessation</b> offering <b>information</b> on weight gain control and support to weight-concerned smokers in order to remove a barrier to quitting...|$|R
40|$|Background: American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) {{communities}} confront some of {{the highest}} rates of tobacco use and its sequelae.

Results: Interviews were held with 20 adult AI/AN current and former tobacco users, 12 healthcare providers, and 9 tribal leaders. An emergent theme from data analysis was that current tobacco screening and <b>cessation</b> efforts lack <b>information</b> on electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use.

40|$|Although the {{majority}} of adolescents in the 13 – 18 age range are at school, {{there is a need}} to target specific groups of young smokers such as unemployed youth. For those young people who are not at school, few directed programs are available in either prevention or <b>cessation</b> and <b>information</b> is needed about the design and delivery of appropriate programs for this population. This report presents the results from a survey of unemployed youth and students at vocational colleges about various aspects of smoking cessation. The majority of out-of-school youth smokers had not tried to quit, but 52 % were contemplating action to quit. Only a quarter of the smokers had quit for more than a week. Few young smokers would use a recognised program though more females would change to a lower nicotine brand, quit with the help of a friend or participate in a group quit program. The method of quitting most would recommend to peers is ‘use of will power’. Incentives to quit were attractive to only a third of the smokers, and many enhancing and inhibiting factors for participation in programs were identified. In particular, efforts to quit increased their confidence in quitting, supporting the need to assist those who are contemplating action to quit. Programs need to incorporate input from youth and be tailored for them but not necessarily for different groups such as non-secondary school students and unemployed youth...|$|R
40|$|Most former {{cigarette}} smokers in the United States {{have stopped}} without formal assistance. However, {{a large proportion}} of smokers desire and seek help other than by attending formal programs. It is important to recognize what factors are likely to influence the effectiveness of smoking cessation attempts among these persons. The authors report results of a prospective cohort study of 1, 552 smokers who called a stop smoking hotline to request self-help smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>information.</b> The participants were classified into three groups based on reports at the 6 -month followup: 242 quitters, 497 recidivists, and 813 nonquitters. Baseline and followup data were used to evaluate three comparisons: quitters versus nonquitters, quitters versus recidivists, and recidivists versus nonquitters. Nonquitters appear to be less motivated and more doubtful of their abilities to quit successfully compared with the other two groups. Quitters appear to live in a supportive environment for smoking cessation. Heavier smokers are more hesitant to try to quit, but once they make an attempt they are as likely to succeed as lighter smokers, when other factors are kept constant. Efforts to promote environments supportive of smoking cessation are likely to result in a larger number of successful quitters. Similarly, efforts to strengthen motivation and belief in personal ability to quit are likely to encourage more nonquitters to attempt to stop smoking. Finally, it appears that some smokers need a previous quit attempt before they are able to maintain cessation successfully...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between physicians' smoking behaviors and their attitudes toward tobacco use by their patients and tobacco control in the Ukraine, a 70 -item questionnaire was administered to 799 general practitioners (287 men and 512 women) working in both rural (278 physicians) and urban (521 physicians) areas of three regions of Ukraine. In all, 13. 9 % of physicians were current smokers and 21. 6 % reported being past smokers, with significantly (P less than 0. 001) more men than women being current or past smokers. Odds ratios from logistic regression analysis reveal that physicians who are heavy smokers are 26 % less likely to record tobacco use by patients than medium smokers. Heavy smokers devote significantly less effort to providing <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> to patients and are 36 % less likely to support the complete prohibition of smoking in the physician's workplace. Older physicians, female physicians and physicians working in urban areas are significantly more likely than younger, male and rural physicians to advise their patients on smoking. The provision of smoking cessation to patients by general practitioners in Ukraine is influenced by several factors, a major one being the smoking status of the physician. If smoking among physicians declines, this will encourage the patient to consider a serious quit attempt in several ways, most notably: (1) physicians act as societal role models and can promote non-smoking as a norm and (2) the likelihood that a patient will be provided smoking cessation counseling increases...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Feasible {{interventions}} promoting tobacco cessation need to {{be implemented}} in psychiatric hospitals, where high proportions of patients are heavy smokers. This pilot study examined the feasibility of a new brief motivational intervention associating positive experiences with temporary smoking cessation. Methods: One-day interventions were proposed to 19 smokers hospitalized for severe mental disorders. The multicomponent intervention comprised a 25 -hour tobacco <b>cessation</b> period, <b>information</b> about smoking, attending thermal baths and music therapy sessions, intensive group support and feedback sessions. Expired carbon monoxide was monitored and nicotine replacement was available. Patients were evaluated before, {{during and after the}} intervention. Results: Most participants were heavy smokers (68. 4 %) and precontemplative about smoking cessation (52. 6 %). Rates of successful smoking abstinence were 78. 9 % after 10 hours and 47. 4 % at 25 hours; 15. 8 % stopped for 3 days or more. Median CO level decreased from 24 to 9 ppm. Patients reported high levels of general well-being and satisfaction during the abstinence day. Psychiatric condition did not deteriorate and frequency of withdrawal symptoms was low. 84 % of patients used nicotine replacement.

40|$|Background To {{increase}} {{knowledge of}} smoking-related health risks and provide smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> {{at the point}} of sale, in 2009, New York City required the posting of graphic point-of-sale tobacco health warnings in tobacco retailers. This study is the first to evaluate the impact of such a policy in the USA. Methods Cross-sectional street-intercept surveys conducted among adult current smokers and recent quitters before and after signage implementation assessed the awareness and impact of the signs. Approximately 10 street-intercept surveys were conducted at each of 50 tobacco retailers in New York City before and after policy implementation. A total of 1007 adults who were either current smokers or recent quitters were surveyed about the awareness and impact of tobacco health warning signs. Multivariate risk ratios (RR) were calculated to estimate awareness and impact of the signs. Results Most participants (86 %) were current smokers, and the sample was 28 % AfricaneAmerican, 32 % Hispanic/Latino and 27 % non-Hispanic white. Awareness of tobacco health warning signs more than doubled after the policy implementation (adjusted RR 2. 01, 95 % CI 1. 74 to 2. 33). Signage posting was associated with an 11 % increase in the extent to which signs made respondents think about quitting smoking (adjusted RR 1. 11, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 1. 22).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to measure the degree of adherence by public health care providers to a policy that requires them to implement minimal contact intervention for tobacco cessation with their clients. This study also described what components of the intervention {{may have contributed to the}} adherence of the policy and how health care providers felt about adhering to the policy. The intervention consisted of a policy for implementation of minimal contact intervention, changes to documentation, a health care provider mentor trained, a training session for health care providers, and ongoing paper and people supports for implementation. Data for this study were collected through a health care provider questionnaire, focus group interviews, and a compliance protocol including a chart audit. The findings of this study showed a high degree of adherence to the policy, that health care providers thought minimal contact intervention was important to conduct with their clients, and that health care providers felt supported to implement the intervention. No statistically significant difference was found between new and experienced health care providers on 17 of the 18 questions on the health care provider questionnaire. However there was a statistically significant difference between new and experienced health care providers with respect to their perception that “clients often feel like they have to accept tobacco <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> from me. ” Changes could be made to the minimal contact intervention and to documentation of the intervention.

40|$|Introduction: Maximizing smoking {{abstinence}} in {{lung cancer}} screening participants {{is important to}} reduce individual risk of disease and improve screening cost-effectiveness; however, the optimal strategy remains undefined. We hypothesized that a single session of tailored face-to-face counseling {{on the day of}} screening CT scan, coupled with audio and printed <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> would be feasible to deliver in a CT screening trial. Methods: We randomized volunteer smokers in the Queensland Lung Cancer Screening Study to intervention (counseling session, audio quit materials, printed quit materials, Quitline contact details) or control group (printed quit materials, Quitline contact details). Participants self-reported point prevalence quit rates at 1 year. Results: Fifty-five smokers were enrolled; 28 randomized to intervention and 27 controls. Median cigarette consumption was 25 /day; 54 / 55 smoked at least 15 cigarettes per day. Median smoking duration was 46 years. Median Fagerström dependence score was 6. In total 58 % did not report any quit attempt in the prior 12 months. Mean duration of counseling was 26. 5 minutes. After 1 year, four participants (14. 3 %) in the intervention group and five participants (18. 5 %) in the control group had quit (P =. 74). Combined annual point prevalence quit rate was 16. 4 %. Conclusions: Although feasible to deliver a single session of tailored counseling on the day of screening this intervention had no discernible impact on cessation over and above printed materials and Quitline access. As participants exhibited hardcore smoking characteristics, more intensive strategies, in larger cohorts, should be explored. Implications: The optimal smoking cessation strategy within a lung cancer screening program is not known. This study demonstrates that a single session of counseling can be feasibly delivered on the day of screening but may not have been intensive enough for long-term, hard-core smokers...|$|E

Objective: The {{current study}} {{examined}} the effectiveness of an institutional intervention aimed at decreasing prevalence of tobacco use and exposure to smoke on campus over a 4 -year pe-riod. Participants: Participants were undergraduate students (N = 4, 947) enrolled at a large Midwestern university between 2007 and 2010. Methods: In 2008, tobacco use was banned on campus. Ad-ditionally, campus-wide tobacco <b>cessation</b> services and <b>information</b> were provided to all students. A self-report measure assessing de-mographics, smoking prevalence, attitudes, and smoke exposure was administered at baseline and at 3 time points over the following 3 years. Results: The percentage of more frequent smokers and less frequent smokers decreased across assessment points. The program appeared to be less effective for female smokers than male smokers. Further, {{a significant change in}} attitudes and secondhand smoke ex-posure was observed. Conclusions: It appears that a campus-wide tobacco ban is a well-accepted and effective prevention method for smoking. This study lends considerable support for efforts towards smoke-free campuses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionTobacco {{smoking is}} the leading cause of {{preventable}} death worldwide. Educating and training medical students about tobacco dependence prevention and treatment will prepare them for the task of helping smokers quit. In Saudi Arabia, little is known about medical students’ knowledge on this topic. MethodsThis study was conducted among 237 medical students (89 % response rate) from three medical schools in Saudi Arabia. Students were asked to complete a 55 -item questionnaire about the knowledge of smoking epidemiology, smoking cessation practice and benefits, and treatment of tobacco dependence. ResultsThe majority of the students (91. 4 %) do not have adequate knowledge about the epidemiology of smoking. Students demonstrated a low knowledge of the health risks associated with tobacco use (average score 53 %; SD= 11. 6), a fair understanding of the benefits of smoking <b>cessation,</b> and insufficient <b>information</b> about treatment of tobacco dependence. Respondents thought they were adequately prepared to counsel their patients to quit smoking. ConclusionsMedical students in Saudi Arabia are not well informed and trained in tobacco dependence and treatment. It is necessary to address this deficit by prioritizing these topics in medical education curricula...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{analyses}} of Google search queries identified circaseptan (weekly) rhythms in smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> seeking, with Google searches for “quit” and “smoking” peaking {{early in the}} week. Similar patterns were observed for smoking cessation treatment seeking, such as calls to quitlines. These findings suggest that smoking cessation behaviors may have a weekly rhythm that could be leveraged to improve smoking cessation efforts. Aims: To assess whether weekly enrollment and usage patterns exist for an Internet smoking cessation intervention. Methods: We used process data from a large, longstanding Internet smoking cessation intervention (www. becomeanex. org). Pearson's chi-squared tests were performed to identify day-of-the week differences in enrollment, first visit to site community pages, and quit date. Differences were considered statistically significant at the 1 % level if p <  0. 00167 due to multiple comparisons. Regression {{analysis was used to}} examine differences in engagement activity based {{on the day of the}} week a user enrolled. Results: Website users (n =  69, 237) were more likely to enroll on the site at the beginning of the week (Mondays and Tuesdays) (p <  0. 0001). Current smokers who selected quit dates (n =  5574) preferred quit dates that came early in the week (Sundays and Mondays) compared to other weekdays (p <  0. 0001). Generally, there were no significant differences in overall website utilization metrics by day of enrollment, but there were some exceptions. Use of interactive features to select quit dates, track cigarette use, and record coping strategies was generally lower for Friday/Saturday enrollees. Conclusions: Consistent with prior research, the beginning of the week appears to be a time when individuals are more likely to enroll in an Internet smoking cessation intervention and engage with its core features. Emphasizing marketing and promotional efforts during the beginning of the week could result in greater reach of Internet smoking cessation interventions...|$|E

Culturally appropriate decision aids are expected {{to help people in}} the decision making for the use of smoking cessation medication. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a culturally tailored decision aid for smoking cessation and evaluate its effect on the use of smoking cessation medication. Patients and methods: A 7 -minute video on smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> and options was developed. Physicians were randomized into intervention and control groups. The decision aid was provided to patients in the intervention group, and they watched it, while those in the control group were provided usual medical care for smoking cessation. The primary outcome was the proportion of smokers who were prescribed smoking cessation medication within 1  month after consultation. The secondary outcomes were abstinence rate and use of smoking cessation medication within 6  months. A logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of the decision aid on the outcomes. Results: In total, 414 current smokers (intervention group: 195; control group: 219) were enrolled. The mean age of the participants was 48. 2  years, and 381 subjects (92 %) were males. In total, 11. 8 % of the participants in the intervention group and 10. 5 % in the control group were prescribed smoking cessation medications within 1  month. The odds ratio was 1. 02 (95 % CI: 0. 40 – 2. 63) after adjustment for baseline characteristics. Within 6  months, 17. 4 % of the participants in the intervention group and 15 % in the control group were prescribed medication (adjusted odds ratio 1. 12, 95 % CI: 0. 59 – 2. 13). Conclusion: The culturally tailored smoking cessation decision aid developed in this study did not show a significant impact on the decision to use smoking cessation medication. Further research to develop more effective and more interactive interventions is expected. Keywords: smoking, clustered randomized trial, decision aids, Kore...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} women {{continue}} to smoke in pregnancy despite the associated risks to their health and that of their unborn child. Little is known about their attitudes towards the smoking cessation support which is available to them and this thesis used a Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) approach to investigate this further. Study One was a qualitative investigation designed to elicit pregnant women's views about NHS Stop Smoking Services and Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). Interviews were conducted with 18 pregnant smokers, recent quitters and new mothers who smoked in pregnancy, and 18 health professionals working in smoking cessation services. A number of behavioural, normative and control beliefs were generated with respect to these behaviours. As there is evidence for inconsistent smoking cessation advice giving in pregnancy {{and a lack of}} confidence amongst health professionals in this area, a theory-based resource to facilitate the communication of smoking <b>cessation</b> <b>information</b> in pregnancy was developed in Study Two and tested in an exploratory randomised controlled trial. The 22 second year medical students who viewed the theory-based resource in preparation for a mock interview were not significantly better at eliciting the salient smoking cessation beliefs of the simulated patient (mean score 8. 41) than the 18 second year medical students who received a standard information resource (mean score 7. 67). However, the resource showed potential to facilitate the delivery of a more patient centred interview and is worthy of further testing. The themes generated in Study One were used to inform the development of a TPB questionnaire to predict NRT use in pregnancy (NRTP-LF) in Study Three. This questionnaire was completed by 100 pregnant smokers who were recruited from antenatal clinics and Stop Smoking Services. The NRTP-LF significantly predicted intention to use NRT in pregnancy, explaining 41. 1 % {{of the variance in the}} outcome variable, justifying the creation of a short form version of it (NRTPSF). In Study Four, the NRTP-SF was tested on a further sample of 204 pregnant smokers recruited from antenatal clinics and Stop Smoking Services and was also shown to have predictive validity with respect to intention to use NRT in pregnancy. It also significantly predicted interest in participation in a trial testing the efficacy and safety of NRT use in pregnancy. It is envisaged that the theory-based communication resource and the NRTP-SF could have practical utility in health care settings and the potential to increase smoking cessation service use and quit rates in pregnancy.

40|$|Background: Although {{evidence}} exists for {{the effectiveness of}} web-based smoking <b>cessation</b> interventions, <b>information</b> about the cost-effectiveness of these interventions is limited. Objective: The study investigated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of two web-based computer-tailored (CT) smoking cessation interventions (video- vs. text-based CT) compared to a control condition that received general text-based advice. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, respondents were allocated to the video-based condition (N = 670), the text based condition (N = 708) or the control condition (N = 721). Societal costs, smoking status, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; EQ- 5 D- 3 L) were assessed at baseline, six-and twelve-month follow-up. The incremental costs per abstinent respondent and per QALYs gained were calculated. To account for uncertainty, bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity analyses were carried out. Results: No {{significant differences were found}} in the three conditions regarding demographics, baseline values of outcomes and societal costs over the three months prior to baseline. Analyses using prolonged abstinence as outcome measure indicated that from a willingness to pay of J 1, 500, the video-based intervention was likely to be the most cost-effective treatment, whereas from a willingness to pay of J 50, 400, the text-based intervention was likely to be the most cost-effective. With regard to cost-utilities, when quality of life was used as outcome measure, the control condition had the highest probability of being the most preferable treatment. Sensitivity analyses yielded comparable results. Conclusion: The video-based CT smoking cessation intervention was the most cost-effective treatment for smoking abstinence after twelve months, varying the willingness to pay per abstinent respondent from J 0 up to J 80, 000. With regard to cost-utility, the control condition seemed to be the most preferable treatment. Probably, more time will be required to assess changes in quality of life. Future studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to investigate whether cost-utility results regarding quality of life may change in the long run...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Public Health Service (PHS) Guideline for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence (Fiore et al. 2000) {{recommends}} supporting {{autonomy and}} perceived competence to facilitate tobacco abstinence. Purpose: The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive tobacco-dependence intervention based on self-determination theory (SDT) and intended to support autonomy and perceived competence in facilitating long-term tobacco abstinence. Methods: One thousand and six adult smokers were recruited into a randomized cessation–induction trial. Community care participants received <b>cessation</b> pamphlets and <b>information</b> on local treatment programs. Intervention participants received the same materials and were asked to meet four times with counselors over 6 months to discuss their health in a manner intended to support autonomy and perceived competence. The primary outcome was 24 -month prolonged abstinence from tobacco. The secondary outcome was 7 -day point prevalence tobacco abstinence at 24 months postintervention. Results: Smokers in the intervention were more likely to attain both tobacco abstinence outcomes and these effects were partially mediated by change in both autonomous self-regulation and perceived competence from baseline to 6 months. Structural equation modeling confirmed the SDT model of health-behavior change in facilitating long-term tobacco abstinence. Conclusions: An intervention based on SDT and consistent with the PHS Guideline, which was intended to support autonomy and perceived competence, facilitated long-term tobacco abstinence...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Japan has a {{relatively}} high prevalence of smoking in men. Despite the importance of behavioral patterns on successful smoking <b>cessation,</b> only limited <b>information</b> is available in Japan. The present study collected data from former smokers in a rural community in Japan {{in order to identify}} health status at the time of cessation, predominant motivating factors, and the role of smoking cessation aids in individuals who successfully stopped smoking. Methods: This cross-sectional study collected data using a self-reported questionnaire from 149 randomly-selected former smokers (119 men and 30 women, aged 20 - 79 years) who were residents of Nanao, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. Results: Of the male participants, 14. 3 % quit due to serious personal health problems, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, or respiratory tract disease, while 20. 8 % of former smokers experienced mild personal health problems or were pregnant at the time of cessation. An approximately equal number stopped smoking due to fear of illness in the absence of immediate health concerns. Compared to personal health motivations, a smaller number of male smokers quit due to anti-smoking social pressure or expense. We also observed a marked increase in former smokers who quit for these reasons in recent years. Smoking lost its appeal in 19. 3 % of male and 10. 0 % of female smokers. Approximately, 95 % of quitters did not utilize health professional counseling or pharmacological therapy. Conclusions: Personal health concerns in former smokers in Nanao, Japan were the predominant motivation for quitting smoking, with the vast majority of former smokers achieving successful smoking cessation by themselves...|$|R
