5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning</b> in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Animals have {{repeatedly}} been used through {{the history of}} biomedical research. The founders, in 1831, of the Dublin Zoo {{were members of the}} medical profession, interested in studying the animals both while they were alive and when they were dead. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur convincingly demonstrated the germ theory of medicine by inducing anthrax in sheep. In the 1880s, Robert Koch infected mice and guinea pigs with anthrax and tuberculosis. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning.</b> In World War I, German agents infected sheep bound for Russia with anthrax, and inoculated mules and horses of the French cavalry with the equine glanders disease. Between 1917 and 1918, the Germans infected mules in Argentina bound for American forces, resulting in the death of 200 mules. Insulin was first isolated from dogs in 1922, and revolutionized the treatment of diabetes. On November 3, 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos, then given to humans. The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took a large step forwards in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch was able to produce the first transgenic mammal, by integrating DNA from the SV40 virus into the genome of mice. This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.|$|E

40|$|<b>Classical</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> {{requires}} {{the recognition of}} conditioned stimuli (CS) and the association of the CS with an aversive stimulus. We used Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays to characterize changes in gene expression compared to naive mice in both the amygdala and the hippocampus 30 min after <b>classical</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> and 30 min after exposure to the CS {{in the absence of}} an aversive stimulus. We found that in the hippocampus, levels of gene regulation induced by <b>classical</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> were not significantly greater than those induced by CS alone, whereas in the amygdala, <b>classical</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> did induce significantly greater levels of gene regulation compared to the CS. Computational studies suggest that transcriptional changes in the hippocampus and amygdala are mediated by large and overlapping but distinct combinations of molecular events. Our results demonstrate that an increase in gene regulation in the amygdala was partially correlated to associative learning and partially correlated to nonassociative components of the task, while gene regulation in the hippocampus was correlated to nonassociative components of <b>classical</b> fear <b>conditioning,</b> including configural learning...|$|R

25|$|Experiments have {{revealed}} that nonsynaptic changes take place during conditional learning.Woody et al. demonstrated that eyeblink conditioning (EBC), a form of <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning</b> for studying neural structures and mechanisms underlying learning and memory, in a cat is associated with increased excitability and input in the neurons in sensorimotor cortical areas and in the facial nucleus. It was observed that increasing excitability from <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning</b> continued after the response stopped. This suggests that increased excitability may function as a mechanism for memory storage.|$|E

25|$|Respondent (<b>classical)</b> <b>conditioning</b> {{is based}} on innate {{stimulus-response}} relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning,</b> the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not produce a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food because it salivates).|$|E

25|$|Non-declarative {{memory is}} memory gained from {{previous}} experiences that is unconsciously applied to everyday scenarios.

40|$|A single electroconvulsive shock (ECS) or a sham ECS was {{administered}} to male 3 - 4 -month-old Wistar rats 1, 2, and 4 h before training in an inhibitory avoidance test and in cued <b>classical</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> (measured by means of freezing time in a new environment). ECS impaired inhibitory avoidance at all times and, at 1 or 2 h before training, reduced freezing time before and after re-presentation of the ECS. These results are interpreted as a transient conditioned stimulus (CS) -induced anxiolytic or analgesic effect lasting about 2 h after a single treatment, {{in addition to the}} known amnesic effect of the stimulus. This suggests that the effect of anterograde learning impairment is demonstrated unequivocally only when the analgesic/anxiolytic effect is over (about 4 h after ECS administration) and that this impairment of learning is selective, affecting inhibitory avoidance but not <b>classical</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> to a discrete stimulus.

25|$|<b>Classical</b> <b>conditioning</b> is {{described}} as the pairing of a conditioned stimulus (CS) (such as a vibration) with an unconditioned stimulus (US) (such as a loud noise) to evoke a conditioned response (CR) (agitation). In this pairing, the vibration will be presented immediately followed by a loud noise. Initially, {{the presentation of the}} loud noise (US) would cause the unconditioned response (UR) (natural agitation) without prior <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning.</b> However, the continuous pairing of the loud noise (US) with the vibration (CS) converts the unconditioned response (UR) into a (CR) as the fetus learns that the presentation of a vibration will be followed by a loud noise. Eventually, the fetus will respond to the vibration (CS) without being exposed to the loud noise (US); this is when conditioning has occurred. Conditioning has been demonstrated in as few as 12-15 pairings of the vibration (CS) with the loud noise (US) in fetuses as early as 32 weeks of gestation.|$|E
25|$|Several {{experimental}} findings seem to {{run counter}} to two-factor theory. For example, avoidance behavior often extinguishes very slowly even when the initial CS-US pairing never occurs again, so the fear response might be expected to extinguish (see <b>Classical</b> <b>conditioning).</b> Further, animals that have learned to avoid often show little evidence of fear, suggesting that escape from fear is not necessary to maintain avoidance behavior.|$|E

40|$|In <b>classical</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> {{a neutral}} {{conditioned}} stimulus (CS) {{such as a}} tone, is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) such as a shock.

25|$|Brave New World is a dystopian novel {{written in}} 1931 by English author Aldous Huxley, and {{published}} in 1932. Set in London in the year AD 2540 (632 A.F.—"After Ford"—in the book), the novel anticipates developments in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation, and <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning</b> that are combined to make a profound change in society. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in an essay, Brave New World Revisited (1958), and with Island (1962), his final novel.|$|E
25|$|Behaviorism {{developed}} in the 1920s, and behavior modification as a therapy became popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. Notable contributors were Joseph Wolpe in South Africa, M.B. Shipiro and Hans Eysenck in Britain, and John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner in the United States. Behavioral therapy approaches relied on principles of operant conditioning, <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning</b> and social learning theory to bring about therapeutic change in observable symptoms.

25|$|The {{end of the}} 19th century {{marks the}} start of {{psychology}} as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study. In that year Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research (in Leipzig). Other important early contributors to the field include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in memory studies), Ivan Pavlov (who discovered <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning),</b> William James, and Sigmund Freud. Freud's influence has been enormous, though more as cultural icon than a force in scientific psychology.|$|E
40|$|All organisms {{continuously}} have {{to adapt}} their behavior according {{to changes in the}} environment in order to survive. Experience-driven changes in behavior are usually mediated and maintained by modifications in signaling within defined brain circuits. Given the simplicity of the larval brain of Drosophila and its experimental accessibility on the genetic and behavioral level, we analyzed if Drosophila neuropeptide F (dNPF) neurons are involved in <b>classical</b> olfactory <b>conditioning.</b> dNPF is an ortholog of the mammalian neuropeptide Y, a highly conserved neuromodulator that stimulates food-seeking behavior. We provide a comprehensive anatomical analysis of the dNPF neurons on the single-cell level. We demonstrate that artificial activation of dNPF neurons inhibits appetitive olfactory learning by modulating the sugar reward signal during acquisition. No effect is detectable for the retrieval of an established appetitive olfactory memory. The modulatory effect is based on the joint action of three distinct cell types that, if tested on the single-cell level, inhibit and invert the conditioned behavior. Taken together, our work describes anatomically and functionally a new part of the sugar reinforcement signaling pathway for <b>classical</b> olfactory <b>conditioning</b> in Drosophila larvae...|$|R

5000|$|Associative {{learning}} {{is when a}} subject creates an relationship between stimuli or behavior and stimulus.

25|$|Recall {{memory is}} active when a {{familiar}} sound triggers {{a feeling of}} pain from a past event, {{but most of the}} recall is shut out from traumatic event. It is similar to <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning,</b> when a dog hears a bell it begins to react to the noise rather than an exterior variable like food or an electric shock. The use of therapy is constructed for a person with this problem to help avoid the fear associated with sounds or objects, and be able to then recall other pieces of information that happened during the event.|$|E
25|$|Overall, studies {{indicate}} {{that there is an}} ability for fetal learning and memory, and through <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning,</b> habituation and exposure learning that memory can be measured. It {{is important to note that}} certain periods in fetal development allow for different learning and memory abilities, which should be taken into consideration when determining if fetal memory exists. Auditory stimuli presented in the womb can be retained and recognized (learned) into the days following birth and that learning is specific to familiar auditory stimuli. Measuring learning and memory in the fetus has only been discussed in terms of healthy pregnancies; however, many factors such as disease affect these delicate processes.|$|E
25|$|While many {{theories}} on motivation have a mentalistic perspective, behaviorists {{focus only on}} observable behavior and theories founded on experimental evidence. In the view of behaviorism, motivation is understood as a question about what factors cause, prevent, or withhold various behaviors, while the question of, for instance, conscious motives would be ignored. Where others would speculate about such things as values, drives, or needs, {{that may not be}} observed directly, behaviorists are interested in the observable variables that affect the type, intensity, frequency and duration of observable behavior. Through the basic research of such scientists as Pavlov, Watson and Skinner, several basic mechanisms that govern behavior have been identified. The most important of these are <b>classical</b> <b>conditioning</b> and operant conditioning.|$|E

40|$|<b>Classical</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> {{has been}} used as a model {{paradigm}} to explain fear learning across species. In this paradigm, the amygdala is known to play a critical role. However, <b>classical</b> fear <b>conditioning</b> requires first-hand experience with an aversive event, which may not be how most fears are acquired in humans. It remains to be determined whether the conditioning model can be extended to indirect forms of learning more common in humans. Here we show that fear acquired indirectly through social observation, with no personal experience of the aversive event, engages similar neural mechanisms as fear conditioning. The amygdala was recruited both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in an analogous situation. These findings confirm the central role of the amygdala in the acquisition and expression of observational fear learning, and validate the extension of cross-species models of fear conditioning to learning in a human sociocultural context. Our findings also provides new insights into the relationship between learning from, and empathizing with, fearful others. This study suggests that indirectly attained fears may be as powerful as fears originating from direct experiences...|$|R
40|$|Corticosterone is a {{glucocorticoid}} {{released as}} part of the body 2 ̆ 7 s response to stress and is known to affect cognitive function, presumably via effects on the hippocampus.
