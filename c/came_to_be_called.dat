5|$|The {{advance on}} Finschhafen {{continued}} on 26 September. Since the Salankaua Plantation was still {{reported to be}} heavily defended, Windeyer attempted to force the defenders to withdraw. He started with attacks on two hills to the south west of the plantation. B and D Companies of the 2/15th Infantry Battalion attacked what <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Snell's Hill. It was captured in hand-to-hand combat using bayonets. The Australians captured three 13mm heavy machine guns and seven light machine guns, and buried the bodies of 52 dead Japanese defenders. The other feature, which <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Starvation Hill, was taken by C Company. However, their capture did not prompt the Japanese to leave the Salankaua Plantation.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant, which <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.|$|E
5|$|Country estates {{had been}} built in the area as early as the 1830s, and some of Louisville's great early mansions, {{predominantly}} in the Italianate style, were built along Broadway, very near Old Louisville, before the Civil War. Development from 1850 to 1870 occurred between Broadway and Kentucky Street, the northern extreme of what <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Old Louisville. North-south city streets were extended throughout the area in the 1850s, and a mulecar line was extended down Fourth to Oak in 1865.|$|E

5|$|Lawrence went on {{to build}} a series of ever larger and more {{expensive}} cyclotrons. His Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University of California in 1936, with Lawrence as its director. In addition {{to the use of}} the cyclotron for physics, Lawrence also supported its use in research into medical uses of radioisotopes. During World War II, Lawrence developed electromagnetic isotope separation at the Radiation Laboratory. It used devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. A huge electromagnetic separation plant was built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Y-12. The process was inefficient, but it worked.|$|E

During the next 14 months this operation was followed by Lunch, Snack, Dinner, Dessert, and Supper as American bombers flew 3,630 sorties and expended 100,000 tons of ordnance on the Base Areas in what <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Operation Menu. During this time frame, the entire program was held as a closely guarded secret from Congress, the American people, and amazingly, from the Air Force itself.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the Great Migration.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Standard, as the {{encounter}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called,</b> was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although {{the result was}} a defeat, it was not by any means decisive. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was just what it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of the old ways. The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E

5|$|By late 1869, enough nickels, as {{the coin}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called,</b> had been {{produced}} {{to meet the}} needs of commerce, and production dropped off. The new coins tended to accumulate in the hands of merchants beyond the legal tender limit, but banks refused to accept them beyond the one-dollar maximum. Storeowners were forced to discount the coins to brokers. Postmasters, compelled by law to accept the coins, found that the Treasury would not accept them as deposits except in lots of $100, in accordance with the authorizing statute. In 1871, Congress alleviated the problem by passing legislation allowing the Treasury to redeem unlimited quantities of nickels and other low-denomination coins when presented in lots of not less than $20. It would not be until 1933, long after the shield design passed from the scene, that the nickel was made legal tender without limit.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s, Indiana {{completed}} {{the removal of}} the Native American tribes. The majority of the Potawatomi voluntarily relocated to Kansas in 1838. Those who did not leave were forced to travel to Kansas in what <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the Potawatomi Trail of Death, leaving only the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians in the Indiana area. The majority of the Miami tribe left in 1846, although many members of the tribe were permitted to remain in the state on lands they held privately {{under the terms of the}} 1818 Treaty of St. Mary's. The other tribes were also convinced to leave the state voluntarily through the payment of subsidies and land grants further west. The Shawnee migrated westward to settle in Missouri, and the Lenape migrated into Canada. The other minor tribes in the state, including the Wea, moved westward, mostly to Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, as it <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called,</b> {{but it was}} {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) {{says the}} siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; {{no mention of the}} sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E

5|$|In March 1782, 160 Pennsylvania militiamen under Lieutenant Colonel David Williamson rode {{into the}} Ohio Country, {{hoping to find}} the warriors who were {{responsible}} for raids against Pennsylvania settlers. Enraged by the gruesome murder by Indians of a white woman and her baby, Williamson's men detained about 100 Christian Delawares at the village of Gnadenhütten. The Christian Delawares (mostly women and children) had returned to Gnadenhütten from Captive Town in order to harvest the crops they {{had been forced to}} leave behind. Accusing the Christian Indians of having aided hostile raiding parties, the Pennsylvanians murdered them all by hammer blows to the head. The Gnadenhutten massacre, as it <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called,</b> would have serious repercussions for the next American expedition into the Ohio Country.|$|E
5|$|In Parliament, a {{political}} crisis {{developed over the}} king's policy of seeking a Spanish wife for Charles, Prince of Wales, {{as part of a}} proposed alliance with the Habsburgs. In the parliament of 1621, it fell to Calvert to advocate the Spanish Match, as it <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called,</b> against the majority of Parliament, who feared an increase in Catholic influence on the state. As a result of his pro-Spanish stance and defence of relaxations in the penal laws against Catholics, Calvert became estranged from many in the Commons, who were suspicious of his close familiarity with the Spanish ambassador's court. Calvert also faced difficulties in his private life: his wife's death on 8 August 1622 left him the single father of ten children, the oldest of whom, Cecil, was sixteen years old.|$|E
5|$|Lion was hit twice more, {{during what}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the Run to the North, after the German battlecruisers {{made their own}} turn north. Beatty's ships slowly moved out of range and rendezvoused with {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet. Beatty {{gradually}} turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre. By 18:35 Beatty was following the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. Beatty then turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast to search for Hipper's ships.|$|E

The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of}} the magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.|$|E
5|$|The Nine Queries, as they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called,</b> {{focused on}} the divine right (jure divino) of church government. While the presbyterian divines were capable of {{defending}} their vision for church government as established by divine right in the Bible, they were unwilling to answer the queries because doing so would further expose the disunity of the Assembly and weaken their case in Parliament. In July 1647, the New Model Army invaded London and conservative members of Parliament were forced out. Parliament passed an ordinance establishing religious tolerance and ensuring that the Assembly's vision of a national, compulsory presbyterian church would never come to fruition. In London, where support for presbyterianism was greatest, presbyteries were established in only sixty-four of 108 city parishes, and regional presbyterian classes were only formed in fourteen of England's forty counties. A planned national general assembly never met. Many presbyterians did, however, establish voluntary presbyteries in what was a de facto free church situation until the Restoration in 1660, when a compulsory episcopal system was reinstated.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{of these shows}} developed them using a variant on the CTW model, a flexible model of production based upon {{the experiences of the}} creators and {{producers of}} the U.S. show. The model consisted of the combination of producers and researchers working together on the show, the development of a unique curriculum, and extensive test screening of the shows. The shows <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> co-productions, and they contained original sets, characters, and curriculum goals. Different co-productions were produced, depending upon each country's needs and resources. They included both dubbed versions of the American show and versions created, developed, and produced in each country that reflected their needs, educational priorities, and culture. For example, the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, from the South African co-production Takalani Sesame, was created in 2003 to address the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa, and was met with controversy in the U.S.. By 2006, there were 20co-productions in countries all over the world. In 2001, there were more than 120million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street, and by the US show's 40thanniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140countries.|$|E
