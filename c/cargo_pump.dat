50|$|In membrane-type vessels {{there is}} also an empty pipe with a {{spring-loaded}} foot valve that can be opened by weight or pressure. This is the emergency pump tower. In the event both main cargo pumps fail the top can be removed from this pipe and an emergency <b>cargo</b> <b>pump</b> lowered {{down to the bottom of}} the pipe. The top is replaced on the column and then the pump is allowed to push down on the foot valve and open it. The cargo can then be pumped out.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical tankers {{often have}} a system for tank heating in order to {{maintain}} the viscosity of certain cargoes, typically by passing pressurized steam through stainless steel 'heating coils' in the cargo tanks, transferring heat into the cargo which circulates in the tank by convection. All modern chemical tankers feature double hull construction and most have one hydraulically driven, submerged <b>cargo</b> <b>pump</b> for each tank with independent piping, which means that each tank can load a separate cargo without any mixing. Consequently, many oceangoing chemical tankers may carry numerous different grades of cargo on the same voyage, often loading and discharging these [...] "parcels" [...] at different ports or terminals. This means that the scheduling, stowage planning and operation of such ships requires a high level of coordination and specialist knowledge, both at sea and on shore. Tank cleaning after discharging cargo is a very important aspect of chemical tanker operations, because tanks which are not properly cleaned of all cargo residue can adversely affect the purity of the next cargo loaded. Before tanks are cleaned, they must be properly ventilated and checked to be free of potentially explosive gases. Chemical tankers usually have transverse stiffeners on deck rather than inside the cargo tanks, in order to make the tank walls smooth and thus easier to clean using permanently fitted tank cleaning machines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Motivation There is, at {{the present}} time, no {{submerged}} molasses pump on the market that is designed specifically for cargo tankers. Due to this I, find it interesting {{to look into the}} possibilities of installing a molasses pump in cargo tankers to transport molasses instead of transporting molasses in containers as it is done today. It is challenging {{to come up with a}} new product, and the motivation of actual be able to release a pump for the international marked is indescribable. Problem The goal is to make a prototype of a submerged pump specifically made for pumping molasses that can fulfill the customer requirements for flow and pressure. Obtaining reliable test result and demonstration of the pump is desirable before the new product is set into production. Approach Molasses is a very special and complex cargo, due to the complexity, 8 cdot 10 ^{ 3 }kg of molasses was ordered from Australia. Then it was possible to do several tests on the actual molasses which the current market is for. Different pump designs have to be evaluated and then some design can be put into prototyping. The prototypes needs to go through several test so as much knowledge as possible can be gained before the pump is released on the market. Conclusion There is definitely a large market for transporting molasses by cargo tankers. There are already several orders for a molasses pumping system. Molasses seems to be a more complicated <b>cargo</b> <b>pump</b> then first assumed because of its big variations in viscosity due to temperature and different batches. There are many unknown factors involved in pumping molasses and as further it was dogged in to the problems new ones occurred. But the problems have been solved, some has been hard to solve. After three prototypes the customers requirements were finally achieved, and then all the hard work has finally given result. Even if the pump design is ready for the first order, many new question have arrived and this is the motivation to continue with the process that has already started. Especially interesting is the new technology that will be available next year regarding CFX a motivation factor to keep trying to rise the efficiency. </p...|$|E
50|$|Main <b>cargo</b> <b>pumps</b> and {{stripping}} {{pumps are}} used to discharge cargo from the ship.

40|$|This paper {{looks into}} {{whether or not}} it can be {{profitable}} for a shipping company operating in the product tanker segment, to change from a steam driven <b>cargo</b> <b>pumping</b> system to a hydraulic <b>cargo</b> <b>pumping</b> system by Frank Mohn AS. By looking at two triangulation scenarios, one between the U. S. and Europe transporting dirty products and the other between the U. S. and Asia transporting both dirty and clean products, I have been able to show that there are both market factors such as economical, political and technological, as well as the vessel speed and bunker price influencing the profitability for the different route alternatives. In order to make the results as realistic as possible, I have used three different variables; vessel speed, bunkers price, and investment cost. The methods used to estimate whether the investment is sound or not, is the discounted cash flow (DCF) model and the adjusted present value (APV) model. In addition to the main scenarios, I have also looked at the profitability of the first route, without the use of triangulation, in order to find out whether the use of triangulation is an important factor for the profitability of the pumping system. I have also looked into which factors that might impede on the trade for the two triangulation routes in the future, by use of the PESTLE analysis. The two analyses show that the new <b>cargo</b> <b>pumping</b> system will be profitable with the use of triangulation and the competitive advantage of quite easily switching from dirty to clean cargo. There are however some market conditions one have to keep in mind; for the first route, it is important to not forget that the U. S. are getting less dependent on foreign oil, {{as a result of their}} own increasing production. For the second route, one have to keep in mind the changing economical and political situations in the concerned countries. With these conditions in mind, one would be hard pressed to not see the potential profit from the new <b>cargo</b> <b>pumping</b> system. nhhma...|$|R

5|$|The {{process of}} moving oil {{off of a}} tanker is similar to loading, but has some key differences. The {{first step in the}} {{operation}} is following the same pretransfer procedures as used in loading. When the transfer begins, it is the ship's <b>cargo</b> <b>pumps</b> that are used to move the product ashore. As in loading, the transfer starts at low pressure to ensure that equipment is working correctly and that connections are secure. Then a steady pressure is achieved and held during the operation. While pumping, tank levels are carefully watched and key locations, such as the connection at the cargo manifold and the ship's pumproom are constantly monitored. Under the direction of the person in charge, crew members open and close valves to direct the flow of product and maintain close communication with the receiving facility to decrease and finally stop the flow of liquid.|$|R

50|$|When a large vessel {{such as a}} {{container}} ship or an oil tanker unloads <b>cargo,</b> seawater is <b>pumped</b> into other compartments in the hull to help stabilize and balance the ship. During loading, this ballast water is pumped out from these compartments.|$|R
5000|$|... "Cold ironing" [...] is {{specifically}} a shipping industry term {{that came into}} use when all ships had coal-fired engines. When a ship tied up at port, {{there was no need}} to continue to feed the fire and the iron engines would literally cool down, eventually going completely cold - hence the term [...] "cold ironing". If commercial ships can use shore-supplied power for services such as <b>cargo</b> handling, <b>pumping,</b> ventilation and lighting while in port, they need not run their own diesel engines, reducing air pollution emissions.|$|R
2500|$|By {{actuating}} cargo valves, {{the person}} in charge can control where <b>cargo</b> is <b>pumped</b> from, where it is pumped to, and in systems that use throttle valves, can control the relative flow rates of cargo through the valves. [...] Modern cargo control rooms allow {{the person in}} charge to remotely control {{some or all of}} the valves in the cargo system and monitor the state of all valves. [...] Valve indicators are typically laid out on a [...] "mimic panel" [...] which displays the cargo system piping, valves and pumps in a schematic diagram.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fact sheet}} continues: “An {{unpredictable}} threat, which {{is difficult to}} control, is chronic pollution by crude oil or other pollutants which spill into the ocean when tankers break open, wash their tanks, dump <b>cargo</b> or <b>pump</b> bilge.

50|$|Liquid Berth: Used {{to handle}} {{oil and gas}} related products. Berths are placed {{offshore}} to keep safe zone of operation from rest of port operations. Vessels are loaded via loading arms containing the pipe lines. <b>Cargo</b> is the <b>pumped</b> back on shore through pipelines, which are usually submerged. Storage facilities for the products are usually some distance away from the berth and connected by these pipelines.|$|R
5000|$|A typical cargo cycle {{starts with}} the tanks in a [...] "gas free" [...] condition, meaning the tanks are full of air, which allows {{maintenance}} on the tank and <b>pumps.</b> <b>Cargo</b> cannot be loaded directly into the tank, {{as the presence of}} oxygen would create an explosive atmospheric condition within the tank, and the rapid temperature change caused by loading LNG at [...] could damage the tanks.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of water ballast {{is that the}} tanks can be emptied, reducing draft or {{the weight of the}} boat (e.g. for transport on ground) and water added back in (in small boats, simply by opening up the valves and letting the water flow in) after the boat is launched or <b>cargo</b> unloaded. <b>Pumps</b> {{can also be used to}} empty the leeward ballast tank and fill the windward tank as the boat tacks, and the quantity of ballast can be varied to keep the boat at the optimum angle of heel. On empty cargo vessels water is added to ballast tanks to increase propeller immersion, to improve steering, and to control trim and draft.|$|R
5|$|Loading an {{oil tanker}} {{consists}} primarily of <b>pumping</b> <b>cargo</b> into the ship's tanks. As oil enters the tank, the vapors inside the tank must be somehow expelled. Depending on local regulations, the vapors can be expelled {{into the atmosphere}} or discharged back to the pumping station {{by way of a}} vapor recovery line. It is also common for the ship to move water ballast during the loading of cargo to maintain proper trim.|$|R
