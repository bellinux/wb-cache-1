40|$|Total hip {{arthroplasty}} is a {{very successful}} procedure. Despite this fact, however, a certain portion of patients has to be revised. One major reason for revision is the wear of the polyethylene leading to loosening and osteolysis. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate linear wear and migration of cemented, all - polyethylene sockets and polyethylene liners in total hip arthroplasty. The aim was also to identify patients for whom increased wear was a risk and who therefore were likely to require a revision, and further to evaluate different methods for measuring wear and their accuracy Material and results Study I: 154 hips had received an uncemented Omnifit total hip. 66 cups were revised and in these cases mean annual wear was 0. 32 mm compared to 0. 12 mm in hips not revised. Osteolytic processes were present in 51 patients at revision but these could be observed in only 35 hips on radiographs. Micromotion evaluated by RSA, weight, age, side, size of <b>cup,</b> <b>screw</b> fixation, polyethylene thickness or shelf - life of the polyethylene did not correlate to wear, whereas male gender did. Study II: Cross - linked N-telopeptide of type I Collagen (NTx), a marker of osteoclast - mediated bone resorption, has been proposed {{for the evaluation of}} the often non-symptomatic peri-prosthetic osteolysis. NTx in urine was analysed in 160 patients with and without osteolysis. The group of patients with osteolysis had significantly higher mean NTx levels (p= 0. 03) and an increased annual wear of the polyethylene. Study III: 120 patients were randomised to have a primary total hip replacement with one out of four possible articulations. The femoral heads were of conventional steel or of a new ceramic, zirconium oxide. The cup was either made of conventional polyethylene or of polyethylene that had been reheated under pressure, Hylamer. All combinations that included Hylamer or Zirconium oxide had increased polyethylene wear as compared to the standard steel / polyethylene combination (p< 0. 008). 12 patients have been revised to date- none had a stainless steel / polyethylene articulation. Study IV: Polyethylene penetration (wear) was measured by RSA in 111 patients by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) in the supine and weight-bearing position. There was a small (0. 02 mm) systematic difference. The degree of penetration of the head into the polyethylene or the time for the first examination did not alter this result. Study V: We analysed the accuracy of 2 radiostereometric (RSA) techniques for wear measurement and 3 standard radiographic techniques using a phantom with different prosthetic components. The mean differences between phantom and measurement were, for digital RSA examinations 0. 010 mm (accuracy 0. 42, n= 175). The corresponding error values for the three radiographic techniques were 0. 19 (accuracy 1. 3, n= 180) for Charnley Duo, 0. 13 (accuracy 1. 3, n= 180) for Imagika corrected, and 1. 021 (accuracy 2. 99, n= 180) for Imagika. Measurement error decreased from 0. 011 mm with ordinary RSA to 0. 004 with RSA digital measurement. Head size, direction of wear in relation to the cup or type of prosthetic component did not influence the measurement error...|$|E

The A tube was closed at the breech end by a wrought iron <b>cup</b> <b>screwed</b> into it.

40|$|Chronic {{irritation}} of the iliopsoas tendon {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} persistent pain after total joint replacement of the hip. In the majority of cases, pain results from a mechanical conflict between the iliopsoas tendon and the anterior edge of the acetabular cup after total hip arthroplasty. Pain can be reproduced by active flexion of the hip and by active raising of the straightened leg. In addition, painful leg raising against resistance and passive hyperextension are suggestive of an irritation of the iliopsoas tendon. Symptoms evolve from a mechanical irritation of the iliopsoas tendon and an oversized or retroverted acetabular <b>cup,</b> <b>screws</b> penetrating into the inner aspect of the ilium, or from bone cement protruding beyond the anterior acetabular rim. The diagnosis may be assumed on conventional radiographs and confirmed by CT scans. Fifteen patients with psoas irritation after total hip replacement are reported on. Eleven patients were treated surgically. The acetabular cup was revised and reoriented with more anteversion in six patients, isolated screws penetrating into the tendon were cut and leveled in three patients, and prominent bone cement {{in conflict with the}} tendon was resected once. A partial release of the iliopsoas tendon only was performed in another patient. Follow-up examination (range: 11 - 89 months) revealed that nine patients were free of pain and two patient had mild residual complaints. Psoas irritation in combination with total hip replacement can be prevented by a correct surgical technique, especially with proper selection of the cup size and insertion of the acetabular cup avoiding a rim position exceeding the level of the anterior acetabular rim...|$|R

40|$|The mean way to fill bone loss, to fix loss of {{continuity}} or to correct severe dysplasia in pelvis {{and in the}} femur during replacement or revision arthroplasty is the augmentation of the bone stock by mean of bulky or morcellized bone allograft. In order to treat these problems, limiting the possible complications connected {{to the use of}} massive bone allograft (bulky or morcellized), and to simplify the surgical procedure we thought to apply in selected cases the platelet’s derived autologous growth factors (AGF), alone or added to Granular Hydroxyapatite. From january 2001 to june 2003 we have applied-autologous growth factors in 10 cases. The diagnosis was: 5 acetabula in primary THR, 2 acetabular and 1 femoral revision after THR, 1 femoral and 1 tibial revision after TKR. We applied the pure AGF in 2 cases and AGF plus Granular Hydroxyapatite in 8 cases. We used emispherical, HA coated, uncemented acetabular <b>cup</b> plus <b>screws</b> (6 cases), uncemented revision <b>cup</b> plus <b>screws</b> (1 case), straight HA coated uncemented femoral stem (1 cases), semi-constrained cemented TKR prosthesis (1 cases).

40|$|<b>Screwed</b> {{acetabular}} <b>cups,</b> {{applied in}} total hip replacements, generate stresses {{in the surrounding}} bone during implantation (prestresses). The effect of these prestresses on the endurance of the hip replacement are unknown. The prestresses in the acetabulum were examined both experimentally, using strain gauge techniques, and numerically, using the finite element method. It {{was found that the}} prestresses were of the same order of magnitude, if not larger, than the stresses due to the hip reaction force during one-legged stance. In some cases, the prestresses even approximated the ultimate tensile strength of cortical bone. The prestresses seemed to have a strong dependence on the outer shape of the cup, rather than on the flexibility of the cup or whether the cup had a self-cutting thread or not. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} prestresses are not very susceptible to stress relaxation due to the visco-elastic behaviour of bone. This means that prestresses will remain present over long periods of time. So even when a patient has resumed normal daily activities, the prestresses will still play an important role in the overall stress distributions around the acetabulum. Due to the interaction of prestresses and stresses due to normal loading, the primary stability of a metal-backed <b>screwed</b> <b>cup</b> is better guaranteed than the primary stability of an all-polyethylene <b>screwed</b> <b>cup...</b>|$|R
30|$|We also {{evaluated}} {{the reconstruction of}} the center of rotation of the hip achieved with these devices. Both an anatomic hip center and maximum bone host contact are desirable postoperatively to support stability. Some authors have reported excellent long-term results using the high hip center technique [4, 17, 34], but other series have reported a higher aseptic loosening rate for a nonanatomical acetabular component site [30, 39]. Finite-element analysis of a protruded acetabulum has shown that stress on the deficient medial wall varies as a directly function of medial placement of the cup [8]. Different authors report that correcting a deficient acetabulum to the anatomical position is crucial for achieving good long-term results [21, 30, 39]. In our study, a good acetabular reconstruction was obtained in most cases. Although the number and positions of the screws were chosen according to the primary stability of the <b>cup,</b> a <b>screw</b> fixed to the pubis using other devices can be recommended, since we only used this in bone defects of type 3 A or 3 B, and this could have influenced the results [7]. After the surgery, most of the hips were inside the Ranawat triangle, and the postoperative distance to the AFHC improved.|$|R
40|$|Background: Vascular injury during {{minimally}} invasive {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) is uncommon, yet a well-recognized and serious issue. It emerges because of non-visibility of vascular structures proximal to the pelvic bone during reaming, drilling holes, and fixing of screws. Numerous {{studies have found that}} screw fixation during cementless THA is beneficial for the initial stability of cup; yet, no anatomical guidelines support angular eccentric screw fixation. Materials and Methods: In this study, we obtained the pelvic arterial-phase computed tomographic data of thirty eight humans and reconstructed the three-dimensional models of osseous and vessel structures. We performed the surgical simulation to fix these structures with cementless <b>cups</b> and <b>screws</b> with angular eccentricities. Results: The effect of screw eccentricities (angular eccentricities of ± 17 ° and ± 34 °) on the vascular injury was determined. Measurement between screw and adjoining vessels was performed and analyzed statistically to ascertain a comparative risk study for blood vessels that are not visible during surgery. Conclusion: Authors similarly discussed the significant absence of appreciation of quadrant systems proposed by Wasielewski et al. on eccentric screws. Adjustment of quadrant systems provided by Wasielewski et al. is required for acetabular implants with eccentric holes for fixation of acetabular screws...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{removal of}} well-fixed {{acetabular}} components following THA (total hip arthroplasty) {{is a difficult}} operation and could be accompanied {{by the loss of}} acetabular bone stock. The optimal method for fixation is still under debate. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the tear-out resistance and failure behavior between osseo-integrated and non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>cups.</b> Furthermore, we examined whether there are differences in the properties mentioned between screw sockets and cemented polyethylene cups. Hypothesis Tear-out resistance and related mechanical work required for the tear-out of osseo-integrated screw sockets are higher than in non-integrated screw sockets. Patients and methods Ten human coxal bones from six cadavers with osseo-integrated screw sockets (n = 4), non-integrated (implanted post-mortem, n = 3) screw sockets and cemented polyethylene cups (n = 3) were used for tear-out testing. The parameters axial failure load and mechanical work for tear-out were introduced as measures for determining the stability of acetabular components following THA. Results The osseo-integrated screw sockets yielded slightly higher tear-out resistance (1. 61 ± 0. 26 kN) and related mechanical work compared to the non-integrated screw sockets (1. 23 ± 0. 39 kN, P = 0. 4). The cemented polyethylene cups yielded the lowest tear-out resistance with a failure load of 1. 18 ± 0. 24 kN. Compared to the <b>screw</b> <b>cups</b> implanted while alive, they also differ on a non-significant level (P = 0. 1). Osseous failure patterns differed especially for the screw sockets compared to the cemented polyethylene cups. Discussion Osseo-integration did not greatly influence the tear-out stability in cementless screw sockets following axial loading. Furthermore, the strength of the bone-implant-interface of cementless screw sockets appears to be similar to cemented polyethylene cups. However, given the high failure load, high mechanical load and because of the related bone failure patterns, removal should not be performed by means of tear-out but rather by osteotomes or other curved cutting devices to preserve the acetabular bone stock...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the initial acetabular implant stability and late acetabular implant migration in press fit <b>cups</b> combined with <b>screw</b> fixation of the acetabular component in order to answer the question whether screws are necessary for the fixation of the acetabular component in cementless primary total hip arthroplasty.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate, at a minimum of five years, the results associated with the use of an extra-large uncemented porous-coated component for acetab-ular revision in the presence of bone loss. Methods: Eighty-nine extra-large uncemented hemispherical acetabular components were used for revision after aseptic failure of a total hip arthroplasty in forty-six men and forty-three women (mean age at revision, fifty-nine years; range, thirty to eighty-three years). The revision implant (a Harris-Galante-I or II <b>cup</b> fixed with <b>screws)</b> had an outside diameter of ≥ 66 mm in men and ≥ 62 mm in women.

At the time of the last follow-up, four acetabular components had been removed or re-vised again (two for aseptic loosening). All of the remaining patients were followed clinically for at least five years (mean, 7. 2 years; range, 5. 0 to 11. 3 years).

In this study, we evaluated the results of total 49 hip replacements (THRs) using an uncemented total hip prosthesis in 44 patients (28 females) who were 30  years or younger (range: 15 – 30  years). The diagnosis was ostearthritis due to congenital dislocations in 28 patients, with the remaining patients having diagnoses of sequelae of fracture, infection, Calve-Legg-Perthes disease, avascular necrosis, chondrodystrophia and epiphyseal dysplasia. In all cases we used an uncemented straight stem fully coated with hydroxyapatite (HA). In 36 cases we used a hemispherical cup inserted with press fit, and in seven cases we used a hemispherical <b>screw</b> <b>cup.</b> The patients were evaluated ten to 16  years (mean: 13  years) after the operation by radiographic and clinical examinations, including the Harris Hip, WOMAC and EuroQol- 5 D scores. In a sub-group of nine patients with a unilateral prosthesis, the muscle strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings was tested using a Cybex 6000. None of the stems were revised at the follow-up examination, and all were classified as well integrated, with no signs of radiological loosening. Twenty-four hips had revision of the acetabular component due to mechanical failure.

40|$|Polyethylene {{wear and}} {{micromotion}} of the implant {{play an important}} role in multifactorial etiology of osteolysis leading to aseptic loosening of the acetabular components. Despite excellent results in primary total hip arthoplasty in a 10 - 15 year perspective there are still unsolved problems. The weakest link is the longevity of the actabular component. Young and active patients have a clearly worse outcome than older patients. Consequences of polyehtylene wear and ways to reduce wear have therefore been in focus during recent years. Radiostereometry (RSA) is the golden standard in measuring in vivo micromotions. In 4 clinical studies including 332 patients we used therefore RSA to record the efficacy of fixation of cemented and uncemented cups. The amount of wear of old and newly designed polyethylenes (PE) was related to cup stability and radiological and clinical measures of outcome. This study showed that cementless cups inserted with pressfit technique do not need additional augmentation. Screws and pegs increase the risk for radiolucencies and osteolystic lesions but are helpful tools in cases where primary stability is jeopardized. In the second decade clinically silent osteolysis is common for the porous coated Harris Galante <b>cup</b> with unsealed <b>screw</b> holes. The locking mechanism of the PE liner in this cup is unsatisfactory and an increase of liner dissociations is expected. EtO sterilized PE displayed high in vivo wear and we do not recommend its continued use but close monitoring of patients with earlier inserted EtO sterilized implants. The substantially reduced wear in cemented highly cross-linked PE cups without any negative in vivo tradeoffs might have a substantial impact on choice of material and operating technique in the near future. However, we still recommend its restrained use in controlled series until longer follow-up data is available. Nevertheless, the short term in vivo results of modern highly cross-linked PE look promising and ight improve the outcome of cemented and uncemented hip arthroplasties by reducing complication and revisions...|$|R
40|$|We are in {{the middle}} of the {{evolution}} of endoprosthetic joint replacement approximating the optimum result. This is not reached yet in young patients, difficult defect situations, revision operations and patient satisfaction. This manuscript evaluates concrete recommendations, concepts and strategies based on clinical studies, animal and in vitro experiments. Possible effects of conservative therapy of primary arthritis of the knee and hip joint on a cementless endoprosthetic replacement that will become necessary were examined for Diclofenac, Celecoxib and Tramadol on cellular level. In contrast to these symptomatic therapeutics a protective effect could be demonstrated for a prostaglandin derivate. Iloprost reduced femoral head bone marrow edema being the initial stadium of and accompanying femoral head necrosis. A correct implant placement is especially for the long term outcome of hip and knee endoprosthesis a conditio sine qua non. However biomechanical and clinical studies show, that so called norm values are no constants but seem to depend on the underlying joint pathology. We were able to demonstrate excellent long term results after medialized positioning of <b>screwed</b> <b>cups</b> in treatment of secondary arthritis in development dysplasia of the hip. This may be explained by an optimization of hip biomechanics resulting from a reduction of hip contact forces. It could be demonstrated for endoprosthetic knee replacement that navigated implantation results in a partially more precise realization of 3 -dimensional preoperative planning than conventional technique. No benefit through navigation was shown for the rotational component alignment and for the tibial cut. In the following the reasons for this were evaluated and recommendations were concluded. In the whole process endoprosthetic joint replacement a further focus was set on the influence of perioperative medication (anticoagulants, immunosuppressants in organ transplantated patients) on bone metabolism on the cellular level being a predictor of survival of cementless endoprostheses. From the clinical point of view we evaluated factors influencing perioperative morbidity after endoprothetic joint replacement to specifically prevent complications. In the last part of the manuscript solution strategies for two up to now unsolved problems of joint replacement surgery were shown. Minimally invasive operative techniques shall reduce muscle trauma but increase the incidence of wound healing disorders. It was demonstrated that the vasoconstrictor Endothelin- 1 is secreted prolonged after total knee replacement, so that a pharmacological antagonization may possibly result in a reduced incidence of wound healing problems. Up to now there is no possibility to regenerate muscle that is traumatized during implantation or revision of endoprostheses. We were able to show in an animal experiment that the transplantation of pluripotent cells can reduce the functional deficit following muscle trauma. This regenerative therapy could have the potential to improve the functional outcome after revision endoprosthetic treatment. Despite all improvements of the process endoprosthetic joint replacement, it should be mentioned that every improvement of a therapy results in an enlargement of its indication spectrum. The thereby resulting problems will formulate the future challenges and focuses of research...|$|R
