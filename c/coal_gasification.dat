5|$|To {{increase}} the EROEI, several combined technologies were proposed. These include {{the usage of}} process waste heat, e.g. gasification or combustion of the residual carbon (char), and the usage of waste heat from other industrial processes, such as <b>coal</b> <b>gasification</b> and nuclear power generation.|$|E
5|$|RTI {{scientists}} helped identify {{toxic chemicals}} in the Love Canal in the 1970s. In 1978, RTI researched the possibility of improving solar cells for the US Department of Energy and <b>coal</b> <b>gasification</b> for the Environmental Protection Agency in 1979. It trained Chinese government employees on using computer models to forecast pollution patterns before the 2007 Olympics in Beijing.|$|E
30|$|Temperature {{plays an}} {{important}} role in <b>gasification</b> of <b>coal.</b> Higher <b>gasification</b> temperature increases the carbon conversion which improves gasification rate.|$|R
30|$|Various models {{including}} {{integrated model}} (IM), random pore model (RPM), and shrinking core model (SCM) {{have been proposed}} to describe <b>coal</b> char <b>gasification.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{solid fuel}} {{gasification}} process was investigated to define chemical reactions rate and activation energy for a gas-generator designing and regime optimizing. An experimental procedure includes coal char samples of Kuznetskiy and Kansko-Achinskiy deposits consequent argon pyrolysis into argon and oxidating into carbon dioxide with different temperatures. The thermogravimetric analysis data of <b>coal</b> char <b>gasification</b> into carbon dioxide was {{obtained in the}} temperature range 900 - 1200 °С. The mass loss and gasification time dependencies from temperature were defined to calculate chemical reaction frequency factor and activation energy. Two <b>coal</b> char <b>gasification</b> physico-mathematical models were proposed and recommendations for them were formed...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as <b>coal</b> <b>gasification</b> and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the accomplishments of the session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed <b>coal</b> <b>gasification</b> plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E
25|$|Minor {{amounts of}} {{pyridine}} are released into environment from some industrial {{processes such as}} steel manufacture, processing of oil shale, <b>coal</b> <b>gasification,</b> coking plants and incinerators. The atmosphere at oil shale processing plants can contain pyridine concentrations of up to 13µg·m−3, and 53µg·m−3 levels were measured in the groundwater {{in the vicinity of}} a <b>coal</b> <b>gasification</b> plant. According {{to a study by the}} US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, about 43,000 Americans work in contact with pyridine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{demand for}} coal {{is likely to}} fall with {{increasing}} focus on renewable energy or low-carbon sources and loss of industry due to globalisation. Oil and gas reserves are predicted to run out long before coal, so gas could be produced from <b>coal</b> by <b>gasification.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the design and}} operation of the cyclone furnace fuelled with coal dust. The main function of the furnace is <b>coal</b> dust <b>gasification.</b> The combustible gases that mainly contain CO {{can be used to}} feed a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The results of numerical calculations presented in the study demonstrated that cyclone furnace can operate over a wide range of fuel flow rates: from the conditions of coal dust combustion, which ensure maintaining the cyclone furnace in a state of hot reserve to the conditions of <b>coal</b> dust <b>gasification,</b> which allow for production of CO.

5000|$|One of {{the first}} tasks of the Corporation was the {{construction}} of a centralised brown <b>coal</b> fuelled <b>gasification</b> plant at Morwell, to replace the number of smaller town gas producing gasworks scattered throughout Melbourne. The plant opened in 1956 and used the German Lurgi process to produce gas that was transferred to Melbourne via a high pressure gas pipeline.|$|R
30|$|Hence, {{it may be}} {{concluded}} that all the catalyst either present or added to <b>coal,</b> affects the <b>gasification</b> behavior of <b>coal</b> by changing the reactivity of coal.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{pyridine}} was {{extracted from}} coal tar or obtained as {{a byproduct of}} <b>coal</b> <b>gasification.</b> The process was labor-consuming and inefficient: coal tar contains only about 0.1% pyridine, and therefore a multi-stage purification was required, which further reduced the output. Nowadays, most pyridine is produced synthetically using various name reactions, and the major ones are discussed below.|$|E

40|$|The {{study has}} been {{conducted}} on the lignite samples from 12 currently exploited, perspective and abandoned Polish deposits. Lignite is common in the Polish Lowland and {{is derived from the}} Paleogene and Neogene. In order to determine the suitability for gasification based on the petrographic composition, the diagram shown in figure 1 has been used. To be suitable for gasification, the lignite should contain at least 80 % of the macerals of the huminite and liptinite groups (H + L mmf) and less than 20 % of the macerals of the inertinite group in mineral matter free basis (Immf). The suitability for this process is problematic when the inertinite group content varies between 20 and 50 %. Overall, macerals from huminite and liptinite groups within all studied deposits are over 90 %. This indicates that the lignite from Polish deposits meet the criterion for petrographic <b>coal</b> for <b>gasification.</b> It should be noted, however, that the problem of petrographic composition of <b>coal</b> for <b>gasification</b> in various types of generators requires further studies.

25|$|Carbon capture, utilization, and {{sequestration}} (or storage) {{is increasingly}} being utilized in modern <b>coal</b> <b>gasification</b> projects {{to address the}} greenhouse gas emissions concern {{associated with the use}} of coal and carbonaceous fuels. In this respect, gasification has a significant advantage over conventional coal combustion, in which CO2 resulting from combustion is considerably diluted by nitrogen and residual oxygen in the near-ambient pressure combustion exhaust, making it relatively difficult, energy-intensive, and expensive to capture the CO2 (this is known as “post-combustion” CO2 capture).|$|E
25|$|As of 2017 {{large scale}} {{expansion}} of the <b>coal</b> <b>gasification</b> industry was occurring only in China where local governments and energy companies promote the industry {{for the sake of}} jobs and a market for coal.
