50|$|PM-ER contact {{sites have}} a well known {{role in the}} control of calcium dynamics. The major {{intracellular}} pool of calcium is the ER and its release may be triggered by different stimuli. In excitable cells the coupling between PM depolarization and the release from the intracellular pools is essential to generate the Ca2+ signalling. In muscle cells, at the triad, junctophilin, an integral ER membrane protein, is involved in ER-PM <b>contact</b> <b>stabilization</b> by interacting with PIPs in the PM. In these contact sites, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) activate closely apposed ryanodine receptors expressed on the ER to trigger calcium release during excitation-contraction coupling.However, calcium levels need to be tightly controlled in all cell types. Non-excitable cells regulate calcium influx through PM calcium channels by sensing luminal ER calcium levels (the Calcium Release Activated Channels). ORAI1 is a molecular component of the CRAC, and it interacts with STIM1 an ER protein. STIM1 can rapidly translocate to a PM-ER contact site after depletion of the ER stores.|$|E

The excess biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process {{has been shown to be}} an economical and environmentally compatible method for reducing phosphorus from wastewaters. Despite the complexity of EBPR mechanisms, appropriately designed and operated treatment plants can easily achieve phosphorus (P) removal as long as EBPR-available organic substrates such as short chain volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and an aerobic–anaerobic (respectively) reactor configuration are provided. Some factors and operating conditions, adversely affect the performance of EBPR plants. Available design and research information for the EBPR process were directly related to organic strength, solids and phosphorus content in wastewater. The success of excess biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process is largely dependent on the characteristics of organic carbon present in wastewater. The COD and BOD 5 content of wastewater will also determine whether a phosphorus removal EBPR system is required.

Thirty eyes from 30 patients with cataract and vitreoretinal disease were included, and divided into two matched groups according to disease type and ring used. In Group A, we used a 23 -gauge transconjunctival vitrectomy system and a disposable sutureless silicone lens ring (n = 15). In Group B, we used a 23 -gauge transconjunctival vitrectomy system and a conventional metal lens ring (n = 15). The main outcome measures were: time required for vitrectomy preparation, rate of intraoperative corneal limbus bleeding, and limbus scar rate at the final follow-up visit. Results: Thirty cases were successfully completed. The average vitrectomy preparation time was less in Group A than in Group B (P &lt; 0. 01), and the average preparation time saved was 3. 94 minutes. None of the Group A patients had intraoperative bleeding or postoperative scarring, whereas all 15 Group B cases had bleeding and five had scarring. There was {{a statistically significant difference}} between Group A and Group B for these complications (P &le; 0. 05). Conclusion: This report demonstrates the advantages of using a sutureless silicone ring during combined 23 -gauge vitrectomy and cataract surgery. Using this method could allow extra time for the surgeon {{to pay more attention to}} complex vitreoretinal procedures.

40|$|A {{good example}} of {{macromolecular}} recognition {{is found in the}} interaction of the two monomers of the dimeric superoxide dismutase protein found in Photobacterium leiognathi. We have produced, by molecular dynamics simulation techniques, a specific path for the rupture of the dimer and calculated the effective force involved in the process by extending a well established free energy calculation scheme, the molecular dynamics blue moon approach to rare events. Within this picture we have generalized the approach to a vectorial reaction coordinate and performed a number of different simulations in function of the monomer-momomer separation, at fixed relative orientation. We find a deep minimum and we compute the height of the free energy barrier to break the dimer. As for the system characterization we have found that, when the separation distance increases, the protein structure is stable and the monomer-monomer interface is uniformly hydrated. Moreover, identifying the crucial <b>contacts</b> for the <b>stabilization</b> of the dimer, we have found the sequence of the different microscopic events in the monomer-monomer recognition and we have developed a view of the process which requires a merging of standard explanations, in agreement with the recent picture of recognition as a dynamical process mixing the various mechanisms previously considered [Kimura, Biophys. J. 80 635 (2001) ]. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of epithelial cell contacts in determining cell behavior, we still lack a detailed understanding of the assembly and disassembly of intercellular contacts. Here we examined {{the role of the}} catalytic activity of the Src family kinases at epithelial cell contacts in vitro. Like E- and P-cadherin, Ca 2 + treatment of normal and tumor-derived human keratinocytes resulted in c-Yes (and c-Src and Fyn), as well as their putative substrate p 120 CTN, being recruited to cell–cell contacts. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selectivity against the Src family kinases, PD 162531, and a dominant-inhibitory c-Src protein that interferes with the catalytic function of the endogenous Src kinases induced cell–cell contact and E-cadherin redistribution, even in low Ca 2 +, which does not normally support stable cell–cell adhesion. Time-lapse microscopy demonstrated that Src kinase inhibition induced stabilization of transiently formed intercellular contacts in low Ca 2 +. Furthermore, a combination of E- and P-cadherin-specific antibodies suppressed cell–cell contact, indicating cadherin involvement. As a consequence of <b>contact</b> <b>stabilization,</b> normal cells were unable to dissociate from an epithelial sheet formed at high density and repair a wound in vitro, although individual cells were still motile. Thus, cadherin-dependent contacts can be stabilized both by high Ca 2 + and by inhibiting Src activity in low (0. 03 mM) Ca 2 + in vitro...|$|E
40|$|CAS {{might have}} {{a key role in}} the {{apoptosis}} induced by toxins, acting as anti-apoptotic factor, stimulating the cellular proliferation and the cell <b>contact</b> <b>stabilization.</b> To start to elucidate their role in the brain apoptosis of Bufo arenarum induced by cypermethrin (CY), the expression patterns of CAS and several cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) were established. Bufo arenarum tadpoles of the control and acute bioassay survival at different doses (39, 156, 625 and 2, 500 µg CY/L) and times (24, 48, 72 and 96 h) of CY treatment were fixed in Carnoy, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. CAS and CAMs expression was determined by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively. When the bioassay starts, CAS increases suggesting a proliferative or regenerative effect, but decreases when the doses and/or the biocide exposure time increases, suggesting compromise of the cellular cycle control and trigger of an apoptotic wave. However, these neurotoxic mechanisms should not involve degradation of N-cadherin and &# 945;-catenin, in contrast of &# 946;-catenin and axonal N-CAM 180, at least in the initial apoptotic phase. Additionally, an adhesion compensatory mechanism by N-CAM 180 is observed in the neuron cell body. These results suggest a dual role of CAS in the cellular cycle control during the CY-induced apoptosis: induction of cell proliferation and stabilization of the cell-cell junctions by modulating CAMs expression...|$|E
40|$|Wastewater is {{typically}} {{treated by the}} conventional activated sludge process, which suffers from an inefficient overall energy balance. The high-rate <b>contact</b> <b>stabilization</b> (HiCS) has been proposed as a promising primary treatment technology with which to maximize redirection of organics to sludge for subsequent energy recovery. It utilizes a feast famine cycle to select for bioflocculation, intracellular storage, or both. We optimized the HiCS process for organics recovery and characterized different biological pathways of organics removal and recovery. A total of eight HiCS reactors were operated at 15 degrees C at short solids retention times (SRT; 0. 24 - 2. 8 days), hydraulic contact times (t(c); 8 and 15 min), and stabilization times (t(s); 15 and 40 min). At an optimal SRT between 0. 5 and 1. 3 days and t(c) of 15 min and t(s) of 40 min, the HiCS system oxidized only 10 % of influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and recovered up to 55 % of incoming organic matter into sludge. Storage played a minor role in the overall COD removal, which was likely dominated by aerobic biomass growth, bioflocculation onto extracellular polymeric substances, and settling. The HiCS process recovers enough organics to potentially produce 28 kWh of electricity per population equivalent per year by anaerobic digestion and electricity generation. This inspires new possibilities for energy-neutral wastewater treatment...|$|E
40|$|A pilot-scale {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate a traditional contact stabilization activated sludge system (CSASC) and a modified CSAS (CSASM) treating domestic wastewater.  The CSASC system was comprised of a <b>contact</b> reactor (CR), a <b>stabilization</b> reactor (SR) and a secondary settler(SS); the CSASM included a second CR, a second SS (CR 2  and SS 2), and a modified SR (SRM) divided into four zones: an attached-suspended growth zone which allowed the system to reach an average sludge retention time close to  36 d and favored the occurrence of nitrification; an anoxic zone for denitrification occurrence; an aerated suspended growth zone with a high presence of organic carbon; and an additional aerated suspended growth zone with a high ammonia concentrations environment. The CSASC’s removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) were respectively 94 ± 4 % and 53 ± 12 %; whereas CSASM’s efficiencies were 88 ± 7 % for COD and 92 ± 7 % for TAN. Concentrations of TAN and NO 3 [...] N in the CSASC’s final effluent were 14. 3 ± 5. 2 and 5. 0 ± 2. 9 mg×L- 1; and 4. 8 ± 4. 4 and 9. 1 ± 5. 8 mg×L- 1 in the CSASM’s final effluent. Results demonstrated that the proposed configuration obtained higher nitrogen removal efficiencies than traditional CSAS...|$|R
40|$|While total knee {{replacement}} (TKR) {{has a high}} success rate, TKR {{patients are}} still experiencing limitations in performing functionally demanding tasks. Improving function therefore requires a more accurate understanding of the mechanical loading conditions in the knee joint. Here, gait analysis was performed on 9 patients with telemetric knee implants for activities which require flexion/extension as well as stabilization of the joint. In order to gain insight into the internal load distribution, the in vivo measurements were complemented by patient specific musculoskeletal computer models. The combination of in vivo measurements and computer models provided unprecedented evidence that the muscle forces required for knee extension generate patello-femoral contact forces above 3 times bodyweight, which is the level the tibio-femoral <b>contact</b> forces. The <b>stabilization</b> of the knee joint in the frontal plane was dominated by passive mechanisms. The medio-lateral distribution of the tibio-femoral contact force alone balanced more than 60 % of the external adduction moment during walking and stair climbing, which reduces the necessity for compensation by muscles. The medial tibio-femoral contact force correlated well with the external adduction moment, which had more influence on the medial contact force than the external flexion moment, even during high flexion activities. However, {{the relationship between these}} external and internal loads varied between patients, suggesting that inter-individually different strategies of active stabilization of the knee joint do exist. The individual strategies of joint stabilization are quantitatively ascertainable by computer models and can, beyond informing novel implant designs, open up new perspectives for improving function after TKR...|$|R
40|$|Pentameric ligand-gated ion {{channels}} are activated by the binding of agonists {{to a site}} distant from the ion conduction path. These membrane proteins consist of distinct ligand-binding and pore domains that interact via an extended interface. Here, we have investigated the role of residues at this interface for channel activation to define critical interactions that couple conformational changes between the two structural units. By characterizing point mutants of the prokaryotic channels ELIC and GLIC by electrophysiology, X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry, we have identified conserved residues that, upon mutation, apparently prevent activation but not ligand binding. The positions of nonactivating mutants cluster at a loop within the extracellular domain connecting β-strands 6 and 7 and at a loop joining the pore-forming helix M 2 with M 3 where they contribute to a densely packed core of the protein. An ionic interaction in the extracellular domain between the turn connecting β-strands 1 and 2 and a residue {{at the end of}} β-strand 10 stabilizes a state of the receptor with high affinity for agonists, whereas contacts of this turn to a conserved proline residue in the M 2 -M 3 loop appear to be less important than previously anticipated. When mapping residues with strong functional phenotype on different channel structures, mutual distances are closer in conducting than in nonconducting conformations, consistent with a potential role of <b>contacts</b> in the <b>stabilization</b> of the open state. Our study has revealed a pattern of interactions that are crucial for the relay of conformational changes from the extracellular domain to the pore region of prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Due to the strong conservation of the interface, these results are relevant for the entire family...|$|R
