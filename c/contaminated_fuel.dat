5|$|When World War II began, Friedrich Ihn was {{initially}} {{deployed in the}} Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sister ships in laying defensive minefields. She also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in October. The ship was scheduled to conduct a minelaying operation off the British coast in early November, but it was cancelled {{when one of the}} other destroyers assigned to participate suffered machinery problems from <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuel</b> oil.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in the Mediterranean, Lyster {{proposed}} a carrier airstrike on the Italian fleet at its base in Taranto, as the Royal Navy had been planning since the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935, and Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, approved the idea by 22 September 1940. The attack, with both available carriers, was originally planned for 21 October, {{the anniversary of the}} Battle of Trafalgar, but a hangar fire aboard Illustrious on 18 October forced its postponement until 11 November when the next favourable phase of the moon occurred. The fire destroyed three Swordfish and heavily damaged two others, but they were replaced by aircraft from Eagle, whose <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks prevented her from participating in the attack.|$|E
40|$|Advantages of {{fuel nozzle}} over {{conventional}} pressure-atomizing fuel nozzles: simplicity of construction, ability to distribute fuel-air mixture uniformly across full height of combustor without using auxiliary air supply, reliability when using <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuels,</b> and durability of nozzle at high operating temperatures...|$|R
50|$|The {{kerosene}} {{from which}} the two yeast strains were isolated was analyzed with gas chromatography and shown to have 48 identifiable components. C. keroseneae appears to consume the n-alkane compounds hexadecane, heptadecane, and octadecane. Other microbes that can <b>contaminate</b> <b>fuels</b> include the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, the filamentous fungus Hormoconis resinae, and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{forms of}} sulfur that {{refiners}} or pipelines may leave in finished gasoline, such as mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide, can <b>contaminate</b> <b>fuel</b> sending units {{and lead to}} erratic dashboard fuel gauge readings, which may be expensive to repair. The regular use of a TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline can prevent this from occurring. However, this problem has become less common as manufacturers are now making these units with improved alloys that are less affected by these forms of sulfur.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{allocated}} to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung. The group's {{task was to}} transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment (139. Gebirgsjäger Regiment) and {{the headquarters of the}} 3rd Mountain Division (3. Gebirgs-Division) to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and sailed the next day. Giese fell behind the rest of Group 1 as the result of oil leaks, machinery breakdowns, and <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuel</b> oil. She fell further behind when Lieutenant Commander (Korvettenkapitän) Karl Smidt turned the ship about to recover a soldier who had been washed overboard by the high seas. Giese had little usable fuel left by this time and was forced to continue at a slower speed to conserve fuel. When the ship arrived at her destination on 9 April, she landed her troops in the Herjangsfjord (a northern branch of the Ofotfjord) to reinforce the other troops previously landed there in order to capture the Norwegian Army armory at Elvegårdsmoen. Later in the day, Erich Giese moved to Narvik harbor, but was not able to refuel before she was ordered to return to the Herjangsfjord well before dawn together with her sisters Wolfgang Zenker and Erich Koellner.|$|E

25|$|A {{public inquiry}} was opened in London at Holborn Town Hall on 2 July 1953 to {{consider}} possible {{causes of the}} loss of the York. The Solicitor General representing The Crown absolved the crew from blame; he also ruled out sabotage or <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuel.</b> On the second day the Chief Investigation Officer of the Accidents Investigation Branch (AIB) gave an opinion that it may have been an uncontrollable fire in one of the aircraft's engines.|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art {{thermal barrier}} {{coatings}} (TBCs) developed {{for aircraft engines}} can achieve both hot-section component operating temperature reductions and superior oxidation resistance. Such TBCs typically consist of two layers: a metallic, often NiCrAlY 'bond' inner layer {{in contact with the}} superalloy structural component, and an outer, insulating ceramic layer. A ceramic frequently used in this role due to its high durability is plasma-sprayed ZrO 2, partially stabilized with 6 - 8 wt pct Y 2 O 3. TBCs can also be useful in nonaircraft gas turbines, which frequently use highly <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuels...</b>|$|R
50|$|Plumes of {{volcanic}} ash near active volcanoes are an aviation safety hazard, especially for night flights. Volcanic ash is hard and abrasive, and can quickly cause significant wear to propellers and turbocompressor blades, and scratch cockpit windows, impairing visibility. The ash <b>contaminates</b> <b>fuel</b> and water systems, can jam gears, and make engines flameout. Its particles have low melting point, so they melt in the combustion chamber and the ceramic mass then sticks to turbine blades, fuel nozzles, and combustors—which {{can lead to}} total engine failure. Ash can also contaminate the cabin and damage avionics.|$|R
5000|$|Where the saboteur might <b>contaminate</b> {{aircraft}} <b>fuel,</b> {{the aircraft}} {{could be put}} out of service by a clerk committing subversion, by delaying or losing maintenance orders, resupply of fuel or munitions, or [...] "misrouting" [...] an order for the aircraft to attack ...|$|R
500|$|At 06:13, Leach {{gave the}} order to retreat; only five of his ship's ten [...] guns were still firing and his ship had {{sustained}} significant damage. Prince of Wales made a 160° turn and laid a smoke screen to cover her withdrawal. The Germans ceased fire as the range widened. Though Lindemann strongly advocated chasing Prince of Wales and destroying her, Lütjens obeyed operational orders to shun any avoidable engagement with enemy forces that were not protecting a convoy, firmly rejecting the request, and instead ordered Bismarck and Prinz Eugen {{to head for the}} North Atlantic. In the engagement, Bismarck had fired 93 armour-piercing shells and had been hit by three shells in return. The forecastle hit allowed [...] of water to flood into the ship, which <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuel</b> oil stored in the bow. Lütjens refused to reduce speed to allow damage control teams to repair the shell hole which widened and allowed more water into the ship. The second hit caused some additional flooding. Shell-splinters from the second hit also damaged a steam line in the turbo-generator room, but this was not serious, as Bismarck had sufficient other generator reserves. The combined flooding from these two hits caused a 9-degree list to port and a 3-degree [...] by the bow.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 September 2007, the Tanzanian-flagged {{passenger}} ferry Spice Islander I was off {{the coast}} of Somalia when she experienced engine problems due to <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuel.</b> After the alarm had been raised via Kenya, the destroyer Stout, operating with Combined Task Force 150, was dispatched to her aid. The Spice Islander had been on a voyage from Oman to Tanzania, and it was not carrying any passengers. The destroyer James E. Williams also responded. Stout provided the ship with [...] of fuel and supplied the ten-man crew with food and water. After her engines were restarted, she resumed her voyage to Tanzania.|$|E
50|$|The Bulk Oil Storage and Transportation (BOST) was in {{the news}} to have sold 5 million litres of <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuel</b> to an {{unlicensed}} company Movepiina and Zup Oil which {{is alleged to have}} caused Ghana to lose 7 million Ghana Cedis in revenue. The Minister of Energy Mr. Boakye Agyarko came out to say the BNI has cleared BOST of any wrong doing which the Minority in Parliament believes its a cover up by the Government on in the <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuel</b> saga.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrogen is odorless, colorless and tasteless, so {{most human}} senses won’t help {{to detect a}} leak. By comparison, natural gas is also odorless, colorless and tasteless, but {{industry}} adds a sulfur-containing odorant called a mercaptan to make it detectable by people. Currently, all known odorants <b>contaminate</b> <b>fuel</b> cells (a popular application for hydrogen). However, given hydrogen’s tendency to rise quickly, a hydrogen leak indoors would briefly collect on the ceiling and eventually move towards the corners and away from where any nose might detect it. For that and other reasons, industry often uses hydrogen sensors to help detect hydrogen leaks and has maintained a high safety record using them for decades. Researchers are investigating other methods that might be used for hydrogen detection: tracers, new odorant technology, advanced sensors and others.|$|R
40|$|A biopile was {{assessed}} by moving most of the soil <b>contaminated</b> by diesel <b>fuel</b> to a near site. The structure was organized with an aeration and a re-circulating water systems and a microbial inoculant containing a dried consortium of oil degrading bacterial strains was periodically released in the soil. The degradation of the <b>contaminating</b> diesel <b>fuel</b> was constantly monitored. In order {{to understand how the}} newly introduced microflora and the resident microbial populations are involved in the remediation activity, a study on the nature of both the microbial components was undertaken. This included isolation from soil, investigations on the metabolic activity of soil microbiota, respiration activity of soil bacteria, soil DNA extraction and analyses...|$|R
50|$|Engines one, two {{and three}} were {{replaced}} at Jakarta, {{as well as the}} windscreen, and the fuel tanks were cleared of the ash that had entered them through the pressurisation ducts, <b>contaminating</b> the <b>fuel</b> and requiring that it be disposed of. After the aircraft was ferried back to London, engine number four was replaced and major work was undertaken to return the 747 to service.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, {{there were}} 393 <b>contaminated</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks needing cleanup. 457 potable wells were within 0.25 mi of these tanks, and {{therefore}} posing a potential health threat to those consuming water from them.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{remediation}} of soil {{contaminated with}} petroleum based compounds by white rot fungi is well documented.   In this study {{the ability of}} diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils treated with the fungus Pleurotus tuber-regium to support plant growth was tested.   Pleurotus tuber-regium was grown in different levels (2. 50, 5. 00, 10. 00 % and control- no fungus for each level of contamination) of diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>contaminated</b> soil and sawdust. The removal of petroleum hydrocarbons was highest in the 5. 00 % level of contamination where 55. 53 % of the petroleum hydrocarbons were removed. The least reduction in hydrocarbons was in the 10. 00 % level of contamination where only 35. 53 % of the hydrocarbons were removed. After the remediation the toxicity of the soils were tested by growing Zea mays in the treated soils. There was reduction in the toxicity of the soils treated with Pleurotus tuber-regium. Germination of {{the seeds of the}} test plant in treated 2. 50 and 5. 00 % diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>contaminated</b> substrates was higher than that in the control. Germination of seeds in the 10. 00 % diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>contaminated</b> substrates was less than that in the control. The continued growth of the plant in the treated soils however showed no significant difference between them and the control using leaf area, plant height, fresh weight, dry weight and root length indices. The formation of lateral roots was however adversely affected in the treated 10. 00 % contaminated soil only substrate. The fungus was able to reduce the toxicity of diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>contaminated</b> substrates when compared with control in which there was no remediation. Industrial relevance: Nigeria is an oil producing country with heavy or high reliance on diesel fuel for use in cars and electric power generating sets. The transportation of diesel fuel is by tankers and pipelines. There have been cases of spills which has adverse effect on the environment. The study aims to solve the process of amelioration of the environment biologically by the use of white rot fungi which is more environments friendly and cheaper for a developing country like Nigeria. The assessment of the improvement of contaminated soil by the fungus is tested by using Zea mays easily obtained and cheaper too. The fungus Pleurotus tuber - regium is indigenous to Nigeria and can be used for the remediation of diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>contaminated</b> soils or substrates. </p...|$|R

50|$|In April 2010, Cathay Pacific Flight 780, an {{aircraft}} carrying over 300 passengers, {{had a close}} call when <b>fuel</b> <b>contaminated</b> with spherical particles damaged the aircraft's engines, resulting in 57 passenger injuries as the pilots had to land the aircraft at twice the normal landing speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{variant of}} the gaseous fission reactor is called the gas core reactor rocket. There are two approaches: the open and closed cycle. In the open cycle, the propellant, most likely hydrogen, is fed to the reactor, heated up by the nuclear reaction in the reactor, and exits out the other end. Unfortunately, the propellant will be <b>contaminated</b> by <b>fuel</b> and fission products, and although the problem can be mitigated by engineering the hydrodynamics within the reactor, it renders the rocket design completely unsuitable for use in atmosphere.|$|R

50|$|On April 22, 1992, a skydiving {{aircraft}} lost {{engine power}} during takeoff and crashed. The plane never climbed more than 50 {{feet above the}} runway. There were 22 on board, sixteen of them (2 pilots and 14 skydivers, including 2 Dutch nationals) died in the crash. Two other Dutch skydivers survived, as did 3 Americans and a South African. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) attributed engine failure to aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>contaminated</b> by improper <b>fuel</b> handling. The pilots' response to engine failure {{also contributed to the}} crash. Apparently there was a design-flaw in the Otter that facilitated accidental beta configuration of the propellers in an emergency situation. In a Flight Simulator, shortly after the crash, two other very experienced and current Otter pilots did the same thing as the pilot on the ill-fated flight.|$|R
