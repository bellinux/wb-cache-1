Moreover. after internalization, <b>crocidolite</b> <b>asbestos</b> fibers are often found free in the cytoplasm. whereas glass wool fibers are mainly localized inside cytoplasmic vacuoles. After treatments. we also detected signs of oxidative stress. revealed by an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and by ail induction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The lipoperoxidative damage was characterized by a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), ail increase in the content of thiobarbituric reactive species (TBARS) and a consumption of vitamin E, as a lipophilic antioxidant.

40|$|Although all {{commercial}} {{types of}} asbestos can cause pulmonary fibrosis, {{little is known}} about ultrastructural differences in the evolution of pulmonary lesions induced by amphiboles and serpentines. The present study was designed to compare the histological and ultrastructural effects produced by chronic inhalation of either crocidolite (amphibole) or chrysotile (serpentine) asbestos in the rat. Animals, exposed by intermittent inhalation for 3 months, were killed after 2 to 16 months. When inhaled, both types of asbestos caused thickened alveolar duct bifurcations associated with macrophage aggregates. Crocidolite inhalation also produced subpleural collections of alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes. Electron microscopy revealed some similarities, but also distinct differences, in the pulmonary distribution of inhaled chrysotile and <b>crocidolite.</b> Whereas both <b>asbestos</b> varieties were identified within the pulmonary interstitium, only crocidolite was detected inside alveolar macrophages.

40|$|We {{have used}} a rat intratracheal {{instillation}} model to study the effect of <b>crocidolite</b> <b>asbestos</b> exposure on cytokine production by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) leucocytes. In unexposed controls, the normal BAL leucocytes were mostly macrophages which spontaneously produced interleukin 1 (IL- 1) -like activity and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) in culture; these levels were enhanced by stimulation with LPS. In animals exposed to <b>crocidolite</b> <b>asbestos,</b> two new types of cell, neutrophils and eosinophils, were recruited into the bronchoalveolar space by 1 - 3 days after instillation. However, the BAL profile had returned to normal by 14 days. The production of IL- 1 -like activity was decreased considerably compared to control from 1 to 14 days after asbestos instillation, but was increased at 30 days. However, the leucocytes produced increased TNF-alpha as early as 3 days after asbestos instillation and maintained this elevated level throughout the experimental period. <b>Crocidolite</b> <b>asbestos</b> in vitro also stimulated normal BAL leucocytes to release significantly increased amounts of IL- 1 -like activity and TNF-alpha. We conclude that the deposition of <b>crocidolite</b> <b>asbestos</b> fibre in the lung by instillation causes reduced production of IL- 1 -like activity in the acute phase, but elevated production of both IL- 1 -like activity and TNF in the chronic phase, suggesting that enhanced activities of these cytokines {{may contribute to the}} development of lung pathological changes in the long term...|$|E

This was reflected in the lung and the pleura where no significant pathological response was observed at any time point in the brake dust or chrysotile/brake dust exposure groups through 365 days post exposure. In contrast, <b>crocidolite</b> <b>asbestos</b> produced a rapid inflammatory response in the lung parenchyma and the pleura, inducing a significant increase in fibrotic response in both of these compartments. Crocidolite fibers were observed embedded in the diaphragm with activated mesothelial cells immediately after cessation of exposure. While no chrysotile fibers were found in the mediastinal lymph nodes, crocidolite fibers of up to 35 μm were observed. These results provide support that brake-dust derived from chrysotile containing brake drums would not initiate a pathological response in the lung or the pleural cavity following short term inhalation...|$|E

50|$|Asbestos is a {{naturally}} occurring group of silicate minerals that can readily be separated into thin strong fibres that are flexible, heat resistant and chemically inert. Within the United Kingdom {{and elsewhere in}} the world, asbestos was used extensively as a building material from the 1950s to the 1980s. It was used as a means of fireproofing as well as insulation and any building built before 2000 could contain asbestos. Although Asbestos can be safe if the material is kept in good condition and undisturbed, if damaged asbestos fibres could become airborne and cause serious risks to health if inhaled. Serious diseases including mesothelioma, lung cancer, and asbestosis could result if someone were to breathe in high levels of asbestos fibres. A particular risk if someone were to be working either on, or with, asbestos materials which had been damaged. There are six forms of Asbestos although only three are commonly used, these are Chrysotile (white asbestos), the most common; Amosite (brown asbestos) which can often be found in ceiling tiles and as a fire retardant in thermal insulation products; <b>Crocidolite</b> (blue <b>asbestos),</b> commonly used in high temperature applications.|$|R

40|$|Asbestos is a {{group of}} {{naturally}} occurring minerals. Depending on the physical properties of the asbestos fibres, two main groups are distinguished, especially the amphiboles and serpentines. Amphiboles include amosite (brown <b>asbestos)</b> and <b>crocidolite</b> (blue <b>asbestos).</b> These fibres are straight and needle-like. Serpentines include chrysotile (white asbestos) these are curled fibres. These types of asbestos were used in large quantities in industry in the 20 th century. All three of the above types of asbestos can induce cancer, more specific inhalation of asbestos fibres leads to lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) a new class of nanomaterials made up of circular hollow graphene layers with physicochemical properties related to asbestos. Due to their fibrous structure and small diameter, they can also be inhaled and induce toxicity in the lung and one type has identified to be a ‘possible’ carcinogen by IARC (MWCNT- 7). CNTs are classified according to the number of layers in their structure: single walled CNTs or SWCNTs and multi-walled (CNTs) or MWCNTS. Epigenetics is a relatively young research field in toxicology. Epigenetics is defined as "stable hereditary phenotype due to changes in a chromosome without changes in the DNA sequence" (Berger et al., 2009).

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{inhalation}} of fibrous amphiboles {{can result}} in pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. Although these fibres have the same disease-causing potential, their different morphologies and chemical composition can determine different biological activities. An unusual cluster of mesothelioma was evidenced in Biancavilla (Sicily) where no inhabitant had been significantly exposed to asbestos. OBJECTIVE. We herein discuss the mechanism of action of amphiboles, focusing on the fibres identified in the study area. RESULTS. Human lung carcinoma cells {{have been exposed to}} two different materials: prismatic fluoro-edenite and fibres with fluoro-edenitic composition. Only in the second case, they exhibit features typical of transformed cells, such as multinucleation, prosurvival activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine release.
