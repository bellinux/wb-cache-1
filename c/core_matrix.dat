Solid lipid nanoparticles possess a solid lipid <b>core</b> <b>matrix</b> that can solubilize lipophilic molecules. The lipid core is stabilized by surfactants (emulsifiers). The term lipid is used {{here in a}} broader sense and includes triglycerides (e.g. tristearin), diglycerides (e.g. glycerol bahenate), monoglycerides (e.g. glycerol monostearate), fatty acids (e.g. stearic acid), steroids (e.g. cholesterol), and waxes (e.g. cetyl palmitate). All classes of emulsifiers (with respect to charge and molecular weight) {{have been used to}} stabilize the lipid dispersion. It has been found that the combination of emulsifiers might prevent particle agglomeration more efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Since the vectors {{extracted}} {{are determined}} by the data matrix, {{it is not possible to}} compare factors obtained from different censuses. A solution consists in fusing together several census matrices in a unique table which, then, may be analyzed. This, however, assumes that the definition of the variables has not changed over time and produces very large tables, difficult to manage. A better solution, proposed by psychometricians, groups the data in a « cubic matrix », with three entries (for instance, locations, variables, time periods). A Three-Way Factor Analysis produces then three groups of factors related by a small cubic « <b>core</b> <b>matrix</b> ». This method, which exhibits data evolution over time, has not been widely used in geography. In Los Angeles, however, it has exhibited the role, traditionally ignored, of Downtown as an organizing center for the whole city during several decades.|$|E
50|$|The walls {{consist of}} two faces of {{brickwork}} between {{which is a}} rubble <b>core</b> <b>matrix.</b> The bonding of the brickwork is characteristic of a late medieval date. Irregular shaped bricks are laid in a fairly thick mortar and in a haphazard bond consisting largely of rows of stretchers with the occasional header used to bond the two wall surfaces together. This construction pre-dated the widespread adoption of English Bond (alternating courses of headers and stretchers) and Flemish Bond (alternating headers and stretchers in each course) in England. The courses of brickwork are bonded together with a lime-based 'common mortar' which was originally pointed back flush with the wall face. It survives on the bedding planes and is exposed in several places on the north elevation. In the kitchen a doorway between the Guildhall which would now lead {{to the back of}} Blackfriars Theatre was blocked and may tentatively be dated to the post-Reformation period (mid sixteenth century) on functional grounds. It reflects a change in the provision of access into {{and the use of the}} ground floor which may relate to the adaptation of the building after the suppression of the religious guild of St. Marys. It is thought that this doorway allowed access for the beadsmen or perhaps was access between the Guildhall and the kitchens of Blackfriars prior to the kitchens being established in the Guildhall.|$|E

40|$|A {{convenient}} and versatile {{approach to the}} direct synthesis of a peptide-antigen matrix by the solid-phase method is described. The approach is called the multiple antigen peptide system (MAP) and it utilizes a simple scaffolding of a low number of sequential levels (n) of a trifunctional amino acid as the <b>core</b> <b>matrix</b> and 2 n peptide antigens to form a macromolecule with a high density of peptide antigens of final Mr 10, 000. The MAP model chosen for study was an octa-branching MAP consisting of a <b>core</b> <b>matrix</b> made up of three levels of lysine and eight amino terminals for anchoring peptide antigens. The MAP, containing both the <b>core</b> <b>matrix</b> and peptides of 9 - 16 amino acids, was prepared in a single synthesis by the solid-phase method. Six different MAPs elicited specific antibodies in rabbits and mice, of which five produced antibodies that reacted with their corresponding native proteins. In rabbits, the sera had a considerably higher titer of antibodies than sera prepared from the same peptides anchored covalently to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as carrier. Thus, the MAP provided a general, but chemically unambiguous, approach for the preparation of carrier-bound antigens of predetermined and reproducible structure and might be suitable for generating vaccines...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{discover}} to whom the pharmacy profession adds value and how it describes and documents that value, to inform other health care professionals of that value, and to present a method of review. Definitions of 'values' and 'value' were used to develop this methodology. Three ranking terms (benefit, demand, satisfaction) and three whom-value-serves labels (individual, institution, society) were chosen. Whom-value-serves label(s) were assigned to each article within the <b>core</b> <b>matrix.</b> The search years were 1984 to 1995. The articles were analyzed using the Matrix Method(TM). From this matrix template, further in-depth analyses were completed. Of 86 articles on the <b>core</b> <b>matrix,</b> one-fourth were published in medically-related journals. An article could have more than one whom-value-serves label. As a percentage of total whom-value-serves designations the 'institution' labels were prominent.

Ketoprofen (KET) was used as a model drug, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and Eudragit® L 100 - 55 (EL 100) respectively taken as sheath and <b>core</b> <b>matrices,</b> to prepare nanofibers. Scanning and transmission electron microscope observations demonstrated that the nanofibers had smooth surfaces and cross-sections, and distinct core-sheath nanostructures.

Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction results indicated that the nanofibers contained KET homogeneously distributed in both the sheath and core parts of the fibers. IR spectra indicated that this molecular dispersion was likely to be a result of hydrogen bonding between the components. In vitro dissolution tests showed that the core-sheath fibers provided dual drug release profiles with an immediate release of 35. 1 % in acidic solutions and sustained release of 62. 2 % in a pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer.
