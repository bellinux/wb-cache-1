For modern enterprises, knowledge management is applied to enhance the core power of competition and development. The internet/intranet-based enterprise knowledge management will be helpful to all the stages of the whole product life-cycle, including the excavation of knowledge, verification flow, knowledge sharing and innovation, <b>coding</b> <b>management</b> technology, knowledge attribute view and application knowledge-unit technology etc. This paper mainly discusses how to implement overall structure of networked knowledge management, construction, key technology specification and practical application of enterprises...|$|R

40|$|In this {{qualitative}} study ”Nice girls {{go to heaven}} {{but the rest of}} us go much further”, Johanna Olsson and Caroline Seveson examine how women in male-dominated management boards have experienced and handled female gender roles in order to reach management positions. The study has a gender perspective and semi-structured interviews were conducted with five women. Previous research shows that there is a role incongruity between female gender roles and management positions since these positions often are coded as male. To analyze the material, a theoretical framework was chosen based on previous research and the study’s empirical data. The framework consists of theories discussing structures that can affect women’s career progress and coping strategies that can be used by women to handle female gender roles in order to reach management positions. The analysis shows that female gender roles can affect women’s career progress. The role incongruity between female gender roles and male <b>coded</b> <b>management</b> positions {{does not seem to have}} affected the participants notably since they, in comparison to “nice girls”, match the male norm and male <b>coded</b> <b>management</b> positions. The participants have occasionally used a gender neutral strategy, conformist strategy and loyalty strategy in order to reach management positions and parts of the theoretical framework could be developed based on the result of the study...|$|R

30|$|A {{meta-analysis}} was performed, whereby {{descriptive statistics}} were calculated to summarise {{and explain the}} results of the systematic review process. To compare findings of each study individual characteristics and data were tabulated onto a spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) for <b>coding,</b> <b>management,</b> review, and data reference for statistic entry. Descriptive statistics including sample size (n), mean (M), and standard deviations (SD) were taken from each study, to provide information for the mean differences in pre- to post-intervention between groups (e.g. LF, MF, and HF) on various strength outcomes. Muscular strength was considered a continuous data variable; therefore, the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were used to determine ES measures (Table 3).|$|R
