50|$|Plasma cutting {{involves}} {{cutting a}} material using a plasma torch. It {{is commonly used}} to cut steel and other metals, but {{can be used on}} a variety of materials. In this process, gas (such as compressed air) is blown at high speed out of a nozzle; at the same time an electrical arc is formed through that gas from the nozzle to the surface being <b>cut,</b> <b>turning</b> some of that gas to plasma. The plasma is sufficiently hot to melt the material being cut and moves sufficiently fast to blow molten metal away from the cut.|$|E

50|$|The wood is soft, white {{when first}} <b>cut,</b> <b>turning</b> to pale red; the knots are attractively mottled. The timber {{is not used}} where {{strength}} is required in the construction industry, but is used for paper-making, the manufacture of fibreboard {{and the production of}} energy. Under water the wood is very durable and is used for deep foundations of buildings. The piles beneath the Rialto in Venice, and the foundations of several medieval cathedrals are made of alder. The Roman architect Vitruvius mentioned that the timber was used {{in the construction of the}} causeways across the Ravenna marshes. The wood is used in joinery, both as solid timber and as veneer, where its grain and colour are appreciated, and it takes dye well. As the wood is soft, flexible and somewhat light, it can be easily worked as well as split. It is valued in turnery and carving, in making furniture, window frames, clogs, toys, blocks, pencils and bowls.|$|E

40|$|Compound states {{manifest}} themselves as bound states, resonances, or primitives, and their character {{is determined by}} their interaction with the continuum. If the interaction experiences a perturbation, a compound state can change its manifestation. Phase analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering indicates the existence of primitives in the 3 S 1, 1 S 0, and 3 P 0 channels. Electromagnetic interaction can shift primitives from the unitary <b>cut,</b> <b>turning</b> them into narrow resonances. We evaluate this effect on the 1 S 0 proton-proton scattering channel {{within the framework of}} the Simonov-Dyson model. We show that electromagnetic interaction turns a primitve with a mass of 2000 MeV into a dibaryon resonance of approximately the same mass and a width of 260 keV. Narrow resonances of a similar nature may occur in other nucleon-nucleon channels. Experimental confirmation of the existence of narrow resonances would have important implications for the theory of nucleon-nucleon interaction.

Specification purpose of scientific research aimed at the intensification of turning. Design/methodology/approach. The problem of increasing {{the efficiency of the}} GTE disks and shafts production through the intensification of the turning is still relevant because of the tendency of materials used in aircraft engine. With regard to the manufacturing processes of the gas turbine engines discs and shafts, the proportion of turning operations in the structure of some of them reaches 60 %.

If an Island Independent is chosen the following week to be the council's chairperson, who casts a deciding vote in the event of a tie, this would leave the Island Independents with an effective majority.|$|R
