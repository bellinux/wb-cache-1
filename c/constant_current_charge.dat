50|$|The non-aqueous Li-air {{batteries}} {{were demonstrated}} first (Abraham and Jiang 1996). They usually {{use the same}} mixed ethylene carbonate+ propylene carbonate solvents with LiPF6 or Li bis-sulfonimide salts like the conventional lithium-ion batteries, however, with a gelled rather than liquid electrolyte. (Imanishi, Matsui, et al. 2014) The voltage difference upon <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> <b>charge</b> and discharge is usually between 1.3 and 1.8 V (with an OCP of ca. 4.2 V) even at such ridiculously low currents as 0.01-0.5 mA/cmÂ² and 50-500 mA/g of C on the positive electrode (see Fig. 2 as an example), (Balaish, Kraytsberg et al. 2014, McCloskey, Burke, et al. 2015, Liu, Xu, et al. 2016). However, the carbonate solvents do evaporate and get oxidized due to a high overvoltage upon charge, (Lu and Amine 2013) and other solvents, such as end-capped glymes, DMSO, dimethylacetamide, and ionic liquids, have been considered. (Balaish, Kraytsberg et al. 2014, Imanishi, Matsui et al. 2014) Carbon cathode also gets oxidized above +3.5 V v Li during charge forming Li2CO3, which leads to an irreversible capacity loss (Imanishi, Matsui et al. 2014).|$|E

Three {{of the four}} waveforms investigated were 120 Hz full wave rectified sinusoidal (FWRS), 120 Hz silicon controlled rectified (SCR), and 1 kHz square wave (SW). The fourth, a <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> method, {{was used as a}} baseline of comparison. Three sealed Ni-Zn cells connected in series were cycled. Each series string was charged at an average c/ 20 rate, and discharged at a c/ 2. 5 rate to a 75 % rated depth. Results indicate that the relatively inexpensive 120 Hz FWRS charger appears feasible for charging 5 amp-hour nickel-zinc cells with no significant loss in average cycle life when compared to <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> <b>charging.</b> The 1 -kHz SW charger could also be used with no significant loss in average cycle life, and suggests the possibility of utilizing the existing electric vehicle chopper controller circuitry for an on-board charger. There was an apparent difference using the 120 Hz SCR charger compared to the others, however, this difference could be due to an inadvertent severe overcharge, which occurred prior to cell failure.

40|$|Supercapacitors are {{now being}} looked at for use in higher power {{applications}} such as mobile telecommunications and hybrid electric vehicles. We have examined two different supercapacitors, one is a commercial sample {{and the other is}} a supercapacitor of our own design.

Parameter values obtained from Impedance Spectroscopy are excellent for comparing supercapacitors under equilibrium conditions but correlate poorly with data obtained from the more useful Power Cycling Charts (PCC). The choice of the current step size in <b>Constant</b> <b>Current</b> <b>Charging</b> and the scan rate in Cyclic Voltammetry has a large bearing on the results obtained from these techniques. The strong voltage dependence of the parameters for the commercial sample prevented analysis using Cyclic Voltammetry.
