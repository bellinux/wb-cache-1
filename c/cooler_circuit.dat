To reduce the time of cooling and control the uniformity of temperature and volumetric shrink-age, industry expects to have cooling channels that are con-formal {{to the shape of}} products. We achieve the goal of automatically designing such conformal <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit</b> in twofold. First, the relationship between the conformal cool-ing and the geometry shape of <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit</b> is formulated. Based on that, we investigate a geometric modeling algo-rithm to design the <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit</b> approaching the conformal cooling.

40|$|The ITER {{diagnostic}} Upper Port Plug (UPP) is a water-cooled {{stainless steel}} structure aimed to integrate within vacuum vessel the plasma diagnostic systems, shielding them from neutron and photon irradiation. Due {{to the very}} intense heat loads expected, a proper <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit</b> {{has been designed to}} ensure an adequate UPP cooling with an acceptable thermal rise and an unduly high pumping power and to perform its draining and drying procedure by injection of pressurized nitrogen. A theoretical research activity has been launched at the Department of Nuclear Engineering of the University of Palermo aiming to investigate the hydraulic behaviour of the UPP Trapezoid Section <b>cooling</b> <b>circuit</b> under steady state conditions and during its draining and drying transient procedure. The research activity has been performed following a theoretical-computational approach and adopting the RELAP 5 thermal-hydraulic system code.

40|$|Members of the Legionella genus find {{suitable}} {{conditions for}} their {{growth and survival}} in nuclear power plant <b>cooling</b> <b>circuits.</b> To limit the proliferation of Legionella pathogenic bacteria in nuclear power plant <b>cooling</b> <b>circuits,</b> and ensure that levels remain below regulatory thresholds, monochloramine treatment can be used. Although the treatment is highly effective, i. e. it reduces Legionella numbers by over 99 %, Legionella bacteria can still be detected at low concentrations and rapid re-colonisation of circuits can occur after the treatment has ceased. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an in vitro methodology for determining the intrinsic susceptibility of L. pneumophila strains, collected from various nuclear power plant <b>cooling</b> <b>circuits</b> subjected to different treatment conditions. The methodology was developed by using an original approach based on response surface methodology (RSM) combined with a multifactorial experimental design. The susceptibility was evaluated by the Ct factor. The susceptibility of environmental strains varies widely and is, for some strains, greater than that of known tolerant species; however, strain susceptibility was not related to treatment conditions. Selection pressure induced by monochloramine use did not result in the selection of more tolerant Legionella strains and did not explain the detection of Legionella during treatment or the rapid re-colonisation of <b>cooling</b> <b>circuits</b> after disinfection has ceased.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of monochloramine on L.  pneumophila subpopulations in the <b>cooling</b> <b>circuits</b> of a nuclear power plant.

This study confirmed the effectiveness of monochloramine to limit L.  pneumophila concentrations in <b>cooling</b> <b>circuits.</b> The culturable L.  pneumophila community was strongly affected by the injection of monochloramine. Several subpopulations persisted during treatment at low concentrations (below the detection limit of standard methods), suggesting that the susceptibility of L.  pneumophila is strain dependent. Although the composition of the subpopulations was not similar, the resilience of the community structure was observed. Indeed, the community eventually returned to its initial structure and presented a similar pattern of richness, diversity and uniformity to that seen before treatment...|$|R
