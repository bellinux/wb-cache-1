500|$|The Dutch {{penchant for}} {{tactical}} debate surprised Robson. In {{an interview with}} Voetbal International, he lamented, [...] "An English pro accepts the manager's decision. After every match here, the substitutes <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>visit</b> me." [...] Another of his challenges at PSV was handling the Brazilian international Romário. Robson became frustrated with the Brazilian's work ethic, although admitted [...] "in some matches he would be scintillating". Robson arranged showdown talks with Romário, with Frank Arnesen, Robson's assistant, acting as a translator. The talks proved unsuccessful, with Romário unwilling to change his lifestyle. Despite this, PSV won the Eredivisie in both the 1990–91 and 1991–92 seasons. However, the team {{did not make the}} progress expected by the board in European competitions and Robson was informed he would be leaving the club {{at the end of the}} 1991–92 season.|$|E
