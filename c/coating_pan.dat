40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a pH {{responsive}} enteric coated extended release pellets containing a model drug flurbiprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used for rheumatoid arthritis. The drug loaded pellets were prepared by using extrusion/ spheronization method. Core pellets were coated with polymer Eudragit RS 30 D in a <b>coating</b> <b>pan</b> to achieve a sustainable release for 12 hours. A ph responsive barrier coat of Eudragit L 100 - 55 was employed in a <b>coating</b> <b>pan</b> for abstaining release in acidic media. The drug excipient mixtures were subjected to pre-formulation studies. The pellets were subjected to physicochemical studies, in-vitro drug release, Kinetic studies and stability studies. FTIR studies shown there was no interaction between drug and polymers. The physicochemical properties of pellets were found within the limits. The drug release from the optimized formulations was extended for a period of 12 hrs i. e. first 2 hrs no drug release was observed and gradually drug release was increased up to 12 hrs. From the above results, achievement of site specific release to lower part of gastrointestinal tract might be due to Eudragit L 100 - 55 stability in acidic pH. The prepared pellets apart from fulfilling all official and other specifications, exhibited good extended release of Flurbiprofen. The optimized formulations were subjected to stability studies and shown there were no significant changes in drug content, physicochemical parameters and release pattern.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this study a {{mathematical}} model for an aqueous film coating process in a production size <b>coating</b> <b>pan</b> was developed which would allow the effects of process variables and their interactions with the coating process to be identified and subsequently predicted with mathematical certainty. Because excess water accumulation in the tablet bed can be undesirable and effective water removal is critical to an efficient process, the dependent varaible selected in the study was water removal efficiency. The independent variables considered in the study were coating solution spray rate, inlet air temperature, exhaust airflow, pan rotational speed and total tablet surface area. ^ In order to establish the appropriate operating conditions for the <b>coating</b> <b>pan</b> it was necessary to evaluate the mixing action of the baffled pan and the various spray gun configurations available for use in the unit. This included the study of spray patterns and determination of the optimal spray rates for uniform tablet coverage. Tablet surface area was also determined to be a critical parameter which had a significant effect on the drying air flowing through the tablet bed. The results from the studies indicate that the model developed could predict water removal efficiency with a satisfactory degree of assurance. Graphical analysis indicated interactions between pan speed and air temperature, and pan speed and airflow. ^ In the second part of this research, a standard production sugar coating suspension which had been applied manually was modified to allow for spray application in an automated tablet sugar coating process. Ingredients which may have contributed to microbiological growth were eliminated. A mathematical model was developed which predicted the viscosity of the subcoat suspensions containing different concentrations of selected coating ingredients. A subcoat suspension formula was selected and the effect of the addition of various synthetic polymers on the strength and disintegration rate of coated tablets was evaluated. The results indicated that the new subcoat suspension containing synthetic polymers provided a sugar coat that was as physically strong as the standard production formula but disintegrated more rapidly from the tablet. ...|$|E

Hot-melt coating avoids the use of solvents and is a safer and time-saving process. The present study was designed to assess the efficacy of hot-melt coating (HMC) as an enteric coating technique. Pellets prepared by extrusion spheronization were selected as the core formulation for a model of the gastric irritant drug diclofenac sodium (DFS) because of their innate advantages over single-unit formulations. Stearic acid (SA) and palmitic acid (PA) were evaluated as enteric hot-melt coating materials.

SEM of coated pellets showed a uniform and smooth coating. These results indicated that HMC of both SA and PA exhibited very good enteric coating ability. The coated pellets showed negligible drug release in acidic pH.

Inert cores were intermittently treated with micronized drug powder and binding solution. This treatment {{led to the formation of}} multiple layers of drug particles around an inert core resulting in the production of pellets that can further be coated by different polymers to obtain modified release formulations. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to image the surface morphology of the prepared pellets.

40|$|We present in-line coating {{thickness}} measurements acquired simultaneously using two independent sensing modalities: terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI) and {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT). Both techniques are sufficiently fast to resolve the {{coating thickness}} of individual pharmaceutical tablets in-situ during the film coating operation and both techniques are direct structural imaging techniques {{that do not require}} multivariate calibration. The TPI sensor is suitable to measure coatings greater than 50 μm and can penetrate through thick coatings even in the presence of pigments over a wide range of excipients. Due to the long wavelength, terahertz radiation is not affected by scattering from dust within the coater. In contrast, OCT can resolve coating layers as thin as 20 μm and is capable of measuring the intra-tablet coating uniformity as well as the inter-tablet coating thickness distribution within the <b>coating</b> <b>pan.</b> ¬-However, the OCT technique is less robust {{when it comes to the}} compatibility with excipients, dust and potentially the maximum coating thickness that can be resolved. Using a custom built laboratory scale coating unit, the coating thickness measurements were acquired independently by the TPI and OCT sensors throughout a film coating operation. Results of the in-line TPI and OCT measurements were compared against one another and validated with off-line TPI and weight gain measurements. Compared to other process analytical technology (PAT) sensors, such as near-infrared and Raman spectroscopy, the TPI/OCT sensors can resolve the inter-tablet thickness distribution based on sampling a significant fraction of the tablet populations in the process. By combining two complementary sensing modalities it was possible to seamlessly monitor the coating process over the range of film thickness from 20 μm to greater than 250 μm.

This investigation was undertaken to develop, characterize and evaluate a new pulsed-release dosage form for a low dose water soluble drug with consistent drug release that combines polymer matrix and aqueous coating technology. ^ The effect of scale-up on granulation, compression and coating of pulse-release tablet formulation containing low dose active drug made with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as base excipients were investigated for two different formulation. The controlled release matrix tablets produced were seal coated using aqueous polymer latex dispersion to retard the drug release from the tablet cores for a period of 3 – 4 hours. Immediate release coat was developed to apply the initial dose of the drug onto the seal coated tablets. ^ A factorial design was used to study the critical processing parameters that were known to influence coating process. The results of analysis of variance were used to predict the effect of various processing parameters on the response. Pair-wise comparisons of the dissolution results for two different scales and formulations using F 2 metrics established by FDA SUPAC guidelines were used to evaluate similarity between drug release characteristics. ^ Results indicate that adjustment of the blending time and headspace to blender capacity based {{on the size of the}} blenders used at various stages of scale-up is necessary to maintain constant blending geometry and equivalent mixing to produce uniform distribution of the active drug. Results also show that coating suspension spray rate and <b>coating</b> <b>pan</b> rotation speed significantly affect the coating uniformity.

The molar ratios of monomer to DBSA used for the nanotube and the nanofiber synthesis are 1 : 1 and 4 : 1, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results confirm the narrow diameter range of 180 - 230 nm for the PAn nanotubes and nanofibers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirms that the resistance of the <b>coating</b> containing <b>PAn</b> nanotubes is three times higher than the <b>coating</b> containing <b>PAn</b> nanofibers after 30 days of immersion. This effect can be explained because of the higher surface area of the nanotubes compared to nanofibers with the same mass.
