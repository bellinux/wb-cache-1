40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{three main}} objectives: (1) the {{contribution to the}} body of literature of consumer behaviour demonstrating that consumer groups’ knowledge (i. e., two-person dyads, families, peer or friendship groups, teams, and other social units) is relevant for study by consumer researchers; (2) the development of an integrated conceptual representation of <b>consumer’s</b> <b>group</b> knowledge including the influence of collective variables on decision making process; (3) the investigation of scientific inquiries regarding the role of advanced technologies in relation to conceptual representation. The approach introduces a new framework applicable both as a tool for enhancing the understanding of <b>consumer’s</b> <b>group</b> knowledge, and as a useful guide to future research on consumer knowledge as a whole. The content discussed herein attempts to establish the building block toward the development of a theory of <b>consumer’s</b> <b>group</b> knowledge. The study offers direction toward a potential path that could evolve into an established theory regarding <b>consumer’s</b> <b>group</b> knowledge in the marketplace.
