5|$|Most {{researchers}} have {{disagreed with the}} identification of the structures as <b>collagen</b> or other structural fibres. Notably, the team of scientists that reported the presence of pigmentation cells in the structures argued that their presence proved the structures were feathers, not <b>collagen,</b> because <b>collagen</b> does not contain pigment. Gregory S. Paul reidentified what the <b>collagen</b> hypothesis's proponents consider a body outline outside of the fibres as an artefact of preparation: breakage and brushed-on sealant have been misidentified as the outline of the body.|$|E

40|$|<b>Collagens</b> are the {{proteins}} {{found in the}} extracellular matrix of multicellular organisms, from primitive sponges (parazoans) to highly advanced mammals (metazoans). These proteins, classified as the “collagen superfamily,” comprise about 28 members each {{with at least one}} triple-helical domain. <b>Collagens</b> deposited in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and connective tissues form supramolecular assemblies and function as structural proteins contributing to mechanical properties, organization, and shape of tissues. They regulate cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation by binding to cognate receptors on the cell surface and triggering signal transduction cascades. <b>Collagens</b> with restricted tissue distribution perform specific biological functions. This chapter envisages the structural and functional characteristics of both invertebrate and vertebrate <b>collagens</b> with a special account of sponge <b>collagens</b> and their significance in tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{sequence}} {{comparison of}} the C-termini of <b>collagens</b> X, VIII, the collagen-like complement factor C 1 q, and the fibrillar <b>collagens</b> showed a conserved cluster of aromatic residues. This conserved cluster was in a domain of approximately 130 amino acids that exhibited marked similarities in hydrophilicity profiles between the different <b>collagens,</b> despite {{a low level of}} sequence similarity. These data suggest that the ‘collagen X-like family’ and the fibrillar <b>collagens</b> contain a domain within their C-termini that adopts a common tertiary structure, and that a conserved cluster of aromatic residues in this domain may be involved in C-terminal trimerization...|$|R

5|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta, {{known as}} brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone {{disorder}} {{which can be}} lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in Type-I <b>collagen,</b> which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen's triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new quantum mechanical method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of <b>collagen.</b> Although researchers have used Folding@home to study <b>collagen</b> folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.|$|E

25|$|Ascorbic acid {{is needed}} {{for a variety of}} biosynthetic pathways, by {{accelerating}} hydroxylation and amidation reactions. In the synthesis of <b>collagen,</b> ascorbic acid is required as a cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. These two enzymes are responsible for the hydroxylation of the proline and lysine amino acids in <b>collagen.</b> Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are important for stabilizing <b>collagen</b> by cross-linking the propeptides in <b>collagen.</b> Defective <b>collagen</b> fibrillogenesis impairs wound healing. <b>Collagen</b> {{is an important part of}} bone, so bone formation is affected. Defective connective tissue leads to fragile capillaries, resulting in abnormal bleeding. Untreated scurvy is invariably fatal.|$|E
25|$|To mend the damage, {{fibroblasts}} slowly {{form the}} <b>collagen</b> scar. The fibroblast proliferation is circular and cyclically, the fibroblast proliferation lays down thick, whitish <b>collagen</b> inside the provisional and <b>collagen</b> matrix, {{resulting in the}} abundant production of packed <b>collagen</b> on the fibers giving scars their uneven texture. Over time, the fibroblasts continue to crawl around the matrix, adjusting more fibers and, in the process, the scarring settles and becomes stiff. This fibroblast proliferation also contracts the tissue. In unwounded tissue, these fibers are not overexpressed with thick <b>collagen</b> and do not contract.|$|E
25|$|<b>Collagen</b> is {{the major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in nerve regeneration and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, <b>collagen</b> gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. <b>Collagen</b> resorption rates are able {{to be controlled by}} crosslinking <b>collagen</b> with polypoxy compounds. Additionally, <b>collagen</b> type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, <b>collagen</b> conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful nerve regeneration compared to nerve autografts. This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and Schwann cell seeding density will need to be examined in future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these <b>collagen</b> I/III gels.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the susceptibility of both the helical and non-helical regions of isolated rat chondrosarcoma <b>collagens,</b> types II, IX and XI, to degradation by the cysteine proteinases, cathepsins B and L. Both enzymes degrade these <b>collagens</b> at temperatures from 20 to 37 °C and pH values from 3. 5 to 7. 0. Cleavage occurs only within the non-helical domains unless the helix is destabilized. Cathepsin L {{is more effective than}} cathepsin B on a molar basis and they appear to cleave at different sites. Since these cathepsins can degrade cartilage <b>collagens</b> at pH values near neutrality, they may contribute to the destruction of cartilage observed in arthritis...|$|R

25|$|Any injury {{does not}} become a scar until the wound has {{completely}} healed; this can take many months, or years in the worst pathological cases, such as keloids. To begin to patch the damage, a clot is created; the clot is the beginning process that results in a provisional matrix. In the process, the first layer is a provisional matrix and is not scar. Over time, the wounded body tissue then overexpresses <b>collagen</b> inside the provisional matrix to create a <b>collagen</b> matrix. This <b>collagen</b> overexpression continues and crosslinks the fiber arrangement inside the <b>collagen</b> matrix, making the <b>collagen</b> dense. This densely packed <b>collagen,</b> morphing into an inelastic whitish <b>collagen</b> scar wall, blocks off cell communication and regeneration; as a result, the new tissue generated will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding unwounded tissue. This prolonged collagen-producing process results in a fortuna scar.|$|E
25|$|When the {{endothelium}} is damaged, {{the normally}} isolated, underlying <b>collagen</b> {{is exposed to}} circulating platelets, which bind directly to <b>collagen</b> with collagen-specific glycoprotein Ia/IIa surface receptors. This adhesion is strengthened further by von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is released from the endothelium and from platelets; vWF forms additional links between the platelets' glycoprotein Ib/IX/V and the <b>collagen</b> fibrils. This localization of platelets to the extracellular matrix promotes <b>collagen</b> interaction with platelet glycoprotein VI. Binding of <b>collagen</b> to glycoprotein VI triggers a signaling cascade that results in activation of platelet integrins. Activated integrins mediate tight binding of platelets to the extracellular matrix. This process adheres platelets {{to the site of}} injury.|$|E
25|$|People with OI {{are born}} with {{defective}} connective tissue, or without {{the ability to make}} it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I <b>collagen.</b> This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the <b>collagen</b> triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains create steric hindrance that creates a bulge in the <b>collagen</b> complex, which in turn influences both the molecular nanomechanics and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. As a result, the body may respond by hydrolyzing the improper <b>collagen</b> structure. If the body does not destroy the improper <b>collagen,</b> the relationship between the <b>collagen</b> fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing brittleness. Another suggested disease mechanism is that the stress state within <b>collagen</b> fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger shear forces lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads as the homogeneous stress state found in healthy <b>collagen</b> fibrils is lost. These recent works suggest that OI must be understood as a multi-scale phenomenon, which involves mechanisms at the genetic, nano-, micro- and macro-level of tissues.|$|E

A human fibroblast cell line (CRL- 2703) was used. The synthesis of type I and type III <b>collagens</b> were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by RT-PCR and confocal microscopy, respectively. Cell proliferation was evaluated by two methods: (1) MTT assay (2) cell cycle analysis. It was found that PDGF-AB stimulate the proliferation of fibroblast cultured on gelatin coated silicon sheet in dose dependant manner with a maximum effect at 10 ng ml) 1. The exogenous TGF-b 1 induced the expression of type I and type III <b>collagens</b> in a dose and substrate-dependant manner.

25|$|Dry bone {{exhibits}} some piezoelectric properties.

25|$|All {{scarring}} {{is composed}} of the same <b>collagen</b> as the tissue it has replaced, but {{the composition of the}} scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different.

Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and keloid scarring, both of which experience excessive stiff <b>collagen</b> bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of <b>collagen</b> blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the <b>collagen</b> bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.|$|E
