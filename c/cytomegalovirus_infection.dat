25|$|One of {{the main}} global risks posed by {{breastmilk}} specifically is the transmission of HIV and other infectious diseases. Breastfeeding by an HIV-infected mother poses a 5–20% chance of transmitting HIV to the baby. However, if a mother has HIV, she {{is more likely to}} transmit it to her child during the pregnancy or birth than during breastfeeding. A 2012 study conducted by researchers from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine showed reduced HIV-1 transmission in humanized mice, due to components in the breast milk. <b>Cytomegalovirus</b> <b>infection</b> poses potentially dangerous consequences for pre-term babies. Other risks include mother's infection with HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 (viruses that could cause T-cell leukemia in the baby), herpes simplex when lesions are present on the breasts, and chickenpox in the newborn when the disease manifested in the mother within a few days of birth. In some cases these risks can be mitigated by using heat-treated milk and nursing for a briefer time (e.g. 6 months, rather than 18–24 months), and can be avoided by using an uninfected woman's milk, as via a wet-nurse or milk bank, or by using infant formula and/or treated milk.|$|E

40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, an {{opportunistic}} complication {{in patients}} with AIDS, causes substantial morbidity and has high treatment costs. Although prevention of this disease is highly desirable, incremental cost-effectiveness estimates for proposed prophylactic strategies in the era prior to the availability of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) were unfavourable relative to other specific antimicrobial prophylactic strategies {{in patients with}} AIDS. With the availability of HAART, several inputs upon which previous estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for anti-CMV prophylaxis were based probably changed substantially. To assess the incremental cost effectiveness of prophylaxis in the HAART era, data are needed on visual outcomes and utility for patients with CMV retinitis and AIDS, on better strategies for identifying subpopulations at high risk for CMV disease and on the prophylactic efficacy of valganciclovir. Cost-effectiveness analysis could potentially contribute by exploring thresholds of population risk, prophylactic effectiveness, and drug pricing in order to identify conditions under which prophylaxis for CMV disease in patients with AIDS could potentially become cost effective.

Reports of generalized <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>infections</b> of infants with morphologic signs of infection in several organs, including the pancreas, are not infrequent.
