5|$|As a child, Usama was {{the second}} of four boys and raised by his nurse, Lu'lu'a, who had also raised his father and would later raise Usama's own children. He was {{encouraged}} by his father to memorize the Qur'an, and was also tutored by scholars such as Ibn Munira of Kafartab and Abu Abdullah al-Tulaytuli of Toledo. He {{spent much of his}} youth hunting with his family, partly as recreation and <b>certainly</b> <b>as</b> warrior (faris) training for battle as part of furusiyya. He also had much direct experience of battle, against the neighbouring crusader County of Tripoli and Principality of Antioch, hostile Muslim neighbours in Hama, Homs, and elsewhere, and Hashshashin who had established a base near Shaizar.|$|E
5|$|Lochlann, {{originally}} Laithlinn or Lothlend, {{the land}} where Amlaíb's father was king, is often identified with Norway, {{but it is not}} universally accepted that it had such a meaning in early times.

Whatever the original sense, by the twelfth century, when Magnus Barefoot undertook his expedition to the West, it had come to mean Norway.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's {{early life}} was heavily {{influenced}} by {{his relationship with his}} uncle Henry I. Henry seized power in England following the death of his elder brother William Rufus. In 1106 he invaded and captured the Duchy of Normandy, controlled by his eldest brother, Robert Curthose, defeating Robert's army at the battle of Tinchebray. Henry then found himself in conflict with Louis VI of France, who took the opportunity to declare Robert's son William Clito the Duke of Normandy. Henry responded by forming a network of alliances with the western counties of France against Louis, resulting in a regional conflict that would last throughout Stephen's early life. Adela and Theobald allied themselves with Henry, and Stephen's mother decided to place him in Henry's court. Henry fought his next military campaign in Normandy, from 1111 onwards, where rebels led by Robert of Bellême were opposing his rule. Stephen was probably with Henry during the military campaign of 1112, when he was knighted by the King, and was definitely present at court during the King's visit to the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in 1113. Stephen probably first visited England in either 1113 or 1115, almost <b>certainly</b> <b>as</b> part of Henry's court.|$|E

25|$|The celebrated John Duns Scotus (d. 1308), a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure, argued, on the contrary, {{that from}} a {{rational}} point of view it was <b>certainly</b> <b>as</b> little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin, {{as to say that}} she first contracted it and then was delivered. Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, he argued that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ; rather it {{was the result of a}} more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history.|$|E

25|$|The {{troops of}} the Indian 26th Division began occupying the city without {{opposition}} on 2 May. The British were joyfully welcomed, perhaps not universally as liberators, but <b>certainly</b> <b>as</b> they could restore order and bring in food and other assistance. When the Japanese and Ba Maw's officials left Rangoon, widespread looting and lawlessness had broken out and continued for several days. The retreating Japanese had burned down the jail housing Burmese prisoners. They had also destroyed St. Philomena's Convent, which had {{been used as a}} hospital, killing 400 of their own men. After three years of war and deprivation, the city was deep in filth, many of the population had fled to escape the Kempeitai (Japanese military police) and those remaining were in rags. Dacoits (armed bandits) plagued the outskirts and various infectious diseases were rife.|$|E
25|$|A {{voyage to}} explore {{the east coast of}} New Holland, with a view to a British {{colonization}} of the country, had been recommended in John Campbell’s editions of John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels (1744–1748, and 1764), a book which Cook had with him on the Endeavour: The first Point, with respect to a Discovery, would be, to send a small Squadron on the Coast of Van Diemen's Land, and from thence round, in the same course taken by Captain Tasman, by the Coast of New Guiney; which might enable the Nations that attempted it, to come to an absolute Certainty with regard to its Commodities and Commerce... By this means all the back Coast of New Holland, and New Guiney, might be roughly examined; and we might know as well, and as <b>certainly,</b> <b>as</b> the Dutch, how far a Colony settled there might answer our Expectations.|$|E
25|$|None of the group-13 {{elements}} {{has a major}} biological role {{in complex}} animals, but some are at least associated with a living being. As in other groups, the lighter elements usually have more biological roles than the heavier. The heaviest ones are toxic, as are the other elements in the same periods. Boron is essential in most plants, whose cells use it for such purposes as strengthening cell walls. It is found in humans, <b>certainly</b> <b>as</b> a trace element, but there is ongoing debate over its significance in human nutrition. Boron's chemistry does allow it to form complexes with such important molecules as carbohydrates, so it is plausible {{that it could be}} of greater use in the human body than previously thought. Boron has also been shown to be able to replace iron in some of its functions, particularly in the healing of wounds. Aluminium has no known biological role in plants or animals. Gallium is not essential for the human body, but its relation to iron(III) allows it to become bound to proteins that transport and store iron. Gallium can also stimulate metabolism. Indium and its heavier homologues have no biological role, although indium salts in small doses, like gallium, can stimulate metabolism.|$|E

500|$|Although Diodorus {{says that}} Philip {{defeated}} the new tyrants, Buckler considers {{it more likely}} that Philip's appearance on the scene allowed the Aleuadae to negotiate a peace settlement with Pherae from a position of greater strength. Philip seems to have come away from the expedition with new wives from both Larissa (Philinna) and Pherae (Nicesipolis, Jason's niece), which is suggestive of a negotiated settlement; <b>certainly,</b> <b>as</b> Buckler says, [...] "Philip came away from Thessaly with a foot in both camps".|$|E
500|$|It is also {{possible}} that the mound is actually a cenotaph rather than a grave, the only sign of body was a chemical stain which could have had other origins, indeed the site includes burials of both meat and companion animals. [...] Further {{there is a lack of}} shroud ties, and no clear evidence of items which might have adorned a body being left in the expected places in relation to the stain. [...] The cenotaph theory may be consistent with the transition from pagan burial to Christian burial, <b>certainly</b> <b>as</b> far as Rædwald is concerned, he could have received a Christian burial, and the mound, whether completed before or after his conversion being used as a memorial and as symbol of the status of the Kingship of East Anglia.|$|E
500|$|Ímar and Amlaíb {{were joined}} in Ireland by another brother, Auisle, {{sometime}} before 863. From this date onwards the three brothers {{are described as}} [...] "kings of the foreigners" [...] by the annals, but in modern texts they are usually labelled as kings of Dublin, after the Viking settlement which was the base of their power. Lochlann, originally Laithlinn or Lothlend, the land where Ímar's father was king, is often identified with Norway, {{but it is not}} universally accepted that it had such a meaning in early times. Several historians have proposed instead that in early times, and <b>certainly</b> <b>as</b> late as the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, Lochlann refers to the Norse and Norse-Gael lands in the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, the Northern Isles and parts of mainland Scotland.

500|$|The {{attorneys}} then {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court which denied the initial petition, but later reconsidered and accepted the appeal. The Supreme Court limited their review to the question, [...] "was the charge of contempt, as and when certified, one which the accusing judge was authorized under Rule 42(a) to determine and punish himself; or was it one to be adjudged and punished under Rule 42(b) only by a judge other than the accusing one and after notice, hearing, and opportunity to defend?". The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice Robert Jackson, upheld the contempt sentences by a 5–3 vote. Jackson's opinion stated that [...] "summary punishment always, and rightly, is regarded with disfavor, and, if imposed in passion or pettiness, brings discredit to a court as <b>certainly</b> <b>as</b> the conduct it penalizes. But the very practical reasons which have led every system of law to vest a contempt power in one who presides over judicial proceedings also are the reasons which account for it being made summary." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{a writing}} session at McCartney's house in north London, Lennon and McCartney {{fine-tuned}} the lyrics, using {{an approach that}} author Howard Sounes likens to the cut-up technique popularised by William Burroughs. [...] "I didn't copy the accident," [...] Lennon said. [...] "Tara didn't blow his mind out, {{but it was in}} my mind when I was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the song—not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene—were similarly part of the fiction." [...] McCartney expounded on the subject: [...] "The verse about the politician blowing his mind out in a car we wrote together. It has been attributed to Tara Browne, the Guinness heir, which I don't believe is the case, <b>certainly</b> <b>as</b> we were writing it, I was not attributing it to Tara in my head. In John's head it might have been. In my head I was imagining a politician bombed out on drugs who'd stopped at some traffic lights and didn't notice that the lights had changed. The 'blew his mind' was purely a drugs reference, nothing to do with a car crash." ...|$|E
500|$|Aetosaurs {{were very}} heavily armored (most <b>certainly</b> <b>as</b> {{a defense against}} predators), with large , {{interlocking}} bony plates, or osteoderms, protecting the back and sides, belly, and tail. [...] Most osteoderms are heavily pitted on their upper surfaces and smooth on their undersides. Their centers are made of cancellous or spongy bone (also called diploë) and their outer portions {{are made up of}} compact bone. In life, these plates were probably covered in horn. Dorsal osteoderms, which are found on the backs of aetosaurs, are often ornamented with radial grooves. Dorsal paramedians, those found along the midline of the animal, are often wide and quadrangular with a small boss called a dorsal eminence on the dorsal surface of each plate. In aetosaurs, paramedian plates often have raised or depressed anterior edges where the plates articulate with the ones in front of them. If the anterior edge is raised, the area is called an anterior bar, while if it is depressed, the area is called an anterior lamina. In lateral plates, which are positioned {{on either side of the}} paramedian plates, the dorsal eminence is often enlarged into a prominent spike. This spike is especially noticeable in desmatosuchines such as Longosuchus and Desmatosuchus. Osteoderms are useful in diagnosing aetosaur taxa, and aetosaur species can often be identified from individual scutes based on their ornamentation pattern.|$|E
