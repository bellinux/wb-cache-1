If a {{developable surface}} lies in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and is complete, then it is necessarily ruled, but the converse is not always true. For instance, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> are developable, but the general hyperboloid of one sheet is not. More generally, any developable surface in three dimensions {{is part of a}} complete ruled surface, and so itself must be locally ruled.

[...] "The delineation of the form is laid down in the digital genes of the design that hold the germ of life.

50|$|When {{attempting}} {{to draw a}} complicated shape such as a human figure, it is helpful at first to represent the form {{with a set of}} primitive volumes. Almost any form can be represented by some combination of the cube, sphere, <b>cylinder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cone.</b> Once these basic volumes have been assembled into a likeness, then the drawing can be refined into a more accurate and polished form. The lines of the primitive volumes are removed and replaced by the final likeness. Drawing the underlying construction is a fundamental skill for representational art, and is taught in many books and schools. Its correct application resolves most uncertainties about smaller details, and makes the final image look consistent. A more refined art of figure drawing relies upon the artist possessing a deep understanding of anatomy and the human proportions. A trained artist is familiar with the skeleton structure, joint location, muscle placement, tendon movement, and how the different parts work together during movement. This allows the artist to render more natural poses that do not appear artificially stiff. The artist is also familiar with how the proportions vary depending on the age of the subject, particularly when drawing a portrait.|$|E

Cone, cylinder and sphere are chosen among standard configurations. Unlike two last figures, calculation of irradiance coefficient for conic object {{is the most difficult}} and contains a number of uncertainties. The method of calculation for integrated and effective irradiance coefficients of space object with a conic form is stated which is typical for fragments of spacecrafts. Integrated irradiance coefficients define the average thermal balance on a lateral surface of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>and</b> <b>cone,</b> and also full power balance on a sphere surface. Effective irradiance coefficients define a full falling specific stream of the Earth’s radiation on the whole surface of cylindrical or conic object taking into account their bases. By data about effective irradiance coefficients, the average stationary temperatures of space objects in the Earth shadow are defined, {{as well as on the}} trajectory part illuminated by the Sun taking into account two additional components of power balance – direct sunlight and reflected by the Earth.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} the recent progress with a validation exercise {{to examine the}} effectiveness of DSMC and Navier-Stokes in predicting complex flows involving shock/shock and shock/boundary layer interactions under laminar hypersonic conditions. The exercise is based on experiments conducted in the Aerothermal and Aero-Optics Evaluation Center shock tunnels using nitrogen. Under moderately rarefied conditions Navier-Stokes methods have performed very well in capturing the details of flow structure especially when non-equilibrium and slip effects are accounted for, whereas DSMC {{has not been as}} successful. In particular, the size of the separation regions is underestimated.

While the problem of model fitting has been successfully addressed, the problem of efficient high accuracy and stability of the fitting is still an open problem.

40|$|A ring is {{generally}} provided {{at the intersection}} between the <b>cylinder</b> <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> of an elevated storage silo or tank to resist a large circumferential compressive force at the intersection (the transition junction).

A common cross-sectional form of this ringbeam is a T-section. This paper presents an investigation into the elastic out-of-plane distortional buckling behaviour and strength of T-section ringbeams clamped at their inner edge. A clamped inner edge represents a limiting case of the inner edge support condition. The buckling strength of clamped T-section ringbeams provides a close approximation for cases in which the rotational restraint from the shell walls is heavy and a basis for formulating a buckling approximation for T-section ringbeams with a semirigid rotational restraint at the inner edge.

Particularly is this so with regard to the conic projections with two standard parallels: they may be regarded as developed on cones, but they are cones which bear no simple relationship to the sphere.

For whey concentrations of 30 wt % and above, the viscosity decrease asymptotically with an increasing shear rate. The power law Index is approximately constant over the range 30 - 40 wt % whey. The viscosity of 30 - 35 wt % solutions is independent of time of shearing, but is dependent on time for solutions of 40 wt % and greater.

Using the results of the calculi, the author discusses possible implications of severe urinary sequestration in the pyeloureteral systems. Using geometrical and topological approximations we calculate the volumes of ureters and renal pelvises, applying in vivo measurements obtained from conventional ultrasound, retrograde cystourethrograms and topographic anatomic references. Approximations use 2 decimals and assumed π value was 3. 14. Ureteral and pyelic volumes are calculated, respectively, from the mathematical formula for the <b>cylinder</b> <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> volumes. Dolicomegaureter are compensated using proportional calculi. Bladder volumes are estimated from conventional formulae. Proximal urinary sequestration is compared between infants and older children with VUR. Mechanisms of direct induction of bladder urodynamic failure from VUR are suggested. Sequestration of urine in the ureter and renal pelvis can be estimated from mathematical formulae in patients with VUR. The values used derive from ultrasound examinations, CUM and topographical anatomical references. Primary VUR can determine urodynamic problems.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the Double Conformal / Darboux Cyclide Geometric Algebra (DCGA), {{based in the}} G 8; 2 Cliord geometric algebra. DCGA {{is an extension of}} CGA and has entities representing points and general Darboux cyclide surfaces in Euclidean 3 D space. The general Darboux cyclide is a quartic surface. Darboux cyclides include circular tori and all quadrics, and also all surfaces formed by their inversions in spheres. Dupin cyclide surfaces can be formed as inversions in spheres of circular toroid, <b>cylinder,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> surfaces. Parabolic cyclides are cubic surfaces formed by inversion spheres centered on other surfaces. All DCGA entities can be conformally transformed in 3 D space by rotors, dilators, translators, and motors, which are all types of versors. All entities can be inversed in general spheres and reected in general planes. Entities representing the intersections of surfaces can be created by wedge products. All entities can be intersected with spheres, planes, lines, and circles. DCGA provides a higher-level algebra for working with 3 D geometry in an object/entity-oriented system of mathematics above the level of the underlying implicit surface equations of algebraic geometry.

40|$|Understanding cardiac {{function}} in developing larval fishes {{is crucial for}} assessing their physiological condition and overall health. Cardiac output measurements in transparent fish larvae and other vertebrates have long been made by analyzing videos of the beating heart, and modeling this structure using a conventional simple prolate spheroid shape model. However, the larval fish heart changes shape during early development and subsequent maturation, but no consideration {{has been made of}} the effect of different heart geometries on cardiac output estimation. The present study assessed the validity of three different heart models (the “standard” prolate spheroid model as well as a <b>cylinder</b> <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> tip + cylinder model) applied to digital images of complete cardiac cycles in larval mahi-mahi and red drum. The inherent error of each model was determined to allow for more precise calculation of stroke volume and cardiac output. The conventional prolate spheroid and cone tip + cylinder models yielded significantly different stroke volume values at 56 hpf in red drum and from 56 to 104 hpf in mahi. End-diastolic and stroke volumes modeled by just a simple cylinder shape were 30 – 50 % higher compared to the conventional prolate spheroid. However, when these values of stroke volume multiplied by heart rate to calculate cardiac output, no significant differences between models emerged because of considerable variability in heart rate. Essentially, the conventional prolate spheroid shape model provides the simplest measurement with lowest variability of stroke volume and cardiac output. However, assessment of heart function—especially if stroke volume is the focus of the study—should consider larval heart shape, with different models being applied on a species-by-species and developmental stage-by-stage basis for best estimation of cardiac output...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Information in {{an image}} can be {{represented}} in separate spatial-frequency bands, or spatial scales. If non-redundant information is available in different spatial scales, access to multiple scales should provide better recognition performance than access to a single scale. An image can also be divided into different spatial regions. If there is a capacity constraint {{on the amount of}} visual information that can be processed at one time, there will be a trade off in the resolution of the spatial scale {{and the size of the}} region analyzed. Such a capacity constraint can be simulated by using a restricted "window" which varies in size according to the spatial scale. We asked how effectively people would use multi-scale information when they can control the spatial scale and spatial location of such a window in an object recognition task. Method. Three normally sighted subjects recognized grayscale images on a computer screen. The stimulus set consisted of images of four 3 D objects (wedge, pyramid, <b>cylinder</b> <b>and</b> <b>cone)</b> in eight different views. Spatial scales used were 2, 4, 8 and 16 cycles/object. The square window had a linear size of about half a cycle at the scale used. Subjects used a mouse to control the spatial location of the window in discrete steps and four different keys on the keyboard to select the spatial scale. The subjects were instructed to maximize accuracy, not speed. Results. Averaged percent correct across subjects for the multi-scale condition was 54. 17 %. Averaged percent correct for the 2 -, 4 -, 8 - and 16 -single conditions were 42. 71 %, 55. 21 %, 64. 58 % and 62. 50 % respectively. Conclusions. Recognition accuracy in the multi-scale condition was poorer than that in some of the single-scale conditions. Our findings indicate that human observers did not benefit from access to information in different spatial scales. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

By defining a narrow line-of-sight region, rp &lt; 5. 5 h - 1 Mpc, where r p is the transverse separation component, we measure a strong excess of clustering at &# 8764; 110 h - 1 Mpc, as previously reported in the literature. We also test these results in an alternative coordinate system, by defining the line of sight as &# 0952; < 3 &# 0176; where &# 0952; is the opening angle. This clustering excess appears much stronger than the feature in the better-measured monopole. A fiducial ACDM nonlinear model in redshift space predicts a much weaker signature. We use realistic mock catalogs to model the expected signal and noise. We find that the line-of-sight measurements can be explained well by our mocks {{as well as by}} a featureless &# 0958; = 0. We conclude that there is no convincing evidence that the strong clustering measurement is the line-of-sight baryonic acoustic feature. We also evaluate how detectable such a signal would be in the upcoming Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) LRG volume. Mock LRG catalogs (z &lt; 0. 6) suggest that (1) the narrow line-of-sight <b>cylinder</b> <b>and</b> <b>cone</b> defined above probably will not reveal a detectable acoustic feature in BOSS; (2) a clustering measurement as high as that in the current sample can be ruled out (or confirmed) at a high confidence level using a BOSS-sized data set; (3) an analysis with wider angular cuts, which provide better signal-to-noise ratios, can nevertheless be used to compare line-of-sight and transverse distances, and thereby constrain the expansion rate H(z) and diameter distance DA(z) ...|$|E
