5|$|At the time, 404 {{would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach their target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped the ball in the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes, Australia had only made 0/10.|$|E
5|$|The {{declaration}} left Australia with {{a victory}} target of 404 runs.

Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting their dismissal by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spinners. In addition, most of the Australian onlookers present at the ground thought their team had no chance of victory.

5|$|Yardley’s {{declaration}} left Australia {{to chase}} 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting team. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target; the local press wrote them off and predicted that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket that was expected to favour the spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a surface that offered spin and bounce. It appeared that they were playing <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> first before deciding whether to try and achieve the target at a later point. Only 44 runs came in the first hour, meaning that 360 runs were still needed in 285 minutes. Evans then missed a leg-side stumping opportunity against Hassett as Bedser beat both openers with extra bounce. Hassett was dismissed by Compton's left-arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57. The Englishman’s delivery had caught Hassett's leading edge and he dived forward in his follow through to take a one-handed catch just above the ground. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. The English spinners created a number of chances against both batsmen, but multiple catches and stumping opportunities were fumbled. Aside from the missed wicket-taking opportunities, the spinners were erratic in line and length and Bradman and Morris plundered many boundaries. Australia went on to complete the world record chase with seven wickets and 15 minutes in hand, ensuring an unassailable 30 series lead.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Ginsburg co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and, in 1973, {{she became}} the ACLU's general counsel. The Women's Rights Project and related ACLU {{projects}} participated in over three hundred gender discrimination cases by 1974. As {{the director of the}} ACLU's Women's Rights Project, she argued six gender discrimination cases before the Supreme Court between 1973 and 1976, winning five. Rather than asking the Court to end all gender discrimination at once, Ginsburg charted a strategic course, taking aim at specific discriminatory statutes and building on each successive victory. She chose plaintiffs <b>carefully,</b> <b>at</b> times picking male plaintiffs to demonstrate that gender discrimination was harmful to both men and women The laws Ginsburg targeted included those that on the surface appeared beneficial to women, but in fact reinforced the notion that women needed to be dependent on men. Her strategic advocacy extended to word choice, favoring the use of [...] "gender" [...] instead of [...] "sex", after her secretary suggested the word [...] "sex" [...] would serve as a distraction to judges. She attained a reputation as a skilled oral advocate and her work led directly to the end of gender discrimination {{in many areas of the}} law.|$|E
500|$|The UK {{announced}} {{a test of}} opinion in Rhodesia to be undertaken by a four-man commission headed by the veteran judge Lord Pearce. All four population groups—black, white, coloured (mixed) and Asian—would have to approve the terms for Britain to proceed. ZANU and ZAPU supporters quickly formed the African National Council (later the United African National Council, or UANC) to organise and co-ordinate black opposition to the deal. Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the first black man to have been ordained as such in Rhodesia, was installed as the movement's leader. The Pearce Commission finished its work on 12 March 1972 and published its report two months later—it described white, coloured and Asian Rhodesians as in favour of the terms by 98%, 97% and 96% respectively, and black citizens as against them by an unspecified large majority. This came as a great shock to the white community [...] "and a deep disappointment to those in Britain who hoped {{to get rid of}} this tiresome albatross", Blake records. Smith condemned the Pearce Commissioners as [...] "naive and inept". The UK withdrew from negotiations, but neither government abandoned the accord entirely. [...] "I would ask them [...] to look again very <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> what they rejected," [...] Douglas-Home told the House of Commons; [...] "the proposals are still available because Mr Smith has not withdrawn or modified them." ...|$|E

He had played in practice matches and was [...] "fully confident {{of his ability to}} perform as well as ever he did". Teddy Jolley and newcomer Bernard Pumfrey began the season at full back, but a defeat at Liverpool and a heavy defeat at Burslem Port Vale gave Speller his chance. His first game for almost a year came in a visit to Ardwick, won 1–0 by Small Heath. According to the Post, [...] "he played <b>carefully</b> <b>at</b> the start, but gained confidence as the game proceeded, and many times put a stop to extremely dangerous attacks by the clever right wing of the home team." [...] He played in the next game, a 5–2 win at home to Grimsby Town, then lost his place to William Reynolds. At Christmas, Small Heath played a friendly at Marlow, in which Speller had [...] "not been seen in such form since his leg was broken". Nevertheless, he retired {{at the end of the}} season. Before he broke his leg, he had not missed a game in League or FA Cup since the ankle injury some two-and-a-half years earlier.|$|E
