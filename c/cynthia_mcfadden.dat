Liberty Media would join the venture in 1991. The network's first logo consisted of a rectangle with the word [...] "COURT", and the letters [...] "TV" [...] below, with a line underneath.|$|E

The conversion to a multi-topic format has received some criticism {{due to the fact}} that it is more difficult to focus on a story subject in depth when there is much less time devoted to it, and that more stories seen on the program seem to focus more on popular culture, rather than news events. However, ratings increased after the new format was implemented, even beating the Late Show with David Letterman for three consecutive weeks in August 2006 and again in 2008.|$|E
