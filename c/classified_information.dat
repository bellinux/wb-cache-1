5|$|On 3 June 1982, Vulcan XM597 broke its probe while {{attempting}} to refuel in flight, while returning from a mission over the Falkland Islands. With insufficient fuel to reach its base on Ascension Island, the pilot discarded <b>classified</b> <b>information</b> over the Atlantic Ocean and diverted to Rio de Janeiro. Shortly after entering Brazilian airspace, the Brazilian Air Force sent two Northrop F-5s to escort the British plane until it landed on Galeão Air Force Base. This led to high-level diplomatic talks between the UK and Brazil, which remained neutral during the Falklands War. After seven days of detainment, the Vulcan and its crew were allowed to return home {{on the condition that}} XM597 played no further part in the conflict.|$|E

40|$|Information and {{protection}} of information is vital to organizations to protect organizational competence. CAD data in form of 2 D and 3 D models consists of almost all intellectual property {{in research and development}} organizations. One way of protecting the information in the 2 D and 3 D models is to <b>classify</b> the <b>information</b> in the models. By <b>classifying</b> the <b>information</b> security measures can be taken dependent of the classification. It is important for organization to make it the culture to <b>classify</b> <b>information</b> and to use a information classification model with shared terms that is understood by all.

5|$|After the World Security Council members {{arrive for}} the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers {{broadcasts}} Hydra's plot to {{everyone at the}} Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised {{as one of the}} Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D's database so that Romanoff can leak <b>classified</b> <b>information,</b> exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury kills Pierce. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Rogers refuses to fight the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers is thrown out into the Potomac River. The Winter Soldier rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee and Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells. Rogers and Wilson decide to find the Winter Soldier, while Rumlow, who was a double agent for Hydra, is hospitalized following the Triskelion's destruction.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of flerovium and livermorium was recognized by IUPAC on 1 June 2011, IUPAC asked {{the discovery}} team at the JINR to suggest permanent names for those two elements. The Dubna team chose to name element 114 flerovium (symbol Fl), after the Russian Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR), named after the Soviet physicist Georgy Flyorov (also spelled Flerov); earlier reports claim the element name was directly proposed to honour Flyorov. In accordance with the proposal received from the discoverers IUPAC officially named flerovium after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (an older name for the JINR), not after Flyorov himself. Flyorov is known for writing to Stalin in April 1942 and pointing out the silence in scientific journals {{in the field of}} nuclear fission in the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. Flyorov deduced that this research must have become <b>classified</b> <b>information</b> in those countries.

5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, <b>classified</b> <b>information</b> could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E

50|$|A {{significant}} {{provision of}} EO 13526 {{is the creation}} of the National Declassification Center. The major focus is the idea that information should become declassified systematically as soon as practicable.

Mechanisms are outlined for periodic reevaluation of the need to <b>classify</b> <b>information,</b> even if the result of the evaluation is to keep the <b>information</b> <b>classified.</b>|$|R
5|$|Initially, {{the very}} {{existence}} of the SPARTAN project and thus John's existence, was categorised as <b>classified</b> <b>information.</b> Many within the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who were aware of this information, were strongly opinionated against the project, as the SPARTAN unit's proven versatility elevated them into direct competition with role-dedicated, established units. Since John emerged as the most exemplary Spartan from among the unit, he became the natural target of their sentiments. Antonio Silva, an officer from one such unit (ODSTs), exemplifies this attitude, and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet. Following the partial declassification of the SPARTAN project, John's heroic achievements caused the overall sentiment to lean in his favor. Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor {{said in an interview that}} revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{advances}} {{in recent years}} in the area of mandatory access control in database systems, today's information repositories remain vulnerable to inference and data association attacks that can result in serious information leakage. Such information leakage can be prevented by properly <b>classifying</b> <b>information</b> according to constraints that express relationships among the security levels of data objects. In this paper we address the problem of <b>classifying</b> <b>information</b> by enforcing explicit data classification as well as inference and association constraints. We formulate the problem of determining a classification that ensures satisfaction of the constraints, {{while at the same time}} guaranteeing that information will not be unnecessarily overclassified. We present an approach to the solution of this problem and give an algorithm implementing it which is linear in simple cases, and low-order polynomial (n²) in the general case. We also analyze a variation of the problem which is NP-hard...|$|R
