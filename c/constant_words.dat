We generalise Shinohara’s algorithm to subclasses of patterns and characterise those subclasses for which it is applicable. Furthermore, within this set of pattern classes, we characterise those for which Shinohara’s algorithm has a polynomial running time (under the assumption P 6 = N P). Moreover, we also investigate the complexity of the consistency problem of patterns, i. e., finding a pattern that separates two given finite sets of words...|$|E

In this paper, we provide a procedure {{to decide whether}} a regular language is a reflexive splicing language, based on the above-mentioned characterization that is given {{in terms of a}} finite set of constants for the language. The procedure relies on the notion of label-equivalence that induces a finite refinement of the syntactic monoid of a regular language L.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} of this work is to design a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) processor with CanonicSigned Digit (CSD) recoding. Methods: The incorporation of the CSD recording reduces the number of non-zero bits in the <b>constant</b> <b>word</b> length coefficient. The processor has a dedicated processing unit for the manipulation of floating pointnumbers. It uses CSD recoded number for {{the execution of the}} arithmetic operations such as multiplication. This noveltechnique reduces the switching activity and in turn resulting in reduction in the power consumed by the processor. Findings: The simulation was carried out using XILINX 14. 3 and CADENCE NCLAUNCH. The RISC processor was synthesizedwith and without the CSD recoding. Although there is a slight increase in the area overhead, the use of ternary numberrepresentation in the processor design brought in a power reduction of 56. 23 %.

40|$|Combined use of {{a hearing}} aid (HA) and {{cochlear}} implant (CI) {{has been shown to}} improve CI users’ speech and music performance. However, different hearing devices, test stimuli, and listening tasks may interact and obscure bimodal benefits. In this study, speech and music perception were measured in bimodal listeners for CI-only, HA-only, and CI[*]+[*]HA conditions, using the Sung Speech Corpus, a database of monosyllabic words produced at different fundamental frequencies. Sentence recognition was measured using sung speech in which pitch was held constant or varied across words, as well as for spoken speech. Melodic contour identification (MCI) was measured using sung speech in which the words were held constant or varied across notes. Results showed that sentence recognition was poorer with sung speech relative to spoken, with little difference between sung speech with a constant or variable pitch; mean performance was better with CI-only relative to HA-only, and best with CI[*]+[*]HA. MCI performance was better with <b>constant</b> <b>words</b> versus variable words; mean performance was better with HA-only than with CI-only and was best with CI[*]+[*]HA. Relative to CI-only, a strong bimodal benefit was observed for speech and music perception.

While variations in pitch and timbre may negatively affect CI users’ speech and music perception, bimodal listening may partially compensate for these deficits...|$|E
40|$|The rate of {{occurrence}} of words is not uniform but varies from document to document.

40|$|Let p be a prime. We prove various analogues and generalizations of McEliece's theorem on the p-divisibility of weights {{of words}} in cyclic codes over a finite field of {{characteristic}} p. Here we consider Abelian codes over various Galois rings. We present four new theorems on p-adic valuations of weights. For simplicity of presentation here, we assume that our codes do not contain <b>constant</b> <b>words.</b> The first result has two parts, both concerning Abelian codes over Z/p^dZ. The first part gives a lower bound on the p-adic valuations of Hamming weights. This bound is shown to be sharp: for each code, we find the maximum k such that p^k divides all Hamming weights. The second part of our result concerns the number of occurrences of a given nonzero symbol s in Z/p^dZ in words of our code; we call this number the s-count. We find a j such that p^j divides the s-counts of all words in the code. Both our bounds are stronger than previous ones for infinitely many codes. The second result concerns Abelian codes over Z/ 4 Z. We give a sharp lower bound on the 2 -adic valuations of Lee weights. It improves previous bounds for infinitely many codes. The third result concerns Abelian codes over arbitrary Galois rings. We give a lower bound on the p-adic valuations of Hamming weights. When we specialize this result to finite fields, we recover the theorem of Delsarte and McEliece on the p-divisibility of weights in Abelian codes over finite fields. The fourth result generalizes the Delsarte-McEliece theorem. We consider the number of components in which a collection c_ 1, [...] .,c_t of words all have the zero symbol; we call this the simultaneous zero count. Our generalized theorem p-adically estimates simultaneous zero counts in Abelian codes over finite fields, and we {{can use it to}} prove the theorem of N. M.
