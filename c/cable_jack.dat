5000|$|The Gibson Melody Maker {{was first}} {{launched}} in 1959 and discontinued in 1971. It had a thin slab-style mahogany {{body and a}} one-piece mahogany neck. [...] All the electronics, from the small single-coil pickups to the <b>cable</b> <b>jack,</b> were assembled on the pickguard and installed in a rout {{in the front of}} the body. The strings ran from a straight-sided simplification of the traditional Gibson headstock at one end to a wraparound bridge/tailpiece unit at the other.|$|E
5000|$|Pickup {{configuration}} {{consists of}} two genuine Seymour Duncan humbuckers: a TB-4 at the bridge, and an SH-1N at the neck. The pickups are connected to rear-mounted controls consisting of a shared volume dome knob and a tone dome knob, with a 3-Position blade selector switch below the knobs, 2013 models are equipped with 5 position switch, which enables coil splitting configurations in positions 2 and 4. (Pos. 1 Bridge H, Pos. 2 S/S, Pos. 3 H/H, Pos. 4 Neck S and Pos. 5 Neck H). A 1/4" [...] mono audio <b>cable</b> <b>jack</b> is bottom mounted on the body, which is secured with a black plastic football plate.also some custom LTD runs contain EMG 81/85 active humbucker pickups (some newer runs have the ZW EMG set.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Danelectro Convertible was a hollow-bodied thinline acoustic/electric guitar {{based on}} the Shorthorn. It had a {{conventional}} round sound hole with a lipstick pickup mounted across the hole. The Convertible name came from the ability to play it unplugged as an acoustic guitar or plugged in as an electric guitar. The Convertible has the double cutaway shape used on Danelectro's DC series of guitars. The Convertible was originally produced in the 1960s. It was offered as a reissue between 1998 and 2001. The guitar is currently being reissued. The reissues differ from the originals in that they have mounted the pickup diagonally across the soundhole, and {{there is only one}} concentric knob as opposed to two separate tone and volume knobs. The reissues also have a <b>cable</b> <b>jack</b> located in the strap knob.|$|E

5000|$|The M1009s have a split 24/12 V {{electrical}} system. Most of {{the truck}} actually runs on 12 V. It has two separate 12 V alternators and batteries wired in series, only the glow plug system, the starter, and the jumper <b>cable</b> <b>jack</b> are wired to the 24 V terminals. {{everything else in the}} truck runs on 12 V. The glow plugs are actually 12 V glow plugs with a resistor pack on the firewall to drop the 24 V down to 12 V. This resistor pack can be bypassed and the glow plugs run directly off of the 12 V battery. If this is done and the 24 V starter is replaced with a standard 12v starter the second alternator and battery are no longer needed. (If this is done then the military 24 V slave adapter in the grille will need to be disconnected as well.) ...|$|E
50|$|CIVICUS is {{a two-year}} living and {{learning}} undergraduate {{program in the}} College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, which links academic coursework together with participation in internships and community service to provide an experience of civil service engagement for participants (known as CIVICUS Associates). CIVICUS Associates live together in Somerset Hall (located in the North Hill Community), which was renovated in 1999 for the CIVICUS Living and Learning Program. Somerset Hall also houses the program's offices and hosts CIVICUS classes. The hall is designed with several study and social lounges to enhance students' living and learning experience. Somerset is located centrally on campus making the walk to classes, the dining hall, McKeldin Library, and the Stamp Student Union quick and convenient. All the rooms in Somerset are air conditioned and each student has his/her own internet, phone, and <b>cable</b> <b>jack.</b> Most of the rooms are doubles with a few triples and quads scattered throughout the building. There are also some singles. In addition, there is a computer lab and laundry facility located on the ground floor. Each floor also has one or two small kitchenettes with a microwave and a sink.|$|E

25|$|On a {{conventional}} suspension bridge, sections of deck are hung {{in place and}} so immediately tension the suspenders. The proper initial length of each suspender is predetermined by engineering calculations and adjustments are required for segment relative positioning and equality of load distribution amongst the several suspenders of the section. On this bridge, the deck sections were already in a fixed relative position (being joined together and resting upon the falsework) and all suspender cables must be brought to specific tensions individually in order to tension the main <b>cable.</b> A <b>jacking</b> saddle on the western end is used to balance the tension among the sections of the single main cable.|$|R

For 10GBASE-T, an unshielded Cat 6 cable should not exceed 55 metres.|$|R
50|$|Shell {{received}} over 200 individual {{suggestions for}} {{what could be done}} with the Brent Spar. One of these came from the Stavanger Port Authority. They were planning a quay extension at Mekjarvik, to provide new Roll-On/Roll-Off ferry facilities. It was hoped that using slices of the Spar's hull would save both money and energy that would otherwise have been spent in new steel construction. The Spar was raised vertically in the water by building a lifting cradle, placed underneath the Spar and connected by <b>cables</b> to <b>jacks</b> on board heavy barges. <b>Jacking</b> the <b>cables</b> upwards raised the Spar so that its hull could be cut into 'rings' and slid onto a barge.|$|R
50|$|The Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) {{is a small}} {{form-factor}} {{serial port}} connector developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). It uses {{a modified version of}} the 6P6C modular connector with the latch displaced off-center so standard modular connectors found on Ethernet <b>cables</b> or phone <b>jacks</b> cannot accidentally be plugged in. MMJ connections are used on Digital minicomputers, such as the PDP-11, VAX and Alpha systems, and to connect terminals, printers, and serial console servers.|$|R
50|$|Holman left television, {{working a}} number of {{positions}} {{in and out of}} media, until he revived his show on cable television in 1985. The show had a short stint on independent station WDBB. In 1990 Holman was back on broadcast television with Cousin Cliff's Clubhouse, a Saturday-only show on WBRC-TV. That show ran for two years, after which Holman again produced a <b>cable</b> version for <b>Jack's</b> Hamburgers. After a short run, Holman retired from television altogether.|$|R

Nash travels to one of the temporary Army outposts performing quarantine procedures, and witnesses the effects of Andromeda spreading through various modes of transportation. He becomes a target of assassination due to his presence at the outpost, but manages to escape Ferrus and his subordinates.|$|R
50|$|Taylor {{worked as}} a teacher prior to being {{selected}} as party leader in 1995.

Liberal MLA <b>Jack</b> <b>Cable</b> served as the party's interim leader in the Legislative Assembly of Yukon, although Taylor retained the organizational leadership until Pat Duncan was selected as his successor in 1997.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} of LocalTalk called PhoneNet {{was introduced by}} Farallon Computing. It used standard unshielded side-by-side telephone wire, with six-position modular connectors (same as the popular RJ11 telephone connectors) connected to a PhoneNet transceiver, instead of the expensive, shielded, twisted-pair cable. In addition to being lower cost, PhoneNet-wired networks were more reliable due to the connections being more difficult to accidentally disconnect. In addition, because it used the [...] "outer" [...] pair of the modular connector, it could travel on many pre-existing phone <b>cables</b> and <b>jacks</b> where just the inner pair was in use for RJ11 telephone service. PhoneNet was also able to use an office's existing phone wire, allowing for entire floors of computers to be easily networked. Farallon introduced a 12-port hub, which made constructing star topology networks of up to 48 devices as easy as adding jacks at the workstations and some jumpers in the phone closet. These factors led to PhoneNet largely supplanting LocalTalk wiring in low-cost networking.|$|R
5000|$|On September 1, 2014, Jack City {{ended its}} run on free TV {{due to the}} {{preparations}} being made by BEAM 31 for the incoming transition to ISDB-T digital television, though {{it continues to be}} broadcast as a separate <b>cable</b> channel.

50|$|S/PDIF was {{developed}} {{at the same time}} as the main standard, AES3, used to interconnect professional audio equipment in the professional audio field. This resulted from the desire of the various standards committees to have at least sufficient similarities between the two interfaces to allow the use of the same, or very similar, designs for interfacing ICs. S/PDIF remained nearly identical at the protocol level, but changed the physical connectors from XLR to either electrical coaxial cable (with RCA connectors) or optical fibre (TOSLINK; i.e., F05 or EIAJ optical), both of which cost less than the XLR connection. The RCA connectors are typically colour-coded orange to differentiate from other RCA connector uses such as composite video. The cable was also changed from 110 Ω balanced twisted pair to 75 Ω coaxial <b>cable,</b> using RCA <b>jacks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Most cable {{companies}} require a set-top box to view their cable channels, even on newer televisions with digital cable QAM tuners, because most digital cable channels are now encrypted, or [...] "scrambled", to reduce cable service theft. A <b>cable</b> from the <b>jack</b> {{in the wall}} {{is attached to the}} input of the box, and an output cable from the box is attached to the television, usually the RF-IN or composite input on older TVs. Since the set-top box only decodes the single channel that is being watched, each television in the house requires a separate box. Some unencrypted channels, usually traditional over-the-air broadcast networks, can be displayed without a receiver box. The cable company will provide set top boxes based on the level of service a customer purchases, from basic set top boxes with a standard definition picture connected through the standard coaxial connection on the TV, to high-definition wireless DVR receivers connected via HDMI or component. Older analog television sets are [...] "cable ready" [...] and can receive the old analog cable without a set-top box. To receive digital cable channels on an analog television set, even unencrypted ones, requires a different type of box, a digital television adapter supplied by the cable company. A new distribution method that takes advantage of the low cost high quality DVB distribution to residential areas, uses TV gateways to convert the DVB-C, DVB-C2 stream to IP for distribution of TV over IP network in the home.|$|R
