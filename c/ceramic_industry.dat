5|$|Burzahom's <b>ceramic</b> <b>industry</b> {{was mostly}} of hunting based culture and is {{different}} from the Chinese Neolithic pottery. The economy of the people was found to be based on hunting and gathering with a nascent stage of cultivation practices. Pottery made in Burzahom showed close affinity to those found in the Swat valley in Pakistan, particularly in respect of its shapes and decorations of the black ware pottery. The burial practices and type of tools recovered from the site were inferred as having close resemblance to those found in the North Chinese Neolithic culture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ceramic</b> <b>industry</b> consumes a {{significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E

25|$|The precise {{origins and}} early {{innovations}} of Satsuma ware are somewhat obscure; however most scholars date its appearance {{to the late}} sixteenth or early seventeenth century. The Satsuma region was ripe {{for the development of}} kilns due to its access to local clay and proximity to the Korean peninsula. In 1597–1598, at the conclusion of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's incursions into Korea, potters were forcefully brought to Japan to kick-start Kyūshū's non-existent <b>ceramic</b> <b>industry.</b> These potters eventually mainly settled in Naeshirogawa and Tateno, which were to become the hub of the local pottery industry.|$|E
25|$|Figures and {{ornaments}} {{were painted}} {{on the body of}} the vessel using shapes and colors reminiscent of silhouettes. Delicate contours were incised into the paint before firing, and details could be reinforced and highlighted with opaque colors, usually white and red. The principal centers for this style were initially the commercial hub Corinth, and later Athens. Other important production sites are known to have been in Laconia, Boeotia, eastern Greece, and Italy. Particularly in Italy individual styles developed which were at least in part intended for the Etruscan market. Greek black-figure vases were very popular with the Etruscans, as is evident from frequent imports. Greek artists created customized goods for the Etruscan market which differed in form and decor from their normal products. The Etruscans also developed their own black-figure <b>ceramic</b> <b>industry</b> oriented on Greek models.|$|E
