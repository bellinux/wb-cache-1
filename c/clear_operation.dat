5000|$|The entire {{core memory}} {{was in the}} IBM 1625 memory unit. Memory cycle time was halved {{compared}} to the Model I's (internal or 1623 memory unit), to 10 µs (i.e., the cycle speed was raised to 100 kHz) by using faster cores. A Memory Address Register Storage (MARS) core memory read, clear, or write operation took 1.5 µs and each write operation was automatically (but not necessarily immediately) preceded by a read or <b>clear</b> <b>operation</b> of the same [...] "register(s)" [...] during the 10 µs memory cycle.|$|E
50|$|Ctries {{support a}} lock-free, linearizable, constant-time {{snapshot}} operation, {{based on the}} insight obtained from persistent data structures. This is a breakthrough in concurrent data-structure design, since existing concurrent data-structures do not support snapshots. The snapshot operation allows implementing lock-free, linearizable iterator, size and clear operations - existing concurrent data-structures have implementations which either use global locks or are correct only given {{that there are no}} concurrent modifications to the data-structure. In particular, Ctries have an O(1) iterator creation operation, O(1) <b>clear</b> <b>operation,</b> O(1) duplicate operation and an amortized O(logn) size retrieval operation.|$|E

50|$|Citation:The Distinguished Service Cross is {{presented}} to Glenn K. Otis, Lieutenant Colonel (Armor), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with Headquarters Troop, 3d Squadron, 4th Cavalry, 25th Infantry Division. Lieutenant sic Otis distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous actions on 31 January 1968 as commanding officer of a cavalry squadron defending against the communist Lunar New Year offensive at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army forces launched a massive attack on the base and penetrated the defensive wire. Colonel Otis responded to a call for assistance and immediately led his squadron to reinforce the beleaguered friendly elements. Braving devastating rocket, machine gun and mortar fire, he repeatedly ordered low passes over the enemy positions to assess the rapidly changing situation and skillfully coordinate his unit's defenses. His aircraft was forced down on three occasions by the intense enemy fusillade, {{but he refused to}} leave the battle area and quickly secured another helicopter each time. The battle grew in intensity, as he fearlessly landed amid a curtain of fire to coordinate with his ground commanders and encourage his men to continue their staunch defenses. His skillful and aggressive leadership inspired his men to repel the attack and force the determined insurgents to withdraw. Informed that an estimated Viet Cong battalion, poised outside the perimeter, was threatening the air base, he quickly directed his unit in a search and <b>clear</b> <b>operation.</b> Repeatedly exposing himself to savage enemy fire, he led his men in a fierce attack that totally destroyed the enemy forces. His fearless leadership in the heat of battle was instrumental in preventing the vital military installation from falling into enemy hands. Lieutenant Colonel Otis' extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.|$|E

40|$|The use of tumescent technique, which {{contains}} epinephrine, in penile surgery {{has not been}} reported previously. Two patients with hypospadias had reconstructive operation using tumescent technique with a ”One-per-Mil” tumescent solution containing epinephrine intra-operatively. The results was a <b>clear</b> <b>operation</b> field, almost bloodless during dissection, and no complication on the penis after epinephrine injection with minimal edema. Apparently, the “One-per-Mil” tumescent solution acts as a natural hydro-dissector creating avascular anatomic tissue planes for easier and more rapid dissection in surgery for hypospadias. We suggest that epinephrine is safe to be injected in penis as a future area of clinical practice.

40|$|For east-west {{spanning}} line, {{to reduce}} abscissa value of Gauss projection, the oblique reference ellipsoid was constructed {{by means of}} least square method. Via theory of coordinate system transformation, spatial rectangular coordinates of target region in each coordinate system were carried out, and then geodetic coordinates of target region on oblique reference ellipsoid were relatively given. Through ellipsoid transformation, oblique deformed ellipsoid was established to lessen distortion of projection caused by height. Taking one railway for example, it were shown that "An alteration of Gauss projection based on oblique deformed ellipsoid" could greatly deplete abscissa components, avoid zoning of Gauss projection and reduce height effectively, {{as well as the}} relevant distortion it caused.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] this paper {{we examine the}} check sorting and <b>clearing</b> <b>operation</b> and develop a mathematical model for arriving at optimal decisions on check sorting patterns and clearing routes. Previous {{research in this area}} has focused on either the sorting <b>operation</b> or the <b>clearing</b> <b>operation,</b> and hence the main contribution of our research is to develop and solve optimization model that simultaneously represents both these operations. The proposed model was tested using real-life operational data obtained from a Philadelphia-based bank. After optimally solving the model, we recommend possible ways of finding more robust sorting and clearing decisions, and compare the robust decisions to the optimal solution. It {{should be noted that the}} sorting and <b>clearing</b> <b>operation</b> is not limited to banking industry alone, but that it is also a backbone of the U. S. Postal Service operation.

40|$|Objectives. To {{analyze the}} {{kinematics}} of cervical rotation-traction manipulation (CRTM). Methods. An experimental study measuring the kinematics of CRTM was conducted. A total of 18 healthy volunteers {{participated in the}} study. A single manipulator operated the CRTM for all subjects. Motion capture technology was adopted to track the trajectory during the CRTM operation. Results. The manipulated side did not influence the cervical spine motion. The motion ranges obtained during CRTM were well below the active range of motion reported in the literature. The head rotation angle after thrusting was less than {{the angle of the}} rotary-position (P< 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} the head rotation angle between pretraction and upward-thrust. The thrust direction of CRTM was mainly upward.

40|$|Background and Objective: One of {{the main}} {{treatments}} for chronic rhinosinusitis is endoscopic surgery. In this procedure, intraoperative bleeding due to limited view of the surgeon can bring about surgical complications. To have a <b>clear</b> <b>operation</b> field for endoscopic sinus surgery, bleeding management is necessary.

Before anesthesia, magnesium sulfate was administered for 10 min at a dose of 50 mg/kg and at a dose 15 mg/kg/h afterwards. In the other group, dexmedetomidine was given for 10 min before anesthesia at a dose of 1 mic/kg and at a dose of 0. 6 mic/kg/h thereupon.
