5|$|Most insects, however, lead short {{lives as}} adults, and rarely {{interact}} {{with one another}} except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of parental <b>care,</b> <b>where</b> they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest, and arrange them so they could be protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs (birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care (as seen in paleognaths such as ostriches and emus). This reproductive system pre-dates the origin of birds and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental <b>care</b> (<b>where</b> both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had pygostyles on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; these could have been used for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals.|$|E

25|$|Kangaroo care or Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), {{sometimes}} called skin-to-skin care, {{is a technique}} of newborn <b>care</b> <b>where</b> babies are kept skin-to-skin with a parent, typically their mother.

25|$|Cavity spawners: {{lay eggs}} in a cave or cavity. These fish form pairs and have {{advanced}} brood <b>care</b> <b>where</b> the eggs are defended and cleaned.

25|$|SOA 2.0 {{event-driven}} {{programming is}} structured around {{the concept of}} decoupled relationships between event producers and event consumers: an event consumer doesn't <b>care</b> <b>where</b> or why an event occurs; rather, it's concerned {{that it will be}} invoked when the event has occurred. Systems and applications that separate event producers from event consumers typically rely on an event dispatcher, or channel. This channel contains an event queue that acts as an intermediary between event producers and event handlers.|$|E

40|$|This {{pioneering}} book, {{in considering}} intellectually disabled people's lives, sets out a care ethics model of disability that outlines the emotional <b>caring</b> sphere, <b>where</b> love and <b>care</b> are psycho-socially questioned, the practical <b>caring</b> sphere, <b>where</b> day-to-day <b>care</b> is carried out, and the socio-political <b>caring</b> sphere, <b>where</b> social intolerance and aversion to difficult differences are addressed. This book draws from {{an understanding of}} how intellectual disability is represented in all forms of media, a feminist ethics of care, and capabilities, as well as other theories, to provide a critique and alternative to the social model of disability...|$|R
25|$|In physics, {{conservation}} laws {{state that}} certain particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system {{do not change}} as the system evolves over time. In 1915, Emmy Noether discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature. The fact that physical processes don't <b>care</b> <b>where</b> in space they take place (space translation symmetry) yields conservation of momentum, {{the fact that such}} processes don't care when they take place (time translation symmetry) yields conservation of energy, and so on. In this section, we examine the Newtonian views of conservation of mass, momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.|$|E
25|$|Kelly {{remained}} comatose, {{and after}} his condition did not improve he was transferred to hospice <b>care,</b> <b>where</b> he died the following month. The Holmes County sheriff's office, which had also been the lead agency investigating the McDaniel disappearance, implied {{that it had not}} gotten the full story of what had occurred the night of Kelly's injury and that it had some questions it wanted answered. However, police would not name the individuals who had taken Kelly home and found him there in the morning. The sheriff's office also refused to release the autopsy report to the Northwest Florida Daily News despite its status as a public record under Florida's sunshine laws; it claimed that release of the report would compromise an ongoing investigation.|$|E
25|$|Males can be choosier than females. As an offering, {{males are}} capable of {{providing}} nuptial gifts secretions, which can be more expensive than female reproductive investment, parental <b>care,</b> <b>where</b> the reproductive costs in males are higher than in females because they invest large quantities of resources and time after egg fertilization, and foraging and nesting sites to the females. Moreover, these factors decrease their subsequent male reproductive opportunities, {{and the availability of}} males. An example of male parental care can be found in belostomatid water bugs, where the male, after fertilizing the eggs, allows the female to glue her eggs onto his back. He broods them until the nymphs hatch 2–4 weeks later. The eggs are large and reduce the ability of the male to fertilize other females and catch prey, and increases its predation risk.|$|E

25|$|Invigorated by {{the arrival}} of {{enthusiastic}} new members, the IWW began a wave of organizing drives. These largely took a regional form and they, as well as the union's overall membership, concentrated in Portland, Chicago, Ann Arbor, and throughout the state of California, which when combined accounted for over half of union drives from 1970 to 1979. In Portland, Oregon, the IWW led campaigns at Winter Products (a brass plating plant) in 1972, at a local Winchell's Donuts (where a strike was waged and lost), at the Albina Day <b>Care</b> (<b>where</b> key union demands were won, including the firing of the director of the day care), of healthcare workers at West Side School and the Portland Medical Center, and of agricultural workers in 1974. The latter effort led to the founding of an IWW union hall in Burnside, Oregon to compete with extortionate hiring halls and day labor agencies. Organizing efforts led to a growth in membership, but repeated loss of strikes and organizing campaigns would anticipate the decline of the Portland branch after the mid-1970s, a stagnancy period which would last until the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|In all, some 650–800 Germans died, {{and some}} 550 of the around 1,400 wet and cold {{survivors}} of Blücher were captured, by soldiers from Company no. 4 of the Norwegian Royal Guards {{under the command}} of Kaptein (Captain) A. J. T. Petersson. In total, some 1,200 of the survivors had made it ashore at Frogn near Drøbak and the guardsmen were supposed to take all the Germans prisoner, but mainly focused on tending for the many wounded and dying. Around 1,000 of the Germans, including Generalmajor Erwin Engelbrecht and Admiral Oskar Kummetz, were eventually moved to a nearby farm and placed under light guard. None of the prisoners were interrogated. By 18:30, the Norwegian soldiers withdrew from the area, abandoning the Germans. Generalmajor Engelbrecht and Admiral Kummetz then made their way to Oslo. The German leading officers reached Oslo at 22:00, moving into the Hotel Continental, though without the most of the troops intended to occupy the Norwegian capital. Many of the German wounded were initially taken to Åsgården summer hotel in Åsgårdstrand for medical <b>care,</b> <b>where</b> Norwegian wounded had already been brought. The hotel was the temporary improvised location for the Royal Norwegian Navy Hospital, which had been evacuated from Horten at midnight on 8 April.|$|E

40|$|Can actions {{caused by}} {{emotions}} {{be free and}} autonomous? The rationalist conception of autonomy denies this.

I argue that the rationalist conception does not make room for akratic actions, that is, free and intentional actions performed against the agent’s best judgement. I then develop an account inspired by Harry Frankfurt and David Shoemaker, according to which an action is autonomous when it is determined by the agent’s most central <b>cares,</b> <b>where</b> <b>cares</b> are defined in terms of emotional dispositions...|$|R

On 7 February 1944, the battalion sailed from Finschhafen for Australia, disembarking at Brisbane. Granted home leave, Derrick {{made his way to}} South Australia for a short period with Beryl. In April, he was admitted to hospital suffering from malaria before returning to his battalion the following month.

500|$|The term {{ambulance}} {{comes from}} the Latin word [...] "" [...] as meaning [...] "to walk or move about" [...] which is a reference to early medical <b>care</b> <b>where</b> patients were moved by lifting or wheeling. The word originally meant a moving hospital, which follows an army in its movements. Ambulances (Ambulancias in Spanish) were first used for emergency transport in 1487 by the Spanish forces during the siege of Málaga by the Catholic Monarchs against the Emirate of Granada. During the American Civil War vehicles for conveying the wounded off the field of battle were called ambulance wagons. Field hospitals were still called ambulances during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and in the Serbo-Turkish war of 1876 even though the wagons were first referred to as ambulances about 1854 during the Crimean War.|$|E
500|$|A {{major concern}} with the second act was the {{effectiveness}} of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers [...] "Mr. and Mrs. God"), before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor. The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening. Rodgers said to Hammerstein, [...] "We've got to get God out of that parlor". When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>where</b> you put Him. Put Him on a ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor!" [...] Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder, and Mrs. God was removed from the show. Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by The New Republic as [...] "a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth".|$|E
