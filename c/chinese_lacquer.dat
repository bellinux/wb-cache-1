5|$|The Ngakpa Tratsang, also spelled Ngaba Zhacang, was the {{smallest}} of the three colleges that was set up in the complex. It was a three storied building originally built in 1419 by Jetsun Kunkhen Lodroe Rinchen Senge. It was refurbished in the 18th century by Lhazang Khan. Devoted to tantric studies, the college had an assembly hall and two chapels in the ground floor. The Assembly hall was built with four tall and 42 short columns with elegantly carved capitals. The main image in the centre of the hall was of Jamchen Chojey (wearing a black hat), founder of the monastery. It was believed that the Yongle Emperor (1360–1424) presented this image to Sera. Other images enshrined in the hall were of Maitreya, Gyeltsen Zangpo (first religious teacher of Sera), Pawangka Rinpoche, Tsongkhapa (with his principle disciples), Dalai Lama XIII, Chokyi Gyeltsen and Lodro Rinchen (founder of Sera Je). The two chapels housed many statues; in the Neten Lhakhang chapel of Shakyamuni Buddha along with images of 16 elders in double series (Upper series made in Tibetan style and the lower series in <b>Chinese</b> <b>lacquer</b> given by the Chinese Emperor); and the Jigje Lakhang chapel housed the 15th century image of Bhairava along with those of Mahakala, Dharmaraja, Shridevi and many others. While the third story was the residence of the Dalai Lama, the second floor had the images Amitayus and also eight 'Medicine Buddhas', as also reliquaries (stupas) of Gyeltsen Zangpo and Jetsun Chokyi Gyeltsen. However, as per reports, this college was destroyed and all resident monks also died in the bombardment done by the Chinese in 1959.|$|E

5000|$|Chinese {{diplomatic}} {{gifts to}} the Japanese government in the early Ming are especially well-documented on the Japanese side, {{at a time when}} the Ashikaga shogunate was enjoying a period of improved relations with China. In 1403 a consignment of luxury goods, also including <b>Chinese</b> silks and <b>lacquered</b> <b>Chinese</b> furniture, had 58 pieces of carved red lacquerware in a range of shapes. Lists with descriptions and measurements that allow some surviving pieces to be identified also survive from 1406, 1407, 1433 and 1434.

50|$|The {{new design}} tucked the house sidelong into the slope, with an 8-foot (2.4 m) tall by 200 foot (60 m) long {{concrete}} retaining {{wall on the}} uphill side. A mezzanine level was added, making use of a prefabricated spiral stair that {{was to have been}} the lower entrance. The upper level holds the bedrooms and overlooks the double-height living room. A courtyard was also introduced, separating the residence from the studio space. This revised scheme required only one additional beam. The 17 foot (5.1 m) tall facade is broken down into a rigidly geometric, almost Mondrianesque composition of brightly colored panels between thin steel columns and braces, painted black. The entry door is marked with a gold-leaf panel above. An existing row of eucalyptus trees was preserved along the exposed wall of the house, providing some shading and a visual contrast with the house's bold facade. As for the interior design, the Eameses' collection includes, among others, Isamu Noguchi floor lamps, Japanese kokeshi dolls, <b>Chinese</b> <b>lacquered</b> pillows, a Native American basket full of woven grass stems.|$|R
50|$|Though usually {{understood}} as a European style, chinoiserie was a global phenomenon. Local versions of chinoiserie were developed in India, Japan, Persia, and particularly Latin America. Through the Manila Galleon Trade, Portuguese traders brought large amounts of <b>Chinese</b> porcelain, <b>lacquer,</b> textiles, and spices from Chinese merchants based in Manila to New Spanish markets in Acapulco, Panama, and Lima. Those products then inspired local artists and artisans such as ceramicists making Talavera pottery at Puebla de Los Angeles.|$|R

50|$|In the 17th century, Dutch traders brought <b>Chinese</b> mother-of-pearl, <b>lacquer,</b> silks and {{porcelain}} to Europe. In {{the noble}} courts of the baroque era, {{an interest in}} Oriental arts grew during the rococo period into Chinoiserie, a genuine fashion for all things Chinese. In addition to the enthusiasm for Asian luxury goods which harmonized with the certain forms of rococo, travelogues and exhibitions portrayed the carefree living of the Chinese, which corresponded with the European courts' ideal of a relaxed lifestyle. Whole rooms of palaces were decorated with porcelain, small Chinese-style furniture and wall murals which presented the ideal world that was supposedly China.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{identification}} of several chemical markers of vegetal species of Oriental lacquers with the aim at providing a methodology consistent with sampling restrictions necessarily applied {{in the field of}} cultural heritage. The method proposed is based on rapid and easy single step thermally assisted hydrolysis-methylation (THM) pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) analysis that can be carried out with a minimum amount of matter (typically 10 μg for a sample collected on a museum or an archaeological object). The main contribution {{of this study is to}} provide multiple molecular criteria for discriminating the three Asian species used for making lacquers, namely Rhus verniciflua Stokes, Rhus succedanea and Melanorrhoea usitata. Because these trees grow in specific areas, identifying the species involved in ancient lacquer coatings also provides geobotanical data and fruitful information on the exchange networks and trading routes developed by ancient societies. With this purpose, a systematic study of all pyrolysis products of lacquer coatings was carried out on modern dried lacquer films from authentified provenance. It was demonstrated that the whole pyrolysis products play a significant role in identifying the vegetal species. The chemotaxonomic value of homologous series of alkanes, alkenes and benzene derivatives, rarely explored until now, was assessed. It was shown that the combination of data related to five distinct groups of pyrolytic markers (composition and/or distribution of alkanes, alkenes and benzene, alkenyl-, alkylcatechol and phenol derivatives) provided new strong criteria to establish vegetal origin and provenance of Asian artworks, even though they have been largely altered over time. Case studies of archaeological <b>Chinese</b> <b>lacquered</b> artefacts and Japanese Buddhistic altar were thereafter successfully investigated to address informative potential and efficiency of these criteria on ancient and degraded lacquer coatings.
