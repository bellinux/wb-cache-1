Back in the 1970 s, logic models first began to attract atten-tion [...] . {{and they continue to}} hold our attention today, providing us with the framework to plan and fund (!) powerful programs that produce powerful results. A logic model is like a carefully crafted curriculum. Everything con-nects. A thread runs through it that links everything, explaining what and why in no uncertain terms. Everything that comes makes sense based on what came before. In terms of program planning, you know exactly where you’re going because you know precisely where you’ve been and what’s <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> <b>on</b> the horizon. It’s the “yellow brick road ” of quality program/interven-tion planning, except that it makes the road map from Kansas to Oz crystal clear to you and all whom you involve in its development and use. The “wizards ” who helped us with this tool include the wonderful people at the University of Wiscon-sin Extension who designed and put online the self-study course “En-hancing Program Performance wit...|$|E

A team could also start the game with the intention of playing small ball but then change from this strategy at some point during a game, depending on circumstances, such as when the opposing pitcher is struggling or has left the game or when the team is ahead or behind by several runs.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} Sunday (19 September) was {{the first}} North West derby of the season, with Liverpool travelling to Old Trafford to face Manchester United. Two goals from Dimitar Berbatov, including a bicycle kick, saw United go into a 2-0 cushion with half an hour left, when Fernando Torres won a penalty, being pulled down by Nemanja Vidić. With Gerrard scoring from the spot, Liverpool's hopes were reinvigorated, and when Torres was pulled down outside the box, Gerrard took the free kick with great precision, drawing Liverpool level, kissing the TV camera in celebration. The Liverpool joy was short-lived, as Berbatov scored his third goal from a header less than ten minutes from time. This meant Liverpool had only five points from five games, but with two home matches against unfancied sides <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next.</b>|$|R

50|$|Tahitian {{drumming}} compositions {{are composed}} of single rhythmic phrases that Tahitians call pehe. There are three parts of a pehe, each serving a different purpose. The first segment, fa’atomora’a, is an introductory phrase. It is a quick snippet that is played to announce which pehe it will be. It does this with rhythm and by being played on a certain instrument. Additionally, it also announces {{if there is any}} potential change to the program order at that time. The second segment of the pehe is the main rhythm pattern. The last part is the toma, which is the ending pattern. There are varieties of patterns to choose from and the choice determines the appropriate movement for the dancers and the number of pulses to expect before quickly ending the piece. Some pehe are used as fillers and transition periods without any choreography, but they still cue the dancers for what is <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Māori Television, the Maori Language channel.

There was also a documentary, funded at around $2 million by the government, about the Maori history of New Zealand. The money was obviously used for other purposes as the show was filmed with plastic toys on a New Zealand map at Aunty Donna's place (a possible reference to Donna Awatere Huata) in five or so minutes. The show parodied the recent debate over whether or not the Maori people were the first to New Zealand by stating, [...] "…there were some natives here before that, but a giant shark came and ate them". The 'giant shark' excuse was also used about the death of the native birds in New Zealand, such as the Moa and Giant Eagle which were hunted to extinction by Maori.|$|R

2500|$|Maddux {{has been}} {{credited}} {{by many of}} his teammates with a superior ability to outthink his opponents and anticipate results. Braves catcher Eddie Pérez {{tells the story of}} Maddux intentionally allowing a home run to the Astros's Jeff Bagwell, in anticipation of facing Bagwell in the playoffs months later. Maddux felt Bagwell would instinctively be looking for the same pitch again, which Maddux would then refuse to throw. On another occasion while sitting on the bench, Maddux once told his teammates, [...] "Watch this, we might need to call an ambulance for the first base coach." [...] The batter, Los Angeles' José Hernández, drove the next pitch into the chest of the Dodgers' first base coach. Maddux had noticed that Hernández, who'd been pitched inside by Braves pitching during the series, had shifted his batting stance slightly. On another occasion, a former teammate, outfielder Marquis Grissom, recalled a game in 1996 when Maddux was having trouble spotting his fastball. Between innings, he told Grissom, [...] "Gary Sheffield is <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> inning. I am going to throw him a slider and make him just miss it so he hits it to the warning track."

2500|$|Program {{managers}} {{identified the}} analysis and repairs that were required to safely launch the shuttle, and this analysis was reviewed at a special Program Requirements Control Board (PRCB) held on 24 November. Managers announced at that meeting that the launch window available in early December would be passed up, with a new target of 17 December set, but cautioned that the launch could slip into February 2011. After reviewing the space station's December traffic model following the realigned Johannes Kepler ATV's launch date, NASA had identified a potential launch window in mid-/late-December 2010. The 17 December 2010 date was preferred {{because it would have}} allowed the shuttle to carry more stored oxygen to the International Space Station to help it deal with oxygen generation issues, which the crew had dealt with for several months. [...] "What we've told the agency leadership is that clearly we're not ready for the 3 December to 7 December window that's <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>next</b> week," [...] John Shannon, NASA's SSP manager, said in a news conference held after the special PCRB.
