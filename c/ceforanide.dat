40|$|This {{investigation}} {{evaluated the}} effect of probenecid on <b>ceforanide</b> concentrations in eight healthy volunteers. Each volunteer was given 1 or 2 g of <b>ceforanide</b> either alone or with 1 g of probenecid. Concentrations of <b>ceforanide</b> in plasma, urine, and saliva were then measured. Probenecid did not alter the plasma concentrations of <b>ceforanide,</b> nor did it affect the urinary excretion of this agent. <b>Ceforanide</b> was not secreted into saliva in any detectable amount either when administered alone or with probenecid. It is not clear why probenecid has a negligible effect on <b>ceforanide</b> concentrations in plasma. It may be that tubular secretion plays less of {{a role in the}} excretion of <b>ceforanide</b> than expected, or that the physical properties of <b>ceforanide</b> prevent probenecid from affecting its excretion...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ceforanide</b> {{administered}} parenterally {{twice daily}} {{was used as}} the sole agent to treat 17 patients with right-sided endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus or nonenterococcal streptococci.

One patient was transferred to another hospital 4 days after <b>ceforanide</b> therapy was initiated, and the other was changed to a different antibiotic regimen when his viridans streptococcus proved tolerant to <b>ceforanide.</b> The intramuscular form of <b>ceforanide</b> was well tolerated. It was stopped in two patients after week 3 of therapy because of adverse effects, possibly related to the study drug. These findings resolved with discontinuation of the <b>ceforanide,</b> and no additional antimicrobial therapy was necessary.

40|$|<b>Ceforanide</b> (BL-S 786 R) is a new, broad-spectrum, {{parenteral}} cephalosporin. Pharmacokinetic properties {{were determined}} in rats (100 mg/kg), rabbits (30 mg/kg), dogs (25 mg/kg), and humans (2 g or 30 mg/kg) and compared with equivalent single doses of cefazolin. Plasma half-lives for <b>ceforanide</b> and cefazolin were 1. 1 and 0. 5 h in the rat, 5 and 0. 3 h in the rabbit, 1 and 0. 8 h in the dog, and 2. 6 and 2 h in humans, respectively. The slower elimination of <b>ceforanide,</b> as reflected by longer plasma half-life, larger area under the curve, and peak plasma concentrations, {{was due to}} slower body and renal clearances. The apparent volumes of distribution of <b>ceforanide</b> and cefazolin were comparable. Rats, dogs, and humans excreted 80 to 100 % of the <b>ceforanide</b> dose in the 0 - to 24 -h urine; rabbits excreted only 50 %. Tubular secretion constituted 50 % of <b>ceforanide</b> renal excretion in rabbits, dogs, and humans and 90 % in rats; the remainder was excreted by glomerular filtration. There was no apparent correlation between the extent of tubular secretion and degree of plasma protein binding in different species. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between <b>ceforanide</b> and amikacin in the rat.

40|$|Twice-daily {{intramuscular}} <b>ceforanide</b> therapy of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis in parenteral {{drug abusers}} was compared in a randomized prospective trial with intravenous cephapirin therapy. Dosage regimens were <b>ceforanide,</b> 1 g every 12 h, and cephapirin, 2 g every 4 h. Mean minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of <b>ceforanide</b> for S. aureus treated with <b>ceforanide</b> were 0. 78 and 1. 56 microgram/ml compared to cephapirin for patient isolates of 0. 08 and 0. 14 microgram/ml, respectively. Serum killing levels with <b>ceforanide</b> were 1 : 5. 7 and 1 : 1. 5 at peak and trough levels, compared to 1 : 134 (peak) and 1 : 4. 2 (trough) with cephapirin. Despite this apparent in vitro advantage of cephapirin, patients treated with <b>ceforanide</b> did {{as well as}} those with cephapirin. Of 16 ceforanide-treated patients, all responded initially to therapy, and 15 were cured with 28 days of therapy. One patient relapsed at the end of therapy. Of 16 cephapirin-treated patients, 1 was a clinical and microbiological failure, and 3 other relapsed at the end of therapy. In addition, one ceforanide-treated patient and two cephapirin-treated patients developed central nervous system abscesses. These were cured with drainage and continuation of antibiotic therapy. <b>Ceforanide</b> was well tolerated by the intramuscular route. Cost analysis suggests that therapy with intramuscular <b>ceforanide</b> would result in an approximate 70 % decrease in drug therapy cost when compared to intravenous cephapirin. <b>Ceforanide</b> appears to be a safe, efficacious, convenient, and relatively inexpensive drug for treating staphylococcal endocarditis in parenteral drug abusers...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{and protein}} binding of <b>ceforanide</b> were studied in 15 patients undergoing cholecystectomies. Each patient received <b>ceforanide</b> (20 mg/kg) intravenously on {{arrival in the}} operating room, after which serial blood samples were collected during the elimination phase for determination of total and free <b>ceforanide</b> concentrations in the serum. A high-pressure liquid chromatography assay was used, with a centrifugal filtration system for free-drug determinations. Serum concentration data for each individual were subjected to linear regression to determine the elimination rate constants (total and free drug), volumes of distribution, and systemic clearances. The mean elimination rate constants were 0. 41 and 0. 50 h- 1 for total and free <b>ceforanide,</b> respectively. The mean percentage of <b>ceforanide</b> bound to serum protein was 87. 9 %. The relationship of the free <b>ceforanide</b> concentration to the total concentration appeared to be linear. The data were fit to double-reciprocal and half-reciprocal relationships with good agreement, showing one binding site and an association constant range of 1. 6 X 10 (7) to 1. 9 X 10 (7) at these in vivo concentrations. The mean volume of distribution and mean systemic clearance of total drug were 100 ml/kg and 45. 9 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, respectively. <b>Ceforanide</b> consistently produced higher intraoperative total drug concentrations {{compared with those of}} cefazolin and cefoxitin from similar studies...|$|E
40|$|Doses of 30 mg of <b>ceforanide</b> or {{cefamandole}} per kg {{were administered}} intravenously to 26 patients just before their chests were opened for {{coronary artery bypass}} or cardiac valve replacement surgery. Samples of right atrial appendage, pericardial fluid, plasma, aortic wall, intercostal muscle, and sternum were obtained at different times after the antibiotic was injected, and these samples were assayed for cephalosporin concentration. For <b>ceforanide</b> the pre-bypass plasma half-life was 2. 5 h, and the atrial appendage half-life was 2. 1 h; for cefamandole the pre-bypass plasma half-life was 0. 75 h and the atrial appendage half-life was 0. 72 h. At 3 h the concentrations of <b>ceforanide</b> and cefamandole in atrial appendages were 28. 0 and 5. 0 micrograms/g, respectively. <b>Ceforanide</b> achieved higher and more sustained concentrations in other tissues than cefamandole.

40|$|<b>Ceforanide</b> {{is a new}} (parenteral) long-acting {{cephalosporin}} with antimicrobial activity {{comparable to}} those of other second-generation cephalosporins. In a randomized prospective study, patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia were treated with <b>ceforanide</b> at 0. 5 g every 12 h (28 cases) or with cefazolin at 1. 0 g every 8 h (26 cases). The study groups were comparable in clinical and laboratory findings, including etiological diagnosis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from the sputum of 38 patients, of whom 8 (21 %) were bacteremic. Mean peak and trough serum levels of <b>ceforanide</b> drawn 1 and 11. 5 h after the 0. 5 -g intravenous dose were 39. 6 and 2. 5 microgram/ml, respectively. Of the 50 patients evaluable for efficacy, all responded clinically with no serious adverse reactions. In spite of clinical improvement and in vitro susceptibility, Haemophilus influenzae persisted in the sputum of five of the eight cefazolin-treated patients and four of the five patients treated with <b>ceforanide.</b> <b>Ceforanide</b> appears to be as safe and effective as cefazolin for the therapy of pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae, but neither drug was effective in clearing H. influenzae from the sputum...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of intramuscular <b>ceforanide</b> in 46 infants, children, and adolescents, {{ranging in age}} from 1 month to 17 years. After the subjects were given 20 -mg doses of <b>ceforanide</b> per kg, the mean peak plasma concentration was 56. 3 microgram/ml (range, 27. 0 to 95. 0), the mean 8 -h level was 5. 9 microgram/ml (range, 1. 5 to 13. 5), and the mean 12 -h level was 1. 5 microgram/ml (range, 0. 2 to 4. 2). <b>Ceforanide</b> half-life varied with the ages of the patients: in 1 - to 2 -year-old children, in half-life was significantly shorter (1. 5 h) than in younger or older children. Plasma concentrations at 8 and 12 h after a dose were lowest in 1 - to 2 -year-old children. There was no relationship between the area under the curve, the volume of distribution, or the body clearance of <b>ceforanide</b> to the ages of the patients. Within 6 h of administration of the drug, a mean of 77. 5 % of a dose was excreted in urine, {{and at the end of}} 12 h, virtually all (93. 9 %) of the administered dose was recovered in urine samples. The administration of <b>ceforanide</b> every 12 h did not result in drug accumulation. A dose of 20 mg of <b>ceforanide</b> per kg every 12 h is recommended for most pediatric patients.

40|$|<b>Ceforanide</b> {{levels in}} plasma, {{gallbladder}} bile, gallbladder tissue, and {{common bile duct}} were studied in 10 patients with normal biliary tracts and in 35 patients with biliary disease at various intervals after intravenous injection of 1 g of the drug. Peak blood levels were obtained within 1 h of administration (mean, 67 +/- 15 micrograms/ml). Patients with a normal bilary tract, as well as patients with chronic cholecystitis and a patent cystic duct, achieved high gallbladder bile levels of <b>ceforanide</b> within 2 h (mean, 76 +/- 25 micrograms/ml) and attained even higher levels by 4 h (mean, 182 +/- 51 micrograms/ml). However, all patients with chronic cholecystitis and an occluded cystic duct had very low drug concentrations in the gallbladder bile (14 +/- 7 micrograms/ml at 2 h). Despite this difference in gallbladder bile levels, <b>ceforanide</b> levels of 21 +/- 3 micrograms/g were achieved at 1 to 3 h in gallbladder tissue in both groups with chronic cholecystitis. The concentration of <b>ceforanide</b> in common bile duct was 149 +/- 59 micrograms/ml at 2 h after administration, with levels over 60 micrograms/ml present from 1 to 4 h after administration. These results indicate that <b>ceforanide</b> reaches high levels in the biliary tract. Its potential value in the prevention and treatment of biliary infections should be assessed...|$|E
40|$|The {{comparative}} {{tissue distribution}} of <b>ceforanide,</b> cefazolin, and cefamandole was determined in rats after subcutaneous doses of 100 mg/kg. <b>Ceforanide</b> had the longest plasma half-life, 0. 9 h, versus 0. 5 h for cefazolin and 0. 4 h for cefamandole, {{and the highest}} area under the plasma concentration time curve, 324 micrograms x h per ml, versus 184 micrograms x h per ml for cefazolin and 42 micrograms x h per ml for cefamandole. The peak plasma concentrations of <b>ceforanide</b> and cefazolin were 173 and 140 micrograms/ml, respectively, and were threefold {{higher than that of}} cefamandole (49 micrograms/ml). Measureable concentrations of the three compounds were found in the liver, kidneys, lungs, submaxillary glands, cervical lymph nodes, bones, heart, abdominal muscles, eyes, and testes, with cefamandole levels being generally lower and more variable. The peak tissue levels of <b>ceforanide</b> and cefazolin were comparable, within the limit of data variation, and were considerably higher than that of cefamandole.

The serum concentration of BL-S 786, after repeated doses, did not demonstrate accumulation of the drug. About 27 to 36 % of the administered dose was excreted unaltered in the urine, within 3 hr of a single parenteral dose. Urine concentration exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration for 90 - 100 % of the common Gram-negative urinary pathogens, 12 hr after the administered dose...|$|E
40|$|HR 756, a new {{parenteral}} cephalosporin that is beta-lactamase resistant, {{was tested}} against 271 bacterial isolates. Both agar and broth dilution testing were employed, using two media and two inoculum sizes of bacteria. Antibacterial {{activity of the}} drug was {{compared to that of}} cefamandole (CFM) and <b>ceforanide</b> (CFN). In agar, HR 756 was more active than CFM and CFN against all bacteria tested except isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, which were better inhibited by CFM. HR 756 exhibited some antipseudomonas activity in agar, although a marked inoculum effect was apparent. A comparison of median minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations in broth showed again that HR 756 was the most active of these three drugs. HR 756 demonstrated enhanced antibacterial activity compared to CFM and CFN against bacteria sensitive to all three drugs as well as against more resistant isolates of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter species, and indole-positive Proteus. As with other cephalosporins, results for most bacteria were affected by inoculum size, medium, and type of dilution test employed in in vitro studies...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the in vitro synergistic activity at clinically attainable concentrations of combinations of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam antibiotics against 30 gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli. All 56 pairs of 4 aminoglycosides and 14 beta-lactams were evaluated. Combinations with amikacin demonstrated inhibitory synergistic activity in 29 % of the assays, {{as compared with}} 22 % for netilmicin (P = 0. 018), 17 % for gentamicin (P less than 0. 001), and 13 % for tobramycin (P less than 0. 001). Among the beta-lactams, combinations with cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, or cefpiramide (SM- 1652) demonstrated inhibitory synergistic activity most often (39, 38, and 35 % of the assays, respectively) and with <b>ceforanide,</b> cefsulodin, and imipenem least often (less {{than or equal to}} 8 % each). The most active combination was amikacin and ceftriaxone, with which 67 % of the assays demonstrated inhibitory synergism. Isolates with high-level resistance to either antibiotic in a combination were unlikely to be inhibited synergistically by the combination. Further, combinations generally demonstrated little synergistic activity against isolates highly susceptible to beta-lactams...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of chloramphenicol, ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefamandole, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, <b>ceforanide,</b> and moxalactam for 100 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 25 of which produced beta-lactamase. Susceptibility was not {{influenced by the}} capsular characteristic of the organism. The mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole, ticarcillin, and ampicillin for beta-lactamase-producing strains were 3 -, 120 -, and 400 -fold higher than their respective mean minimal inhibitory concentrations for beta-lactamase-negative strains. No such difference was noted for the other antibiotics. We performed time-kill curve studies, using chloramphenicol, ampicillin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, and moxalactam with two concentrations of the antimicrobial agents (4 or 20 times the minimal inhibitory concentrations) and two inoculum sizes (10 (4) or 10 (6) colony-forming units per ml). The inoculum size had no appreciable effect on the rate of killing of beta-lactamase-negative strains. The rates at which beta-lactamase-producing strains were killed by chloramphenicol, cefotaxime, and moxalactam was not influenced by the inoculum size. Whereas cefamandole in high concentrations was able to kill at 10 (6) colony-forming units/ml of inoculum, it had only a temporary inhibiting effect at low drug concentrations. Methicillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor CP- 45, 899 were able to neutralize the inactivation of cefamandole by a large inoculum of beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{pharmacokinetics}} of extracellular solutes {{is determined}} by the blood-tissue exchange kinetics and the volume of distribution in the interstitial space in the different organs. This information can be used to develop a general physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model applicable to most extracellular solutes. Methods The human pharmacokinetic literature was surveyed to tabulate the steady state and equilibrium volume of distribution of the solutes mannitol, EDTA, morphine- 6 -glucuronide, morphine- 3 -glucuronide, inulin and Î²-lactam antibiotics with a range of protein binding (amoxicillin, piperacillin, cefatrizine, <b>ceforanide,</b> flucloxacillin, dicloxacillin). A PBPK data set was developed for extracellular solutes based on the literature for interstitial organ volumes. The program PKQuest was used to generate the PBPK model predictions. The pharmacokinetics of the protein (albumin) bound Î²-lactam antibiotics were characterized by two parameters: 1) the free fraction of the solute in plasma; 2) the interstitial albumin concentration. A new approach to estimating the capillary permeability is described, based on the pharmacokinetics of the highly protein bound antibiotics. Results About 42 % of the total body water is extracellular. There is a large variation in the organ distribution of this water â varying from about 13 % of total tissue water for skeletal muscle, up to 70 % for skin and connective tissue. The weakly bound antibiotics have flow limited capillary-tissue exchange kinetics. The highly protein bound antibiotics have a significant capillary permeability limitation. The experimental pharmacokinetics of the 11 solutes is well described using the new PBPK data set and PKQuest. Conclusions Only one adjustable parameter (systemic clearance) is required to completely characterize the PBPK for these extracellular solutes. Knowledge of just this systemic clearance allows one to predict the complete time course of the absolute drug concentrations in the major organs. PKQuest is freely available [URL]. </p...|$|E
