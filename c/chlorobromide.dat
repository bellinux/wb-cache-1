40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} than materials which tightly adsorb on sliver halide lattices will attach themselves preferentially at certain points, usually {{referred to as}} activity sites, which have areas {{of only a few}} percent of I the total crystal surface. An experiment using the mechanism of Photosolubilization as revealed by R. K. Blake and others of the E. I. DuPont de nemours Research Laboratories measureing the clearing rate of a <b>chlorobromide</b> emulsion doped with 2 -mercapto- 4 -phenylthiazole indicates that the fixing rate is substantially modified by very small concentrations of this compound, and that the rate remains essentially constant over quite a wide range of concentrations with sharp breaks at what are believed to be of the order of one or two percent coverage and complete coverage of the 2 crystal surface...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} reported that the speed and contrast of a given film-developer combination {{is influenced by the}} addition of PEO to either the developer or to the emulsion. Factorial experiments were conducted upon Ag(Brl) and Ag(BrCl) films to determine the PEO development effects on hydroquinone and N-methyl-p-aminophenol developers of normal sulfite level. Various levels of exposure, bromide concentration, and PEO addition to the developer were employed to gain information about possible interactions as well as individual effects. Density-log time of development curves were obtained using the method of arrested development. Response variables were induction period and maximum rate of post-IP development. The PEO effect upon the induction period was qualitatively similar for both the bromoiodide and <b>chlorobromide</b> films, but depended upon the developing agent [...] the induction period increased with hydroquinone, but remained unchanged with N-methyl-p-aminophenol. The rate depended upon the silver halide grain composition [...] an increase was observed only when Agl was present. PEO addition had no influence upon the covering power. As the bromide level increased, the induction period increased and rate decreased. As the exposure level increased, induction period decreased and rate increased. A significant bromide-PEO interaction was observed only for the induction period of hydroquinone development for both films...|$|E

" 1374 -p-Amincdiethylaniline MonoHydrochloride; layers, contro[ilg] diffusion of processing solutions, reversal method[ilg] the delicacy [ilg] the operation means {{that only the}} [ilg]rge organization can offord the necessary scientific controls., Dye coupling development [must] be devided into two main classes called prima[ry] and secondary. Primary [ilg] development was [first] used for [itself by Homolk[ilg]n 1907. He wanted [to] find developing agents whose oxidation products [ilg]re themselves insoluble and preferably colored. The [ilg] commonly known agent of such a type is of cou[ilg] pyro. A pyro develope[d] image shows the character[istic] brownish stain, and even after the silver has been removed by bleaching the stain image is very evident. The qualitity of sulfite in the pyro developer, as is [w]ell known, cont[ilg]s the amount of stain obtained. There are several other primary developing agents [s]ome even giving colored images that might be [u]sed in color photography where the spectral hues [req]uired are quite specific., Secondary color development is of most [ilg]rest at the [p]resent time because of its [ilg] rang[e] of color and control. Fischer and [ilg]ist published the first material on secondary [ilg] or development in 1914 and additions to the s[ilg] have been rapidly increasing for the last t[ilg] years. A large number of color formers are k[ilg] which couple in a manner still under disc[uss]ion. (although the present explanation is that t[h]e developer's oxidation product couples when it is formed with a color former to yield {{a more or less}} insoluble dye). Thus is secondary coupling we use not the oxidation product of the develop[ment] alone but compounds that unite with it and g[ilg] brightly colored dyes. The majority of the early d[y]e images w[ilg] of the indoaniline, indamine and indophenol group, although as the list has grown rapidly in rece[nt] years many new types have been used. The latest [c]onvenient summary of known couplers was published by Tull. T[he] dyes must of course be relatively [i]nsoluble after [ilg]mation, and for practical purposes fairly [ilg]st to lig[ilg] and of the proper hue., The actual application of dye coupling to m[ono]chrome photography has been oddly enough, rather rare. The research that ha[s] been done on dye couplers has generally been carries on with the idea of using the results in direct color photography. In view of the infinite variety of hues that may be obtained and the simplicity of their production, the use of single or multiple black and white prints should be interested in the making of monochrome prints or transparencies. An understanding of the procedure is also helpful in considering the more complicated applications of the same ideas in the color photography of today and the near future, The production of dye-coupled monochrome prints necessitates the same steps as are used in making a normal black and white print. The prints are exposed, developed, rinsed, fixed, washed and dried. The color of the final image will depend chiefly on the composition of the developing solution. If desired, completed black and white prints can be bleached and redeveloped to obtain similar results although the results obtained {{do not seem to be}} of as high quality in such prints as in those directly developed in [ilg] special developers. The emulsions useable for d[ye] coupling development are quite numerous al[th]ough some chlorides and <b>chlorobromides</b> do not work al all except by redevelopment. These papers make the dye form in the developing solution even before actual silver development is evident. Most of the common enlarging papers such as Kodabrom, Velous Black, Brovira, etc. work very well as do the transparency materials from the same manufacturers. The exposure of any of these sensitive emultions is approximately the same as that used when making a black and white print., The mixing of the developer solution probably offers the greatest deviation from normal procedure. The working solution is made up from tex parts of a fairly normal developer with one part of a color former or mixture of color formers. The developer solution is composed of, Sodium sulfite 18 grams, Sodium carbonate 40 grams, Potassium bromide 1 grams, Developing agent 0. 5 - 2. 0 grams, Water to make 1 liter, The composition of this developer for monochrome work is not as critical as for three color work. The quantities of sulfite or carbonate may be varied within reasonable limited but the quantity of developing agent does not have considerable effect on the result. As the quantity of developing agent increases, the strength and contrast of the image increases until there is considerable gerneral stain produced.
