50|$|The {{yield of}} rimmed and <b>capped</b> <b>steel</b> is {{slightly}} better than that of semi-killed steel. These types of steels are commonly used for sheet and strip metal because of their excellent surface condition. It is also used in most cold-working applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Capped</b> <b>steel</b> {{starts as}} rimmed steel but part {{way through the}} {{solidification}} the ingot is capped. This {{can be done by}} literally covering the ingot mold or by adding a deoxidizing agent. The top of the ingot then forms into a solid layer of steel, but the rim {{of the rest of the}} ingot is thinner than in a rimmed steel. Also there is less segregation of impurities.|$|E

(see Fig.  2). In order to let shrinkage deformation of the concrete occur without restraint during curing, the <b>steel</b> <b>cap</b> was not installed for 2  days before the sustained loading. After the <b>steel</b> <b>cap</b> was placed, the gap between the <b>steel</b> <b>cap</b> and the concrete surface of the columns was filled with high-strength epoxy mortar (see Fig.  2). The epoxy mortar was hardened for 2  days.|$|R
5000|$|Staking a claim {{involves}} {{first the}} discovery of a valuable mineral in quantities that a [...] "prudent man" [...] (the Prudent Man Rule) would invest time and expenses to recover. Next, marking the claim boundaries, typically with wooden posts or <b>capped</b> <b>steel</b> posts, which must be four feet tall, or stone cairns, which must be three feet tall.

40|$|Many {{organizations}} seek {{to alleviate}} {{poverty in the}} developing world. One organization in particular strives to improve the livelihood of people in poverty through the technical development of and training in bamboo and rattan enterprises, the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR). A team in the Spring 2008 D-Lab: Design class has been collaborating with members of INBAR located in India to develop the processes and tools necessary to make pencils from bamboo, rather than wood. The communities that launch this enterprise will need to outsource the glue and graphite leads required to complete the pencils. Waste is generated by cutting processes used to dimension the bamboo to appropriate pencil size and from {{the parts of the}} bamboo stalk that cannot be used in pencils, the nodes. If this bamboo waste is carbonized to charcoal, it can be made into pencil leads, eliminating the need for communities to purchase graphite leads from an external source. Manufacturing pencil leads from bamboo waste could raise the profit generated by the enterprise, create more jobs, and help to alleviate poverty in regions of the world where it is widespread. This thesis presents factors affecting the feasibility of using graphite pencil lead manufacturing processes to make bamboo charcoal pencil leads using clay as a binder. The feasibility is determined by modeling industrial-scale graphite pencil lead manufacturing techniques with small-scale methods that are replicable in a developing country and then comparing the resulting charcoal lead performance to graphite lead performance qualities, including the ability of the lead to write smoothly on paper and its ability to be erased. Experimentation conducted found that vitrification of the charcoal leads is possible at kiln temperatures in excess of 1250 °C and that a sufficiently reducing environment could be simulated using a <b>capped</b> <b>steel</b> nipple. However, a higher performance lead that makes marks comparable to a graphite pencil lead can be attained by simply heat-drying or sintering the charcoal pencil leads and coating them in wax. by Nadia S.

In the same time, the Empresa Nacional del Petróleo (ENAP) oil state company was created, as well as ENDESA electricity company, the Compañía de Acero del Pacífico (<b>CAP)</b> <b>steel</b> holding and the Industria Azucarera Nacional (IANSA) sugar company.
