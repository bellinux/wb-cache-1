Technical advances {{now offer}} scope economies between video and telephony services while regulatory initiatives have removed many legal barriers separating the two industries. Together with favorable market conditions, these developments make cable telephony a lucrative opportunity {{at a time}} when video markets have come under attack from several new competitors. To predict whether this opportunity is exploited through direct entry, acquisition or joint venture, we assess the strategic merits of each entry mode. Key strategic factors include whether the cable operator can make credible and effective threats to follow an alternative entry path, {{and the extent to which}} incumbent providers have made sunk investments. We conclude by examining some implications of policies toward entry mode choice and find they may have unintended consequences, such as when a ban on acquisition results in uneconomi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods are}} {{presented}} that use existing local bathymetric data {{to determine the}} position of the sidescan sonar towfish during surveys. In the absence of direct measurements of towfish position as survey work is underway, later determination of this position by other means is necessary to obtain accurately geo-referenced seabed imagery from the sonar data. The methods investigated rely on either large objects in the sonar field of view or the profile of the total water depth along the towfish survey track. Results of the analysis are compared with independent estimates derived from ship geometry and logbook <b>cable</b> length <b>entries</b> and from short-baseline acoustic tracking system measurements of the range to the towfish.

Predicted entry probabilities are included in a supply-demand model to permit empirical investigation {{of the effect of}} potential competition on incumbent cable operator’s price and channel programming decisions. Estimation results show incumbents offer more channels to consumers in markets facing greater potential competition from broadband service provider (BSP) wireline overbuilders and/or incumbent local exchange carriers. In particular, when the probability of entry rises to about 42   the average cable system provides six more channels, and price per channel declines from US$ 0. 77 to US$ 0. 66.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} direct broadcast satellites (DBS) as {{a competitor}} to cable. We first estimate a structural consumer level demand system for satellite, basic cable, premium cable and local antenna using micro data on almost 30, 000 households in 317 markets, including extensive controls for unobserved product quality {{and allowing the}} distribution of unobserved tastes to follow a fully flexible multivariate normal distribution. The estimated elasticity of expanded basic is about - 1. 5, with the demand for premium cable and DBS more elastic. The results identify strong correlations in the taste for different products not captured in conventional logit models. Estimates of the supply response of cable suggest that without DBS <b>entry</b> <b>cable</b> prices would be about 15 percent higher and cable quality would fall. We find a welfare gain of between $ 127 and $ 190 per year (aggregate $ 2. 5 billion) for satellite buyers, and about $ 50 (aggregate $ 3 billion) for cable subscribers.

40|$|Cable {{supports}} offer {{several advantages}} over traditional secondary support methods by enhancing stress redistribution to pillars and gob areas, minimizing or eliminating timbers and cribs that reduce ventilation, eradicating material-handling injuries related to placement of crib supports, {{and providing a}} cost-effective alternative to secondary support. The U. S. Bureau of Mines, in researching alternatives to traditional roof support methods, designed and installed high-strength cable supports to improve the stability of longwall gate road and bleeder entries in a Western U. S. coal mine. With the cooperation of industry, methods were developed to install cable supports in a tailgate and bleeder entry test area using traditional resin cartridges. Resin-grouted cable bolts were also installed and evaluated in additional longwall gate road and bleeder entry systems at the study mine. The cable-bolted areas successfully maintained roof support throughout the tailgate and bleeder <b>entries.</b> <b>Cable</b> supports replaced wood cribbing as secondary support in the bleeder entry system and minimized the use of cribbing in the longwall tailgate entries. This report describes the theory, application, and advantages of cable supports and presents mine measurements made to assess the cable performance during the retreat process of longwall mining...|$|R
50|$|Since <b>cable</b> <b>entry</b> {{systems are}} {{utilised}} {{in many different}} applications, {{it is very important}} to comply with standards like e.g. IP rating (according to EN 60529), UL recognition, DNV-GL listing (for marine applications), national or European railway standards or ATEX certifications that enable use in potentially explosive atmospheres.|$|E
50|$|For routing cables {{which are}} already {{assembled}} with connectors, split <b>cable</b> <b>entry</b> {{systems have been}} developed. The divisibility of these systems provides two advantages. The warranty on pre-terminated cables remains since the connectors don’t have to be cut and soldered again after entering the cables. The other advantage is that assembly can be done subsequently because the split cable entries are usually built around the existing lines.Most split cable entries consist of a split hard frame, made of plastic or sometimes aluminium (e.g. utilised in food industry) and one or several split sealing grommets, usually made of elastomer. The grommet matching the cable diameter is placed around the cable and fixed inside the <b>cable</b> <b>entry</b> frame. Thus allowing strain relief for the cables (in some cases according to EN 50262) as well as ingress protection of up to IP 65/66/67.|$|E
50|$|From the 50s on, {{machines}} and switch cabinets were {{more and more}} wired by using heavy-duty industrial connectors but the increasing cost pressure forced engineers to look for more cost-effective solutions and to decrease the risk of miswiring.

50|$|Heat-shrink tubing (or, commonly, {{heat shrink}} or heatshrink) is a {{shrinkable}} plastic tube used to insulate wires, providing abrasion resistance {{and environmental protection}} for stranded and solid wire conductors, connections, joints and terminals in electrical work. It {{can also be used}} to repair the insulation on wires or to bundle them together, to protect wires or small parts from minor abrasion, and to create <b>cable</b> <b>entry</b> seals, offering environmental sealing protection. Heat-shrink tubing is ordinarily made of nylon or polyolefin, which shrinks radially (but not longitudinally) when heated, to between one-half and one-sixth of its diameter.|$|E
50|$|Hermetic vs. Water-Proof vs. Water-Resistant {{refers to}} the {{coupling}} seal between the contacts, connector insert and body. A true hermetic connector provides an airtight seal and can support and maintain positive pressure or a vacuum. Waterproof connectors prevent liquid ingress when immersed {{using a variety of}} methods (e.g., molding, potting and encapsulating) to prevent water intrusion at high hydrostatic pressures. Water resistant implies that a coupled connector will prevent water ingress that can lead to shorting in shallow standing water or rain. Typically this is achieved by inserting rubber gaskets and compression seals at the contract region {{as well as at the}} <b>cable</b> <b>entry.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although the {{individual}} parts for cable assembly can be acquired, ready-made cables for both brakes and shifting are available. These usually consist of an inner wire within {{a length of}} housing, and depending on their purpose, {{with one or more}} end caps fitted. However, because of the wide range of fittings in use, it is probable that these universal cables' caps, although suiting many situations, will not suit every purpose, as their name wrongly implies. The shortening of housings requires the use of a special hand tool, designed to make a square cut without closing the <b>cable</b> <b>entry.</b> The same tool is used to cut the internal steel cable. To avoid unraveling of the cable's wires during installation, manufacturers weld or crimp the ends.|$|E
