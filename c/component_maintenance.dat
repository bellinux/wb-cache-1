30|$|The TAP Maintenance & Engineering {{aircraft}} <b>components</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{shops are}} responsible for the maintenance and repair of aircraft components of fleets. They perform maintenance on thousands of different aircraft accessories. Annually thousands of components are repaired, tested or modified, such as navigation instruments, displays, valves, heat exchangers, generators, oxygen masks and life vests. Also, for each unit there are distinct types of maintenance, such as overhaul, repair, inspection and testing.|$|R

40|$|AbstractInadequate {{and delayed}} {{maintenance}} of roads leads to road accidents. Several <b>maintenance</b> <b>components</b> like poor surface condition (big pothole etc.), improper traffic signs and marking, poor lighting etc. affects road safety. However, road maintenance is generally limited to improving carriageway surface condition like filling pothole etc. without replacing missing traffic signs, road marking and other safety features essential for creating a safe road network. Huge resources are required to maintain the road network in safe operating condition. Thus, Identification of critical <b>maintenance</b> <b>components</b> and their ill effects on road safety is {{the first and most}} important task of assessing the maintenance needs for improving road network safety. However, literature review indicated that limited studies are available on identification of ill effects of various <b>maintenance</b> <b>components</b> on road safety. Hence, this study presents how poor maintenance of various road components leads to road accident and also identifies effectiveness of various <b>maintenance</b> <b>components</b> in reducing road accidents. Further, a hierarchical structure is developed based on the identification of ill effect of poor maintenance on road safety and by considering inter-relationship between various <b>maintenance</b> <b>components</b> and sub-components. The study also presents a check list for <b>maintenance</b> <b>components</b> to be evaluated for assessing road safety hazardous conditions. It is expected that this study will be useful for assessing the maintenance needs and to assess the effectiveness of various <b>maintenance</b> <b>components</b> in safety improvement. Thus, the study is expected to be useful to justify the resource requirement for road safety improvement...|$|R

30|$|In {{aircraft}} <b>components</b> <b>maintenance</b> shops, <b>components</b> {{are distributed}} amongst repair {{groups and their}} respective technicians based {{on the type of}} repair, on the technicians skills and workload, and on the customer required dates. This distribution planning is typically done in an empirical manner based on the group leader’s past experience. Such a procedure does not provide any performance guarantees, leading frequently to undesirable delays on the delivery of the aircraft components. Among others, a fundamental challenge faced by the group leaders is to decide how to distribute the components that arrive without customer required dates.|$|R

The method of HVDC small signal modulation is applied to enhance the small signal stability of the system; the results are investigated based on the Prony method. The influences of <b>component</b> <b>maintenances</b> in the transmission corridors on the inter-area oscillations are further investigated, and some important conclusions are drawn...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a k-out-of-N system with identical, repairable <b>components.</b> <b>Maintenance</b> is initiated {{when the number}} of failed components exceeds some critical level. After a possible set-up time, all failed components are replaced by spares. A multi-server repair shop repairs the failed components. The system availability depends on the spare part stock level, the maintenance policy and the repair capacity. We present a mathematical model supporting the trade-off between these three parameters. We present both an exact and an approximate approach to analyse our model. In some numerical experiments, we provide insight on the impact of repair capacity, number of spares and preventive maintenance policy on the availability. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The relation of annual specific respiration rate to annual relative growth rate was fitted {{by a single}} straight line over all seedlings. From this relation, respiration was divided into two <b>components,</b> <b>maintenance</b> and growth respiration which were proportional to dry mass and its increment, respectively. Any seedlings consumed annually 391 % of the dry mass by maintenance respiration and 24 % of the dry mass increment by growth respiration. The ratio of growth respiration to total respiration, varying among seedlings, ranged from 3 to 13 % with the average of 8 %...|$|R

30|$|In “Assignment and {{scheduling}} problem” subsection we designed an algorithm to assign the components to the technicians {{within a single}} group, and we implemented it in Excel for a small example. Several limitations {{need to be addressed}} before the algorithm could be used by an aircraft <b>components</b> <b>maintenance</b> shop, such as our assumptions that a technician can only work on one part at once and that technicians do not rotate between work benches. We indicated how the algorithm could be extended {{to take into account the}} interactions between all the groups. This needs further development, however, and its implementation would be a major programming task. The assignment algorithm should be tested by comparing the assignments produced by our algorithm with those produced manually by team leaders.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, when the data has {{outliers}} {{or has a}} skewed or heavy-tailed distribution, which {{is the case of}} the typical data of the aircraft <b>components</b> <b>maintenance</b> shops, the values of the mentioned measures may be quite different and it is not always obvious which value to choose. In such cases, frequently we find that the mean is a poor measure of the typical value. The sample mean is usually quite above or below the wide majority of the data. This is a consequence of the extreme values in the tail that drag the value of the mean {{in the direction of the}} skewness. In these situations, the median (less sensitive to extreme values) is generally considered to be a better representative of the central location of the data.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust algorithm {{for the assessment}} of risk priority for medical equipment based on the calculation of static and dynamic risk factors and Kohnen Self Organization Maps (SOM). Four risk parameters have been calculated for 345 medical devices in two general hospitals in Baghdad. Static risk factor components (equipment function and physical risk) and dynamics risk <b>components</b> (<b>maintenance</b> requirements and risk points) have been calculated. These risk components are used as an input to the unsupervised Kohonen self organization maps. The accuracy of the network was found to be equal to 98 % for the proposed system. We conclude that the proposed model gives fast and accurate assessment for risk priority and it works as promising tool for risk factor assessment for the service departments in large hospitals in Iraq. <br /...|$|R
