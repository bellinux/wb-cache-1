5|$|PlayStation Underground was a {{non-traditional}} {{magazine that}} Sony Computer Entertainment America produced and published between Spring 1997 to Spring 2001. Subscribers received two PlayStation CDs, {{along with a}} booklet and colorful packaging every quarter. The CDs contained interviews, cheats, programmers moves, game demos and one-of-a-kind Memory Card saves. Several issues showed how a game was created from basic design to final product. Since the CDs could only be run on a PlayStation, it proved a useful marketing tool which spawned a line of PlayStation Underground JamPacks Demo CDs and which contained highlights from recent issues of PlayStation Underground, along with seemingly as many game demos that could be packed on a single CD. Unlike PlayStation Underground these were available in most stores for $4.95, were published twice a year in Summer and Winter and usually spotlighted newly released or <b>coming</b> <b>soon</b> games. By 2001, Sony had decided to phase out Underground {{to focus on the}} JamPacks with the release of the PlayStation 2. PlayStation Underground CDs are mainly in the hands of collectors these days.|$|E
