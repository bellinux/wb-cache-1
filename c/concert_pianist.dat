5|$|Hogg had {{previously}} suffered from mental health problems. In late 1918, she fell ill, probably from severe depression. She consulted with Dr. Francis Xavier Dercum, {{a specialist in}} the treatment of nervous and mental diseases, who treated her for the next three years. She was hospitalized for more than a year, and spent a further three years convalescing, primarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the summer of 1923 Hogg was fully recovered, but she permanently discarded her dream of being a <b>concert</b> <b>pianist,</b> ostensibly because of weakness after her illness.|$|E

A family friend introduced Davidson to horses, and he began attending Pony Club events. He bought, trained and sold horses until he found a championship horse in Irish Cap, the horse that took him to his first gold medal at the 1974 World Eventing Championship. Davidson went to college at Iowa State University with a veterinary major, but left in his third year to train with the United States Equestrian Team (USET).|$|E

5|$|Reger, who {{was born}} in Bavaria in 1873 and studied at the Wiesbaden Conservatory, worked as a <b>concert</b> <b>pianist</b> and composer. His work focused first on chamber music, Lied and choral music. After his studies he {{returned}} to his parental home in 1898 and concentrated on works for organ, continuing the tradition of Johann Sebastian Bach. Raised Catholic, he was still inspired by Lutheran hymns, writing chorale fantasias such as Zwei Choralphantasien, Op. 40, in 1899. He moved to Munich in 1901 and married in 1902 Elsa vonBercken, a divorced Protestant. In 1907, Reger was appointed professor at the Royal Conservatory in Leipzig. A year later he began the composition.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Sterndale Bennett (13 April 18161 February 1875) was an English composer, pianist, {{conductor}} {{and music}} educator. At {{the age of}} ten Bennett {{was admitted to the}} London Royal Academy of Music (RAM), where he remained for ten years. By the age of twenty, he had begun to make a reputation as a <b>concert</b> <b>pianist,</b> and his compositions received high praise. Among those impressed by Bennett was the German composer Felix Mendelssohn, who invited him to Leipzig. There Bennett became friendly with Robert Schumann, who shared Mendelssohn's admiration for his compositions. Bennett spent three winters composing and performing in Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three years, besides {{teaching}} piano to the Thun children, Smetana studied theory and composition under Proksch. The works he composed in these years include songs, dances, bagatelles, impromptus and the G minor Piano Sonata. In 1846 Smetana attended concerts given in Prague by Berlioz, and in all likelihood met the French composer at a reception arranged by Proksch. At the home of Count Thun he met Robert and Clara Schumann, and showed them his G minor sonata, but failed to win their approval for this work—they detected too much of Berlioz in it. Meanwhile, his friendship with Kateřina blossomed. In June 1847, on resigning his position in the Thun household, Smetana recommended her as his replacement. He then {{set out on a}} tour of Western Bohemia, hoping to establish a reputation as a <b>concert</b> <b>pianist.</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} various types of {{practice}} <b>concert</b> <b>pianists</b> utilize in preparation for performance. There are surprisingly few published documents which examine the highest levels of piano practice, and this study examines these scarce ideas in comparison with the newly collected material given by eight selected <b>concert</b> <b>pianists</b> regarding their practice methods, techniques and regimes. Keyboard practice techniques {{from the middle of the}} 19 th century until the present are examined and presented here. Some of the techniques are physical applications of how to practice the instrument, and others are mental preparations which suggest philosophical guidance toward physical practice or enhance performance capabilities. Advice from many famous (older) <b>concert</b> <b>pianists</b> regarding their practice is compared with the newer advice of the eight pianists selected for this study. The amalgamation of all the compiled suggestions should enlighten any pianist’s approach toward practice, and could also be a helpful compendium to any professors of piano who wish to offer a wider variety of practice methods to their students.

5|$|Soule {{was born}} in Keokuk, Iowa to a public school music teacher father and a graphic {{designer}} mother. He became interested in music and symphony orchestras {{at the age of}} five. Soule began taking piano lessons at an early age and became entranced with music, even writing music notation in the margins of his math homework; after his teachers and his father realized his talent, he began taking private lessons with professors from Western Illinois University when he was in sixth grade. He claims to have earned the equivalent of a master's degree in composition before completing high school, though, as he never enrolled in the school, he did not earn a degree. He was split between trying to become a <b>concert</b> <b>pianist</b> and a composer when he grew up; he ended up deciding to become a composer once he realized how difficult it would be to do both.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, she vacationed in Germany, {{and enjoyed}} her time {{so much that}} she chose to remain in Europe to {{continue}} her piano studies. For the next two years she studied music in Vienna under Franz Xaver Scharwenka, pianist to the court of Francis Joseph I of Austria, and in Berlin under Martin Krause. After returning from Europe, Hogg settled in Houston with her brother William. Although the city had a population of about 100,000, it had no museums or parks and no professional theater, music, or ballet groups. Hogg chose to teach music and continued in this vocation for the next nine years. One of her first pupils was Jacques Abram, who later became a <b>concert</b> <b>pianist.</b> By 1913, Hogg had become president of the Girls' Musical Society and was on the entertainment committee of the College Women's Club, which organized a small theater group known as the Green Mask Players. That year, she organized the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Hogg served as the vice-president of the Symphony Society when the first session of the Board of Directors convened. In 1917 the Board of Directors requested that she serve as president; she went on to serve 12terms.|$|E
5|$|Sargent as {{composer}} attracted favourable {{notice in}} a Prom season when other composer-conductors included Gustav Holst with his Planets suite, {{and the next}} year, Wood included a nocturne and scherzo by Sargent in the Proms programme, also conducted by the composer. Sargent was invited to conduct the Impression again in the 1923 season, {{but it was as}} a conductor that he made the greater impact. On the advice of Wood, among others, he soon abandoned composition in favour of conducting. He founded the amateur Leicester Symphony Orchestra in 1922, which he continued to conduct until 1939. Under Sargent, the orchestra's prestige grew until it was able to obtain such top-flight soloists as Alfred Cortot, Artur Schnabel, Solomon, Guilhermina Suggia and Benno Moiseiwitsch. Moiseiwitsch gave Sargent piano lessons without charge, judging him talented enough to make a successful career as a <b>concert</b> <b>pianist,</b> but Sargent chose a conducting career. At the instigation of Wood and Adrian Boult he became a lecturer at the Royal College of Music in London in 1923.|$|E
