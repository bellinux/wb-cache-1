In the present study, {{it was hypothesized}} that intertidal marshes contribute significantly to the <b>contaminant</b> <b>filter</b> function of estuaries. Trace metal concentrations and sediment characteristics were measured along a transect from the subtidal, over an intertidal flat and marsh to a restored marsh with controlled reduced tide. Metal concentrations in the intertidal and restored marsh were found to be a factor two to five higher than values in the subtidal and intertidal flat sediments. High metal concentrations and high accretion rates indicate a high metal accumulation capacity of the intertidal marshes. Overbank sedimentation in the tidal marshes of the entire estuary was calculated to remove 25 % to 50 % of the riverine metal influx, even though marshes comprise less than 8 % of the total surface of the estuary. In addition, the large-scale implementation of planned tidal marsh restoration projects was estimated to almost double the trace metal storage capacity of the present natural tidal marshes in the estuary...|$|E

40|$|AIM: Recent {{studies have}} shown the ocular surface to have {{significantly}} greater bacterial diversity using high-throughput sequencing. However, sequencing low microbial biomass samples (such as from the conjunctiva) {{has been shown to}} contain a disproportionate amount of contaminating sequences. How potential contaminations are being dealt with has not been rigorously addressed in the majority of ocular microbiome studies. The current study applied a statistical model to <b>filter</b> potential <b>contaminant</b> taxa in a 16 S rRNA gene sequencing study of the healthy ocular surface microbiome over time METHOD: Microbial DNA was extracted from conjunctival swabs of 45 subjects over three time points (baseline, 1 -month, 3 months) and paired-end 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Negative controls of blank swabs and nuclease-free water were used. Sequences were quality filtered (using Mothur), abundance filtered by removal of samples with insufficient sequences (< 10, 000) and removal of OTUs (operational taxonomic units) present at less than 0. 0001 % relative abundance. <b>Contaminant</b> <b>filtering</b> was performed as follows: a linear regression analysis was conducted using abundances of OTUs in the blank swab negative control as a predictor of the OTU abundances in the subject samples; the prediction standard error (SE) from the linear regression were used as a filter threshold, with the SE multiplied by five and the exponent calculated and the outliers of the regression that were in greater abundance in the participant samples retained; the linear regression filter was applied on the retained OTUs using the OTUs obtained from the nuclease-free water samples as the predictor following the steps outlined previously. The final retained OTUs were considered to be truly present in the participant samples and used in downstream statistical analysis. RESULTS: Prior to <b>contaminant</b> <b>filtering,</b> the highest relative abundance OTUs were Acetobacter and Aeribacillus. After abundance and quality filtering of 16 S rRNA sequencing data and application of a linear regression statistical model to <b>filter</b> <b>contaminant</b> taxa identified in negative controls, the number of taxa was reduced from 11, 894 to 183 OTUs on the conjunctiva which covered 8 phyla and 56 genera, with 17 genera possessing a relative abundance greater than 1 %. An average of 16 OTUs were observed on the ocular surface at each sampling time point and there was an average of 33 OTUs per subject across the three time points. The most prevalent and abundant OTU belonged to the genera Corynebacterium. No OTU was found in all participants at all times or in all participants in any one time but there were 26 OTUs present in at least one or more participants at all times. CONCLUSION: Application of a statistical model to <b>filter</b> <b>contaminant</b> taxa in ocular microbiome data shows the conjunctiva contains a lower diversity of microorganisms compared to previous ocular microbiome studies.

As adsorption will generally be greater towards the entrance of a filter, where the concentration of contaminant particles is higher, these effects can also result in a spatially varying porosity. We investigate this dynamic process using an extension of homogenization theory that accounts for a macroscale variation in microstructure. We formulate and homogenize the coupled problems of flow through a filter with a near-periodic time-dependent microstructure, solute transport due to advection, diffusion and filter adsorption, and filter structure evolution due to the adsorption of contaminant. We use the homogenized equations to investigate how the <b>contaminant</b> removal and <b>filter</b> lifespan depend on the initial porosity distribution for a unidirectional flow. We confirm a conjecture made by Dalwadi et al. (Proc. R. Soc. Lond.

In addition to removing particulate <b>contaminants,</b> <b>filters</b> accumulate a particle layer that can react with ozone. Ozone-particle cake reactions serve as a sink for ozone {{and a source of}} secondary carbonyls. The location of filters in air distribution systems can lead to byproducts being distributed throughout a building. Two experiments were performed to determine the ozone removal efficiency on two residential filters that were loaded with particles for one month (# 1) and three months (# 2). On both filters, the ozone removal efficiency dropped rapidly during the first 30 minutes and then stayed approximately constant for 4 hours. The steady state values of ozone removal efficiency were 10 % for Filter # 1 and 14 % for Filter # 2 at a face velocity of 0. 81 cm/s. The potential for HVAC filters to affect ozone concentrations in residential buildings was evaluated using a well-mixed reactor model. The tested filters reduced indoor ozone levels slightly when compared to indoor surfaces and an entire HVAC system, although the impact was much smaller than that of the air exchange rate. The influence of continuous particle deposition was not considered here, but would likely increase the impact of ozone interactions on HVAC filters...|$|R

One particular area of concern is ammonia, which, in addition to the normal spacecraft sources, can also be off-gassed by the amine-based sorbent. In the first half of 2009, tests were performed with typical cabin atmosphere levels of five of the most common trace gases, most of which had not yet been tested with this technology. A subscale sample of the sorbent was exposed to each of the chemicals mixed into a stream of moist, CO 2 -laden air, and the CO 2 adsorption capacity of the sorbent was compared before and after the exposure. After these typical-concentration chemicals were proven to have negligible effect on the subscale sample, tests proceeded on a full-scale test article in a sealed chamber with a suite of eleven contaminants.

The aim of LUCAS Soil Component {{was to create}} a harmonised and comparable dataset of physical and chemical parameters of topsoil at the EU. The LUCAS Topsoil Survey was extended to Bulgaria and Romania in 2012. Overall, ca. 22, 000 soil samples were collected and analysed. All samples were analysed for percentage of coarse fragments, particle-size distribution, pH, organic carbon, carbonates, phosphorous, total nitrogen, extractable potassium, cation exchange capacity, multispectral properties and heavy metals. In 2015, the Topsoil Survey was repeated in the same set of points of LUCAS 2009 / 2012 for monitoring changes in topsoil physical and chemical parameters across the EU. Furthermore, the topsoil survey was extended to Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Switzerland. Approximately 27, 000 samples we collected in 2015 and will be analysed over 2016 and 2017. Currently, the European Commission is working on the organization of the upcoming LUCAS Soil Surveys. This report is a proposal for analysing new physical, chemical and biological soil parameters within the forthcoming LUCAS Soil Surveys. Biological parameters, such as soil biodiversity, needs to be added to LUCAS Soil Surveys. Soil biological community supports food and biomass productivity, is a genetic pool for developing novel pharmaceuticals, and affects climate regulation.

40|$|Swine flu {{had already}} {{affected}} 13, 000 people in 48 countries {{within a month}} of its emergence in Mexico. The risk of disease transmission is augmented by the increasing mobility of people across the world. Nearly two billion people travel on commercial airliners each year. Therefore, knowledge about the transmission mechanism of viruses such as swine flu inside commercial airliner cabins would help to greatly reduce the spread of disease viruses. Previous investigations {{have suggested that the}} risk of in-flight disease transmission should remain within two rows of the contagious passenger. But during the SARS outbreak in 2003, passengers seated as far as seven rows from the contagious passenger became infected. Insufficient data and incomplete passenger manifestations make it difficult to ascertain the disease contaminant transmission mechanisms. Hence, the objective of this thesis was to study contaminant transmission inside airliner cabins using experimental measurements and computational tools. ^ A computationally efficient analytical model was first developed to help in understanding contaminant transmission along the length of an airliner cabin. The model could predict the effect of cabin air recirculation, the efficiency of HEPA <b>contaminant</b> <b>filters,</b> and the longitudinal airflow on the contaminant transmission characteristics in the cabin. This model, however, could not capture the effect of local airflows near the contaminant source that had a major impact on transmission. This effect was captured by coupling the analytical model with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for the region near the contaminant source. Furthermore, the applicability of the analytical model is limited as it assumed uniform supply airflow conditions. Experimental and CFD investigations showed that the supply airflow conditions can be highly non-uniform and can significantly influence contaminant transmission inside airliner cabins. For a correct prediction of contaminant transmission using computational tools such as CFD, the diffuser supplying air to the airliner cabin should be accurately modeled. ^ Further experimental and CFD investigations revealed that in-flight movement of passengers and crew members can change the airflow and contaminant transmission inside airliner cabins. Experiments were performed using a one-tenth scale, water-based empty cabin model to facilitate measurements and to generate high quality experimental data using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF). But the understanding of contaminant transmission gained from the empty smallscale cabin could not be extended to a full-scale cabin with seats and passengers as flow similarity is practically difficult to achieve. But the experimental data was used in testing the performance of a CFD model. The CFD model could capture the characteristic flow features and contaminant transport observed in the small-scale model and hence was used in examining the influence of movement on contaminant transmission in full-scale cabin mockups. The results indicate that seats and passengers tend to obstruct the lateral transmission of contaminants and restrict the spread to the aisle of the cabin if a contaminant is released from a moving body. Investigations showed that movement could be the reason behind the transmission of SARS contaminants to passengers seated as far as seven rows from the infected passenger during the SARS outbreak in 2003. ...|$|R

Slow sand filters (SSFs) {{have been used for}} hundreds of years to provide a safe and reliable source of potable drinking water, with minimal energy requirements. However, a lack of knowledge pertaining to the treatment mechanisms, particularly the biological processes, underpinning SSF operation, has meant SSFs are still operated as “black boxes”. This lack of knowledge pertaining to the underlying ecology and ecophysiology limits the design and optimisation of SSFs. This thesis represents the most comprehensive microbial community survey of full-scale SSFs to-date. Using traditional microbiological methods alongside up-to-date molecular techniques and extensive water quality analyses, specific taxa and community metrics are linked to changes in water quality production. Furthermore, it has been verified that laboratory scale SSFs can mimic the microbial community and water quality production of full-scale filters. This allowed rigorous experiments pertaining to operational differences, pathogen and novel contaminant removal to be performed. This has revealed, for the first time, that multiple trophic interactions within SSFs are integral to optimal performance. This thesis has shown that SSFs are phylogenetically and metabolically diverse systems capable of producing high quality water, with the ability to adapt to remove novel contaminants.

The results for the percentages removal of the parameter in terms of water quality for nature soil are: BOD 5 at 20 °C 10...|$|R
40|$|Forests cover 59 % of Taiwan {{island where}} {{disastrous}} floods, landslides and debris flows occur often due to heavy typhoon-season rainstorms, steep terrain, fragile geologic formations and frequent earthquakes. This study evaluated the hydrologic influences of forests on Taiwan's headwaters watersheds and supports the century-old policy of designating protection forests for streamflow regulation and soil conservation. Despite rainfall intensity that often exceeds 100 mm/h overland flow rarely occurs on Taiwan's permeable forest soils. High evapotranspiration totaling 800 - 1200 mm annually contributes to reduced streamflows. In Taiwan forests reduce stream sedimentation from landslides by enhancing slope stability with roots and protect water quality by minimizing stream temperature fluctuation, regulating nutrient concentration and <b>filtering</b> <b>contaminants.</b> Floods in Taiwan are {{mainly caused by}} heavy rainstorms exceeding 250 mm, and are not significantly affected by the currently low level of annual forest removal. Rapid urbanization of some forested watersheds may cause increased peak flows and decreased low flows due to significantly reduced soil infiltration capacities. Forests' influences are minimal on landslides, debris flows or floods caused by extreme natural {{events such as the}} 7. 3 Richter-scale earthquake in September 1999 or the rainstorms exceeding 1000 mm during Typhoon Herb in August 1996.

40|$|Culture {{methods for}} the {{detection}} of indicator bacteria are currently used for detection of waterborne bacteria. The need for an increased range of analyzed bacteria coupled with the obtainment of rapid and early results justify the development of a DNA microarray for the identification of waterborne pathogens. This DNA microarray has 16 implanted probes with a median size of 147 bases, targeting 12 different parameters, including all mandatory indicator microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, total and fecal coliforms and enterococci. The validation per-formed with DNA extracted from pure microbial cul-tures showed the suitability of the probes for detection of the target microorganism. To overcome the high di-lution of water samples it was included either a prior culture step of bacterial <b>contaminants</b> retained after <b>filtering</b> 100 ml of water, or a 10 -fold increase in the volume of filtered water, that resulted in the increase of the detected bacteria. The analysis of complex environ-mental water samples using culture methods and the DNA microarray revealed that the latter detected the same parameters plus other bacteria tested only in the DNA microarray. The results show that this DNA microarray may be a useful tool for water micro-biological surveillance...|$|R
40|$|Riparian buffers {{can improve}} surface water quality by <b>filtering</b> <b>contaminants</b> from runoff before they enter streams. Infiltration is an {{important}} process in riparian buffers. Computer models are often {{used to assess the}} performance of riparian buffers. Accurate prediction of infiltration by these models is dependent upon accurate estimates of infiltration parameters. Of particular interest here are Green-Ampt infiltration parameters, satiated hydraulic conductivity (Ko) and wetting front suction (hf). The objectives of this research were to (i) modify the Smith sorptivity procedure {{so that it can be}} used to estimate Green-Ampt infiltration parameters, (ii) Determine the relative closeness of Ko estimated by the inverse sorptivity and inverse Green-Ampt procedures and hf estimated by Rawls and Brakensiek (1985) to the laboratory-determined standards and (iii) Compare Ko estimates of the inverse sorptivity and inverse Green-Ampt procedures to those estimated by pedotransfer functions. This project was conducted at six sites in Nebraska, at which soil type and land use varied. The results of this study suggest that the inverse Green-Ampt procedure can be used to provide Ko estimates, even in the presence of macropores. Generally, pedotransfer function predictions did not estimate Ko well. Finally, hf as predicted by pedotransfer function was lower than laboratory-determined hf. These predicted infiltration parameters were used in the Green-Ampt infiltration equation to illustrate their effect on cumulative infiltration. Cumulative infiltration based on the inverse Green-Ampt procedure parameters resulted in the closest match to cumulative infiltration prediction from laboratory-based infiltration parameters at five of the six sites...|$|R
