When they intruded upon the playing area to congratulate their heros, their sincereity extended to trying to steal their caps or snitching a bail or stump whilst the umpire was distracted by his concern for the pitch...umpire Brooks and an intruder clashed physically in the centre of the Test pitch. The invader was sent sprawling in the centre of the wicket by an exesperated umpire, who was no doubt unwise to intrude into the domain of law and order.|$|E
2500|$|Contagion Theory - the Contagion Theory was {{formulated}} by Gustave Le Bon. According to Le Bon crowds exert a hypnotic influence over their members. Shielded by their anonymity, {{large numbers of}} people abandon personal responsibility and surrender to the contagious emotions of the crowd. A crowd thus assumes a life of its own, stirring up emotions and driving people toward irrational, even violent action (LeBon 1895). Le Bon's Theory, although one of the earliest explanations of <b>crowd</b> <b>behavior,</b> is still accepted by many people outside of sociology. However, critics argue that the [...] "collective mind" [...] has not been documented by systematic studies. Furthermore, although collective behavior may involve strong emotions, such feelings are not necessarily irrational. Turner and Killian (1957) argue convincingly that the [...] "contagion" [...] never actually occurs and participants in collective behavior do not lose their ability to think rationally.|$|E
40|$|Crowd {{modeling}} and simulation is an important and active research field, {{with a wide range}} of applications such as computer games, military training and evacuation modeling. One important issue in crowd modeling is model calibration through parameter tuning, so as to produce desired <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Common methods such as trial-and-error are time consuming and tedious. This paper proposes an evolutionary framework to automate the crowd model calibration process. In the proposed framework, a density-based matching scheme is introduced. By using the dynamic density of the crowd over time, and a weight landscape to emphasize important spatial regions, the proposed matching scheme provides a generally applicable way to evaluate the simulated <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Besides, a hybrid search mechanism based on differential evolution is proposed to efficiently tune parameters of crowd models. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective and efficient to calibrate the crowd models in order to produce desired macroscopic <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R

Jacques et al. [25] review state-of-the-art techniques. Hereby, the authors differ between object-based approaches and holistic approaches. In object-based approaches, single individuals are detected and tracked individually. Relevant information is fused to analyze group behaviors. As an example, Mehran et al. [26] use the social-force model introduced by Helbing et al. [27] to infer crowd patterns from pedestrian tracks. Object-based approaches {{have been used}} by Johansson et al.

This results in more realistic <b>crowd</b> <b>behavior</b> though {{may be more}} computationally intensive than simpler techniques.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Simulation of <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors</b> is {{a widely}} {{discussed}} topic {{for over a decade}} for computer games, architecture and entertainment. The {{most important thing is that}} agents should execute the human like behaviors in real life scenarios. This situation becomes very complex with dense crowds. Our proposed Realistic Behavior Agent Simulation (RBAS) model simulates the agents from the knowledge of empirical findings of <b>crowd</b> physical <b>behaviors</b> and <b>crowd</b> psychology. This paper presents a novel technique to design the agents to with following modules 1) Path planning behavior for collision avoidance 2) Situation awareness during herding behavior and turbulent flow in high density crowds. 3) Personal Reaction bubble (PRB) based response and perceptions. The evaluation with real life situations is performed to validate the RBAS model. The RBAS model allows the agents to use cognitive understandings to plan ahead their path using the visual perception information. This model encapsulates the emergent <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors</b> such as self-organization behavior in herding situation. During turbulent high density flows, most of the existing models fail to predict the behavior of agents, the evaluations show the RBAS model mimics the same <b>behavior</b> of the <b>crowd</b> in different situations...|$|R

50|$|Literature on {{crowds and}} <b>crowd</b> <b>behavior</b> {{appeared}} {{as early as}} 1841, {{with the publication of}} Charles Mackay's book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. The attitude towards crowds underwent an adjustment with the publication of Hippolyte Taine's six-volume tome The Origins of Contemporary France (1875). In particular Taine's work helped to change the opinions of his contemporaries on the actions taken by the crowds during the 1789 Revolution. Many Europeans held him in great esteem. While it is difficult to directly link his works to <b>crowd</b> <b>behavior,</b> it may be said that his thoughts stimulated further study of <b>crowd</b> <b>behavior.</b> However, {{it was not until the}} latter half of the 19th century that scientific interest in the field gained momentum.

40|$|Pedestrian crowd {{simulation}} explores <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{in virtual}} environments. It is extensively studied in many areas, such as safety and civil engineering, transportation, social science, entertainment industry and so on. As a common phenomenon in pedestrian crowds, grouping can play {{important roles in}} <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors.</b> To achieve more realistic simulations, {{it is important to}} support group modeling in <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Nevertheless, group modeling is still an open and challenging problem. The influence of groups on the dynamics of crowd movement has not been incorporated into most existing crowd models because of the complexity nature of social groups. This research develops a framework for group modeling in agent-based pedestrian crowd simulations. The framework includes multiple layers that support a systematic approach for modeling social groups in pedestrian crowd simulations. These layers include a simulation engine layer that provides efficient simulation engines to simulate the crowd model; a behavior-based agent modeling layers that supports developing agent models using the developed BehaviorSim simulation software; a group modeling layer that provides a well-defined way to model inter-group relationships and intra-group connections among pedestrian agents in a crowd; and finally a context modeling layer that allows users to incorporate various social and psychological models into the study of social groups in pedestrian crowd. Each layer utilizes the layer below it to fulfill its functionality, and together these layers provide an integrated framework for supporting group modeling in pedestrian crowd simulations. To our knowledge this work is the first one to focus on a systematic group modeling approach for pedestrian crowd simulations. This systematic modeling approach allows users to create social group simulation models in a well-defined way for studying the effect of social and psychological factors on <b>crowd’s</b> grouping <b>behavior.</b> To demonstrate the capability of the group modeling framework, we developed an application of dynamic grouping for pedestrian crowd simulations...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a system which aims at {{providing}} a decision support, threats response planning and risk assessment. Threats {{can be in the}} form of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) weapons and technologies. In order to assess and manage possible risks of such attacks, we have developed a computational framework of simulating terrorist attacks, <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and police or safety guards’ rescue missions. The characteristics of <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors</b> are modeled based on social science research findings and our own virtual environment experiments with real human participants. Based on gender and age, a person has a different behavioral characteristic. Our framework is based on swarm intelligence and agent-based modeling, which allows us to create {{a large number of people}} with specific behavioral characteristics. Different test scenarios can be created by importing or creating 3 D urban environments and putting certain terrorist attacks (such as bombs or toxic gas) on specific locations and time-lines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for identifying five <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors</b> (bottlenecks, fountainheads, lanes, arches, and blocking) in visual scenes. In the algorithm, a scene is overlaid by {{a grid of}} particles initializing a dynamical system defined by the optical flow. Time integration of the dynamical system provides particle trajectories that represent the motion in the scene; these trajectories are used to locate regions {{of interest in the}} scene. Linear approximation of the dynamical system provides behavior classification through the Jacobian matrix; the eigenvalues determine the dynamic stability of points in the flow and each type of stability corresponds to one of the five <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The eigenvalues are only considered in the regions of interest, consistent with the linear approximation and the implicated behaviors. The algorithm is repeated over sequential clips of a video in order to record changes in eigenvalues, which may imply changes in behavior. The method was tested on over 60 crowd and traffic videos...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Collective {{behaviors}} {{characterize the}} intrinsic {{dynamics of the}} crowds. Automatically understanding col-lective <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors</b> has important applications to video surveillance, traffic management and crowd control, while it {{is closely related to}} scientific fields such as statistical physics and biology. In this paper, a new mixture model of dynamic pedestrian-Agents (MDA) is proposed to learn the collec-tive behavior patterns of pedestrians in crowded scenes from video sequences. From agent-based modeling, each pedes-trian in the crowd is driven by a dynamic pedestrian-agent, which is a linear dynamic system with initial and termina-tion states reflecting the pedestrian’s belief of the starting point and the destination. The whole crowd is then modeled as a mixture of dynamic pedestrian-agents. Once the model parameters are learned from the trajectories extracted from videos, MDA can simulate the <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors.</b> It can also infer the past behaviors and predict the future behaviors of pedestrians given their partially observed trajectories, and classify them different pedestrian behaviors.

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} problem of {{simulating}} pedestrian <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors</b> in real time. To date, two approaches can be used in modeling and simulation of <b>crowd</b> <b>behaviors,</b> i. e. macroscopic and microscopic models. Microscopic simulation techniques can capture the accuracy simulation of individualistic pedestrian behavior while macroscopic simulations maximize the efficiency of simulation; neither of them assures the two goals at the same time. In order to achieve the strengths of the two classes of crowd modeling, we propose a hybrid architecture for defining the complex <b>behaviors</b> of <b>crowd</b> at two levels, the individual behaviors, and the aggregate motion of pedestrian flow. It consists of combining a microscopic and a macroscopic model in an unified framework, we simulate individual pedestrian behaviors in regions of low density by using a microscopic model, and we use a faster continuum model of pedestrian flow in the remainder regions of the simulation environment. We demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our interactive hybrid simulation technique in a large environment. This technique demonstrates the applicability of hybrid techniques to the efficient simulation of large-scale flows with complex dynamics.
