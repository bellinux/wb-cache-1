This paper {{investigates the}} effect of spindle <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> on the static and dynamic {{characteristics}} of the spindle-tooling system through measuring the frequency response function of the tool end point in variable spindle <b>clamping</b> <b>force.</b> The {{research shows that the}} limited static stiffness increases accordingly and normal static stiffness changes little as the spindle champing force increases. The high spindle <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> leads to reduce the modal damping of the spindle-tooling system while the natural frequency varies slight. The analyses of process stability indicates that the low spindle <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> can improves the process stability because of the higher damping in some <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> range...|$|R
50|$|A <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor is a {{relatively}} expensive component in an EMB caliper. The cost is derived from its high unit value from a supplier, as well as marked production expenses because of its inclusion. The later emanates from the complex assembly procedures dealing with small tolerances, as well as on-line calibration for performance variability from one <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor to another. The successful use of a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor in an EMB system poses a challenging engineering task. If a clamp forcesensor is placed close to a brake pad, {{then it will be}} subjected to severe temperature conditions reaching up to 800 Celsius that will challenge its mechanical integrity. Also temperature drifts must be compensated for. This situation can be avoided by embedding a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor deep within the caliper. However, embedding this sensor leads to hysteresis that is influenced by friction between the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor and the point of contact of an inner pad with the rotor. This hysteresis prevents a true <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> to be measured. Due to the cost issues and engineering challenges involved with including the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor, it might be desirable to eliminate this component from the EMB system. A potential opportunity to achieve this presents itself in accurate estimation of the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> based on alternative EMB system sensory measurements leading to the omission of a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor.|$|R
40|$|The micromanipulator’s force {{feedback}} {{is one of}} the key research contents of minimally invasive surgical robotic system. Because the micromanipulator is a kind of compact construction which is suitable for valve installation with small space in surgery, especially for the influence of disinfection method, there are major difficulties and limitations to integrate compact sensors in the end of micromanipulator. This article focuses on the 3 -degree-of-freedom micromanipulator’s <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> sensing, and these three joints are actuated by wirerope driving. A <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> sensing method is proposed based on static tension of wirerope driving, and a static model between the <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> and wirerope’s static tension is established considering the influence of real friction resistance in the mechanical system. Finally, an equivalent experimental test platform for 3 -degree-of-freedom micromanipulator’s <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> sensing is set up, and then a series of experiments of the <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> are studied. The frictional resistances of wirerope between the guide plate and guide pulley mechanism are tested, and a calibration and correction method of the experimental <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> is proposed. The final experiment results show that the total average accuracy of experimental <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> is about 78. 3 %, and it can be the basic measurement force to realize micromanipulator’s <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> feedback of a minimally invasive surgical robot...|$|R

50|$|Due to dynamic loads, {{bolted joints}} have a {{tendency}} to loosen. Downtime is significantly reduced because MJTs are able to easily achieve the large <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> required to prevent bolted components from vibrating loose. Therefore, less time is spent tightening joints repeatedly and fixing problems caused by loose joints. MJTs also reduce the likelihood the bolted joint will fail, which reduces downtime caused by needing to replace damaged components.|$|E

The <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> and welding temperature for a butt welded joint during laser welding are measured simultaneously. The preset <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> is varied during welding for different thicknesses of workpieces and weld joint strengths. The thermal expansion, cooling contraction, and workpiece width reduction during welding induce variations in the preset <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> and consequently change the weld joint strength.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} estimating <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> in an electro-mechanical brake (EMB) for an automotive brake-by-wire (BBW) system. A <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor is typically used in EMB designs {{and the elimination of}} this component is strongly demanded due to implementation difficulties and cost issues. The motivation behind this thesis is to make developmental inroads into the deficiencies provided by previous attempts to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force.</b> Previous attempts have deficiencies for high speed braking applications as well as handling thermally dependent parameter variations. A dynamic stiffness model to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> is developed that relies on the actuator resolver sensor and two additional temperature sensors. Previous attempts to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> have been stiffness based and have not been capable of successfully modelling parameter variations in response to heating. This thesis introduces new developments on how to model stiffness parameter variations under the influence of heating. Two temperature sensors are required to be employed in this new approach. These additional sensors will not have a considerable impact towards the cost savings created by omitting a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor. A torque balance model to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> is also developed that relies on the actuator resolver sensor and actuator motor current sensors. A training strategy is used for the dynamic stiffness and torque balance models to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> so that wear dependent parameters can be adapted. The two independent models to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> are fused using various sensor fusion algorithms to give improved estimates of <b>clamp</b> <b>force.</b> A maximum-likelihood estimator is used to optimize the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of estimation. This is followed by implementing a Kalman filter to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> in an EMB. The dynamic stiffness model is used as the state space equation in the Kalman filter, whilst the torque balance model is used to give measurement updates. Experimental verification showed that the Kalman filter was more accurate than the maximum-likelihood estimator as expected, however the Kalman filter required more computational burden. A RMSE of 0. 5 kN was attained for the Kalman filter and 0. 56 kN for the maximum-likelihood estimator...|$|R

50|$|Reaction {{injection}} molding can produce strong, flexible, lightweight parts which {{can easily be}} painted. It also {{has the advantage of}} quick cycle times compared to typical vacuum cast materials. The bi-component mixture injected into the mold has a much lower viscosity than molten thermoplastic polymers, therefore large, light-weight, and thin-walled items can be successfully RIM processed. This thinner mixture also requires less <b>clamping</b> <b>forces,</b> which leads to smaller equipment and ultimately lower capital expenditures. Another advantage of RIM processed foam is that a high-density skin is formed with a low-density core.|$|E
50|$|An HSK {{connection}} {{depends on}} a combination of axial <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> and taper-shank interference. All these forces are generated and controlled by the mating components’ design parameters. The shank and spindle both must have precisely mating tapers and faces that are square to the taper’s axis. There are several HSK clamping methods. All use some mechanism to amplify the clamping action of equally spaced collet segments. When the toolholder is clamped into the spindle, the drawbar force produces a firm metal-to-metal contact between the shank and the ID of the clamping unit. An additional application of drawbar force positively locks the two elements together into a joint {{with a high level of}} radial and axial rigidity. As the collet segments rotate, the clamping mechanism gains centrifugal force. The HSK design actually harnesses centrifugal force to increase joint strength. Centrifugal force also causes the thin walls of the shank to deflect radially at a faster rate than the walls of the spindle. This contributes to a secure connection by guaranteeing strong contact between the shank and the spindle. The automotive and aerospace industries are the largest users of HSK toolholders. Another industry that is seeing increasing use is the mold and die industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} an electro-mechanical dual acting pulley {{continuously variable}} transmission (EMDAP CVT) system and presents a method of measuring belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> indirectly using a DC motor current sensor. The EMDAP CVT mainly consists of two movable primary (input) and secondary (output) pulley sheaves connected by metal pushing V-belt. Two DC motor’s actuation systems adjust the CVT ratio. Additionally, the secondary actuation system controls belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> by adjusting the flatness of the spring discs placed {{at the back of}} each secondary pulley sheave to keep the belt tight and prevent belt slip. Ideally, a force sensor is used to measure the belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> however the use of force sensor inside transmission gearbox is not feasible due to high temperature and oily environment. A viable solution for indirectly measuring the <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> using current sensor for DC motor is proposed. Since the DC motor actuates the movable pulleys to clamp the belt, the relationship between the DC motor current and belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> can then be investigated experimentally. The results will give positive impact on precisely controlling belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> of EMDAP CVT using current sensor which is relatively simpler and less expensive than force sensor...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} design tools for analysing block stability around a tunnel. First, {{it was determined that}} joint length and field stress have a significant influence on estimating block stability. The results of calculations using methods based on kinematic limit equilibrium (KLE) were compared with the results of filtered DFN-DEM, which are closer to reality. The comparison shows that none of the KLE approaches– conventional, limited joint length, limited joint length with stress and probabilistic KLE – could provide results similar to DFN-DEM. This is due to KLE’s unrealistic assumptions in estimating either volume or <b>clamping</b> <b>forces.</b> A simple mechanism for estimating <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> such as continuum mechanics or the solution proposed by Crawford-Bray leads to an overestimation of <b>clamping</b> <b>forces,</b> and thus unsafe design. The results of such approaches were compared to those of DEM, and it was determined that these simple mechanisms ignore a key stage of relaxation of <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> due to joint existence. The amount of relaxation is a function of many parameters, such as stiffness of the joint and surrounding rock, the joint friction angle and the block half-apical angle. Based on a conceptual model, the key stage was considered in a new analytical solution for symmetric blocks, and the amount of joint relaxation was quantified. The results of the new analytical solution compared to those of DEM and the model uncertainty of the new solution were quantified. Further numerical investigations based on local and regional stress models were performed to study initial <b>clamping</b> <b>forces.</b> Numerical analyses reveal that local stresses, which are a product of regional stress and joint stiffness, govern block stability. Models with a block assembly show that the <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> in a block assembly are equal to the <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> in a regional stress model. Therefore, considering a single block in massive rock results in lower <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> and thus safer design compared to a block assembly in the same condition of in-situ stress and properties. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which is  the most important parameter by assessing sensitivity factors and studying the applicability of the partial coefficient method for designing block stability. It was determined that the governing parameter is the dispersion of the half-apical angle. For a dip angle with a high dispersion, partial factors become very large and the design value for <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> is close to zero. This suggests that in cases with a high dispersion of the half-apical angle, the <b>clamping</b> <b>forces</b> could be ignored in a stability analysis, unlike in cases with a lower dispersion. The costs of gathering more information about the joint dip angle could be compared to the costs of overdesign. The use of partial factors is uncertain, at least without dividing the problem into sub-classes. The application of partial factors is possible in some circumstances but not always, and a FORM analysis is preferable. QC 2011120...|$|E
