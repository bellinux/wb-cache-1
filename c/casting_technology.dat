500|$|Wolfenstein 3D (created by id Software and {{released}} in 1992) {{was an instant}} success, fueled largely by its shareware release, and has been credited with inventing the first-person shooter genre. It {{was built on the}} ray <b>casting</b> <b>technology</b> pioneered in earlier games to create a revolutionary template for shooter game design, which first-person shooters are still based upon today. Despite its violent themes, Wolfenstein largely escaped the controversy generated by the later Doom, although it was banned in Germany due to the use of Nazi iconography; and the Super NES version replaced the enemy attack dogs with giant rats. Apogee Software, the publisher of Wolfenstein 3D, followed up its success with [...] in 1993.

500|$|Id Software's Hovertank 3D pioneered ray <b>casting</b> <b>technology</b> in May 1991 {{to enable}} faster {{gameplay}} than 1980s vehicle simulators; {{and six months}} later Catacomb 3-D introduced another advance, texture mapping, in November 1991. The second game to use texture mapping was , a March 1992 action role-playing game by Looking Glass Technologies that featured a first-person viewpoint and an advanced graphics engine. In October 1990, id developer John Romero learned about texture mapping from {{a phone call to}} Paul Neurath. Romero described the texture mapping technique to id programmer John Carmack, who remarked, [...] "I can do that.", and would feel motivated by Looking Glass's example to do the same in Catacomb 3-D. Catacomb 3-D also introduced the display of the protagonist's hand and weapon (in this case, magical spells) on the screen, whereas previously aspects of the player's avatar were not visible. The experience of developing Ultima Underworld would make it possible for Looking Glass to create the Thief and System Shock series years later.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} wind power was {{appreciated}} in China {{long before the}} introduction of the windmill during the Song period. It is uncertain when the ancient Chinese used their very first inflatable bellows as wind-blowing machines for kilns and furnaces. They existed perhaps {{as far back as the}} Shang dynasty (1600 BCE–1050 BCE), due to the intricate bronze <b>casting</b> <b>technology</b> of the period. They were certainly used since the advent of the blast furnace in China from the 6th century BCE onwards, since cast iron farm tools and weapons were widespread by the 5th century BCE. In 31 the Han dynasty governmental prefect and engineer Du Shi (d. 38) employed the use of horizontal waterwheels and a complex mechanical gear system to operate the large bellows that heated the blast furnace in smelting cast iron. [...] Bellows continued in use for purposes of metallurgy, but other sources of wind power were discovered and harnessed. The Han dynasty artisan Ding Huan (fl. 180) not only pioneered the invention of the cardan suspension, but also the rotary fan, which could be used as a simple air conditioner. This employed seven wheel each about 3m (10ft) in diameter and manually powered, but by the Tang dynasty (618–907) palaces featured water-powered rotary fans for air conditioning, and in the Song dynasty, states Needham, [...] "the refrigerant effects of artificial draught seem to have been appreciated ever more widely." [...] There was also an intricate Chinese rotary fan winnowing machine depicted in Wang Zhen's agricultural treatise of the Nong Shu of 1313 (although the earliest depiction of a winnowing machine was from a Han dynasty tomb model dated from the 2nd century BCE to the 2nd century). After these innovations, the windmill was finally introduced to China in the early 13th century via the Jin dynasty in northern China, during the late Song dynasty.|$|E

2500|$|Although few {{in number}} there were some {{exceptions}} to the bronze and iron paradigm. Composite metal cannons were produced in the Ming and Qing dynasties during the 17th century. In China, the Ming dynasty started producing smoothbore breech loading cast-bronze cannons after the European fashion no later than 1620. However, in addition to European expertise and design, the Chinese had an advantage in their long history of metal casting practices.

2500|$|China's Qing (Manchu) dynasty began casting {{coins in}} the far-Western region of [...] "Xinjiang" [...] (Chinese for [...] "The New Frontier", {{sometimes}} transliterated as [...] "Sinkiang") in 1760, {{only one year}} after the Qianlong Emperor's generals conquered the region's capitols of Kashgar and Yarkand. [...] Not only did this primarily Muslim and Turkic-speaking region represent a distinct cultural landscape for the empire, but also a special economic environment. [...] The many differences between the coinages of Xinjiang and the rest of China reflected the special demands of governing this area. [...] The coins cast in Xinjiang were made from copper, rather than the brass used {{for the rest of the}} empire's coinage, leading to the nickname [...] "red cash." [...] These copper coins were valued at five of the standard cash, and provided some continuity with the monetary system used under the region's previous rulers, the Dzungar Oirat Mongol Dzungar Khanate. Most of the red cash also displayed mint names in the local Turki language. The coins had writing in Chinese, Manchu, and Turki. Lying far from the empire's center, Xinjiang was somewhat loosely governed by the court, and this is reflected in the great variety of coin types produced, some of them quite innovative. [...] In spite of frequent rebellions and invasions, the coinage of red cash continued on and off through the nineteenth century and into the beginning of the twentieth. [...] The final examples of red cash were cast in 1909 in the name of the Last Emperor, Puyi, using the same <b>casting</b> <b>technology</b> employed by Chinese mints for 2,000 years.|$|E
