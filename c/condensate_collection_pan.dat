The aim {{of the study was}} to test the effect of condensation temperature on the parameters of exhaled breath condensate and the levels of selected biomarkers. Methods Exhaled breath condensate was collected from 24 healthy subjects at temperatures of - 10, - 5, 0 and + 5 C degrees. Selected parameters (condensed volume and conductivity) and biomarkers (hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde) were measured.

EBC was collected from 6 conscious sheep and then from the same anesthetized sheep during mechanical ventilation.

OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the feasibility of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) -based metabolomic analysis applied to exhaled breath condensate ("breathomics"). Information coming from NMR spectra was analyzed with a view to establish the NMR variables that best discriminate between children with asthma and healthy children. METHODS: Twenty-five children with asthma (17 with persistent asthma treated with inhaled corticosteroids, 8 with intermittent asthma inhaled corticosteroid naive; age, 7 - 15 yr) and 11 healthy age-matched control subjects were enrolled. Every child performed exhaled nitric oxide measurement, spirometry, and <b>condensate</b> <b>collection.</b> <b>Condensate</b> samples were analyzed by means of NMR spectroscopy. Linear and partial least squares discriminant analyses were applied to data obtained from the NMR spectra. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The combination of exhaled nitric oxide and FEV(1) discriminates children with asthma and healthy children with a success rate of approximately 81 %, whereas selected signals from NMR spectra offer a slightly better discrimination (approximately 86 %). The selected NMR variables derive from the region of 3. 2 to 3. 4 ppm, indicative of oxidized compounds, and from the region of 1. 7 to 2. 2 ppm, indicative of acetylated compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolomics can be applied to exhaled breath condensate, leading to the characterization of airway biochemical fingerprints.

This study investigated the possibility of wind dispersal of soil invertebrates within the dry valleys. Soil invertebrates were evaluated in (1) pockets of transported sediments to lake ice and glacier surfaces, (2) wind-transported dust particles in <b>collection</b> <b>pans</b> (Bundt pans) 100 cm above the soil surface, and (3) sediments transported closer to the surface (< 50 cm) and collected in open top chambers (OTCs). Invertebrates were extracted and identified. Nematodes were identified to species and classified according to life stage and sex. Three species of nematodes were recovered and Scottnema lindsayae was the most dominant. There were more juveniles (71 %) in the transported sediments than adults (29 %). Tardi-grades and rotifers were more abundant in sediments on lake and glacier surfaces while nematodes were more abundant in the dry sediment <b>collections</b> of Bundt <b>pans</b> and OTCs.

50|$|The {{research}} on high frequency screens {{has led to}} {{new developments in the}} field which enhance the operation and performance of the equipment.

Each screen deck has an undersize and oversize <b>collection</b> <b>pan</b> which will respectively go into their common outlet. The stacking of the machines thus allows more production while using less space. Another new development is the fabrication of Polyweb urethane screen surfaces that have openings as fine as 45 µm and open areas from 35% - 45%. This leads to the screen being able to separate finer particles. The screens can be used for both wet and dry applications and urethane formulation is still an ongoing process. Thus, research and development is still being invested in high frequency screening equipment to improve the overall separation efficiency and also to lower costs.|$|R

However, few studies are available on this topic. DesignThe aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the influence of inflammatory pattern, age and affective status on dyspnea {{perception in}} asthmatic subjects.

Furthermore, airways inflammation plays a key role in the decline of dyspnea perception as proved by the negative correlation observed between inflammatory cells in sputum, exhaled pH and NO and BORG–VAS/FEV 1 slope.

METHODS: Two devices were mounted in polystyrene boxes filled either with crushed ice/salt crystals or dry ice/crushed ice.

The need for further studies that confirm the previous findings and support the potential scope of this method underlies the main aim of this study that seeks to explore the pathogenic mechanisms determining the EBT in lung cancer. We enrolled 44 consecutive patients with a radiological suspicion of lung cancer and ten healthy non-smoker volunteers, after which their EBT was measured. On the same day, the subjects underwent breath <b>condensate</b> <b>collection</b> for the measurement of leukotriene (LTB) - 4 and of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the former being a marker of airways inflammation and the latter of neoangiogenesis.
