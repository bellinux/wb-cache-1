Rapid increase in osmotic pressure, soluble proteins, and phospholipids in plumules in association with the development of freezing and drought tolerance and the requirement of endosperm suggested diversion of nutrient from use in extension growth, to use in augmentation of protoplasm in plumule cells. Since cold acclimation slowed or arrested growth and is associated with augmentation of protoplasm, it is suggested that the common element in the induction of freezing tolerance by cold and drought is the necessity for producing a condition of augmented protoplasm and membranes in cells thus reinforcing a similar conclusion reached from seasonal studies on woody plants...|$|E

40|$|X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, {{and mass}} {{spectrometry}} techniques {{were used in}} an attempt to clarify the morphological and chemical features that are responsible for reversible aging processes that occur in asphalt binders during conditioning at low temperatures. The reversible aging term is used in this paper to capture all reversible processes (i. e., wax crystallization, free volume collapse, asphaltene aggregation, etc.) that lead to a reduction in low-temperature rheological and fracture performance. Crystalline content and asphaltene aggregate size at ambient temperatures, as measured by X-ray diffraction on thin asphalt films, are identified as two factors that correlate reasonably well with the reversible aging tendency at low temperatures. A coarse and unstable colloidal state for the asphaltene fraction is also identified as an important contributor to reversible aging. It was found that the saturates fraction has a particularly significant role in the aging process, with those asphalts containing higher amounts of linear paraffin losing more in terms of rheological performance. This important phenomenon is responsible for significant fracture distress in asphalt pavements in northern climates and therefore deserves further investigation. Some of the air-blown asphalts investigated in this study were found to show a high crystalline content and a coarse phase morphology and concurrent tendency for reversible aging during <b>cold</b> <b>conditioning.</b> This {{may be due to the}} crude source(s) employed, the chemistry of the air-blowing process, or resulting phase changes.

During this psychophysical test, pain intensity clamping uses REsponse Dependent STIMulation (REDSTIM) methodology to automatically adjust stimulus intensity to maintain a desired pain rating set-point. Specifically, stimulus intensity increases until a pre-defined pain rating (the setpoint) is exceeded, and then decreases until pain ratings fall below the setpoint, with continued increases and decreases dictated by ratings. The subjects are blinded {{in terms of the}} setpoint and stimulus intensities. Younger and older subjects completed two test sessions of two REDSTIM trials, with presentation of <b>conditioning</b> <b>cold</b> stimulation between the trials of one session but not the other. The results indicated that <b>conditioning</b> <b>cold</b> stimulation similarly decreased the overall sensitivity of younger and older subjects, as measured by the average temperature that maintained a setpoint rating of 20 (on a scale of 0 - 100). The conditioning stimulus also significantly enhanced sensitization following ascending stimulus progressions and desensitization following descending stimulus progressions in older subjects relative to younger subjects. Thus, older subjects experienced greater swings in sensitivity in response to varying levels of painful stimulation. These results are discussed in terms of control over pain intensity by descending central modulatory systems.

40|$|Preventing {{ripening}} {{is required}} for seafreight export and delayed marketing. In avocado, storage is a balance between low temperatures to minimise respiration rate, but not too low to cause black skin discoloration (discrete patches) from chilling injury. Thus, ‘Hass’ fruit are usually stored at 4 - 5 °C. A <b>cold</b> <b>conditioning</b> treatment of 3 - 4 d at 6 °C allows cold disinfestation at 1 °C for about 16 d without discrete patches developing, but {{it was unclear whether}} conditioning could allow longer storage times at these lower temperatures. To test this, ‘Hass’ fruit were either not conditioned or conditioned, held at 1 °C or 5 °C for up to 40 d, then assessed for skin damage soon after removal and ripe fruit quality. In most cases, conditioning and storing at 1 °C maintained ripe fruit quality for up to 20 - 25 d, but longer storage resulted in skin damage. Conditioning then holding at 1 - 5 °C for 30 d showed that 2 °C storage resulted in negligible skin damage and the best balance between minimal flesh diseases and disorders. Also, storing conditioned fruit for 30 d at 2 °C resulted in similar severity of flesh diseases and disorders as non-stored fruit, and significantly less than with 5 °C. Skin appearance was similar with 2 and 5 °C storage. After 40 d, flesh defects were significantly less with 2 °C than with 5 °C, and with acceptable skin spotting and discrete patches severity. These results suggest that conditioned ‘Hass’ fruit can be cold-stored at 2 °C for up to 40 d and perhaps reduce dependence on controlled atmosphere systems...|$|E
40|$|Mario Bernaba, Kevin A Johnson, Jiang-Ti Kong, Sean MackeyStanford Systems Neuroscience and Pain Laboratory, Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USAPurpose: Conditioned pain {{modulation}} (CPM) is {{an experimental}} approach for probing endogenous analgesia by which one painful stimulus (the conditioning stimulus) may inhibit the perceived pain of a subsequent stimulus (the test stimulus). Animal {{studies suggest that}} CPM is mediated by a spino–bulbo–spinal loop using objective measures such as neuronal firing. In humans, pain ratings are often used as the end point. Because pain self-reports are subject to cognitive influences, we tested whether cognitive factors would impact on CPM results in healthy humans. Methods: We conducted a within-subject, crossover study of healthy adults {{to determine the extent}} to which CPM is affected by 1) threatening and reassuring evaluation and 2) imagery alone of a <b>cold</b> <b>conditioning</b> stimulus. We used a heat stimulus individualized to 5 / 10 on a visual analog scale as the testing stimulus and computed the magnitude of CPM by subtracting the postconditioning rating from the baseline pain rating of the heat stimulus. Results: We found that although evaluation can increase the pain rating of the conditioning stimulus, it did not significantly alter the magnitude of CPM. We also found that imagery of cold pain alone did not result in statistically significant CPM effect. Conclusion: Our results suggest that CPM is primarily dependent on sensory input, and that the cortical processes of evaluation and imagery have little impact on CPM. These findings lend support for CPM as a useful tool for probing endogenous analgesia through subcortical mechanisms.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{metabolism}} of ethyl alcohol in rats expoxsed to a cold environment was investigated by means of uniformly 14 C-labeled ethyl alcohol. In rats exposed to cold for five days, the rate of metabolism of alcohol was accelerated, in contrast to their controls kept at room temperature. Moreover, the rate of absorption of alcohol {{from the site of}} its administration and the rate of its removal from the blood was greater in cold-exposed animals than in rats maintained at room temperature. The observed increase in the rate of metabolism of alcohol in cold-exposed rats, however, was not proportional to the rate of increase in the general metabolism. In cold-acclimated rats, whether or not pre-treated with alcohol, cold exposure resulted in an increased rate of alcohol metabolism. In cold-acclimated alcohol pre-treated rats, the increase in the rate of alcohol metabolism was proportional to the increase in overall metabolism. The data also indicate that the rate of alcohol metabolism is essentially independent when given in various doses. However, a dose dependence on the ratio of oxidation of alcohol to the total foodstuff utilization was demonstrated. No detectable changes in the alcohol oxidation rate were caused by partial hepatectomy. A single dose of an adrenergic blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, immediately prior to the introduction of alcohol, produced a decrease in the oxidation rate of alcohol in rats exposed to cold. This reduction was more pronounced when cold-exposed rats were pre-treated with phenoxybenzamine from the onset of cold exposure, i. e. for five days prior to alcohol administration. The positive influence of the thyroid gland on the metabolic rate of alcohol in animals exposed to cold was demonstrated by blocking hormone production with potassium perchlorate during the <b>cold</b> <b>conditioning</b> period...|$|E
30|$|The {{population}} of southern China {{tends to be}} more vulnerable to low temperatures, and residents in the north are more sensitive to heat (Fig.  5). This regional difference in vulnerability is consistent with other studies conducted in Europe, the United States, and China (Curriero et al. 2002; Analitis et al. 2008; Guo et al. 2013; Ma, Wang et al.). Among the three city clusters, the BTH region and the PRD had a quicker response to heat stress and cold stress, respectively. The different responses to temperature extremes between residents of northern and southern China are both a result of and have further contributed to their respective ability to adapt to their local climates. Such adaptation may occur either by acclimatization, behavioral change, technology uptake, or other adaptive mechanisms (Keatinge et al. 2000; Medina-Ramón and Schwartz 2007). For example, central heating, an important adaptive measure against cold, is almost universal in northern China, which may explain why northern residents seemed more acclimatized to cold than the southern population. Central heating is rare in southeastern and southern China, however, and the heating function of air conditioning units may not work well under extreme cold events. Thus, the vulnerability of southern China residents to low temperatures could be explained by their limited adaptive measures to <b>cold.</b> Air <b>conditioning</b> is less prevalent in the BTH region than the YRD and the PRD, which provides a partial explanation of northern China residents’ susceptibility to extremely high temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Conditioned pain {{modulation}} (CPM) {{refers to}} the diminution of perceived pain intensity for a test stimulus following application of a conditioning stimulus to a remote area of the body, and is thought to reflect the descending inhibition of nociceptive signals. Studying CPM in children may inform interventions to enhance central pain inhibition within a developmental framework. We assessed CPM in 133 healthy children (mean age =  13 years; 52. 6 % girls) and tested the effects of sex and age. Participants were exposed to 4 trials of a pressure test stimulus before, during, and after {{the application of a}} <b>cold</b> water <b>conditioning</b> stimulus. CPM was documented by a reduction in pressure pain ratings during cold water administration. Older children (12 - 17 years) exhibited greater CPM than younger children (8 - 11 years). No sex differences in CPM were found. Lower heart rate variability at baseline and after pain induction was associated with less CPM, controlling for child age. The findings of greater CPM in the older age cohort suggest a developmental improvement in central pain inhibitory mechanisms. The results highlight the need to examine developmental and contributory factors in central pain inhibitory mechanisms in children to guide effective, age appropriate pain interventions. PERSPECTIVE: In this healthy sample, younger children exhibited less CPM than did older adolescents, suggesting a developmental improvement in CPM. Cardiac vagal tone was associated with CPM across age. The current findings may inform the development of targeted, developmentally appropriate pain interventions for children...|$|R

40|$|Poultry {{production}} {{plays an}} important role in the food supply and security for billions of people. Poultry meat is considered the most efficient, nutritious source of protein, without religious taboos, and is relatively inexpensive. However, the poultry industry is facing substantial challenges. The global environmental temperature has experienced dramatic changes in the last few years. Modern broilers are not well adapted to environmental challenges (heat and cold stress), which have resulted in heavy economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide. In addition, the use of feed restriction regimens in management of breeders as well as the transportation of young chicks could induce additional metabolic disorders. Although seminal managerial thermo-conditioning, nutritional, and genetic efforts have been applied to partially alleviate these negative effects, poultry productivity still declines due to the adverse effects of these stressors and limited fundamental knowledge. There is, therefore, a critical need for mechanistic understanding of poultry response to these stressors which may help for the subsequent development of potential mechanism-based strategies to improve bird well-being, and thereby enhance poultry productivity and sustainability. The present study aimed to identify new molecular signatures that are involved in environmental and nutritional stress responses in poultry. We found that chronic mild <b>cold</b> <b>conditioning</b> (CMCC) improves growth performance in young chicks via modulation of Adenosine mono phosphate- activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. In addition, we identified heat shock protein A 9 (HSPA 9) or glucose regulated protein (GRP 75), orexin (ORX) and its related receptors (ORXR 1 and 2), and Dicer 1 as new molecular markers involved in stress response in poultry. HSPA 9 /GRP 75 was identified to be expressed differently in various tissues of Jungle fowl and quail, as well as avian cell lines and was affected by heat stress. Orexin and its related receptors are altered by heat and oxidative stress in avian muscle both in vivo and in vitro. The ribonuclease type III, Dicer 1 which plays a key role in microRNA biogenesis, is regulated by nutritional stress (feed deprivation) in quail and chicken livers, and in immortalized chicken embryo liver (CEL-im) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY 5 Y) cell lines...|$|E
40|$|Low {{environmental}} {{temperatures are}} among the most challenging stressors in poultry industries. Although landmark studies using acute severe cold exposure have been conducted, still the molecular mechanisms underlying cold-stress responses in birds are not completely defined. In the present study we determine the effect of chronic mild <b>cold</b> <b>conditioning</b> (CMCC) on growth performances and on the expression of key metabolic-related genes in three metabolically important tissues: brain (main site for feed intake control), liver (main site for lipogenesis) and muscle (main site for thermogenesis). 80 one-day old male broiler chicks were divided into two weight-matched groups and maintained in two different temperature floor pen rooms (40 birds/room). The temperature of control room was 32 °C, while the cold room temperature started at 26. 7 °C and gradually reduced every day (1 °C/day) to reach 19. 7 °C at the seventh day of the experiment. At day 7, growth performances were recorded (from all birds) and blood samples and tissues were collected (n = 10). The rest of birds were maintained at the same standard environmental condition for two more weeks and growth performances were measured. Although feed intake remained unchanged, body weight gain was significantly increased in CMCC compared to the control chicks resulting in a significant low feed conversion ratio (FCR). Circulating cholesterol and creatine kinase levels were higher in CMCC chicks compared to the control group (P< 0. 05). CMCC significantly decreased the expression of both the hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and anorexigenic cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) in chick brain which may explain the similar feed intake between the two groups. Compared to the control condition, CMCC increased the mRNA abundance of AMPKα 1 /α 2 and decreased mTOR gene expression (P< 0. 05), the master energy and nutrient sensors, respectively. It also significantly decreased the expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) gene in chick brain compared to the control. Although their roles are still unknown in avian species, adiponectin (Adpn) and its related receptors (AdipoR 1 and 2) were down regulated in the brain of CMCC compared to control chicks (P< 0. 05). In the liver, CMCC significantly down regulated the expression of lipogenic genes namely FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACCα) and malic enzyme (ME) and their related transcription factors sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 / 2 (SREBP- 1 and 2). Hepatic mTOR mRNA levels and phosphorylated mTOR at Ser 2448 were down regulated (P< 0. 05), however phosphorylated ACCαSer 79 (inactivation) was up regulated (P< 0. 05) in CMCC compared to control chicks, indicating that CMCC switch hepatic catabolism on and inhibits hepatic lipogenesis. In the muscle however, CMCC significantly up regulated the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT- 1) gene and the mRNA and phosphorylated protein levels of mTOR compared to the control chicks, indicating that CMCC enhanced muscle fatty acid β-oxidation. In conclusion, this is the first report indicating that CMCC may regulate AMPK-mTOR expression in a tissue specific manner and identifying AMPK-mTOR as a potential molecular signature that controls cellular fatty acid utilization (inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis and induction of muscle fatty acid β-oxidation) to enhance growth performance during mild cold acclimation...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES:: Widespread central {{hypersensitivity}} {{and altered}} conditioned pain modulation (CPM) {{have been documented}} in chronic pain conditions. Information on their prognostic values is limited. This study tested the hypothesis that widespread central hypersensitivity (WCH) and altered CPM, assessed during the chronic phase of low back and neck pain, predict poor outcome. METHODS:: A total of 169 consecutive patients with chronic low back or neck pain, referred to the pain clinic during 1 year, were analyzed. Pressure pain tolerance threshold at the second toe and tolerance time during cold pressor test at the hand assessed WCH. CPM {{was measured by the}} change in pressure pain tolerance threshold (test stimulus) after <b>cold</b> pressor test (<b>conditioning</b> stimulus). A structured telephone interview was performed 12 to 15 months after testing to record outcome parameters. Linear regression models were used, with average and maximum pain intensity of the last 24 hours at follow-up as endpoints. Multivariable analyses included sex, age, catastrophizing scale, Beck Depression Inventory, pain duration, intake of opioids, and type of pain syndrome. RESULTS:: Statistically significant reductions from baseline to follow-up were observed in pain intensity (P< 0. 001). No evidence for an association between the measures of WCH or CPM and intensity of chronic pain at follow-up was found. DISCUSSION:: A major predictive value of the measures that we used is unlikely. Future studies adopting other assessment modalities and possibly standardized treatments are needed to further elucidate the prognostic value of WCH and altered CPM in chronic pain...|$|R

The efficiency of CPM is predictive {{of a variety of}} health outcomes, while impaired CPM has been associated with various chronic pain conditions. Current methods used to assess CPM vary widely, and interest in CPM method development remains strong. Here, we evaluated a novel method for assessing CPM in healthy controls and fibromyalgia (FM) patients using thumb pressure as both a test and conditioning stimulus. Methods: Sixteen female FM patients and 14 matched healthy controls underwent CPM testing with thumbnail pressure as the test stimulus, and either cold water or noxious pressure as the conditioning stimulus. CPM magnitude was evaluated as the difference in pain rating of the test stimulus applied before and during the conditioning stimulus. Results: In healthy controls, application of either pressure or <b>cold</b> water <b>conditioning</b> stimulation induced CPM as evidenced by a significant reduction in test stimulus pain rating during conditioning (P= 0. 007 and P= 0. 021, respectively). In contrast, in FM patients, neither conditioning stimulus induced a significant CPM effect P-values > 0. 274). There was a significant difference in CPM magnitude for FM patients compared to healthy controls with noxious pressure conditioning stimulation (P= 0. 023); however, no significant difference in CPM was found between groups using cold water as a conditioning stimulus (P= 0. 269). Conclusion: The current study demonstrates that thumbnail pressure can be used as both a test and conditioning stimulus in the assessment of CPM. This study further confirms previous findings of attenuated CPM in FM patients compared with healthy controls.

40|$|Patellofemoral Pain (PFP) {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} among adults and adolescents. Localized mechanical hyperalgesia around {{the knee and}} tibialis anterior have been observed in people with PFP, but limited knowledge of potential manifestations of central sensitisation exists. The aims {{of this study were}} to study conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and wide-spread hyperalgesia in adults with PFP. This assessor-blinded cross-sectional study design compared CPM and mechanical pressure pain thresholds (PPT) between 33 adults (23 females) diagnosed with PFP and 32 age and sex matched pain-free controls. The investigator taking the PPT measurements was blinded to which participants had PFP. PPTs were reliably measured using a Somedic hand-held pressure algometer at three sites: 1) The centre of the patella, 2) the tibialis anterior muscle and 3) a remote site on the lateral epicondyle. For the assessment of CPM, experimental pain was induced to the contralateral hand by immersion into a <b>cold</b> water bath (<b>conditioning</b> stimulus), and assessment of PPTs (the test stimulus) was performed before and immediately after the conditioning stimulation. On average, the CPM paradigm induced a significant increase in PPTs across the three sites (6. 3 - 13. 5 %, P< 0. 05), however {{there was no difference in}} CPM between young adults with PFP compared to the control group, (F(1, 189) = 0. 39, P = 0. 89). There was no difference in mechanical PPTs between the two groups (F(1, 189) = 0. 03, P = 0. 86). Contrary to our a-priori hypothesis, we found no difference in CPM or PPT between young adults with PFP and age and sex matched pain-free controls...|$|R
40|$|Pharmacokinetic ⁄ {{pharmacodynamic}} (PK⁄PD) modelling {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the relationship between dose regimen of opioids, plasma concentration and effect of opioids, which in turn can lead to more rational treatment regimens of pain. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the concentration–effect relationship for transdermal buprenorphine and fentanyl in experimentally induced pain. Twenty-two healthy volunteers were randomized to receive transdermal patches with fentanyl (25 lg ⁄ hr, 72 hr), buprenorphine (20 lg ⁄ hr, 144 hr) or placebo. The experimental pain tests were pressure at the tibial bone, cutaneous thermal stimulation, <b>cold</b> pressor test (<b>conditioning</b> stimulus (3 € 0. 3 C cold water), nerve growth factor– induced muscle soreness and intradermal capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia. Experiments were carried out at baseline, 24, 48, 72 and 144 hr after application of patches. Time-course of placebo was described first and was afterwards added to the description of the time-courses of buprenorphine and fentanyl. This was either described by zero (no drug effect), linear or Emax model concentration–effect relationships. Time-dependent changes in pain measures in the placebo arm were described by linear or quadratic functions. The time-course of fentanyl and buprenorphine plasma concentrations was complex but could be represented by cubic spline interpolation in the models. Buprenorphine significantly attenuated bone-associated pain, heat pain, nerve growth factor–induced soreness and cold pressor pain. Fentanyl significantly attenuated cold pressor pain for the administered dose regimens. Although the PK⁄PD relationship for both drugs could be described with similar models, tissue-differentiated analgesic effects between buprenorphine and fentanyl was shown. ...|$|R

The full text of the complete book is freely available at: [URL] hypothetical case study {{has been made of}} a 100 MW OTEC plant, which would require around 400 m 3 /sec of warm water feed (with 200 m 3 /sec of cold water feed) and resulted in the following data: CO 2 saving compared to coal power plant, as determined from lifecycle assessment (LCA) studies, would be 98. 62 % for CC-OTEC, 97. 41 % for the hybrid type, and 94. 4 % for OC-OTEC. Energy payback period value would be 1. 33 years. Cost of power generation from NPV concept of such plant is estimated to be of 2. 9 p/kWh. 172, 800 m 3 of potable water/day could be available from OC-OTEC (but none from CC-OTEC though a hybrid type may yield appreciable potable water). More than 68, 000 kg shellfish/day could be availed for all types of 100 MW OTEC. Upwelling of the nutrient rich cold water along with abundant plankton from sea-bottom and the mixed discharge of it in the ocean during OTEC operations is likely to help growth of the oceans’ flora and fauna for the abundant supply of seafood. But the danger posed from simultaneous upwelling of toxic algal bloom endangering the marine species, are also apprehended. However, by and large positive marine species growth has been opined. Such increased species growth becomes instrumental in burying CO 2 in the deep ocean floor with the carcasses of dead marine species grown. This phenomenon known as sequestering of CO 2, appreciably increases the ocean’s CO 2 storage capability and thereby in addressing the problem of global warming. This is in addition to the amount of CO 2 saved from use of alternate energy source on OTEC, against the conventional fossil fuel resources. Upwelling of cold water may be utilized in <b>cold</b> storages/air <b>conditioning</b> saving 600 times the power required for running the same. Hydrogen production, as may be made at expense of the net power generated, from a 100 MW plant, would amount to over 35, 000 kg/day or 20, 000 kg of NH 3 /day. 21, 773 kg of CO 2 /day from OC-OTEC (also from the hybrid type but not for CC-OTEC) would be available, which can be utilized as raw material for soda ash manufacture/urea production (along with NH 3 as may be availed from H 2 production). Also a huge quantity of oxygen enriched air – near 33 % O 2 content, against 20. 93 % of normal air may be availed. 188, 812 kg/day of methanol utilizing the H 2, as may be generated can thereby be the resource raw material for petrochemical industries, opening up the scope of availability of a chemical hub {{in the vicinity of the}} OTEC plant. Such OTEC plants can help sustainable development, particularly small island developing states (SIDS), arresting coral bleaching (decreasing acid rains etc.), and generating employment; and also help in reducing global warming from sequestering of CO 2, in addition to saving CO 2 emission compared to conventional fossil fuel power generators...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of social economy, the electricity consumption by air conditioning increases unceasingly. Even the electricity peak due to the air conditioning is often {{at the same time}} with the industry trade peak, which worsen creates the peak electric power resources shortage, and the electricity difference between on-peak hours and off-peak hours is becoming larger. The ice-storage air conditioning system, as a powerful technology of balancing electric loads from on-peak hours, has the great significance to the electric network. The dynamic ice cold storage technique is the important research direction of the ice storage air conditioning system, In order to obtain guidelines for engineering applications, experiments were conducted using the dynamic ice <b>cold</b> storage air <b>conditioning</b> system developed by Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion,and the paper mainly focused on the following aspects; 1) The influences of different initial cool thermal storage rate, different cooling load of end-users, different discharge water flow rate and different ice-melting velocity on the discharging characteristics were analyzed in detail, the results show that the ice-melting velocity {{plays an important role in}} discharging characteristics, and initial cool thermal storage rate, discharge water flow rate and cooling load of end-users have little effect on the discharging characteristics. 2) In order to get the optimum pipeline designs in ice storage tank during the ice charging process, several ice-melting experiments were conducted.

Through this experimental study, the crucial discharging parameters of the dynamic ice storage air conditioning system were obtained; at the same time, an optimum pipeline design in the ice storage tank during ice discharging process was also obtained. And the experimental foundation and the design instruction were to be provided for the product development of the dynamic ice storage air conditioning. 随着社会经济水平的不断发展，人们对生活环境和工作环境的要求有了很大提高，空调用量不断增加。并且空调用电高峰往往与工商业用电高峰同步，进一步造成高峰期电力资源短缺，电力峰谷差矛盾的加剧。冰蓄冷空调就是为了实现电网负荷削峰平谷而发展起来的一项实用技术，对电网移峰填谷具有重大意义。 动态冰蓄冷技术是冰蓄冷空调的重要研究方向，为了更好的指导工程应用，本文利用中科院广州能源研究所自主研发的动态冰蓄冷空调系统，主要作了以下几项工作： ⑴ 进行动态冰蓄冷空调系统的融冰实验，分析不同初始蓄冰量、不同末端负荷、不同取冷流量、槽内回水速度等因素对融冰取冷特性的影响。结果表明：初始蓄冰量、末端负荷、取冷流量对融冰取冷特性的影响很小，槽内回水速度对融冰取冷起关键作用。 ⑵ 通过改变取水、回水布管方式，以获得最佳取冷速率（或融冰速度）的取水口和回水口的基本设计原则和依据。结果表明，存在最佳的融冰布管方式，取水口对融冰效率的影响很小。 ⑶ 定性阐明蓄冰槽内因回水和取水引起的速度场或其他参数对融冰速度的影响规律； 通过本课题的实验研究，得到了动态冰蓄冷空调系统融冰取冷特性的关键参数和取回水的基本设计原则，为动态冰蓄冷空调的进一步研发提供了参考依据...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{naturally}} occurring compounds present in grapefruit have shown several health promoting properties such as anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial and cardioprotective. However, {{the levels of}} these {{naturally occurring}} compounds are influenced by several preharvest and postharvest factors. The primary objective of the current research {{is to determine the}} effects of different postharvest treatments on naturally occurring compounds present in grapefruit. In the first and second studies, effect of ethylene degreening on ?Star Ruby? and ?Rio Red? grapefruit natural compounds was investigated. Degreening helped to improve grapefruit color while maintaining the health promoting compounds. Significant influence of ethylene treatment was observed on flavonoids and furocoumarins. The third and fourth study examined the changes in ?Star Ruby? and ?Rio Red? grapefruit under cold storage and with low temperature conditioning treatment. Conditioning the fruits prior to cold storage reduced the incidence of chilling injury and conditioned fruits had similar or higher levels of health promoting compounds compared to fruits stored under <b>cold</b> storage without <b>conditioning.</b> However, results suggest that for short term storage of few weeks, storing fruits at 11 ?C was better for retention of most naturally occurring compounds. The fifth study focused on use of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) to maintain grapefruit quality and nutritional properties. Two MAP films, micro-perforated (modified oxygen, carbon dioxide and humidity levels) and macro-perforated (modified humidity only), were investigated for their influence on naturally occurring compounds and fruit quality under a prolonged storage period. MAP treatments did not have significant effect on ascorbic acid, limonoids and fruit quality parameters such as total soluble solids, acidity, fruit taste, decay and disorders. Based on our research, use of MAP films is recommended to maintain fruit quality and health promoting compounds. The sixth and seventh studies focused on variation in health promoting compounds, specifically, flavonoid pathway gene expression and volatile compounds present in ?Rio Red? grapefruit during fruit development and maturity. Overall expression of flavonoid pathway genes and related flavonoid content decreased as the fruits developed and matured, with the levels being highest in immature fruits harvested in June. Levels of limonene decreased as the fruits developed from June to April; while, nootkatone levels increased with fruit development and maturity. The eighth study investigated the effect of different ethylene concentrations on flavonoid pathway gene expression and related flavonoids in grapefruit. Significant effect of ethylene concentration was observed on flavonoids and furocoumarins as well as the genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis. Overall, significant influence of different postharvest treatments was observed on grapefruit health promoting compounds. We believe that this research will be helpful to the citrus industry to optimize the postharvest treatments in order to maximize their benefits in regards to fruit quality and nutritional value...|$|R
