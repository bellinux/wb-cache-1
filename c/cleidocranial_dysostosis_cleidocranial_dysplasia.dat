40|$|Background: The {{developmental}} anomaly involving skeleton {{and teeth}} is <b>Cleidocranial</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> It is an autosomal disorder with equal sex distribution. It {{is also known}} as Marie and Sainton disease, Mutational <b>dysostosis</b> and <b>Cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis.</b> Skeletal defects of several bones are noted in this disorder in the form of partial or complete absence of clavicles, late closure of the fontanels, presence of open skull sutures and multiple wormian bones. Case presentation: In this case report, we describe an otherwise healthy 28 year-old male with a chief complaint of chronic pus discharge from the mandibular left canine and premolar edentulous region. Conclusion: <b>Cleidocranial</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is very rare in occurrence, incidence being 1 : 1, 000, 000. Since early diagnosis of <b>Cleidocranial</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is essential for initiating the appropriate treatment approach, clinicians {{should be aware of the}} characteristic features. We report a case of <b>Cleidocranial</b> <b>dysplasia</b> because of its rarity...|$|R
30|$|Formerly, {{the disease}} was {{considered}} only to influence the skull, clavicle, and flat bone which undergo intramembranous ossification and, therefore, called <b>cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis.</b> However, it was reported from later findings that the disease also affects the bones formed by endochondral ossification as well and the patients with this disease exhibit abnormality in their skeletal system. Hence, {{the disease was}} named <b>cleidocranial</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (CCD) to describe the broad spectrum of symptoms [1].|$|R

40|$|<b>Cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} skeletal disorder, {{associated with}} clavicular hypoplasia or aplasia, delayed closure of cranial fontanels, brachycephalic skull, delayed exfoliation of primary dentition, eruption of permanent teeth, and multiple supernumerary and morphologic abnormalities of the maxilla and mandible. The disorder is caused by mutation in the CBFA 1 gene, on the short arm of chromosome 6 p 21.

50|$|<b>Cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> (CCD), {{also called}} <b>cleidocranial</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> is a {{congenital}} disorder that mostly affects {{the development of}} bones and teeth. The collarbones are typically either poorly developed or absent, which often allows the shoulders to be brought close together. The front of the skull often does not close until later, and those affected are often short. Other symptoms may include a prominent forehead, wide set eyes, abnormal teeth, and a flat nose. Symptoms can vary between people; however, intelligence is typically normal.|$|R

5000|$|In diphyodonts, {{the number}} of teeth that are {{replaced}} varies from species to species. In humans, a set of twenty deciduous teeth, or [...] "milk teeth", are replaced by a completely new set of thirty-two adult teeth. In some cases hypodontia or hyperdontia occurs, the latter in <b>cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> and Gardner's syndrome.

40|$|<b>Cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> is {{characterized}} by varying degree of hypoplasia of membranous bone {{and to a lesser}} extent of endochondral bone and dentition 1, 2. It is mainly inherited as autosomal dominant 1. One third are fresh mutations 1. Case report A four and half year old girl was admitted to General Hospital, Kalutara for investigation of short stature. Her head circumference was 51 cm (50 th centile), height 90 cm (< 3 rd centile), weight 16 kg (between 10 th and 50 th centiles). She had a brachycephalic head with open anterior fontanelle. Both clavicles were absent so that she could move her shoulders across the chest. There was no chest deformity. Her dentition was norma l. X-ray skull (figures 1 and 2) showed defective mineralization of the skull bones and widely open fontanelles. There was frontal and parietal bossing with multiple wormian bones. X-ray chest (figure 3) revealed absent clavicles, narrow thorax and short ribs which were obliquely directed downward. Physical features and x-ray findings confirmed the diagnosis of <b>cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis...</b>|$|R
50|$|Part of the {{functionality}} of the clavicle is {{to serve}} as a strut between the scapula and sternum, resisting forces that would otherwise bring the upper limb close to the thorax. Keeping the upper limb away from the thorax is vital for its range of motion. Complete lack of clavicles may be seen in <b>cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis,</b> and the abnormal proximity of the shoulders to the median plane exemplifies the clavicles' importance as struts.|$|R
5000|$|Anterior fontanelle is a {{diamond-shaped}} membrane-filled space {{located between}} the two frontal and two parietal bones of the developing fetal skull. It persists until approximately 18 months after birth. It is at the junction of the coronal suture and sagittal suture. The fetal anterior fontanelle may be palpated until 18 months. In <b>cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis,</b> however, it is often late in closing or may never close. Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle.|$|R

40|$|Pycnodysostosis {{was first}} {{described}} in 1962 by Maroteaux and Lamy. It {{is a rare}} autosomal-recessive disorder in which osteoclast dysfunction causes osteosclerosis. The name derives from the Greek words pycnos (dense), dys (defective), and ostosis (bone). The disorder {{is also known as}} Tou-louse-Lautrec syndrome, named after the French artist who suffered from pycnodysostosis. 1 The principal characteristics of this disorder are short stature, cranial dysplasia, clavicular dysplasia, total/partial dysplasia of the terminal phalanges, obtused mandibular gonial angle, and generally increased bone density. 2 Intraoral features include persistence of deciduous teeth with premature or delayed eruption of the permanent teeth, which can cause crowding. In addition, very poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, tooth misalignment, enamel hypoplasia, and a grooved palate have Pycnodysostosis is a rare genetic disorder and was first described in 1962 by Maroteaux and Lamy. The incidence of this anomaly is estimated to be 1. 7 per 1 million births. The principal char-acteristics of this disorder are short stature, prominent eyes with blue sclera, beaked nose, cranial dysplasia, exposed fontanelles and cranial sutures, clavicular dysplasia, total/partial dysplasia of the terminal phalanges, obtused mandibular gonial angle, and generally increased bone density. Some features of pycnodysostosis are similar to osteopetrosis and <b>cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis.</b> Therefore, it must be distinguished from osteopetrosis and <b>cleidocranial</b> <b>dysostosis</b> in order to diagnose it in in-dividuals of a younger age.
