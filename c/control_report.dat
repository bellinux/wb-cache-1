5000|$|In 2007 the United States {{implemented}} the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In order {{to comply with}} section 404 of the Act the company had to perform a top down risk assessment which necessitated the production of an [...] "internal control report" [...] that affirmed [...] "the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting." [...] This report has to include {{an evaluation of the}} effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures that are related to financial reporting. To meet this requirement organisations increasingly began to perform a control self-assessment using a recognised standard methodology. The organisation's external auditors, who are required to sign-off the internal <b>control</b> <b>report,</b> typically became more deeply involved in the control self-assessment process as it facilitated their later review of the internal <b>control</b> <b>report.</b> In the United Kingdom in 2011 the Financial Services Authority recognised in its recommendations for the improvement of operational risk management that the assessment of risks through a control self-assessment may be an important means of identifying risks. It also noted that for the assessment to be fully effective it had to be fully integrated into the financial organisation's risk-management process.|$|E
