40|$|Abstract [...] Resin or wrinkle free {{finishing}} {{is widely}} used in the textile industry to impart wrinkle-resistance to cotton fabrics and garments. Considerable loss in strength of the finished fabrics {{has been a major}} concern for the industry. The overall objectives of this work are to investigate the effect of resin finish on wrinkle recovery, tensile strength, bending length & DP ratings of cotton and cotton blended fabrics. However the changes due to crease resist finish are found to be statistically significant. In addition, the wrinkle recovery angle increases approximately 42 %, breaking strength reduces about 64 %, Stiffness increases 8 % after the <b>crease</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>finishing.</b> To find out the varieties of cotton blended fabrics in order to develop market viable new products is also another purpose of this project.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} awareness of environmental pollution and the extensive 	consideration of mankind health, {{there has been}} an increased demand for natural fibers 	in textile materials recently. As a typical natural fiber, ramie is an increasingly popular 	because of its excellent properties including a high tensile strength, excellent thermal 	conductivity, coolness, ventilation function, moisture absorption, and antibacterial 	function. However, ramie fiber and ramie fabric have some disadvantages such as poor 	elasticity, low wrinkle recovery, low resilience, itchiness, harsh handle, which decreases 	the competitiveness of ramie fabric in the high-grade garment-fabric market. It is 	necessary to use the advanced technologies in the dyeing and finishing for enhancing 	the competitiveness of ramie fabric. This study is aimed to study the natural dyeing and 	functional finishing of ramie fabric. At present, ramie fabrics are mostly dyed with synthetic colorants which can give rise 	to serious environmental pollution and potential harm to mankind health. Thus the 	natural and healthy features of ramie fabric are greatly weakened. In this study, ramie 	fabrics were dyed with the several natural extracts. But heavy metal ions, which lead to 	environmental pollution, are usually used as mordant in natural dyeing. In this study, the 	eco-friendly rare earth was used as mordant in natural dyeing of ramie fabrics. The 	influences of dyeing conditions were studied. The ramie fabrics dyed using rare earth as 	mordant exhibited higher color shade stability against pH variation. Using rare earth as 	mordant in natural dyeing apparently enhanced the color fastness to washing, rubbing 	and light of the ramie fabrics. As compared with Fe 2 + and Cr 6 +, rare earth was more 	efficient, resulting in decrease of mordant concentration in natural dyeing. Thus rare 	earth was effective mordant in the natural dyeing of ramie fabrics. One of the shortcomings of ramie fabric is its lower wrinkle recovery. The typical 	wrinkle <b>resistant</b> <b>finishing</b> via cross-linking usually decreases strength of cellulose 	fabrics. In this study, ramie fabrics were pretreated with liquid ammonia (NH 3) prior to 	wrinkle <b>resistant</b> <b>finishing.</b> Meanwhile, a kind of thermally reactive polyurethane (PU) 	emulsion was used as strength protector. The liquid NH 3 pretreatment was proved todecrease crystallinity of ramie fiber and bring about apparent swelling effect. As a result, 	the accessibility of the ramie fabrics treated by liquid NH 3 was elevated. The liquid NH 3 	pretreatment prior to resin finishing gave rise to better wrinkle resistant effect and less 	strength loss. The thermally reactive PU emulsion was proved to decrease strength loss 	of ramie fabric without influencing wrinkle resistant effect. Using liquid NH 3 	pretreatment and employing reactive PU as protector in the wrinkle <b>resistant</b> <b>finishing</b> 	of ramie fabric can raise strength retention up to 80 %. After 10 laundry cycles, the flat 	appearance and the crease retention of these ramie fabrics were over grade 3. 0. Developing electromagnetic shielding textiles has drawn increasing attention recently 	since electromagnetic pollution is harmful to mankind health. In this study, super critical 	carbon dioxide (scCO 2) fluid technology was used to develop electromagnetic shielding 	ramie fabric. The scCO 2 treatment could remove the impurities of the ramie fibers 	prominently. The scCO 2 fluid could result in the swelling of ramie fiber and thus 	increase the absorbency of ramie fiber to additives. Using scCO 2 fluid, the Palladium 	(II) -hexafluoroacetylacetonate could be impregnated into the ramie fiber under 	appropriate conditions. After thermal decomposition at high temperature, the Palladium 	film formed on ramie fibers. The ramie fabrics bearing Palladium catalyst were plated 	with a cooper film via electroless cooper plating. The cooper coated ramie fabrics 	exhibited good shielding effect. This study presented a new way for developing 	electromagnetic shielding fabric. Nanoparticles have been extensively used for the functional finishing of textiles. But 	the nano finishing of ramie fabrics has less been studied. In this study, the 	multifunctional ramie fabrics coated by TiO 2 nanoparticle were developed. The optimal 	dispersion conditions of TiO 2 nanoparticles in aqueous suspension were studied in 	details. A kind of hydrophilic silica aerogel product was proved to be suitable for 	serving as dispersant for dispersion of TiO 2. Using the TiO 2 suspension prepared in 	optimal conditions, ramie fabrics were coated with TiO 2 via a dip-pad-dry process. In 	order to enhance the finishing durability the ramie fabric were pretreated by citric acid 	prior to nano finishing. The ramie fabric finished with working bath containing 0. 8 g/L 	TiO 2 was proved exhibited excellent UV protection and antibacterial property, and high capability for decomposing formaldehyde. Treating fabric with citric acid before coating 	could improve the washing durability of the resultant TiO 2 loaded ramie fabrics. This study explored several ways for developing healthy and highly functional ramie 	fabrics with high added value. The resultant ramie fabrics exhibited high quality. The 	newly developed dyeing and finishing processes are supposed to be helpful for raising 	the competitiveness of ramie and expanding its application...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{worldwide}} aging population, {{methods have been}} sought to improve the efficiency of health care services. It is envisaged that remote monitoring of patients would form part of the solution. Monitoring of patients would be via the use of functionalised undergarments with the required technology embedded within. There have been significant advances in flexible electronics but metal wires are still required for electrical interconnects which compromise the comfort that the garment offers when in contact with skin. Electrically conductive polymers are considered as viable replacements for these metal wires. Electrically conductive polymers can have high electrical conductivities {{but they can be}} brittle due to their inherent stiffness. From studies reported in this thesis, various routes to the synthesis of PEDOT, which would lend itself to function in <b>crease</b> and wash <b>resistant</b> conductive inks, were investigated. The task was highly challenging due to the confliction between high conductivity and structural rigidity of typical conductive molecules. A series of monomers, described within, were designed, synthesised and characterised. These monomers provide a foundation for further syntheses to the subsequent novel electrically conductive polymers. In order to assess potential challenges in the formulation of <b>crease</b> and wash <b>resistant</b> conductive inks based on conductive polymers, systems containing PEDOT:PSS were designed, prepared and characterised. It was found that the use of just PEDOT:PSS as the coating for cotton fabric provided an electrically conductive coating which was susceptible to degradation during creasing and washing. To overcome this challenge, a composite of a synthesised latex and PEDOT:PSS was devised which provided an electrically conductive coated cotton fabric with an electrically insulating surface. The electrical resistance could still be measured by incorporating electrodes prior to the application of the final latex layer. Encouragingly, this composite provided a formulation having very low electrical resistances pre- and post-wash...|$|R

Electroless nickel has been used for many decades to provide a hard, corrosion <b>resistant</b> surface <b>finish</b> to engineering components. In recent years its application has been extended to the electronics industry for the production of solderable surfaces on printed circuit boards, which utilize a further thin gold coating to prevent oxidation of the nickel surface. The recent interest in the use of flip-chip technology in electronics manufacture has required the development of low cost methods for solder bumping of semiconductor wafers. The electroless nickel process has been considered as a suitable candidate for the deposition of a solderable under bump metallization (UBM) layer onto the Al bondpads. However, the extension of existing electroless nickel plating processes to this new application requires greater understanding of the technique. In particular, the coating of the small isolated bondpads on the wafer surface introduces difficulties that make the use of many commercially available solutions impossible. This paper reports the results of a number of experiments carried out to investigate the electroless nickel bumping of Al bondpads and highlights the issues that need to be considered when selecting materials and techniques...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic fibers, mainly {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET), polyamide (PA), polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and polypropylene (PP), {{are the most}} widely used polymers in the textile industry. These fibers surpass the production of natural fibers with a market share of 54. 4 %. The advantages of these fibers are their high modulus and strength, stiffness, stretch or elasticity, wrinkle and abrasion resistances, relatively low cost, convenient processing, tailorable performance and easy recycling. The downside to synthetic fibers use are reduced wearing comfort, build-up of electrostatic charge, the tendency to pill, difficulties in finishing, poor soil release properties and low dyeability. These disadvantages are largely associated with their hydrophobic nature. To render their surfaces hydrophilic, various physical, chemical and bulk modification methods are employed to mimic the advantageous properties of their natural counterparts. This review is focused on the application of recent methods for the modification of synthetic textiles using physical methods (corona discharge, plasma, laser, electron beam and neutron irradiations), chemical methods (ozone-gas treatment, supercritical carbon dioxide technique, vapor deposition, surface grafting, enzymatic modification, sol-gel technique, layer-by-layer deposition of nano-materials, micro-encapsulation method and treatment with different reagents) and bulk modification methods by blending polymers with different compounds in extrusion to absorb different colorants. Nowadays, the bulk and surface functionalization of synthetic fibers for various applications is considered {{as one of the best}} methods for modern textile finishing processes (Tomasino, 1992). This last stage of textile processing has employed new routes to demonstrate the great potential of nano-science and technology for this industry (Lewin, 2007). Combination of physical technologies and nano-science enhances the durability of textile materials against washing, ultraviolet radiation, friction, abrasion, tension and fading (Kirk–Othmer, 1998). European methods for application of new functional finishing materials must meet high ethical demands for environmental-friendly processing (Fourne, 1999). For this purpose the process of textile finishing is optimized by different researchers in new findings (Elices & Llorca, 2002). Application of inorganic and organic nano-particles have enhanced synthetic fibers attributes, such as softness, durability, breathability, water repellency, fire retardancy and antimicrobial properties (Franz, 2003; McIntyre, 2005; Xanthos, 2005). This review article gives an application overview of various physical and chemical methods of inorganic and organic structured material as potential modifying agents of textiles with emphasis on dyeability enhancements. The composition of synthetic fibers includes polypropylene (PP), {{polyethylene terephthalate}} (PET), polyamides (PA) or polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Synthetic fibers already hold a 54 % market share in the fiber market. Of this market share, PET alone accounts for almost 50 % of all fiber materials in 2008 (Gubitz & Cavaco-Paulo, 2008). Polypropylene, a major component for the nonwovens market accounts for 10 % of the market share of both natural and synthetic fibers worldwide (INDA, 2008 and Aizenshtein, 2008). It is apparent that synthetic polymers have unique properties, such as high uniformity, mechanical strength and resistance to chemicals or abrasion. However, high hydrophobicity, the build-up of static charges, poor breathability, and <b>resistant</b> to <b>finishing</b> are undesirable properties of synthetic materials (Gubitz & Cavaco-Paulo, 2008). Synthetic textile fibers typically undergo a variety of pre-treatments before dyeing and printing is feasible. Compared to their cotton counterparts, fabrics made from synthetic fibers undergo mild scouring before dyeing. Nonetheless, these treatments still create undesirable process conditions which can result in increased waste production, unpleasant working conditions and higher energy consumption. Therefore reducing pollution in textile production is becoming of utmost importance for manufacturers worldwide. In coming years, the textile industry must implement sustainable technologies and develop environmentally safer methods for textiles processing to remain competitive (Agrawal et. al., 2008).
