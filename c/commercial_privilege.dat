40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} socio-economic and socio-cultural dynamics of medieval Famagusta from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries. Contrary {{to the traditional}} historiography suggesting that Famagusta enjoyed <b>commercial</b> <b>privilege</b> {{after the fall of}} Acre in 1291 and lost its importance with the Genoese occupation of the city in 1374, this work offers more detailed analysis of economic and social dynamics of the late medieval Famagusta by examining wide-range of archival evidence and argues that Famagusta maintained its commercial importance until the late fifteenth century. In late medieval ages, Famagusta enjoyed economic prosperity due to its crucial role in Levant trade as a supplier and distributor of agricultural and luxury merchandise. It hosted nearly all prominent Genoese, Venetian, and Tuscan merchant companies and {{become one of the most}} important part of the Levantine trade policy of Venice and Genoa. Moreover, beside the economic growth Famagusta also witnessed social and cultural prosperity which enabled it to bear the title 'emporium'. People from almost every nation lived, visited, co-operated, and enjoyed the cultural wealth where the cultural differences were far from being social disintegration factor. By analysing notarial, fiscal, ecclesiastical and visual evidence from the period under examination, the main elements that are necessary to understand the evolution of medieval 'emporium', such as economic, social, cultural, administrative and urban dynamics, are scrutinized in order to draw more consistent conclusions. Regarding the lack of any monograph on this subject, this dissertation provides the first comprehensive analysis of economic and socio-cultural dynamics of late medieval Famagusta...|$|E

50|$|Having allied {{himself with}} an {{unsuccessful}} Lombard {{rebellion against the}} Latin Emperor, Henry of Flanders, Ravano was eager to find a powerful protector.

50|$|The name of {{the city}} is first found in a {{document}} from 1408. This is a grant of certain <b>commercial</b> <b>privileges</b> by the Moldavian Prince Alexander to the Polish merchants of Lvov.

50|$|Other similar {{exclusive}} commercial {{rights were}} granted in other colonies and later {{states of the}} United States of America.

50|$|The new treaty {{replaced}} the notoriously vague 'Philastre treaty' of 15 March 1874 (the Treaty of Saigon), which had given France limited <b>commercial</b> <b>privileges</b> in Tonkin.

The arrangement obtained under the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854 might perhaps be appropriately described as a partial "free-trade area" rather than as a "customs union" since the United States and the British North American Provinces were not assumed to draw up a common tariff schedule for their imports from the outside countries.

In 971, Pietro had to consent to end the trade with the Moslems.|$|R
50|$|Like the Treaty of Viterbo, the new {{treaty was}} signed in the Papal palace, which Pope Martin IV had moved to Orvieto after Viterbo was placed under interdict for imprisoning two cardinals.

Its practical motivation, however, was to re-establish the Latin Empire, under Angevin domination, and to restore Venetian <b>commercial</b> <b>privileges</b> in Constantinople.|$|R
50|$|Religious prejudice, {{xenophobia}} {{and fears}} of foreign political views, as well as maintenance of an Englishman's superior <b>commercial</b> <b>privileges,</b> all contributed to a conservative approach to early naturalization law.

However, {{with the passage of}} the Linen Cloth Act 1663 (15 Cha. 2, c. 15), the difficulties of naturalization started to be modified toward favoring categories of aliens who might prove of particular benefit to the state.|$|R
