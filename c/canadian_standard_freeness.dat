Highly impermeable {{wood of the}} Rocky Mountain variety was termed "refractory," while the pervious wood of the Pacific Coastal variety was termed "permeable. " Under constant pulping conditions, refractory Douglas-fir underwent less delignification than permeable Douglas-fir, giving higher screened rejects and lower screened yields. Pulp made from refractory Douglas-fir required less refining to achieve a given level of <b>Canadian</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Freeness.</b> Handsheet properties were direct functions of fiber characteristic variations. Paper made from refractory Douglas-fir heartwood had greater sheet density, tensile strength, zero-span tensile strength, stretch, and fold endurance.

Compared with the unpretreated pulp, the beatabilities of the pulp that had been pretreated by enzymes were improved significantly, such as a decrease of <b>Canadian</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Freeness</b> (CSF) {{in the range of}} 25 mL to 55 mL, a decrease of PFI mill revolutions from 1000 r to 5500 r, and a decrease of beating energy consumption from 12. 5 % to 22. 0 %. The values of brightness, breaking length, tearing index, bursting index, and folding number of the pulp pretreated by cellulase were improved by 1. 2 %ISO, 23. 7 %, 14. 8 %, 14. 6 %, and 50 % respectively, while that of the pulp pretreated by xylanase were respectively improved by 2. 1 %ISO, 16. 8 %, 8. 8 %, 8. 9 %, and 25 %. The optimal enzyme dosages were 25 IU•g- 1 and 25 IU•g- 1 for cellulase and xylanase, respectively. Fibre quality analysis results showed that the fibre length of pretreated pulp increased partly, fibre width and fines content decreased, fibres torsion increased, and fibre bonding got stronger.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between pulp properties and operating conditions in high consistency (HC) refiners at Holmen Paper AB were studied. Two types of HC refiners were investigated: the Andritz RTS refiner at the Hallstavik Mill and the Sprout-Bauer Twin 60 refiner at the Braviken Mill. The {{objective of the}} study was to clarify the relationship between the pulp properties and refining conditions such as electrical energy input, housing- and feed- pressure and plate wear in high consistency refining. The results of this project show that worn segments reduce the operating energy maximum input and the pulp and handsheet properties in negative aspects such as lower tensile- and tear index, and shorter average fibre length. Energy input is an important factor in the refining process and influence <b>Canadian</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Freeness</b> and the tensile index as evident from the probability residuals. Housing pressure and feed pressure influence the pulp quality and should be adjusted in order to optimise the refining process, although the effect is not as great as for energy input or plate wear. The results of the study indicate that Braviken Mill is operating at its optimum for the parameters measured in this project. Hallstaviks goal, to avoid fibre shortening and to obtain better tensile index, can be reached by making slight changes in pressure condition. ...|$|E

The results indicated that even though there were some substantial decreases in some physical properties of shrimp-chitosan-treated handsheets (brightness, surface roughness and surface water absorptiveness), their opacity was slightly increased. Most of the mechanical properties of shrimp-chitosan-treated handsheets such as the bursting index, folding endurance, tensile index, modulus of elasticity and tensile energy absorption were greatly increased with the addition of shrimp chitosan at 0. 25 % o. d. wt. of pulp to 0. 50 % o. d. wt. of pulp.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} use {{of recycled}} paper by the paper industry to support the Green Industry in the Indonesian Pulp and Paper Industry. But technically, there are some disadvantages of recycled fiber usage such as low drainage rate in which boosted the high energy consumption on drying process. As already known, the drying process consumes the highest energy in papermaking. To overcome this problem, the research using the concentrate of endoglucanase Egl-II has done. The steps of research included production of endoglucanase Egl-II; concentration by ultrafiltration method, modification of recycled paper fibers using endoglucanase Egl-II; characterization of paper sheet; and evaluation of energy consumption in drying the sheet of paper. The results showed that endoglucanase Egl-II had increase drainage rate of recycled fiber stock, which indicate by the freeness number. The number had increased by 80 ml CSF (<b>Canadian</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Freeness)</b> from 190 ml CSF to 270 ml CSF, and fiber retention increased by 0, 63 % from 99, 31 % to 99, 94 %. The dissolved cellobiose test results of recycled fiber stock by the enzyme treatment at low dosage showed that no degradation of cellulose, no change into soluble sugars. Characterization of sheet of paper that has been modified with endoglucanase Egl-II based FTIR spectra showed no change in functional group, SEM results showed on the fiber surface fibrils grow more, {{and the results of}} the XRD analysis showed area reduction of amorphous regions is about 6 %.

40|$|In control {{strategies}} for thermomechanical pulp refiners, {{the relation between}} energy consumption and production rate, often called specific energy, {{has been used as}} a key variable for decades. The importance of controlling the specific energy and thereby indirectly the pulp quality, has been an indisputable axiom for most engineers engaged in the pulp and paper industry. Recently, another competing concept based on refining zone temperature measurements has been presented as an alternative for improved pulp quality control, but so far no comparison between these two concepts has been made. In this study, the two concepts are compared based on a system identification procedure using “Auto Regressive Moving Average eXogenous” (ARMAX) models. The identification procedure adopted creates dynamic models that can provide predictions of the commonly used pulp quality variables <b>Canadian</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Freeness</b> (CSF) and Mean Fiber Length (MFL). These predictions are all based on the traditional process variables, i. e. production rate, dilution water flow, and hydraulic pressure, in combination with information of either the specific energy and or the temperature profile. The results show that it is not motivated to use the specific energy for predictions of CSF and MFL, as it gives limited dynamic information of the refining process besides what already is given by the three traditional process variables. Whereas, using the refining zone temperature measurements as inputs to the ARMAX models results in a significant improvement of the ability to predict the pulp quality variables. From a control perspective, this implies that refining zone temperature control is preferable to any concepts based on specific energy when it comes to minimization of pulp quality variations...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Bigleaf maple chips were pulped by the kraft, Magnetite, neutral sulfite semichemical, and refiner {{groundwood}} processes. Pulp {{from each}} process was refined in a Valley Beater and the handsheet {{properties of the}} refined pulp were compared to similar pulps made from other wood species. For the kraft process a different concentration of active alkali was used in five separate cooks while the other cooking parameters were kept constant As the level of active alkali was lowered the unscreened yield increased from 47 2 % to 55. 6 %. The average brightness of the kraft pulp was 41 % (% reflectance at 457 nm as measured by an Elrepho Colorimeter) The pulp strengths were generally improved with higher yields. Samples of the kraft pulp were bleached using a five stage bleaching sequence and the handsheet properties of the bleached pulp were evaluated. The Magnetite cooking schedule gave an unscreened yield in the 50 - 55 % range and a 62. 2 % brightness Samples of the Magnetite pulp were bleached using a three stage bleaching sequence and the handsheet properties of the bleached pulp were evaluated There were four neutral sulfite semichemical cooks made with yields ranging {{from a high of}} 90 5 % to a low of 76. 1 %. The corrugating medium test remained nearly constant as the yield varied, but the other strength values increased with decreasing yields The refiner groundwood was manufactured in three passes through a Bauer double disc refiner. The resultant pulp was beaten to 100 <b>Canadian</b> <b>standard</b> <b>freeness</b> and bleached to 58 1 % brightness using 1 % (w/w) zinc hydrosulfrte. In general, bigleaf maple can be converted into pulp possessing hands heet properties similar to pulp made from other hardwood species. The kraft and Magnetite pulps were bleached using standard bleaching techniques and the pulp lost very little strength in the process. The refiner groundwood pulp was disappointing because it lacked strength The kraft, Magnetite, and NSSC pulps were found to have strength properties competitive with the hardwood pulps presently being manufactured...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A {{study has}} been made of the kraft pulping {{properties}} of young Douglas-fir trees which were thinned from an experimental plantation. The purpose of the plantation study is to determine, whether two year old seedlings can be selected on the criteria of height and branch count for future desirable tree and utilization characteristics. The trees used in this experiment were 15 {{years old at the time}} of cutting. They were all pulped by a standardized kraft process, and the pulp evaluated according to TAPPI Standards. The test results were evaluated by an analysis of variance computer program at certain discrete refining intervals, 600, 400, and 200 <b>Canadian</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Freeness,</b> and 0. 7 and 0. 8 gms/cc sheet density. The trees grown from seeds germinated in the Corvallis nursery were, as a class, taller and larger in volume than their counterparts from the Salem nursery. Significant differences in tensile and bursting strengths, properties important to the linerboard industry, were found between these two classes of pulps, with the Corvallis pulps stronger than the Salem pulps. Lesser differences in these two properties were found when the pulps were classified according to the branch count of the parent trees, and no significant difference could be attributed to the tree height (Control vs. Super Seedlings) criteria. The differences in the other pulp characteristics were found to be non-significant by any of the criteria of tree classification. Two factor analysis of the pulp properties within nurseries disclosed no significant differences within the Corvallis nursery trees, but substantially more significant differences within the Salem nursery trees. The inference is that both pulp properties at age 15 and branch count at age 2 are predominantly influenced by hereditary factors. Tree height at age two is less influenced by heredity than branch count. Overall, the differences in pulp quality between the tested trees are small, which is not surprising in view of the high proportion of juvenile wood and the relative lack of differentiation. Larger differences may be apparent when the trees are older. The pulp properties compare favorably with those of other Douglas-fir kraft pulps prepared at the Forest Research Laboratory, but the influence of the juvenile fibers can be detected in this comparison also...|$|E
40|$|To make paper {{products}} water repelling, a hydrophobic chemical, known as size, {{is added to}} the pulp slurry in the wet end of the paper machine. It can be shown that size prevents water from penetrating the fiber structure, by measuring the contact angle between a droplet of water and a sized paper surface. More sizing will result in higher contact angle and thus less penetration. The traditional view on the penetration of water based inks, is that the ink behaves as water in terms of penetration. Thus, it is considered that sizing has the effect of preventing water based inks from penetrating paper. However, studies made by Viet Hoang and Huy Ly at the Australian Pulp and Paper Institute, APPI, revealed that normal sizing had no effect on the penetration of water based inks. The present work was an extended study of the effect of sizing on the ink penetration profile of water based inks. It was decided to study the effect of four levels of sizing on the penetration depth of two water-based inks. As the effect of refining and pressing was also believed to {{have an effect on the}} penetration depth, three levels of each were included in the study. Pulp provided by the Australian Paper’s Maryvale mill was beaten in the Valley Beater to three different <b>Canadian</b> <b>standard</b> <b>freeness</b> values. Unsized and sized hand sheets were made in the Moving Belt Drainage Former and were wet pressed to three different levels. The measured paper properties were contact angle, grammage and thickness. Sheets from different refining and pressing groups were then printed in full tone with yellow Hewlett-Packard and magenta Epson inks. The ink penetration profile was then analyzed using the confocal microscope. The results show that when printing with water-based yellow and magenta inks the effect of sizing on the penetration depth was generally insignificant. This shows that water-based inks do not behave as water when penetrating the paper sheet. Thus, sizing can not be applied to prevent ink from penetrating paper. The only cases where a clear decrease in penetration, due to sizing, could be seen, was for sheets made from pulp with a low level of refining and for highly wet pressed sheets.

40|$|Recovered {{paper is}} the most {{important}} raw material in the world for the production of paper and paperboard (Hoke, 2009). The availability of recycled fibre is coming under pressure from competition for biomass for different uses, such as construction materials, biorefinery applications and the production of energy (Hoke, 2009). As the demand for secondary fibre increases, paper made with wet strength resins are becoming a more important source of fibre. Currently, wet strength paper entering traditional recycled paper mills ends up in the waste stream (Hoke, 2009). So not only is this a lost opportunity, but also a significant processing cost for its removal and disposal. Therefore it will become increasingly necessary to ensure that wet strength products are firstly removed from comingled recycling streams, and then secondly utilised in an economical manner. This investigation used a wet strength product, Coated Carrier Board (CCB) from Amcor Cartonboard Petrie Mill to investigate variables including chemical type, chemical concentration, temperature and pulping time with the aim of studying the process economics using conventional equipment and chemicals. Pulp tests include <b>Canadian</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Freeness,</b> visual assessment and rejects %wt. Experimentation was completed in three stages, Scoping Laboratory Trials to investigate chemical types, Laboratory Trials to investigate the effects of variables and finally Industrial Pilot Scale Trials to observe real world effects. This study has presented an experimental methodology, investigated the effect of variables, and then considered their economic outcome. Finally, and most importantly it has been demonstrated that {{there is more than one}} way to achieve a desired rejects level. By observing the line of fit for the lowest cost for reject level, these optimum combinations can be selected on their merit on the basis of other operational aspects. Anecdotal evidence of the usable nature of the pulp was gained in industrial pilot scale trials. Use of chemical aids was found to be necessary for repulping CCB to achieve satisfactory rejects levels. Hydrogen peroxide was ineffective at repulping, expensive and hazardous. Hypo produced successful repulping results in tap water, however did not in mill white water, these were therefore eliminated as candidates. Potassium Persulphate used in conjunction with Sodium Hydroxide (Caustic Soda) exhibited a small but positive effect in laboratory trials, however failed to provide a positive effect in industrial pilot scale trials, therefore suggesting it is not an effective additive for CCB repulping. Of the chemical combinations trialled, it was therefore concluded that Caustic Soda was most effective and economical. The experimentation undertaken successfully observed the effects of the selected variables on rejects level. It was observed that time had the greatest and most consistent effect on reducing reject content. In Laboratory trials from 10 mins to 20 mins pulping caused an approximate 75 percent reduction in rejects and this was repeated in Industrial Pilot Scale Trials with thirty to ninety minute trials exhibiting approximately the same reduction. The repulping process was determined to follow first order kinetics with respect to rejects %wt. It was also established that even though the addition of chemicals and increased temperature contributes to increased cost per Accepts Tonne, when aiming for low rejects level these costs are necessary. Increasing pulping time, therefore energy, was found to have the greatest effect and paid for itself up to approximately 550 kWh/Tonne. The variable of second greatest effect was temperature, where an approximately 50 percent reduction of rejects was observed from 45 °C to 75 °C. In the social, economic and environmental climate requiring increasing use of recycled feedstock, it is an important result that repulping wet strength paper is feasible with existing paper mill recycling equipment and commercially available chemicals, and can likely be done below the cost of traditional wastepaper...|$|E
40|$|Thermal drying of a pulp {{sheet on}} a paper machine {{is one of the}} most {{energy-intensive}} operations in the paper-making process (Ghosh, 2011). The drying section of a paper machine removes less than 20 % of the total water eliminated from the wet sheet, but is responsible for 78 % of the energy consumption of the paper machine (Karlsson, 2009 & Biermann, 1996). Any enhancement of the dewatering of the paper sheet in the forming and pressing sections, thereby sending a sheet of lower moisture content to the drying section, would result in significant energy savings in the drying of the paper. Typically, the <b>Canadian</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Freeness</b> (or freeness) and the Water Retention Value (WRV) of pulp are used as a measurement for the dewatering ability of pulp on the wire of the paper machine (Hubbe, 2007). However, neither of these measurements was designed to predict the water removed from the wet sheet (TAPPI T 227, 1999, Scallan & Carles, 1972). The factors that influence the dewatering of pulp on the forming fabric and in the pressing section of a paper machine have been the subject of many studies (Hubbe, 2007). The first objective of the current study was to compile a literature review to build an dewatering of the pulp sheet. Pliable fibres may conform to each other, resulting in a sealing effect that inhibits drainage. Mechanical and enzymatic refining may induce external and internal fibrillation of fibres, and the generation of fines in the pulp. Treating the pulp with an enzyme, specifically endoglucanase, may enhance the susceptibility of the fibres to development by mechanical refining. In the current study, the dewatering of pulp was analysed at pilot scale in order to test which pulp measurements best predicted its forming and pressing performance. A hardwood pulp, composed of Eucalyptus grandis, was refined in a pilot refiner and yielded samples over a range of refining energies. The conventional dewatering measurements, freeness and WRV, were performed on the pulp samples and related to the dewatering performance of the handsheets produced therefrom. The formability (water removed during forming) and pressibility (water removed during pressing) of the handsheets were also determined, and compared to the freeness and WRV of the pulps. It was found that the formability of a handsheet was a much stronger predictor of its dewatering performance than either the freeness or WRV of the pulp. Formability was likely the best predictor of handsheet dewatering because it was a direct measurement of the dewatering performance of a sheet on the forming fabric, whereas freeness and WRV both measured the dewatering of a thicker pad of pulp. The effect of the refining of pulp with an enzyme additive on its dewatering properties was also studied at pilot scale. An endoglucanase was incubated with a hardwood pulp, composed primarily of Eucalyptus grandis, and refined in a pilot refiner. The enzyme was added at four levels, including a control pulp with no enzyme. The dewatering properties of the handsheets formed from the pulp were tested and compared for each enzyme dosage. The morphology of fibres of each of the pulps was determined. It was found that increasing the enzyme dosage of the pulps resulted in the decrease of the dewatering ability of the handsheets. The number of fines in the pulp increased with increasing enzyme dosage. It was likely that fines were responsible for the restriction of pulp dewatering, as suggested by the choke-point hypothesis (Hubbe, 2007). Based on the extent of fibrillation and width of fibres, as well as the number of fines in the pulp, a model of the effect of the enzyme added on the dewatering of the pulp was proposed. Increasing the enzyme concentration in the pulp increased the susceptibility of the fibre to refining. An enzyme dosage of 100 g/t resulted in a more fibrillated fibre than found in the control pulp. However, the fibres of the pulp treated with the enzyme at a concentration of 200 g/t were less fibrillated, suggesting that the fibre surface was weakened to the extent that the fibrils were broke off during refining. The fibres of the pulp treated at 500 g/t were again more fibrillated, suggesting the occurrence of secondary fibrillation of the fibre at this high enzyme dosage. The fibres of the pulps treated at 500 and 200 g/t were also narrower, suggesting the loss of fibre material.

40|$|Globally, {{mechanical}} pulping consumes {{much energy}} (approximately 150 TWh of electric energy annually, approximately 27 Finnish nuclear reactors {{would be needed}} to produce this amount), and the paper consumption has been increasing despite the visions of a paper-free office. The research field has strived for energy efficiency for decades, and in recent years, innovations utilizing repetitive compressive loading have yielded significant energy savings. However, the fundamental physical reason for the energy efficiency of this technique is unknown it has been hypothesized that the compressive loading generates fatigue in the wood, resulting in an energy efficient process. In this thesis the physical question what is the significance of fatigue for mechanical pulping is broken down into five sub-questions: 1) can we model the repetitive compressive loading in a controlled manner (e. g. controllable frequency, amplitude of impacts and moisture content) and quantify the resulting decrease in stiffness (Paper I), i. e. the amount of fatigue? 2) What are the changes generated in the non-linear mechanical properties and where is the generated fatigue localized (Paper II) ? 3) If the effects of fatigue in a well-controlled situation can be quantified, are the phenomena detected in the modelled process present in the actual industrial process (Paper III) ? 4) What is the effect of fatigue on the energy consumption (Paper IV) ? 5) How does the localization of the generated fatigue change in different wood geometries (radial and tangential, Paper V) ? The proposed characterization techniques include (a) quantitative through-transmission ultrasonics for bulk wood (Paper I) and for depth profiling (Paper II, III and V). The latter allows determining stiffness tensor components in wood samples as a function of depth. (b) Micro-computed x-ray tomography which offers an image of the microstructure of the samples (Papers II, III and V); (c) An encapsulated split-Hopkinson device (ESHD, Paper II) combined with a high-speed photography system, enabling research of in situ mechanical phenomena occurring during fast compression; (d) thermoporosimetry, measuring changes in the nano-size pores in the wood cell walls induced by grinding (Paper III) and (e) quasi-static materials testing, measuring the changes in the tensile and compression behaviour in various wood directions both in the elastic and plastic regime (Paper IV). To answer the first sub-question, the EES grinding process was mimicked: a custom made device was used to generate cyclic unipolar compressional pulses at 500 Hz along the radial wood direction. These pulses were found to reduce the measured radial stiffness by up to 90 %. A clear moisture dependence on the stiffness drop was discovered, lower moisture content yielding more fatigue. Above the fiber saturation point no change in the amount of fatigue as a function of moisture was discovered. Ultrasonic depth profiling results and X-ray tomography images answered the second and the fifth question: they revealed that the generated fatigue was concentrated to a layer near the sample surface in both radial and tangential wood geometries. This layer, 1 - 3 mm thick depending on the fatiguing parameters, comprised a zone with saturated fatigue and a transition zone extending from fatigued to intact wood. A theory based on elastic energy storage was formulated to explain this localization. ESHD experiments combined with the quasi-static tensile and compression tests revealed that at nanoscale, the fatigue is generated between the cellulose microfibrils and the surrounding lignin-hemicellulose matrix. To answer the third question, it was shown that the layer-like formation of fatigue is present in the actual industrial process, confirming a hypothesis originating from the 1960 s. After this, in order to answer the fourth question, experiments were done with a laboratory-scale grinder, which indicated that compared to non-fatigued samples the fatigued samples could be ground into similar quality pulp (<b>Canadian</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Freeness</b> and fiber length) using less energy. This means that pre-fatiguing, revealed as a reduced radial stiffness, induced by repeated cyclic compression, reduces the energy consumption of the grinding process. This improvement was hypothesized to result from the previously detected, induced micro-scale damage into the cellulose lignin-hemicellulose matrix boundary, which makes it easier to liberate the fibers. The amount of energy used for pre-fatiguing {{was not included in the}} energy balance since we aimed to show whether pre-fatiguing wood reduces the energy consumption rather than to engineer an industrial process. The main conclusion is that inducing pre-fatigue can reduce the energy consumption of the wood grinding process. This could be done with a grinding surface comprising of two zones: a pre-fatiguing zone and a shearing zone. Paperin valmistamiseen tarvittavan massan tuottaminen mekaanisin keinoin (hionta, jauhaminen) kuluttaa paljon energiaa, ja niinpä mekaanisen massantuotannon tutkimus on jo pitkään pyrkinyt pienentämään kyseisten prosessien energiankulutusta. Väitöskirjatyössäni lähestyn tätä ongelmaa hiontaprosessin kannalta, ja pyrin vastaamaan kysymykseen: Millainen hionnassa käytettävän hiomakiven pinnan pitäisi olla, jotta prosessi olisi energiatehokas? Lähtökohtani oli 2000 -luvun alussa julkistettu keksintö, jossa todettiin, että syklinen puristaminen yhdistettynä perinteiseen hiomapintaan tuottaa massaa energiatehokkaasti. Tutkimuksessani selvitin ne puun ominaisuudet, jotka ovat hionnan kannalta merkittäviä ja määritin ne fysikaaliset ilmiöt, joilla voisi olla merkitystä energiatehokkuuden kannalta, ja tutkin niiden vaikutusta puun kuiduttamiseen. Väitöskirjatyössäni kehitin ultraäänimenetelmän, jolla voi määrittää näytteen mekaaniset ominaisuudet syvyyden funktiona. Lisäksi käytin röntgenmikrotomografiaa (jolla määritin rakenteelliset muutokset), Split-Hopkinsonin laitetta (jolla tutkin epälineaarisia ominaisuuksia), termoporosimetriaa (jolla määritin huokosten koon) sekä mekaanista jännitys- ja puristusmittaria (jolla määritin mekaaniset ominaisuudet jännityksessä). Tutkimuksessa määritin syklisen kuormituksen vaikutuksen puun mekaanisiin ominaisuuksiin. Tärkein tulokseni oli, että syklisessä puristuksessa puuhun syntyy mekaanisesti hajonnut pintakerros. Tällaisen kerroksen synnyttäminen hionnan yhteydessä näyttää olevan mahdollinen tapa vähentää energian kulutusta prosessoinnissa.
