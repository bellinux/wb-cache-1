5000|$|The {{proteins}} are {{toxic to}} animal cells, presumably attacking the cell membrane and rendering it permeable: {{this results in}} the inhibition of sugar uptake and allows potassium and phosphate ions, proteins, and nucleotides to leak from cells. Thionins are mainly found in seeds where they may act as a defence against consumption by animals. A barley (Hordeum vulgare) leaf thionin that is highly toxic to plant pathogens and {{is involved in the}} mechanism of plant defence against microbial infections has also been identified. The hydrophobic protein <b>crambin</b> from the Abyssinian kale (Crambe abyssinica) {{is also a member of}} the thionin family. Some thionins have cytotoxic activity and they are therefore interesting in the development of new drugs against cancer with novel action mechanisms. No thionin has yet been developed into an anti-cancer drug. Thionin is also a minor protein found in mustard (Brassica napus L.) seeds.|$|E

40|$|The general {{designation}} of thionins {{has been proposed}} {{for a family of}} homologous proteins that have been isolated from different tissues {{in a wide range of}} plant taxa and have been variously named purothionins, viscotoxins, <b>crambins,</b> etc. (see Garcia-Olmedo et al., 1989). The possible involvement of thionins in plant defense was first suggested, on the basis of their in vitro toxicity to plant pathogens, by Fernandez de Caleya et al., (1972). Those observations had been prompted by earlier reports concerning the antimicrobial properties of these polypeptides (Stuart and Harris, 1942; Balls and Harris, 1944). Work on the thionins, which has been actively pursued over the past half-century, has been recently reviewed in detail (Garcia-Olmedo et al., 1989). For this reason, earlier work will only be partially summarized in the present chapter, which will focus on recent developments concerning thionin genes and their potential role in plant defense mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The general {{designation}} of thionins {{has been proposed}} {{for a family of}} homologous peptides that includes purothionins, which were first isolated from wheat seeds (Balls el #/., 1942) and their homologues from various taxa that have been named viscotoxins and <b>crambins</b> (see Garcia-Olmedo el al., 1989). The crystalline protein material obtained from lipid extracts of wheat endosperm was designated "purothionins" because of its high sulphur content (Balls el al., 1942). This material was found to have bactericidal and fungicidal properties (Stuart and Harris, 1942), to inhibit fermentation of wheat mashes (Balls and Harris, 1944), and to be toxic to laboratory animals (Coulson el al„ 1942). The toxic properties of mistletoes were ascribed to the viscumin lectin and to a mixture of small basic proteins, designated - "viscotoxins" (Samuelsson, 1974).

40|$|<b>Crambin,</b> a small {{hydrophobic}} protein (4. 7 kDa and 46 residues), {{has been}} successfully expressed in Escherichia coli from an artificial, synthetic gene. Several expression systems were investigated. Ultimately, <b>crambin</b> was successfully expressed as a fusion protein with the maltose binding protein, which was purified by affinity chromatography. <b>Crambin</b> expressed as a C-terminal domain was then cleaved from the fusion protein with Factor Xa protease and purified. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and amino acid analysis suggested that the purified material was identical to <b>crambin</b> isolated from seed. For positive identification the protein was crystallized from an ethanol-water solution, by a novel method involving the inclusion of phospholipids in the crystallization buffer, and then subjected to crystallo-graphic analysis. Diffraction data were collected at the Brookhaven synchrotron (beamline-X 12 C) to a resolution of 1. 32 A at 150 K.

40|$|Conventional small-molecule {{methods of}} solving the phase problem from native data alone, {{without the use of}} heavy-atom derivatives, known {{fragment}} geometries or anomalous dispersion, have been tested on 0. 9 Å resolution data for two small proteins: rubredoxin, from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, and <b>crambin.</b> The presence of three disulfide bridges in <b>crambin</b> and an $FeS_ 4 $ unit in rubredoxin enabled automated Patterson interpretation as well as direct methods to be tried. Although both structures were already well established, the known structures were not used in the phasing attempts, except for identifying successful solutions. Direct methods were not successful for <b>crambin,</b> although the correct phases were stable to phase refinement and gave figures of merit clearly superior to any obtained in the ca 500 000 random starting phase sets that were refined. It appears that the presence of an iron atom in rubredoxin reduces the scale of the search problem by many orders of magnitude, but at the cost of producing `over-consistent' phase sets that overemphasize the iron atom and involve partial loss of enantiomorph information. However, about 1 % of direct-methods trials were successful for rubredoxin, giving mean phase errors of about 56 ° (for all E > 1. 2) that could be reduced to about 20 ° by standard E-Fourier recycling methods. Limiting the resolution of the data degraded the quality of the solutions and suggested that the limiting resolution for routine direct-methods solution of rubredoxin is about 1. 2 Å. With the 0. 9 Å data, automated Patterson interpretation convincingly finds the three disulfide bridges in <b>crambin</b> and the $FeS_ 4 $ unit in rubredoxin, and in both cases E-Fourier recycling starting from these `heavier' atoms yields almost the complete structure. Whereas <b>crambin</b> could only be solved in this way at very high resolution, rubredoxin could be solved by Patterson interpretation down to 1. 6 Å. These results emphasize the benefits of collecting protein data to the highest possible resolution, and indicate that when a few `heavier' atoms are present, it may prove possible in favorable cases to solve the phase problem from a single native data set collected to `atomic resolution'...|$|E

40|$|<b>Crambin,</b> a {{hydrophobic}} plant seed {{protein that}} exhibits sequence homology to membrane-active plant toxins, {{was incorporated into}} phospholipid vesicles. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that its structure in vesicles is nearly identical to its structure in 60 % ethanol solution, the solvent from which the protein was crystallized. The secondary structure predicted from the circular dichroism data of the ethanol solution closely resembles that determined by x-ray diffraction of the crystals. This agreement suggests that the x-ray structure may form a useful basis for modeling the structure and behavior of lipophilic plant toxins. Finally, because the structure of <b>crambin</b> has been determined in an organic solvent medium, it provides a protein standard for examination {{of the effect of}} solvent dipole moment on the circular dichroism spectra of proteins, which may be important for interpretation of data for membrane proteins...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} folding {{mechanisms}} of three small globular proteins: <b>crambin</b> (CRN), chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI 2) and the fyn Src Homology 3 domain (SH 3) which are modelled by a Go-like Hamiltonian with the Lennard-Jones interactions. It is shown that folding {{is dominated by}} a well-defined sequencing of events as determined by establishment of particular contacts. The order of events depends primarily on the geometry of the native state. Variations in temperature, coupling strengths and viscosity affect the sequencing scenarios to a rather small extent. The sequencing is strongly correlated with {{the distance of the}} contacting aminoacids along the sequence. Thus α-helices get established first. <b>Crambin</b> is found to behave like a single-route folder, whereas in CI 2 and SH 3 the folding trajectories are more diversified.

The new algorithm shows particular promise for potential energy minimization of large molecular systems. Usual implementations of Newton’s method require storage space proportional {{to the number of}} atoms squared (i. e., O(N 2)) and computer time of O(N 3). Our suggested implementation of the Truncated Newton technique requires storage of less than O(N 1. 5) and CPU time of less than O(N 2) for structures containing several hundred to a few thousand atoms.

In contrast to other recently proposed refinement protocols, we put a strong emphasis on consistency with widely accepted covalent parameters and computational efficiency. We illustrate the method for NMR structure calculations of three proteins: interleukin- 4, ubiquitin, and <b>crambin.</b> We show a comparison of their structure ensembles before and after refinement in water with and without a force field energy term for the dihedral angles; <b>crambin</b> was also refined in DMSO. Our results demonstrate the significant improvement of structure quality by a short refinement in {{a thin layer of}} solvent. Further, they show that a dihedral angle energy term in the force field is beneficial for structure calculation and refinement.

This model includes all degrees of freedom relevant to folding - all sidechain and backbone torsions - and uses a Go potential. In this study, {{we focus on the}} 46 residue alpha-beta protein <b>crambin</b> and two of its structural components, the helix and helix hairpin. For a wide range of temperatures, we have recorded multiple folding events of these three structures from random coils to native conformations that differ by less than 1 A dRMS from their crystal structure coordinates. The thermodynamics and kinetic mechanism of the helix-coil transition obtained from our simulation shows excellent agreement with currently available experimental and molecular dynamics data. Based on insights obtained from folding its smaller structural components, a possible folding mechanism for <b>crambin</b> is proposed. We observe that the folding occurs via a cooperative, first order-like process, and that many folding pathways to the native state exist. One particular sequence of events constitutes a ``fast-folding'' pathway where kinetic traps are avoided. At very low temperatures, a kinetic trap arising from the incorrect packing of sidechains was observed. These results demonstrate that folding to the native state can be observed in a reasonable amount of time on desktop computers even when an all-atom representation is used, provided the energetics sufficiently stabilize the native state.

In addition, flat-bottomed restraint potentials for representing dihedral angle and vicinal scalar coupling constraints have been introduced into CONGEN. An effective simulated annealing (SA) protocol that combines both weight annealing and temperature annealing is described. Calculations have been performed using ideal simulated NMR constraints, in order {{to evaluate the use}} of restrained molecular dynamics (MD) with these target functions as implemented in CONGEN. In this benchmark study, internuclear distance, dihedral angle, and vicinal coupling constant constraints were calculated from the energy-minimized X-ray crystal structure of the 46 -amino acid polypeptide <b>crambin</b> (ICRN). Three-dimensional structures of <b>crambin</b> that satisfy these simulated NMR constraints were generated using restrained MD and SA. Polypeptide structures with extended backbone and side-chain conformations were used as starting conformations. Dynamical annealing calculations using extended starting conformations and assignments of initial velocities taken randomly from a Maxwellian distribution were found to adequately sample the conformational space consistent with the constraints. These calculations also show that loosened internuclear constraints can allow molecules to overcome local minima in the search for a global minimum with respect to both the NMR-derived constraints and conformational energy. This protocol and the modified version of the CONGEN program described here are shown to be reliable and robust, and are applicable generally for protein structure determination by dynamical simulated annealing using NMR data...|$|E

40|$|The work {{described}} here had as its goal {{the development of}} new techniques for very rapid synthesis of longer peptides. Current methods are often time-consuming and sometimes completely ineffective due to the incursion of peptide aggregation which may interfere with chain extension. Attention was directed to the three main problems in current methodologies: inefficient protecting groups, inefficient coupling reagents and problems due to peptide aggregation. ^ A new protecting group, more effective than the common Fmoc residue, was adopted for the present studies. An unforeseen by-product of these studies was the accidental observation that Bsmoc amino acids are more reactive than Fmoc amino acids as acylating agents as shown in competition experiments. This effect should increase the efficiency of the former for longer peptides. ^ As coupling reagent, O-HATU was adopted as the best of the currently available activators and in addition a new reagent, t-Bu-Dtp-OAt, was developed and shown to be equal in effectiveness to O-HATU. ^ The third problem, aggregation, was given the greatest amount of attention in these studies. While carrying out the first Bsmoc-based syntheses of longer peptides we identified the presence of some by-products of the same molecular weight as the target peptide. These were identified as depsipeptides which were formed at threonine positions during the final TFA treatment which removed the peptide from the resin during solid phase synthesis. The structures of these materials were proved by authentic syntheses and curiously these synthesis occurred very efficiently, showing no aggregation problems. Then the depsipeptide was converted to the desired peptide via a basic buffer. Fortunately this effect also led to greater solubility for the ester sequence thus making purification easier. Once this new technique or modifications involving the new N-dicyclopropylmethyl backbone protectant had been identified it was applied to the superfast synthesis of several difficult sequences, e. g. the JR 10 -mer, the JR 26 -mer, <b>Crambin</b> (16 - 46), <b>Crambin</b> (1 - 46) and the extremely difficult Aβ(1 - 43) amyloid peptide. ...|$|E

We discuss some general implications of an Artificial Life approach to protein folding which makes an attempt at simulating the actual folding process rather than just trying to predict its final result. 1 Introduction The prediction of the three-dimensional structure of proteins is a great challenge both for the difficulty of the task and for the importance of the problem. While computational approaches appear to be natural candidates to solv [...] ...|$|E
