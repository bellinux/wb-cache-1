5|$|Grasshoppers are {{affected}} by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. This widespread fungus {{has been used to}} control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the infection is not usually lethal because basking in the sun has the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of a plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.|$|E
5|$|Redback spiderlings cohabit on the {{maternal}} web {{for several days}} to a week, during which time sibling cannibalism is often observed. They then leave by being carried on the wind. They follow light and <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of nearby logs or rocks before extending their abdomens {{high in the air}} and producing a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long gossamer thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. This behaviour is known as ballooning or kiting. Eventually, the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web. They sometimes work cooperatively, climbing, releasing silk and being carried off in clusters. Juvenile spiders build webs, sometimes with other spiders.|$|E

25|$|Every day (Japanese permitting) at pre–arranged times, {{the radio}} {{operator}} (with escorts) climbed {{to a high}} vantage point, usually necessitating a gruelling <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of some slippery, high, jungle-clad ridge, and sent the latest intelligence information and the group's supply requests etc., and received further orders in return. The radio operator was central to a mission's success and his capture or death would spell disaster for the mission. To avoid capture and use under duress by the Japanese, every SOE operative was issued a cyanide pill.|$|E
25|$|A permit is not {{required}} to hike the mesa. The entrance to the area is reached from Phoenix, Arizona by travelling north on the I-17 highway and exiting at Table Mesa Road. The hike to the mesa is 3 miles from the designated vehicle parking area. The hike consists of a total of six miles round trip on a rocky terrain which is made up of a blend of desert and semi-desert ecosystems. The <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the mesa, whose height is approximately 400 feet, is reached through a steep and narrow path that has a dangerous hundred foot drop. Removal of artifacts are strictly forbidden.|$|E
50|$|The Fang {{gets its}} {{popularity}} mainly during winter months. The {{reason for this}} is because at this moment of year, the waterfall will freeze into a thick ice pole, and climbers enjoy <b>climbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> <b>Climbing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> waterfall is very difficult, meaning the climbers must wear climbing material. Many enjoy climbing the 26 foot wide, 165 foot tall waterfall completely frozen in time and space.|$|R

25|$|Hillary and Tenzing {{were the}} first climbers to ascend this step, and they did so using {{primitive}} ice climbing equipment and ropes. Nowadays, climbers ascend this step using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas. Once above the step, it is a comparatively easy <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> on moderately angled snow slopes—though the exposure on the ridge is extreme, especially while traversing large cornices of snow. With increasing numbers of people climbing the mountain in recent years, the Step has frequently become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently {{up and down the}} mountain.|$|E
25|$|This week saw the Hurricanes {{take on the}} Cheetahs and Hosea Gear {{became the}} Hurricanes' hero after scoring a 90-metre try in the final moments of the game. It was also the team's fourth try of the game which gave them a bonus point {{on top of the}} win. The {{following}} day, the Chiefs thrashed the Western Force 64–36, a game which saw a total of 14 tries being scored, nine of which were scored by the Chiefs, with Roy Kinikinilau and Brendon Leonard each getting hat-tricks. The Crusaders then defeated the Highlanders to <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the table. The Blues lost to the Sharks at home, going down by 7 points, and the Waratahs won only their second game this season, defeating the Reds, who sit {{at the bottom of the}} table.

25|$|Instead, in 2012 English Heritage and Heritage at Risk {{agreed to}} fund {{restoration}} {{work on the}} church. The work, which was scheduled to start in 2013, has now been completed to include the stabilising of the ruin and putting in a gravel pathway inside the church; and restoring a spiral staircase and providing a viewing platform to allow visitors to <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the tower and observe the view. Currently the tower tours run daily at 10am and 2pm. Visitors may need to telephone ahead (there is a number to call {{at the site of}} the church) as the tours are run by volunteers. Further planned work will then include building a heritage centre next to the church building. The total cost of completing the project is stated to be £225,000, of which £75,000 is to be contributed by English Heritage and £100,000 by Heritage at Risk. The remaining balance of £50,000, to be used for the stabilisation and restoration, is to be funded by Waste Recycling Environmental Limited's Heritage Fund.|$|E

25|$|Broadcast 1 February 1995, {{this episode}} {{examines}} how plants either share environments harmoniously or compete for dominance within them. Attenborough highlights the 1987 storm and the devastation it caused. However, for some species, {{it was that}} opportunity for which they had lain dormant for many years. The space left by uprooted trees is soon filled by others who move relatively swiftly towards the light. The oak {{is one of the}} strongest and longest-lived, and other, lesser plants nearby must wait until the spring to flourish before the light above is extinguished by leaves. Tropical forests are green throughout the year, so brute force is needed for a successful <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the canopy: the rattan is an example that has the longest stem of any plant. As its name suggests, the strangler fig 'throttles' its host by growing around it and cutting off essential water and light. Some can take advantage of a fallen tree by setting down roots on the now horizontal trunk and getting nutriment from the surrounding moss and the fungi on the dead bark. The mountain ash (eucalyptus regnans) grows so tall, that regeneration becomes a considerable problem. It is easily flammable, so its solution is to shed its seeds during a forest fire and sacrifice itself. It therefore relies on the periodic near-destruction of its surroundings in order to survive. Attenborough observes that catastrophes such as fire and drought, while initially detrimental to wildlife, eventually allow for deserted habitats to be reborn.|$|E
25|$|Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser): A young, ambitious account {{executive}} {{from an old}} New York family with connections and a privileged background. Often displaying recurring lapses in experience and judgement, Campbell's ruthless <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> causes him to attempt to blackmail Don Draper with the Dick Whitman information he has learned, {{but it does not}} work. He and Don are antagonistic some of the time, but later develop a grudging respect for each other, culminating in Don's approaching Pete over Ken Cosgrove when forming a new agency. Campbell and his wife, Trudy, were unable to conceive a child early in their marriage, and he only learned of his child with Olson at the Season 2 finale. He and Trudy do conceive a daughter, Tammy, late in Season 4. At the end of Season 3, dissatisfied with his treatment at Sterling Cooper regarding a promotion, he secretly plans to leave the firm. Unaware of this, Don Draper approaches Campbell with an offer to join his new firm as long as Pete brings accounts worth $8 million of cash flow. Campbell decides to join Draper, with the condition that he be made a partner, though his surname does not appear in the new firm's name (Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce). Campbell {{is one of the few}} characters in the show who does not smoke cigarettes, though he is seen smoking marijuana on one occasion. He looks up to Don in many ways. Campbell is often shown cheating on his wife, and is not above manipulating and blackmailing women to get them to sleep with him. While Pete and Trudy separate in Season 6 after another one of his affairs, the two reconcile at the end of the series as Pete takes a lucrative offer with Learjet in Wichita, Kansas.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the opening}} match, AAA paid {{homage to the}} promotion's founder, Antonio Peña, while the ring crew set up a steel cage for the second match of the evening, a four-way Parejas Suicidas match, {{featuring}} the teams of Chessman and Juventud Guerrera, Extreme Tiger and Halloween, Jack Evans and Teddy Hart, and Joe Líder and Psicosis. The match was contested under escape rules, with all eight participants starting inside the cage and after only one is left inside, that person will then wrestle his partner in a Lucha de Apuestas. Psicosis allowed Halloween to <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the cage, believing {{that he was going}} to dive back in onto his opponents, but instead Halloween betrayed his Perros del Mal stablemate and became the first man to escape the cage. Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, former AAA World Tag Team Champions, worked together against Psicosis and Teddy Hart, the other two Perros del Mal members in the match, but were then attacked by Juventud Guerrera, swinging a garbage can. Guerrera then became the second man to escape the cage and was followed shortly afterwards by Tiger, who dove from the top of the cage outside onto Halloween and Guerrera. This meant that the former La Familia de Tijuana was the first team to successfully avoid the Lucha de Apuesta. This was followed by Psicosis turning on and attacking Líder, who had publicly announced prior to the event that he hoped to lose the Parejas Suicidas match to get a shot at Psicosis' hair, before escaping the cage. Evans was the next to escape the cage, after avoiding Teddy Hart's attempts to stop him. Hart then climbed on top of the cage and dove onto Chessman and Líder with a moonsault, before climbing back up and escaping, saving himself and Evans from a Hair vs. Hair match and leaving only Chessman and Líder inside. Psicosis, realizing he was in danger of being forced to a Hair vs. Hair match, climbed up the cage and put his hand out to Líder, offering to help him up. Líder grabbed the hand and started to climb, but was dropped to the mat following a kick from Chessman, who then climbed to the top of the opposite side of the cage to become the last escapee, meaning that the former La Hermandad 187 partners were forced to a Lucha de Apustas later in the event. As Chessman celebrated at the top of the cage, the lights in the arena suddenly went out, leading to Vampiro making a surprise appearance and pushing his rival down from the top of the cage, dropping him through a set of tables on the floor of the Arena Ciudad de México. Afterwards, Chessman was stretchered out of the arena, while Vampiro showed his support for Líder in his upcoming match.|$|E

Instead, he attempted to <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> rope and land on Koko stomach-first, but missed. The Bird Man then retaliated by performing several dropkicks and attempted a pin. Boss Man got his shoulder up to save himself from being pinned, and he slammed his opponent into the mat, allowing him to pin Koko for the win.|$|E

When the male larva reaches the third-instar developmental stage, it forms a delicate white cocoon and transforms into a pupa in early June. In late June or early July, females, which are neotenous and retain their larval form, re-emerge from the ground and slowly <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the host plant, where they wait until winged adult males, with characteristic plumes {{at the end of their}} abdomens, leave the cocoons and join them a few days later.
