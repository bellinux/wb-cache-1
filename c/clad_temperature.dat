40|$|Ladies and Gentlemen: The FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) is {{replacing}} the CRAFT 2 evaluation model (EM) with the RELAP 5 /MOD 2 -B&W (RELAP 5) EM as the evaluation model of {{record for the}} Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 1 (DBNPS) {{loss of coolant accident}} (LOCA) analyses. The new analysis of record involves a greater than 50 'F change in peak <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> for both large break and small break loss of coolant accident (LBLOCA and SBLOCA) analyses results. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 46 (a) (3), the DBNPS hereby provides notification of these changes in the calculated peak <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> for the DBNPS. The calculated peak <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> remains below the 10 CFR 50. 46 (b) (1) limit of 2200 'F. Enclosure 1 provides a summary of the new analysis, including an evaluation which concludes that the RELAP 5 EM is acceptable for use in DBNPS-specific LOCA applications.

40|$|A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) {{model is}} used in {{conjunction}} with the alternating conditional expectation (ACE) regression method to analyze the risk associated with the loss of feedwater accident coupled with a subsequent initiation of the feed and bleed operation in the Zion- 1 nuclear power plant. The use of the DBN allows the joint probability distribution to be factorized, enabling the analysis to be done on many simpler network structures rather than on one complicated structure. The construction of the DBN model assumes conditional independence relations among certain key reactor parameters. The choice of parameter to model is based on considerations of the macroscopic balance statements governing the behavior of the reactor under a quasi-static assumption. The DBN is used to relate the peak <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> to a set of independent variables that are known to be important in determining the success of the feed and bleed operation. A simple linear relationship is then used to relate the <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> to the core damage probability. 	To obtain a quantitative relationship among different nodes in the DBN, surrogates of the RELAP 5 reactor transient analysis code are used. These surrogates are generated by applying the ACE algorithm to output data obtained from about 50 RELAP 5 cases covering a wide range of the selected independent variables. These surrogates allow important safety parameters such as the fuel <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> to be expressed as a function of key reactor parameters such as the coolant temperature and pressure together with important independent variables such as the scram delay time. The time-dependent core damage probability is calculated by sampling the independent variables from their probability distributions and propagate the information up through the Bayesian network to give the <b>clad</b> <b>temperature.</b> With the knowledge of the <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> and the assumption that the core damage probability has a one-to-one relationship to it, we have calculated the core damage probably as a function of transient time. The use of the DBN model in combination with ACE allows risk analysis to be performed with much less effort than if the analysis were done using the standard techniques...|$|E

The methodologies for predicting the first two mechanisms in both the COBRA-SFS/RADGEN codes and the MIT Method are studied and compared. Conduction length factors are determined as those values which result in COBRA-SFS calculations generating the same peak clad temperatures for the same heat conduction problem as the MIT effective conductivity method. The functional dependence of these factors on pitch to diameter and wall to diameter ratios, fill gas and bundle size are derived theoretically.

The investigated design data parameters were the core pitch-to-diameter ratio, the core height, and the distance between thermal centres. The examined physical properties were the coolant’s conductivity, the fuel’s conductivity, the pump halving time and the heat transfer coefficient at the hottest fuel pin. The hottest inner <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> has been the reference output variable. The target {{of the study is}} to identify the input parameters that produce a stronger impact on the reference output variable. The statistical strategy followed in this {{study has been}} a two level fractional factorial design. Each factor (either design datum or physical property) is considered to take only two possible values, lower and upper, which are respectively the lower and upper values of the corresponding ranges. Since all possible combinations of the seven factors aren’t affordable from a computational point of view, a ‘wise’ selection of computer runs is done in a stepwise procedure. This procedure allows to discard non-relevant parameters at early stages and to pay attention to actually important factors. Within the ranges and uncertainties considered, three design parameters were identified as the most influential parameters, the core pitch-to-diameter ratio being the most influential one by far.

The design of an optimum LEU core for the MIT reactor is evolving. The objectives {{of this study are}} to benchmark the in-house computer code for the MITR, and to perform the thermal hydraulic analyses in support of the LEU design studies. The in-house multi-channel thermal-hydraulics code, MULCH-II, was developed specifically for the MITR. This code was validated against PLTEMP for steady-state analysis, and RELAP 5 and temperature measurements for the loss of primary flow transient. Various fuel configurations are evaluated as part of the LEU core design optimization study. The criteria adopted for the LEU thermal hydraulics analysis for this study are the limiting safety system settings (LSSS), to prevent onset of nucleate boiling during steady-state operation, and to avoid a <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> excursion during the loss of flow transient. The benchmark analysis results showed that the MULCH-II code is in good agreement with other computer codes and experimental data, and hence it is used as the main tool for this study. In ranking the LEU core design options, the primary parameter is a low power peaking factor in order to increase the LSSS power and to decrease the maximum <b>clad</b> <b>temperature</b> during the transient. The LEU fuel designs with 15 to 18 plates per element, fuel thickness of 20 mils, and a hot channel factor less than 1. 76 are shown to comply with these thermal-hydraulic criteria.

The evaluation of the margin to acceptance criteria, for example, the maximum fuel rod <b>clad</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{should be based on}} the upper limit of the calculated uncertainty range. Uncertainty analysis is needed if useful conclusions are to be obtained from “best estimate” thermal-hydraulic code calculations, otherwise single values of unknown accuracy would be presented for comparison with regulatory acceptance limits. Methods have been developed and presented to quantify the uncertainty of computer code results. The basic techniques proposed by GRS are presented together with applications to a large break loss of coolant accident on a reference reactor as well as on an experiment simulating containment behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{attached}} {{report is}} submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 46 (a) (3) (ii) to provide notification {{of a significant}} change to the calculated peak <b>cladding</b> <b>temperature</b> for the limiting {{loss of coolant accident}} evaluated for St. Lucie Unit 1. The large break loss of coolant accident (LBLOCA) has been analyzed for Cycle 17 and has resulted in an increase of greater than 50 OF over the last evaluation model peak <b>cladding</b> <b>temperature</b> (PCT). The new LBLOCA PCT is 20050 F. Framatome ANP (FRA-ANP) is the current fuel vendor for St. Lucie Unit 1, and performs the calculations to demonstrate that the Unit 1 emergency core cooling system (ECCS) performance conforms to 10 CFR 50. 46. FRA-ANP employs an acceptable evaluation model consistent with 10 CFR 50, Appendix K. The small break loss of coolant accident analysis PCT remains unchanged.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for the Canadian Gen IV Super-Critical Water-cooled reactor (SCWR) concept is the selection of fuel cladding materials. The Canadian SCWR concept will operate at a core outlet temperature of 625 oC and 25 MPa of pressure with peak <b>cladding</b> <b>temperature</b> reaching as high as 850 oC.
