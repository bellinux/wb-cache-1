40|$|Abstract Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to confirm the efficacy, safety, and {{expected}} palatability of amlodipine orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) [RACTAB formulation (Towa, Osaka, Japan) ]. We report the re-analyzed results of 1687 cases in clinical settings obtained through postmarketing surveillance in Japan. Method: Study subjects were patients receiving treatment for the first time with amlodipine ODT for hypertension under routine care. A multicenter <b>central</b> <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> was used for this prospective survey. The survey was conducted fromOctober 2008 to October 2010. The observational period was 12 weeks, during which time surveys on outpatient blood pressure, ad-verse events, palatability, etc. were conducted. Results: Blood pressure stabilized following treatment, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were favorably controlled. Adverse events observed were not significantly different from those observed during drug use trials of amlodipine formulations reported in 2003. Moreover, palatability of amlo-dipine ODT showed a 99. 6 % (227 of 228 cases) favorable patient acceptance, which is consistent with the initial design concept of RACTAB formulation. Conclusions: The results of this postmarketing surveillance study indicated that the efficacy, safety, and palatability of amlodipine ODT met our ex-pectations (dissolves quickly in the mouth, tastes good, and is not rough on the tongue). Accordingly, amlodipine ODT are believed to be an easy-to-use formulation for prescribing doctors, dispensing pharmacists, and patients receiving treatment...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe the DPCA database as a source of data for epidemiological research. Data to DPCA are collected prospectively on all claims and include information on patient factors and health records, system factors, and administrative data. Approval of claims is based on injury due to the principle of treatment below experienced specialist standard or intolerable, unexpected extensiveness of injury. Average processing time of a compensation claim is 6 – 8 months. Data collection is nationwide and started in 1992. The patient&# 39;s <b>central</b> <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> number, a unique personal identifier, allows for data linkage to other registries such as the Danish National Patient Registry.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to review the current selection model for French trotters. Data were obtained from the French <b>central</b> <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> for horses—and contained records of performance at the age of 2 through 6 of 183, 955 trotters born between 1975 and 1994, and 46, 629 of their mothers born after 1966. Genetic parameters were obtained for six traits that could be included in a revised model. Because of the absence of selection of mares in this breed, maternal–offspring regression analysis was used to estimate heritabilities and genetic correlations. Parameters were estimated per age, per trait and over the whole career. Heritabilities were generally moderate except for number of starts, which were low (0. 07 – 0. 13) and earnings at the age of 6 (0. 13). Regarding estimates per age, genetic correlations between binary traits and performance traits were generally high (0. 52 – 0. 99 for earnings and [- 1. 00]–[- 0. 53] for best time). Binary traits were all genetically similar in relation to performance traits. Regarding estimates per trait, genetic as well as phenotypic correlations decreased with increasing age difference. Heritabilities for career traits were generally higher than those for age traits. It was concluded that a model based on career traits could very well be used for the selection of French trotters, for both scientific and practical reasons.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} inflow of foreign {{patients}} seeking cross-border reproductive care in Belgium and the increased number of lesbian couples and single women who call for artificial insemination with donor sperm (AID), Belgian sperm banks nowadays face a shortage in donor sperm. However, {{since there is no}} <b>central</b> <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> for sperm donors in Belgium, no figures are currently available supporting this statement. Therefore a study was performed to obtain a detailed overview of the sperm banking facilities in Belgium. Questionnaires were sent to all Belgian centres for assisted reproduction with laboratory facilities (n = 18) to report on their sperm banking methods. The results showed that 82 % of the centres rely partially or completely on foreign donor sperm. Moreover, four of the thirteen centres that have their own sperm bank use imported donor sperm in > 95 % AID cycles. Our results show that in 63 % of the Belgian AID cycles imported Danish donor sperm is being used. Donor recruitment is mainly performed through the centre’s website (61 %) or by distributing flyers in the centre (46 %) and 9 to 180 potential donors have been recruited per centre in 2013. Eventually, 15 to 50 % of these candidate donors were accepted. Different criteria for donor acceptance are handled by the centres: donor age limits range from 18 - 25 to 36 - 46 years old, and thresholds for sperm normality differ considerably. We can conclude that a wide variation in methods associated with sperm banking is observed in Belgian centres...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Indonesia's recent {{economic}} and political history has left a legacy of widespread poverty and serious health problems, and has contributed to marked inequalities in health care. One means of responding to these challenges has been through a reconsideration of the professional roles of nurses, {{to enable them to}} deal with the range and complexity of health problems. However, there are currently a number of obstacles to achieving these aims: there is a serious shortfall in trained nurses; the majority of nurses have only limited education and preparation for the role; and there is no central registration of nurses, which means {{that it is impossible to}} regulate either the profession or the standards of care. This study aimed to establish the occupational profiles of each grade of nurse, identify their training and development needs and ascertain whether any differences existed between nurses working in different regions or within hospital or community settings. Methods An established and psychometrically valid questionnaire was administered to 524 nurses, covering three grades and coming from five provinces. Results Significant differences in job profile were found in nurses from different provinces, suggesting that the nature of the role is determined to some degree by the geographical location of practice. The roles of hospital and community nurses, and the different grades of nurse, were fairly similar. All nurses reported significant training needs for all 40 tasks, although these did not vary greatly between grade of nurse. The training needs of nurses from each of the provinces were quite distinct, while those of hospital nurses were greater than those of community nurses. Conclusion The results suggest that the role of the nurse is not as diverse as might be expected, given the different levels of preparation and training and the diversity of their work environments. This may reflect the lack of a <b>central</b> <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> and quality framework, which would normally regulate clinical activities according to qualifications. The differences in training needs between subsections of the sample highlight the importance of identifying skills deficits and using this information to develop customized post-registration education programmes. Together, these results provide a rigorous and reliable approach to defining the occupational roles and continuing education needs of Indonesian nurses. </p...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} seven GCC regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies active in the region in order to identify the strengths and weakness of the current GCC centralised procedure. The GCC regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical companies who had registered their products through the GCC centralized registration procedure and the national registration systems were recruited into the study and asked to complete the questionnaires specifically designed for this study. The regulatory review process in Oman was evaluated to identify areas for improvement in the system. Information on the total application numbers and approval dates were obtained directly from the Oman Ministry of Health archives. Another study was conducted to evaluate the regulatory review process and approval times of the remaining six GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Yemen) and the GCC central registration, with respect to review time for new and existing substances, to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the process and to propose strategies that could help the policy maker in the GCC to enhance the review process. The results of the Omani regulatory system showed no significant increase (p> 0. 05) in the total number of registered pharmaceutical products from 2006 to 2010. The approval time in Oman showed that there was a significant increase in approval times for pharmaceutical products from 2006 to 2010 (p< 0. 001). The findings show that although there was an increase in the approval time for all pharmaceutical company products, the median approval time for the five year period was 117 days. This was within the time limit (4 months) fixed by the health authority for the overall registration time. The comparative study of the GCC States showed a downward trend in the median approval time for most of the GCC States, during 2008 to 2010. However, the approval time for all approved products in the GCC States during this period varied from 60 days in Qatar and Oman (2009 and 2010) to 609 days in Saudi Arabia (2008). The main reasons for the decrease in approval time in the Gulf States were due to the positive effect of the Gulf Central Registration, the rise in the number of reviewers in some GCC drug authorities, and the parallel procedure used in the regulatory approval review process. The study of the regulatory review process of the GCC central registration showed that a total of 413 products (96 NASs and 317 EASs) were approved during the period 2006 - 2010 with an overall significant increase in the EASs (p< 0. 001). The approval times increased from 107 calendar days in 2006 to 265 in 2010 (p< 0. 001). The lowest approval time was for EASs submitted by the Gulf companies (134 days) and the longest for NASs submitted by international companies (346 days) (p< 0. 001). VI Both the regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical companies agreed that the centralised procedure is an effective system for authorising medicinal products in all seven GCC countries in one procedure and is the way forward in the future but there is room for improvement in the procedure and the follow ups. They also agreed that clear guidelines, transparency of procedures, effective interactions between authorities and companies, increase in the number of the committee meetings per year, use of electronic on-line submissions will improve approval time for registration of new medicines, enhance the quality of review practice and encourage the pharmaceutical companies to use the GCC <b>central</b> <b>registration</b> <b>system.</b> This research has enabled development of a new model of the GCC central registration procedure to be proposed for the GCC Health Authorities which could improve patient access to medicines in the GCC states...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of decision and policy making is the timely access to accurately and relevant information. At present the situation in some developing countries is that communication and exchange of information between the government agencies are still paper-based. It can often take weeks or months for one government agency to obtain the records it requires from another agency. The lack of communication between these agencies often results in duplication of efforts and inefficiencies. This lack of communication also means that agencies often produce more of the irrelevant albeit sophisticated information (such as the Statistics Division) than the essential information that is critical and actually needed by other agency for decision making.

It does this by analyzing the opportunity to integrate existing technology with the data available in existing databases and make it more valuable for future use. A case study of the Department of Local Administration, under the Ministry of Interior, and the Royal Thai Police Department is used to develop an understanding of how the utilization of data to a full extent can be beneficial in the government service. In Thailand, every Thai citizen is required to carry a national identity card. Personal data of each person such as date of birth, height, blood type, religion and occupation, including registered address and individual photograph image, are kept in the <b>Central</b> <b>Registration</b> Database <b>Systems</b> (CRDS). The CRDS is operated by the Department of Local Administration under the supervision of the Ministry of Interior. In order to maximize the benefits from this database, the CRDS is shared by other authorized government agencies. The Royal Thai Police Department is one of the government agencies that also share the information from the CRDS. Frequently, the individual registration database and photographs from CRDS are needed to support crime investigation. This research therefore, investigates how the Thai government could utilize the existing database system to aid in the crime investigation process. It then suggests an effective method of image retrieval to support police officers when searching criminal records from a <b>Central</b> <b>Registration</b> Database <b>Systems.</b> The research begins with an exploratory study of the use and sharing of information amongst the government agencies in developing countries.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the use of diversified appointment <b>registration</b> <b>systems</b> and explore the factors influencing patients’ <b>registration</b> <b>system</b> choices. Methods: A survey study using a questionnaire was conducted in West China Hospital in February 2012. Outpatients were randomly selected from different hospital departments and the questionnaire was distributed and collected on-site. Results: Data from 1, 009 patients were available for analysis. Of these, 63. 4 % used appointment systems to register while others chose a traditional queuing method to register. 114 telephone (30. 4 %) and on-site (22. 9 %) appointments were made, whereas other systems were less used by patients.
