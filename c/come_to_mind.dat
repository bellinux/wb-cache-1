25|$|A 2012 {{study that}} used virtual reality {{technology}} to study reported déjà vu experiences supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and {{the layout of}} a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) {{may contribute to the}} déjà vu experience. When the previously experienced scene fails to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect—that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.|$|E
25|$|While Petre {{designed}} many churches, schools, public buildings, {{and private}} houses, his largest and grandest project, the Roman Catholic cathedral at Dunedin, was never fully completed. The entrance facade and the nave are built {{to the original}} design, and reveal the cathedral as {{a prime example of}} the French Gothic Revival. St Joseph's Cathedral, standing next to St Dominic's Priory, is reminiscent of many of the great Gothic cathedrals of Europe, with its twin towers and central rose window—Chartres and Notre Dame <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind,</b> although the original design if completed with its tower would have produced a building more like Rouen Cathedral. The architect's intention was for a mighty structure, with the twin towers dwarfed by a lofty spire some 60 metres (200ft) in height, which would have been a magnificent edifice. In the event, the project stalled when a prudent Roman Catholic diocese reluctant to incur unnecessary debt with the onset of the 1880s depression postponed further work.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimates}} of likelihood {{associated with the}} optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event. Some researchers suggest that the representativeness heuristic is {{a reason for the}} optimistic bias: individuals tend to think in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, {{they are more likely to}} associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind,</b> rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they were looking at. Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in representativeness heuristics.|$|E

25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E
25|$|Research on priming and {{practice}} use single word tests to assess {{for the presence}} of TOT states. The first letter of the target word or a similar-sounding word is given in order to prime for the target word. Evidence that comes from the usefulness of priming {{and practice}} in reducing TOT states is that most information in TOT states is low-frequency; that is, it has not been used or recalled for some time. The recency of information use can influence the retrieval process of that information. The presentation of a prime is only needed once for it to facilitate TOT state resolution. Support for priming has been found in that when individuals are given the first letter of the word they are trying to recall, {{they are more likely to}} overcome their TOT state. When the prime is a related word instead of the first letter, an interesting effect occurs: When the prime word has similar phonology to the target word, an increase in the frequency of TOT states and a higher frequency of correctly recalled words when the TOT state is resolved is observed. Incorrect words <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> involuntarily that share similar phonological features with the target word. Thus, phonological similarity can both decrease and increase TOT states. However, it is possible to fix this problem by changing the syntactic class of the priming word. Priming words that are in the same syntactic class as the target word create no difference in TOT state resolution. The TOT state resolution was the same for priming words in the same syntactic class and unrelated priming words. If the priming word is being listed in conjunction with other unrelated priming words, then the position is of importance. The earlier in the list the priming word is, the less likely it is to help resolve the TOT state.|$|E

500|$|Controlled {{experiments}} with numbers {{date back to}} 1933 when the researcher Dietz asked Dutch people to name the first number to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> between 0 and 99. The number 7 was mentioned most, {{as it was in}} various later replicas of the study in other countries. The number 7 also came out on top in studies that asked people to name their favourite number. In an online poll by Bellos, columnist for The Guardian, over 30,000 {{people from all over the}} world submitted numbers, with 7 the most popular. All numbers under 100 were submitted at least once and nearly half of the numbers under 1,000. Marketing researchers King and Janiszewski investigated number preference in a different way. They showed undergraduate students random numbers and asked them to say quickly whether they liked the number, disliked it, or felt neutral. The number 100 had the highest proportion of people liking it (70%) and the lowest proportion of people disliking it (5%). The numbers 1 to 20 were liked by 9% more people than the higher numbers; the numbers that are the result of rote-learned multiplication tables (i.e. 2 x 2 to 10 x 10) [...] were liked by 15% more people than the remaining numbers. The researchers concluded that number fluency predicts number preference: hence multiplication table numbers are preferred over prime numbers.|$|E
500|$|Stockhausen's two early Electronic Studies (especially the second) had a {{powerful}} influence on the subsequent development of electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly {{in the work of}} the Italian Franco Evangelisti and the Poles Andrzej Dobrowolski and Włodzimierz Kotoński [...] The influence of his Kontra-Punkte, Zeitmasse and Gruppen may be seen in the work of many composers, including Igor Stravinsky's Threni (1957–58) and Movements for piano and orchestra (1958–59) and other works up to the Variations: Aldous Huxley In Memoriam (1963–64), whose rhythms [...] "are likely to have been inspired, at least in part, by certain passages from Stockhausen's Gruppen" [...] Though music of Stockhausen's generation may seem an unlikely influence, Stravinsky said in a 1957 conversation: I have all around me the spectacle of composers who, after their generation has had its decade of influence and fashion, seal themselves off from further development and from the next generation (as I say this, exceptions <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind,</b> Krenek, for instance).

40|$|The ease-of-retrieval {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} {{people use the}} ease with which information <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> as a heuristic in forming judgments (Schwarz et al. 1991). We examine the automaticity of the use of ease-of-retrieval as an input in judgments. We demonstrate that the ease-of-retrieval is used unintentionally, out-side of awareness, and effortlessly, along with other consciously applied inputs, to make related judgments. Once experienced, its impact follows through to judg-ments, even when it is discredited as a source of information. Results across four studies suggest that an automatic source of information (viz., the ease-of-retrieval) may merely have to be accessible to be used in a judgment. We propose a mere-accessibility framework as a variant of Feldman and Lynch’s (1988) accessibility-diagnosticity framework to explain these results.
