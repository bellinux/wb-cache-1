50|$|Until June 1970, it {{was formed}} of a {{dedicated}} set of R set carriages. It was then formed of N set carriages before {{being replaced by}} air-conditioned HUB/RUB <b>carriages</b> <b>released</b> from the North Coast Overnight Express in late 1988. In May 1990 it was again extended to Canberra, stopping at all stations south of Campbelltown.|$|R
60|$|It chanced that a {{few minutes}} before this time Grace Melbury, who now rose soon enough to breakfast with her father, in spite of the unwontedness of the hour, had been {{commissioned}} by him to make the same inquiry at South's. Marty had been standing at the door when Miss Melbury arrived. Almost before the latter had spoken, Mrs. Charmond's <b>carriages,</b> <b>released</b> from the obstruction up the lane, came bowling along, and the two girls turned to regard the spectacle.|$|R
50|$|The final {{withdrawal}} of Mark 1s from daily mainline use {{took place in}} 2005 (except for two three-car EMUs on the Lymington branch, withdrawn 2010) some 54 years since the design entered service. Mark 1s continue to be used on special charter trains, but this use {{is also likely to}} be much reduced as Mark 2 <b>carriages</b> <b>released</b> from service by Virgin West Coast become available to replace them. This will leave the preserved railways as the only places to ride on Mark 1 stock.|$|R
50|$|The {{carriage}} {{has been}} loaded on a stagecoach heading for Paris. But its weight eventually overturns the stagecoach into a river. A passenger seeks refuge on the river-floating carriage. He is identified as the rival driven away at the duel months ago. He drives the carriage to the shore and attempts to release the woman from it. Before he can do so Vieux Bois arrives, posing as a highwayman. He forces his old rival to keep his face on the ground. Then he enters the locked door of the <b>carriage,</b> <b>releases</b> his lady, forces his rival to enter it and throws it to the river again.|$|R

5000|$|The {{band has}} {{its origins in}} Carriage H, a Dunedin high school band which was formed in 1999 and won the 2001 Pepsismokefree Rockquest. Band members were Andrew Wilson (bass), Tim [...] "Tiddy" [...] Smith (guitar, vocals), and Michael Prain (drums). <b>Carriage</b> H <b>released</b> one EP, Power of Grey Skull in 2002 and disbanded shortly afterwards.|$|R
50|$|The {{first run}} of models {{featured}} a full brass body preassembled and painted, with onboard lighting included. Three Z-type <b>carriages</b> were <b>released</b> {{as part of}} the 1960s-era Spirit of Progress series, with a VFK and a VBK included in the boxed set of ten (which retailed at $5,500.00), and a further two, 4VBK and 1VFK, included in an expansion pack at $1,100.00.|$|R
60|$|William had {{got into}} the <b>carriage,</b> <b>released</b> from the embraces of his landlord. George bounded in afterwards, and flung his arms round the Major's neck (as they saw from the window), and began asking him multiplied questions. Then he felt in his {{waistcoat}} pocket {{and gave him a}} note. William seized at it rather eagerly, he opened it trembling, but instantly his countenance changed, and he tore the paper in two and dropped it out of the carriage. He kissed Georgy on the head, and the boy got out, doubling his fists into his eyes, and with the aid of Francis. He lingered with his hand on the panel. Fort, Schwager! The yellow postilion cracked his whip prodigiously, up sprang Francis to the box, away went the schimmels, and Dobbin with his head on his breast. He never looked up as they passed under Amelia's window, and Georgy, left alone in the street, burst out crying {{in the face of all}} the crowd.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} war recovery, more S type {{carriages}} were built. Starting from 1948 further AS {{cars were}} constructed, with 9AS and 10AS released to service on 2 December 1948; 11AS on the 22nd and 12AS on 29 March 1949, and 13AS on 20 May that year. 14AS entered service a year later, on 9 May 1950, while 15AS and 16AS were added on 4 and 12 December 1952. All of these <b>carriages</b> were <b>released</b> to service in the same livery as the previous red cars, with silver lines. The only noticeable change is the picking-out of some large underframe equipment in silver.|$|R
60|$|It was a <b>carriage</b> that, thus <b>released,</b> {{eventually}} drew {{up before}} the superior public edifice known as the City Hall. From it a woman, closely veiled, alighted, and quickly entered the building. A few passers-by {{turned to look at}} her, partly from the rarity of the female figure at that period, and partly from the greater rarity of its being well formed and even ladylike.|$|R

In March, they released another single, [...] "2 Ripped Sweets", followed shortly by Takashi's departure. Tsuguki quickly replaced Takashi and Dolly released their first EP, [...] "Cynical Closet" [...] (シニカル　クロゼット), on July 26. In November 2006. they began a three-single release campaign with Ussetsu Drop (鬱雪ドロップ), and continued in February 2007. with Shinshoku Rosetta (浸食ロゼッタ) and Suisai Palette (水彩パレット), all three singles bearing the [...] "Tricolor Opera" [...] (トリコロールオペラ) title.|$|R
40|$|A {{low-speed}} wind-tunnel {{investigation has}} been made of some aspects of the aerodynamic problems {{associated with the use of}} air-to-air missiles when carried externally on aircraft. Measurements of the forces and moments on a missile model for a range of positions under the mid-semispan location of a 45 deg sweptback wing indicated longitudinal and lateral forces with regard to both <b>carriage</b> and <b>release</b> of the missiles. Surveys of the characteristics of the flow field in the region likely to be traversed by the missiles showed abrupt gradients in both flow angularity and in local dynamic pressure. Through the use of aerodynamic data on the isolated missile and the measured flow-field characteristics, the longitudinal forces and moments acting on the missile while in the presence of the wing-fuselage combination could be estimated with fair accuracy. Although the lateral forces and moments predicted were qualitatively correct, there existed some large discrepancies in absolute magnitude...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{polymeric}} carriers containing dispersed magnetic nanocrystalline particles for targeted {{delivery of}} drugs in clinical practice has attracted {{the interest of the}} scientific community. In this paper a system comprised of alginate microparticles with a core of magnetite and carrying nerve growth factor (NGF) is described. The magnetic properties of these microspheres, typical of superparamagnetic materials, allow precise and controlled delivery to the intended tissue environment. Experiments carried out on PC 12 cells with magnetic alginate microspheres loaded with NGF have confirmed the induction of cell differentiation which is strongly dependent on the distance from the microsphere cluster. In addition, finite element modelling (FEM) of the release profile from the microspheres in culture, indicated the possibility of creating defined and predictable NGF gradients from the loaded microspheres. These observations on the <b>carriage</b> and <b>release</b> of growth factors by the proposed microparticles open new therapeutic options for both neuronal regeneration and of the development of effective neuronal interface...|$|R
40|$|The MK- 82 Joint Direct Attack Munition (GBU- 38) is {{cleared for}} {{carriage}} and employment {{for the entire}} F/A- 18 C aircraft flight envelop from the BRU- 55 Canted Vertical Ejector Rack (CVER). The GBU- 38 was certified for <b>carriage</b> and <b>release</b> {{through a series of}} flight tests. For the first flight where the store was released from the BRU- 55, the wind tunnel Captive Trajectory System (CTS) data, as well as NAVAIR and Boeing pre-flight predictions, showed no resemblance to the flight test results. The original NAVSEP and Boeing predictions considerably underpredicted the roll rate, and had the yaw rates in the opposite direction from the flight test telemetry results. Since the wind tunnel CTS trajectories had the same errors, the simulations obviously were missing an important feature of the trajectories. For the flight from the CVER there was a spike in the rolling moment during the ejector stroke. This roll spike was attributed to the misalignment between the ejector force line of action and the store c. g. A statistical approach was used to modify the ejector force characteristics to best match the flight test data. This modification gave an excellent match with the flight test results for all the succeeding test points. 1. 0 NOMENCLATURE BL: Aircraft Buttline, positive outboard, in.

40|$|Modern {{military}} aircraft employ weapon bays for <b>carriage</b> and <b>release</b> of stores. The clearance of these stores for release from aircraft may require several flight tests {{at a range}} of conditions where the trajectories of released stores are obtained through accelerometers located on the store. Although effective, this is expensive and time consuming and only limited flight tests can be accomplished at critical conditions. Predictions made using store release analysis through wind tunnels and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{have the potential to}} reduce the number of flight tests required for store clearance. The motivation for the current work, stems from the need to investigate <b>carriage</b> and <b>release</b> of a store from a weapon bay, idealised as a rectangular cavity, through a unique blend of disciplines comprising Computational Fluid Dynamics, Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD), Computational Aero- Aeroacoustics (CAA) and High Performance Computing (HPC). Detached-Eddy Simulations (DES) of flow in clean cavities were carried out to compare two cavities of different aspect ratios for configurations with doors-off and doors-on. Both cavities had similar acoustic signatures and the addition of doors channelled the flow causing acoustic waves to propagate further away from the cavity. DES computations were carried out for a store at different positions relative to a cavity that showed that a store at carriage position pacified the cavity acoustics the most. Fin tip displacements were small for a store at carriage position and exhibited buzzing characteristics. This was similar to the case where a store was positioned at the shear layer of a cavity but with slightly larger displacements. While fin displacements were not large, the results highlighted concerns for fin fatigue life. Comparisons between rigid and elastic fins showed small differences in loads, however, aeroelastic simulations showed that where resonance of structural and cavity modes occurred, large amplitude fin oscillations were predicted. Scale-Adaptive Simulations (SAS) were validated against experimental data for clean cavities and were found to be similar to DES results and could be run at a larger time-step. The cost savings and similarities of SAS to DES encouraged its use for store release computations. Store release computations from a cavity were conducted and the variability of a stores trajectory due to the unsteady cavity flow-field was investigated. Visualisations using Q-criteria highlighted instantaneous structures that were in contact with the store fins causing the trajectory to vary for different release times. Overall, the thesis suggests the use of SAS as an affordable method for analysing store release computations from a cavity and highlights the need for a stochastic evaluation of trajectories from transonic cavities. A study comparing different signal lengths for post-processing unsteady pressure data revealed that, the minimum CFD signal length required to capture all dominant tones was around 0. 05 s. Different post-processing methods for spectral content were compared and the use of Maximum Entropy Methods (MEMs), based on Burgs Estimator, was suggested as it not only captured dominant tones but also predicted the highest Sound Pressure Levels (SPLs), that could be used to produce the maximum boundary of a given signal...|$|R
