5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are <b>constant</b> current power supplies and <b>constant</b> voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. <b>Constant</b> current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively <b>constant</b> current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. <b>Constant</b> voltage power supplies hold the voltage <b>constant</b> and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept <b>constant,</b> since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E

As the degree of methoxylation and pH decreased, beta-elimination rate <b>constants</b> decreased while acid hydrolysis rate <b>constants</b> increased. Demethoxylation rate <b>constants</b> were minimal at pH 3. 0 and increased both at lower and higher pH.
