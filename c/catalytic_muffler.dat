40|$|Abstract—Emission {{regulations}} {{for diesel engines}} are being strengthened and {{it is impossible to}} meet the standards without exhaust after-treatment systems. Lack of the space in many diesel vehicles, however, make it difficult to design and install stand-alone catalytic converters such as DOC, DPF, and SCR in the vehicle exhaust systems. Accordingly, those have been installed inside the muffler to save the space, and referred to the <b>catalytic</b> <b>muffler.</b> However, that has complex internal structure with perforated plate and pipe for noise and monolithic catalyst for emission reduction. For this reason, flow uniformity and pressure drop, which affect efficiency of catalyst and engine performance, respectively, should be examined when the <b>catalytic</b> <b>muffler</b> is designed. In this work, therefore, the flow uniformity and pressure drop to improve the performance of the catalytic converter and the engine have been numerically investigated by changing various design parameters such as inlet shape, porosity, and outlet shape of the muffler using the three-dimensional turbulent flow of the incompressible, non-reacting, and steady state inside the <b>catalytic</b> <b>muffler.</b> Finally, it can be found that the shape, in which the muffler has perforated pipe inside the inlet part, has higher uniformity index and lower pressure drop than others considered in this work...|$|E

40|$|Exhaust system, {{the least}} {{concerned}} section {{by the people}} has the most effective role on the environment as it is that portion of an automobile through which exhaust gases get out from the combustion chamber to pollute the air by their contaminated contents. The exhaust system components like <b>catalytic</b> converter, <b>muffler</b> and resonator {{make it possible to}} let out the least possible contaminated gas from the engine exhaust manifold. The performance of the emission control system particularly by the catalytic converter and the noise control are the main concern of this paper. To make a comparison of the exhaust gas emission providing with catalytic converter or not, an exhaust gas analyzer was used to collect experimental data. All the experimental data and graphical representation concludes that the carbon content in the exhaust gas from the car, Toyota E- 90 has been reduced to a great extent with the help of catalytic converter & the noise has been reduced as well for the proper attachment of muffler in exhaust system...|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} head has an intake manifold and an exhaust manifold {{attached to the}} corresponding ports. The intake manifold connects to the air filter directly, or to a carburetor when one is present, which is then connected to the air filter. It distributes the air incoming from these devices to the individual cylinders. The exhaust manifold is the first component in the exhaust system. It collects the exhaust gases from the cylinders and drives it to the following component in the path. The exhaust system of an ICE may also include a <b>catalytic</b> converter and <b>muffler.</b> The final section {{in the path of}} the exhaust gases is the tailpipe.|$|R
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} {{survey was conducted}} in Houston, Texas on five trace metals in policemen, parking garage attendants, women living near freeways and three control groups of subjects. The controls were matched with the exposed groups for covariate information such as age, sex, smoking habits, ethnic background, socioeconomic status, hair color, and education. Each subject was sampled four times for blood, urine, hair, and feces, and these samples were analyzed for lead, cadmium, zinc, manganese, and copper. Lead and cadmium were correlated with airborne exposures but zinc, manganese and copper were not. The second part of this paper deals with a market study of platinum and palladium markets and a design of an epidemiology survey of individuals occupationally and nonoccupationally exposed to these two metals.

40|$|In this {{research}} {{it has been}} done characterization on Cr/Bentonit and Zeolit HZSM- 5 catalysts for ethanol catalytic process to biogasoline (equal to gasoline). Cr/Bentonit has high acidity and resistant {{to a lot of}} moisture, so in addition to being able to processing feed which a lot of moisture (> 15 %) from ethanol-water mixture, also it is not easy deactivated. Cr/Bentonit which is then used as the catalyst material on the process of ethanol conversion to be biogasoline and the result was compared with catalyst HZSM- 5 zeolite. Several characterization methods: X-ray diffraction, Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), and catalyst activity tests using <b>catalytic</b> <b>Muffler</b> instrument and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for product analysis were performed on both catalysts. From acidity measurement, it is known that acidity level of Cr/Bentonit is the highest and also from XRD result, it is known there is shift for 2 theta in Cr/Bentonit, which indicates that Cr-pillar in the Bentonite can have interaction. It is also supported by BET data that shows the addition of specific surface are in Cr/Bentonite compared with natural Bentonite before pillarization. Futhermore catalyst activity test produced the results, analyzed by GC-MS, identified as butanol and also possibly formed hexanol, decane, dodecane, undecane, which are all included in gasoline range (C 4 until C 12) ...|$|E
40|$|This review {{attempts}} {{to provide an}} overview of the interconnected industrial changes associated with compliance with the exhaust emission standards of the Clean Air Act of 1970. To understand the complex nature of air pollution problems, Federal legislation, and compliance with this legislation requires an understanding of automotive technology, petroleum refining, atmospheric chemistry and physics, economics, and public health. The endeavors of all of these different areas impinge {{to a greater or lesser}} extent on the final response to the Clean Air Act which is designed to safeguard public health. This overview begins by examining gasoline refinery practice and gasoline composition. Included in this discussion are average values for trace contaminants in gasoline, and an explanation of the function of the many gasoline additives. Next, exhaust emissions are characterized, average values of exhaust components given, and a summary of important atmospheric air pollution reactions presented. Emission control devices and sulfate emissions from these devices are described. This is followed by a complete discussion of methyl cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, a substitute antiknock for tetraethyllead. In the event TEL is legally banned from gasoline, or removed because it poisons the <b>catalytic</b> <b>muffler</b> surface, this manganese antiknock is the most eff;caous replacement. In this discussion, the adverse health effects caused by exposure to manganese oxide particulates, the possible exhaust emission products from this additive, are examined in detail. The review concludes with comments on automotive engine and gasoline composition redesign as an approach to automotive air pollution...|$|E
50|$|The {{consumption}} figures above {{provide no}} insight on environmental impact {{in terms of}} emissions. NASCAR vehicles are generally unregulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and in particular, they have no <b>mufflers,</b> <b>catalytic</b> converters or other emissions control devices. However, some local short tracks which run under NASCAR sanction require certain emissions control devices. Many short tracks run mufflers in compliance with noise ordinances at some tracks; {{in the early years}} of the Camping World Truck Series, some races were held at venues which required mufflers, a requirement still used in NASCAR's K&N Pro Series (East and West) and Whelen (North and South) Modified Tours.|$|R
5000|$|Most of UOP's work is {{not known}} {{to the general public}} since most {{applications}} are within refineries and petrochemical plants. However, one technology UOP helped developed is familiar to automobile owners. During the 1970s, UOP worked on pioneering a combined <b>muffler</b> <b>catalytic</b> converter. To help publicize their work they sponsored CanAm and Formula One teams. The race cars used were developed by Shadow Racing Cars. Many race fans were drawn to the team's innovative designs and underdog status. UOP finally achieved a goal when California adopted the catalytic converter after the UOP governmental relations rep, Donald Gazzaniga, helped push legislation through the state Senate and Assembly.|$|R
50|$|Free-flowing {{exhaust systems}} may {{maximize}} peak horsepower by reducing or eliminating back pressure; this is typically accomplished {{by making the}} path as straight as possible, using a consistent diameter throughout the system and eliminating obstacles such as catalytic converters and pre-catalytic converters or by replacing the muffler with a less restrictive (and usually louder) one. Despite the potential for increased performance by eliminating catalytic converters and other emissions control hardware, doing so will often render the vehicle illegal for street use in many jurisdictions. Other aftermarket modifications that bypass the <b>catalytic</b> converters and/or <b>mufflers,</b> such as electric or cable activated exhaust cutouts—which open and reroute the exhaust flow to bypass restrictions in the system—can similarly increase performance, though would likely be illegal in areas where tampering with emissions devices is prohibited, particularly when {{placed in front of}} the catalytic converters.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe current {{scenario}} of high {{growth rate of}} automobile usage, the automobile industry is forced to adopt the government emission norms to keep the environment green. Latest technologies have been developed in the automotive exhaust system to acknowledge the emission norms. Diesel oxidation catalyst and Muffler both are playing major roles in reducing emission and noise level as well. Diesel oxidation catalyst reduces CO and unburned HC emissions. Muffler reduces noise level of exhaust gases. Nowadays automobile industry is using CFD software extensively to analyze the flow properties inside the diesel oxidation catalyst and Muffler. Flow analysis helps to optimize the geometric design of Diesel oxidation catalyst to oxidize the CO and unburned HC of exhaust gases. In this present work we studied pressure drop and uniformity index of an existing exhaust system which consists of close couple catalytic convertor, under body <b>catalytic</b> convertor and <b>muffler.</b> Exhaust system has been modelled by using CATIA V 5 which is advanced CAD software. The substrate has been modelled as porous medium for analysis purpose. These models have been imported in CFD tool for analysis. After importing the CAD data inside the CFD software, with proper boundary conditions, the CFD analysis has been carried out. Based on the study, individual system contributions to the total pressure drop and flow uniformity have been analyzed and improvement areas of the existing system for better flow uniformity have been suggested...|$|R
