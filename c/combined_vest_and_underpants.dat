5000|$|Despite the {{noticeable}} {{limp and}} ungainly running style, which always {{attracted the attention}} of passers-by whatever the weather, each and every night Simms returned to Luton's Kenilworth Road ground in a despairing effort to regain fitness and play once again. For the duration of the war the ground was closed, but Simms gained entry to the ground each night by climbing up a drain pipe with the [...] "agility and ease of a practised cat-burglar". He then stripped down to his <b>vest</b> <b>and</b> <b>underpants</b> <b>and</b> raced up and down the terraces and completed lap after lap of the cinder track surrounding the pitch. This went on for months, until one morning the wartime caretaker arrived at the ground and noticed footprints in the deep snow. Fearing there was a burglar at large the police laid a trap and pounced on him the following evening, leaving Simms no choice but to confess everything.|$|R
500|$|A goal from Wright against Newcastle United, {{his first}} in seven matches, {{was enough to}} earn victory away at St James' Park.

On Boxing Day, an own goal by Steve Walsh helped Arsenal beat Leicester City 2–1 at Highbury. A draw at Tottenham Hotspur, who were welcoming the return of Jürgen Klinsmann left Arsenal in sixth {{at the end of the}} calendar year, 12 points behind Manchester United.|$|R
