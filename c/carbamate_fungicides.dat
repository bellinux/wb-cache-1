METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in six centres in France between 2000 and 2004. The cases were incident cases with a diagnosis of LN aged 18 - 75 years. During the same period, controls of the same age and sex as the cases were recruited in the same hospital, mainly in the orthopaedic and rheumatological departments. Exposures to pesticides were evaluated through specific interviews and case-by-case expert reviews. Four hundred and ninety-one cases (244 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 87 of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), 104 of lymphoproliferative syndromes (LPSs) and 56 of multiple myeloma (MM) cases) and 456 controls were included in the analyses. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % CI were estimated using unconditional logistic regressions. RESULTS: Positive associations between HL and occupational exposure to triazole fungicides and urea herbicides were observed (OR = 8. 4 (2. 2 to 32. 4), 10. 8 (2. 4 to 48. 1), respectively). Exposure to insecticides, fungicides and herbicides were linked to a threefold increase in MM risk (OR = 2. 8 (1. 2 to 6. 5), 3. 2 (1. 4 to 7. 2), 2. 9 (1. 3 to 6. 5)). For LPS subtypes, associations restricted to hairy-cell leukaemia (HCL) were evidenced for exposure to organochlorine insecticides, phenoxy herbicides and triazine herbicides (OR = 4. 9 (1. 1 to 21. 2), 4. 1 (1. 1 to 15. 5), 5. 1 (1. 4 to 19. 3)), although based on small numbers. Lastly, despite the increased ORs for organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, <b>carbamate</b> <b>fungicides</b> and triazine herbicides, no significant associations were evidenced for NHL. CONCLUSIONS: The results, based on case-by-case expert review of occupation-specific questionnaires, support the hypothesis that occupational pesticide exposures may be involved in HL, MM and HCL and do not rule out a role in NHL. The analyses identified specific pesticides that deserve further investigation and the findings were consistent with those of previous studies...|$|E

The present work studied the effect of carbendazim on the liver of albino rats and the possible protective role of Ginko biloba extract (EGB). Liver of carbendazim-treated animals showed histopathological and histochemical alterations. The histopathological changes include hepatic tissue impairment, cytoplasmic vacuolization of the hepatocytes, and congestion of blood vessels, leucocytic infiltrations and fatty infiltration. Histochemical results showed reduction of carbohydrates and total proteins in hepatic tissues. Moreover, liver function enzymes (ALT, AST) were elevated in sera of carbendazim-treated animals. Coadministration of EGB with Carbendazim improved the hisological and histochemical changes observed in animals treated with carbendazim. In addition, EGB treatment leads to {{a significant decrease in}} ALT and AST. According to the present results, it is concluded that EGB can improve the hepatotoxicity of carbendazim and this effect may be attributed to antioxidant properties of Ginko biloba extract...|$|R

Six resistant and five sensitive isolates were also evaluated in greenhouse assays on fungicide-treated plants. The isolates that were sensitive to thiophanate-methyl in vitro did not cause any disease on thiophanate-methyl-treated plants, and those that were resistant in vitro caused blighting on treated plants equivalent to the nontreated controls. The entire β-tubulin gene was sequenced for four resistant and four sensitive isolates. The resistant isolates all harbored a substitution of alanine for glutamic acid at codon 198 (E 198 A).

40|$|Cladobotryum dendroides (= Dactylium dendroides) has {{hitherto}} {{been regarded}} as the major causal agent of cobweb disease of the cultivated mushroom, Agaricus bisporus. Nucleotide sequence data for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of four Cladobotryum/Hypomyces species reported {{to be associated with}} cobweb disease, however, indicate that the most common pathogen is now C. mycophilum. This cobweb pathogen varies somewhat in conidial septation from published descriptions of C. mycophilum and lacks the distinctive colony odor. ITS sequencing revealed minor nucleotide variation which split isolates of the pathogen into three subgroups, two comprising isolates that were sensitive to methylbenzimidazole <b>carbamate</b> (MBC) <b>fungicides</b> and one comprising MBC-resistant isolates. The MBC-resistant isolates, which were only obtained from Ireland and Great Britain, clustered together strongly in randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR analysis, suggesting that they may be clonal. The MBC-sensitive isolates were more diverse. A RAPD fragment of 800 to 900 bp, containing a microsatellite and found in the MBC-resistant isolates, also indicated their clonal nature; the microsatellites of these isolates contained the same number of GA repeats. Smaller, polymorphic microsatellites, similarly comprising GA repeats, in the MBC-sensitive isolates in general correlated with their geographic origin...|$|R

Target compounds include several groups of emerging and persistent contaminants {{derived from the}} European priority list of the registration evaluation and authorisation of chemicals system (REACH) : organochlorine (8) and organophosphorus (2) pesticides, <b>carbamates</b> (2), <b>fungicides</b> (8), phthalates (2), alkylphenols (10) and bisphenol A. The recovery rates of the SPE gave levels ranged from 84 to 118 % with exception of some compounds that yielded lower (methamidophos (50 %), p,p'-DDT (60 %) and o,p'-DDT (72 %)) but all recoveries were acceptable. Low limits of detection (LOD) varied between 0. 2 and 88. 9 ngL(- 1) (except for HPTE and 4 n-octylphenol giving 161 and 220 ngL(- 1), respectively). A study of matrix effects was performed in order to evaluate the best and reliable calibration approach.

They were classified according to pesticides residues into control group (30 unexposed healthy adult males {{living in the same}} area), insecticides exposed workers group (55 adult males exposed to organophosphate and <b>carbamates)</b> and <b>fungicides</b> exposed workers group (10 adult males exposed to fungicides). The study was designed to investigate and compare the oxidative stress and immunomodulatory effects of pesticides exposure among agricultural workers according the level of pesticide residues in their blood which was measured by HPLC. The oxidative stress status has been evaluated by assessment of (SH-protein), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), total antioxidant capacity and malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition, the acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity was measured as a biomarker of toxicity. We used IgG, IgM, as immunological biomarkers to test the humoral immune function as well as TNFα as a biomarker of cellular immune function. Our result revealed statistically significant reduction of the activity of (AchE), antioxidant defense enzymes, total antioxidant capacity, IgM and IgG while, MDA and TNF levels showed significant elevations in insecticides-exposed workers versus control. Results of fungicides exposed workers revealed non-significant reduction of the activity of (AchE), antioxidant defense enzymes, IgM, IgG and TNFα levels while there was significant elevation of MDA level and significant reduction of total antioxidant capacity level...|$|R

Ces. & de Not and L. biglobosa Shoemaker & H Brun, is a major disease of winter oilseed rape in the UK. Annually, over 90 % of UK crops receive at least one foliar application of fungicide, but {{little is known about the}} sensitivity of the more damaging L. maculans and the less damaging L. biglobosa to these fungicides. The effects of flusilazole, tebuconazole and Methyl Benzimidazole <b>Carbamate</b> (MBC) <b>fungicides</b> (benomyl and carbendazim) on the germination of ascospores, conidia and germ tube growth of both species were examined. Isolates collected from different oilseed rape crops in England and Wales were assessed for their mycelial growth on fungicide-amended medium, and ED 50 values were calculated. RESULTS: Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa differed in their sensitivity to fungicides. Conidial germination of L. maculans was more sensitive to these fungicides than that of L. biglobosa. Isolates of L. maculans had smaller ED 50 values for mycelial growth for all fungicides tested than isolates of L. biglobosa. CONCLUSION:These results suggest that fungicide applications might affect the structure of L. maculans/L. biglobosa populations in UK winter oilseed rape crops...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Methyl {{benzimidazole}} <b>carbamate</b> (MBC) <b>fungicides</b> {{are used}} to control the oilseed rape pathogen Pyrenopeziza brassicae. Resistance to MBCs {{has been reported in}} P. brassicae, but the molecular mechanism(s) associated with reductions in sensitivity have not been verified in this species. Elucidation of the genetic changes responsible for resistance, hypothesised to be target-site mutations in β-tubulin, will enable resistance diagnostics and thereby inform resistance management strategies. RESULTS P. brassicae isolates were classified as sensitive, moderately resistant or resistant to MBCs. Crossing P. brassicae isolates of different MBC sensitivities indicated that resistance was conferred by a single gene. The MBC-target encoding gene β-tubulin was cloned and sequenced. Reduced MBC sensitivity of field isolates correlated with β-tubulin amino acid substitutions L 240 F and E 198 A. The highest level of MBC resistance was measured for isolates carrying E 198 A. Negative cross-resistance between MBCs and the fungicides diethofencarb and zoxamide was only measured in E 198 A isolates. PCR-RFLP was used to screen isolates for the presence of L 240 F and E 198 A. The substitutions E 198 G and F 200 Y were also detected in DNA samples from P. brassicae populations after cloning and sequencing of PCR products. The frequencies of L 240 F and E 198 A in different P. brassicae populations were quantified by pyrosequencing. There were no differences in the frequencies of these alleles between P. brassicae populations sampled from different locations or after fungicide treatment regimes. CONCLUSIONS The molecular mechanisms affecting sensitivity to MBCs in P. brassicae have been identified. Pyrosequencing assays are a powerful tool for quantifying fungicide-resistant alleles in pathogen populations...|$|R

40|$|The {{powdery mildew}} fungus Podosphaera fusca (synonym Podosphaera xanthii) {{is the main}} causal agent of cucurbit powdery mildew {{and one of the}} most {{important}} limiting factors for cucurbit production worldwide. Despite the fungus economic importance, very little is known about the physiological and molecular processes involved in P. fusca biology and pathogenesis. In this study, we isolated and characterised the β-tubulin-encoding gene of P. fusca (PfTUB 2) to develop molecular tools with different applications in powdery mildew research. PfTUB 2 is predicted to encode a protein of 447 amino acid residues. The coding region is interrupted by six introns that occur at approximately the same positions as the introns present in other fungal TUB 2 -like genes. Once cloned, the PfTUB 2 sequence information was used in different applications. Our results showed that the TUB 2 gene is a good marker for molecular phylogenetics in powdery mildew fungi but it is unsuitable for the analysis of intraspecific diversity in P. fusca. The expression of PfTUB 2 was proven to be stable in different temperature conditions, supporting its use as a reference gene in quantitative gene expression studies. Furthermore, an allele-specific PCR assay for the detection of resistance to methyl- 2 -benzimidazole <b>carbamate</b> (MBC) <b>fungicides</b> in P. fusca was developed based on the correlation between the single amino acid change E 198 A in β-tubulin and the MBC resistance phenotype. Lastly, PfTUB 2 was used as a target gene in the development of a high-throughput method to quantify fungal growth in plant tissues. The cucurbit powdery mildew fungus Podosphaera fusca, is a major limiting factor for cucurbit production worldwide. Despite its agronomic and economic importance, very little is known about fundamental aspects of P. fusca biology such as obligate biotrophy and pathogenesis. In order to design novel and more durable control strategies, genomic information of P. fusca is needed. In order to reduce genome complexity, in this work we aimed to obtain and analyse the epiphytic transcriptome of P. fusca as starting point. Total RNA was isolated from epiphytic fungal material composed by mycelia and conidia, and the corresponding cDNA library was sequenced using a 454 GS FLX platform. Over 676, 562 reads were obtained and assembled into 39, 346 contigs. Annotation data was acquired for 62. 6 % of the assembled sequences, identifying 9, 713 putative genes with different orthologues. In the transcript data set, the most represented protein functions were those with role in gene expression, protein metabolism, regulation of biological process and organelle organization. Our analysis also confirmed the existence of missing ascomycete core genes (MACGs) found in previous studies. To get insight into the plant-pathogen relationships, special attention was focused on the analysis of the pool of fungal secreted proteins. After analysis, 119 putative secreted proteins were identified, including 35 candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) specific for P. fusca. In order to validate the in silico assembly, a time-course transcriptional profiling of some selected CSEP genes was performed during the course of infection. The expression profile observed for these CSEPs was consequent with a canonical effector expression pattern, with a maximum of expression at the beginning of the infection process 24 - 48 h after inoculation. Our data open the genomics era of this very important cucurbit pathogen. Methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBC) such as carbendazim and benomyl are fungicidal compounds that exert their biological activity preventing cell division, due to inhibition of the polymerization of tubulin, the major component of microtubules. MBC fungicides have been widely used against powdery mildews (Erysiphales), a constant threat to many crops worldwide. Despite the effectiveness of MBC fungicides in disease control, their misuse in the past has led to the problem of fungicide resistance and thus the loss of efficacy. Although diverse mutations seem to contribute to MBC resistance in powdery mildews and other fungal pathogens, the most common mechanism of resistance against MBCs is provided by the substitution of glutamic acid to alanine at position 198 (E 198 A). However, the precise mechanism by which this amino acid change affects fungicide binding is still unknown. The aim of this work was to elucidate the mode of action and the molecular basis of resistance to MBC fungicides in Podosphaera fusca, the main causal agent of cucurbits powdery mildew in Spain. By a combination of techniques, we show that carbendazim, a paradigm of MBC fungicides, induces conformational changes to β-tubulin, leading to the formation of aberrant tubulin structures. Furthermore, by computational analysis we have evaluated topologically the interaction of the fungicide molecule and the target protein. Our results allowed us to propose a novel binding site for MBCs to β-tubulin in a protein region very close to the GTP binding site. In absence of more conclusive crystallographic data, our results provided new insights about the mode of action and resistance to MBC fungicides, information that could help on new fungicide design...|$|R
