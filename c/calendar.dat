This formed part of a more comprehensive system of Maya calendars which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics were {{essential}} in drafting the astronomical <b>calendar,</b> a lunisolar <b>calendar</b> that used the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. Use {{of the ancient}} Sifen <b>calendar</b> (古四分曆), which measured the tropical year at 3651⁄4 days, was replaced in 104 BC with the Taichu <b>calendar</b> (太初曆) that measured the tropical year at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 days. However, Emperor Zhang later reinstated the Sifen <b>calendar.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Han Chinese used astronomical studies {{mainly to}} {{construct}} and revise their <b>calendar.</b> In contrast to the Julian <b>calendar</b> (46 BCE) and Gregorian <b>calendar</b> (1582 CE) of the West (but like the Hellenic calendars of Classical Greece), the Chinese <b>calendar</b> is a lunisolar <b>calendar,</b> meaning that it uses the precise movements of the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. In the 5th century BCE during the Spring and Autumn period, the Chinese established the Sifen <b>calendar</b> (古四分历), which measured the tropical year at 3651⁄4 days (like the Julian <b>calendar</b> of Rome). Emperor Wu replaced this with the new Taichu <b>calendar</b> (太初历) in 104 BCE which measured the tropical year at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 days. Since the Taichu <b>calendar</b> had become inaccurate over two centuries, Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75–88 CE) halted its use and revived use of the Sifen <b>calendar.</b> Later, astronomer Guo Shoujing (1233–1316 CE) would set the tropical year at 365.2425 days for his Shoushi <b>calendar</b> (授時曆), the same value used in the Gregorian <b>calendar.</b> Besides {{the use of the}} <b>calendar</b> for regulating agricultural practices throughout the seasons, it was also used to mark important dates in the Sexagenary cycle—constructed by celestial stems (gan 干) and Earthly Branches (zhi 支), each of the latter associated with an animal of the Chinese zodiac.|$|E
5|$|The Lutheran <b>calendar</b> is most {{similar to}} the <b>calendar</b> of The Episcopal Church and thus to the Anglican <b>Calendar</b> of Saints, though it also bears {{resemblance}} to the Roman <b>Calendar</b> of Saints because it commemorates {{many of the same}} individuals. However, the Lutheran <b>calendar</b> differs from both in two very significant ways, aside from its emphasis on commemorating persons important to the Lutheran tradition.|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} <b>calendars</b> is best {{approached}} {{as a technical}} subject that has cultural and political dimensions. The functions of <b>calendars</b> – to enumerate days, months and years – can be achieved {{in a variety of}} ways. In broad terms Muslims expect their <b>calendars</b> to predict the phases of the moon, Christians expect their <b>calendars</b> to match the seasons of the year, and Hindus and Chinese expect their <b>calendars</b> to do both. These expectations can be met by different technical means, so that even among those who subscribe to a common set of expectations, there are invariably differences in the working <b>calendars...</b>|$|R

5|$|A full long count date {{consisted}} of an introductory glyph followed by five glyphs counting off {{the number of}} bak'tuns, kat'uns, tuns, winals, and k'ins {{since the start of}} the current creation.

5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating <b>calendar,</b> the Maya {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. The Maya set {{the beginning of}} their <b>calendar</b> as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count <b>Calendar</b> to fix any given day of the <b>Calendar</b> Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the <b>calendar,</b> specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E

40|$|The Indian <b>calendars</b> are interesting, {{but very}} complicated. Indians use both solar and lunisolar <b>calendars.</b> The solar <b>calendars</b> follow the sidereal year. The lunisolar <b>calendars</b> are of two types; some have months that run from new Moon to new Moon, while some have months that run from full Moon to full Moon. Leap months {{are a common}} feature of these lunisolar <b>calendars.</b> In {{addition}} to leap months, the lunisolar <b>calendars</b> sometimes skip months. One lu ar month can sometimes overlap three solar months, so the lunar month corresponding to the overlapped solar month is skipped. They also follow the Moon for the days, so sometimes they skip or add days. They {{are probably the most}} complicated <b>calendars</b> currently used in the world. There are also several regional variations. Specifically the two types of lunar <b>calendars</b> are used in northern and southern India respectively. Another important highlight is hat none of the Indian <b>calendars</b> takes into account the precessional motion of the ear h; therefore they have to be adjusted to arrive at the correct results...|$|R

The 2005 edition of the monthly <b>calendar</b> featured pictures of Yotsuba playing with animals such as lions, zebras, and kangaroos. The 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or reaching for a balloon. The photographs were by Miho Kakuta, with drawings by Kiyohiko Azuma. The daily calendars have a mix of original and manga artwork, with occasional captions, {{as well as other}} fun items – for example, the 2006 <b>calendar</b> had a game of shiritori ongoing through the year. The daily calendars run from April to March, following the Japanese school year instead of the <b>calendar</b> year.|$|E
