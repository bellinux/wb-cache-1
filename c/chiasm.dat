5|$|Pressure on {{the part}} of the optic nerve known as the <b>chiasm,</b> which is located above the gland, leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides, as this {{corresponds}} to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve; it is encountered in 75% of cases. Visual acuity is reduced in half, and over 60% have a visual field defect. The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected. If the part of the nerve between the eye and the <b>chiasm</b> is compressed, the result is vision loss in one eye. If the part after the <b>chiasm</b> is affected, visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic <b>chiasm</b> of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the cavernous sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion.

Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} biological markers that may be involved in the adhesiveness of craniopharyngiomas to optical <b>chiasms</b> and/or pituitary stalks. METHODS: We determined the complete pattern of integrin expression in three craniopharyngiomas by means of a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid microarray. We quantitatively determined the levels of immunohistochemical expression of the different integrins in a series of 37 cases and the pattern of immunohistochemical expression of 10 extracellular matrix components (acting as integrin ligands) in 7 optical <b>chiasms</b> and 11 pituitary stalks. We also quantitatively (computer-assisted microscopy) determined the levels of immunohistochemical expression of galectin- 1, - 3, - 4, - 7, and - 8 in 50 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas. RESULTS: The present study shows that at both the ribonucleic acid and protein levels, adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas express the alpha 2, alpha 6, alpha(v), beta 1, beta 5, and beta 8 integrin subunits, whereas optical <b>chiasms</b> and pituitary stalks express vitronectin, thrombospondin, and various forms of collagens. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that at least part of the adhesiveness of craniopharyngiomas to the surrounding tissue, such as optical <b>chiasms</b> and pituitary stalks, could be explained by the interactions between alpha(2 beta 1) integrin expressed by craniopharyngiomas and collagens on the one hand, and vitronectin expressed by the surrounding tissue on the other hand. In addition, a Cox regression analysis has revealed that the levels of galectin- 4 contribute significant information toward the delay in recurrence independently of surgical status.

Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic <b>chiasm,</b> and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} neurons in each pathway decussate (cross {{the spinal}} cord or brainstem), because {{the spinal cord}} develops in segments. Decussated fibers later reach and connect these segments with the higher centers. The optic <b>chiasm</b> is {{the primary cause of}} decussation; nasal fibers of the optic nerve cross (so each cerebral hemisphere receives contralateral—opposite—vision) to keep the interneuronal connections responsible for processing information short. All sensory and motor pathways converge and diverge to the contralateral hemisphere.|$|E

In larval optic <b>chiasms,</b> the protein is found on recently formed axon bundles, not on older ones. In developing visual neuropils, it is present in all columnar domains of specific layers. The number of irreC-rst-positive neuropil stratifications increases until the midpupal stage. Immunoreactivity fades thereafter. The functional importance of the restricted expression pattern is demonstrated by the severe projection errors of axons in the first and second optic <b>chiasms</b> in loss of function mutants and in transformants that express the irreC-rst protein globally. Epigenesis of the phenotypes can be explained partially on the bases of homophilic irreC-rst interactions...|$|R

Process C counteracts the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night.

25|$|Dolphin {{brain stem}} {{transmission}} time is faster than that normally found in humans, and is approximately {{equivalent to the}} speed found in rats. As echo-location is the dolphin's primary means of sensing its environmentanalogous to eyes in primates – and since sound travels {{four and a half}} times faster in water than in air, scientists speculate that the faster brain stem transmission time, and perhaps the paralimbic lobe as well, assist quicker processing of sound. The dolphin's greater dependence on sound processing is evident in the structure of its brain: its neural area devoted to visual imaging is only about one-tenth that of the human brain, while the area devoted to acoustical imaging is about 10 times that of the human brain. Sensory experiments suggest a great degree of cross-modal integration in the processing of shapes between echolocative and visual areas of the brain. Unlike the case of the human brain, the cetacean optic <b>chiasm</b> is completely crossed, and there is behavioral evidence for hemispheric dominance for vision.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{historical}} analysis of Jesus's resurrection miracles in the synoptic tradition, namely, {{the stories of}} the raising of Jairus's daughter (Mark 5 : 21 [...] 43 and par.) and the widow of Nain's son (Luke 7 : 11 [...] 17), and the story of the exorcism of a possessed boy (Mark 9 : 14 [...] 29 and par.), which can be considered a raising-of-the-dead story only in the Gospel of Mark. The analysis done in this thesis differs from other analyses in that it takes seriously both the oral and written nature of the gospels and the traditions behind them. The analysis also differs in that it uses a different historical framework: it works from a position of a very high Christology, frequent communication between Christian centres, and a definite authority structure within the early Christian community from its beginning. These items all affect how one will view the control of the oral tradition, which in turn will affect how one will analyse the differences between the synoptic versions of the stories of Jairus's daughter and the possessed boy, and how one will judge the fact that the story of the widow of Nain's son is found only in Luke. In regards to the written nature of the gospels, it is argued that the primary structuring device used by the gospel authors is chiastic (concentric) in nature. To demonstrate this a new statistical method for judging <b>chiasms</b> has been developed. A large section of Mark (1 : 12 [...] 6 : 46) is divided into both longer and shorter units, and then the parallels [...] -both word and conceptual [...] - between each unit and all the other units are noted. This data is then not only used to judge the level of parallelism between units, but also to perform probability calculations on found chiastic structures. The demonstration of chiastic structures is useful in analysing possible redactional changes the gospel authors may have made to the Jesus tradition in order to create their <b>chiasms.</b> Also, because chiastic structures can impart meaning, elements that may have been added for theological reasons are also highlighted. The result of both the oral and chiastic analyses is a completely new methodology for judging the historicity of the Jesus tradition...|$|R

40|$|Early modern culture {{incorporated}} the human {{hand into a}} large number of different visual-textual contexts: in religious imagery, in scientific illustrations, in manuals of various disciplines, as manicules in manuscripts and printed books, and with several functional and/or figurative significances in the literature and drama of the period. Hands seem to be thrusting themselves into these contexts as powerful reminders of a human agency, which is often both somatic and spiritual at the same time: in the human hand, relations between body and mind converge and contest in complex and multiple ways. As described by Claire Sherman in the exhibition catalogue Writing on Hands: Memory and Knowledge in Early Modern Europe, the early modern hand is “a meeting place of matter, mind, and spirit”. This meeting place is, in several different ways, the implied setting for the following article. Some hands, such as Albrecht Dürer’s Praying Hands (1508) or Michelangelo’s meeting hands of God and Adam on the Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508 - 1512), have become enduring and familiar icons of visual culture; and of course, Dürer’s and Michelangelo’s hands are found within religious contexts in which the hand has always played vital roles related to matter, mind and spirit. However, besides the vast field of religious studies, there are more and other hands offering rich sites for exploring early modern <b>chiasms</b> of body and mind. In the following analyses of examples from early English cross-over contexts, our purpose is to highlight and discuss {{the ways in which the}} hand and in particular two of its most familiar functions – pointing and touching – may illuminate wider epistemological discourses that shift back and forth throughout the period: discourses on what a human being is and how humans perceive and understand the world they live in. Central here are questions as to how and where human perception and cognition take place; in the mind or in the body; or to be more precise: how bodies and minds are understood in relation to each other by early modern thinkers. We present an investigation of a selection of examples which span the dramatic writing of the period: from issues of the hand in two early Shakespearean tragedies, Titus Andronicus (c. 1594) and Romeo and Juliet (c. 1597), to Hamlet (c. 1602); to the medical sciences, William Harvery’s de Motu Cordis (1628); and to John Bulwer’s manuals on gesture, Chirologia and Chironomia (1644). Extracts from Bulwer’s manuals are also useful because their fluid generic qualities allow us both to provide a contextual backdrop specifically concerned with the hand for our other examples, as well as bridging some of the disciplinary gaps between them. At the same time, we want to acknowledge the fact that the early modern period did not, as William M. Hamlin writes, “recognize the strong disciplinary demarcations we typically acknowledge today”. Writers like Bulwer or Robert Burton, whom we also refer to, do not distinguish rigidly between their multiple interests, and we have therefore chosen the term “cross-over contexts” instead of the potentially anachronistic “interdisciplinary”. The order in which these examples appear is not based on chronology or causality, but thematically arranged precisely in order to show their differing and overlapping epistemological discourses and the ways in which they illuminate relations between bodies and minds...|$|R

Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some optic nerves are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers have a problem with spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was prompted}} by the many inter-textual connections that exist in section V of the poetry volume Syspoor by Tom Gouws, and to determine what these relations are. Several texts feature here in close proximity, i. e. the Bible, two Livingstone biographies, Komas uit ’n bamboesstok by D. J. Opperman, Raka by N. P. van Wyk Louw and the Gouws poems. In this study the following questions were asked: Was the Bible text elucidated, communicated and transcribed for the reader via the Livingstone tale in the poems? How did the poet achieve this? Gouws’s conversance with Biblical/Hebrew poetry and his use of semantic rhyme, <b>chiasms</b> and Midrash in the poems under discussion, became evident in the research and demonstrated the interwoven quality of Syspoor’s section V. Section V, “ooglede van die dageraad” (eyelids of the morning), comes into being {{as the result of}} an “inter-textual interweaving” of several texts. The weaving process as theme was taken into consideration with the study of these poems, because it serves as an indication of the direction which is to be followed when interpreting them, and also because it is the key to their sense and meaning. The word “Syspoor” is semantically loaded and has several interpretations: side-track, siding, His (God’s) track, silk trail or side wound (stigmata). The many texts which are explicitly ánd implicitly present in this section have to be considered closely, otherwise its sense is lost. The Bible text is summoned immediately in the title of section V, which is a quote from the book of Job, and is repeated in the second motto on the title page. The inter-textual discussion commences right at the outset. A connection is made with Opperman in the first motto on the title page, although the suggestion of the presence of an Opperman text already exists in the striking structural resemblance between Syspoor and Komas uit ’n bamboesstok. The third motto is an extract from a David Livingstone biography by George Seaver: David Livingstone: his life and letters. With the fourth motto on the title page (a quote that is taken from an ancient text, Revelations of the Holy Gertrude which was written in approximately 1334), yet another text joins the inter-textual conversation. Thus, before the contents of the section have been scrutinized, the reader has already been made aware of the interwoven texture of texts. The abundance of Biblical quotations, which are used as mottoes in section V, act as beacons on the Livingstone trail. The life story of the explorer / missionary becomes the framework into which the poems are ‘woven’, just as the journeys of the explorer, Marco Polo, are used as a basis for Opperman’s Komas uit ’n bamboesstok. The high incidence of Biblical mottoes confirms the importance {{of the relationship between the}} first person speaker / Livingstone-figure and his God. The presence or absence of a Biblical motto becomes the key to the semantic content of the poems. Where the Bible text is presented in transcribed form as poetry, the focus on the state of the faith of the first person speaker / missionary is intensified. In this preference for the motto, Gouws joins the tradition of Totius, Opperman and Cloete. The credo poem and the epilogue of section V bear the same title: “sterfgebed I” and “sterfgebed II” (death prayer). These two poems encircle the 22 poems of the corpus and complete section V compositionally. Both poems are in the form of a prayer and the similarities in their content, structure and theme, lend a cyclical character to the whole. The imminent death of the speaker is postulated and remains subtly present in the other poems. The God:man relationship appears in both poems, so too the motifs of the trail, weaving, Africa, dreams and journeys. These themes are threaded from the first poem through the tightly woven life-fabric of the missionary to be joined together again in the epilogue. The meaning of the Latin word, intertexere, (to intertwine or weave through) is relevant here. The complex relationship between God and man is highlighted as a central theme in section V: the Livingstone-figure / first person speaker is depicted in all the facets of his humanity. He is a sexual creature, discoverer, missionary, believer and linguist / poet. With reference to Umberto Eco’s motto of chapter 2, this researcher has come to the conclusion that old, well known tales have been retold in section V “ooglede van die dageraad” of Syspoor, but from a fresh angle of incidence, in a strange, yet familiar way, with the result that the reader will view all the relevant texts with new eyes. To conclude the weaving metaphor: after every silk thread has been inter-woven into the framework, the onlooker steps back and appreciates the whole tapestry as a work of art, judging it according to its twill.

40|$|As I do {{not have}} {{copyright}} permission to upload the DVD, it was removed for copyright restrictionsThe goal of this thesis was to reassess {{the relationship between the}} moving body and technology, and more specifically, to focus on recent perspectives in the performing arts which inscribe new manifestations and dynamics of cross-pollination between the somatic and technology. According to Dr. Andrea Davidson, 'Such research has rarely been formally identified with the specialised field of somatics' (2013, p. 3). The thesis thus proposes to reflect on the experience and conception of the performative body in the link it entertains with technology. Investigating this relationship, it defines a new paradigm, that of an 'interfaced intercorporeality'. This paradigm is constructed with special attention to a different relationship revealed between the interface and the notion of a corporal potentiality or 'interval'. In particular, the thesis focuses on the concept of a 'collective body' based on this relationship and on practical research conducted within the framework of my research, along with the methodology that supported it. The research and creative work that are presented derive from experiments I conceived, conducted and participated in making. My analysis is thus based on direct experience. The relationship between the somatic and technology notably led me to focus on the notion of embodied cognition or 'bodily knowledge' and for this, to re-examine the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty. As a consequence, this return to the experiential also required revisiting definitions given by the Greeks concerning the aesthetic as a reference to sensation and the ability to perceive. The thesis approaches the body as the ground and basis for creating work, as well as for testing the effect(s) that technology has on it. Experiments conducted sought to develop greater sensory and perceptual awareness in order to invest the relationship of somatics/technology in a dimension that could potentially constitute a transformation of self, of one's relationship to others and to the world. Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological existentialism formed the basis for explorations made to forge links between the somatic and technology. However, it is important to clarify that my intention was not to make an analysis of phenomenology per se. It was rather referenced as a means to explain the framework of my research in relation to lived experience, sensation, and specifically, to my creative approach involving new technologies. Merleau-Ponty's methodology includes subjective, first-person accounts of 'lived experience'. Third-person accounts, or so-called 'objective' positions, are also included. These accounts are then shown to evolve towards an ecosystem of interaction and movement in order to experience and test the production of theory and practical experimentation involved in the methodology I adopted. The thesis incorporates knowledge from several disciplines, but principally from the field of dance and technology. Highlighting sensorial and perceptual phenomena related to the transformation of the body through technology and subjective experience, it takes into account an interdisciplinary perspective that is linked to this problematic. The thesis begins with an introduction to phenomenology in which the concepts and positions of Merleau-Ponty are outlined, including those of anti-dualism, the lived body, the ontology of the body, corporeality, intercorporeality and the flesh. Chapter 1 looks at the evolution of this philosophical movement throughout history and continues with a history of the body in phenomenology, an analysis of certain applications of phenomenology in the field of dance and subsequently, in the specific field of dance related to technology. Chapter 2 comprises a literature review. It also presents the bases of reductionist thinking, the proposition of a return to integrative thinking and issues concerning instrumentalisation, the double and the complexification of the self. It further examines the history of ideas surrounding the relationship between the body and technology, notions of the real-virtual-actual and a history and problematics of the interface. It concludes with a presentation of theories on the notions of potentiality, the interval and real-time. Chapter 3 presents my artistic background, an historical overview of the trends and principal ideas that have influenced my work, as well as an examination of the field of dance and technology {{from the point of view}} of its history and more recent developments. Chapter 4 is dedicated to an analysis of the research methodologies employed in the practical research for this thesis and identifies related issues. An analysis of problems encountered with existing methodologies notably highlights a need to invest in other methodological modes for practical research of an interdisciplinary nature. The chapter continues with a presentation of some of the methodologies currently used in the field of dance related to technology. The principles underpinning the specific creative research methodology I experimented with are then presented, proposing an adaptation of the aforementioned methodologies in order to respond to the dynamics of collective research of an empathic nature that are specific to my approach and also in order to invest in the link between the somatic and technology my project proposes. This proposition modestly attempts to respond to the lack of methodologies observed in the field of artistic practical research. 	A discussion of the experimentation involved in the practical research for the thesis is made in Chapter 5. Two creative experiments are analysed. Their aim was to investigate and develop a collective physical body composed of five dancers in constant contact, whose movement and relationships create what I call a 'collective sound body'. This collective entity produces sound in real-time which is simultaneously spatialised. The analysis takes into account the ways these two bodies are interdependent and constantly interrelated. Schematically, the first experiment served as a basis on which to found principles related to the collective body, while the second experiment developed them. The chapter further outlines creative strategies that were employed to test principles of self-organisation linked to sensation and stemming from the somatic techniques employed. It also returns to some of Merleau-Ponty's main concepts that were implemented and tested in performative experience: intercorporeality, the lived body, the dynamic of continual transformation and the principle of coexistence. Lastly, Merleau-Ponty's investigation of sensation and perception and his concept of sensory <b>chiasms</b> are related to the experiments' multisensory exploration and theme of intersubjectivity which are then proposed as leading to the possibility of intercorporeality. Chapter 6 forms the conclusion and seeks to identify new knowledge generated in the thesis. Essentially articulating another vision of the performative body as developed through its contact with technology, the findings, both practical and theoretical, bring to light a different understanding of the body rendered through a dissolution of psychophysical borders in the development of the performative model I called the 'collective body'. The thesis further proposes that the 'collective body' and its evolution as the 'collective sound body', open up the path to a new approach to interfaces and further, to what I propose as a theory of interfaced intercorporeality. This research aims to reintroduce the body and its specific intelligence in the understanding and building of relationships that can be renewed. The technology used in these experiments was considered as a physicality and the activator of a reconfiguration of sensory-perceptual processes that the thesis argues can lead to the final paradigm of 'interfaced intercorporeality' it proposes.

2500|$|When Cushing's {{syndrome}} is suspected, either a dexamethasone suppression test (administration of dexamethasone and frequent determination of cortisol and ACTH level), or a 24-hour urinary measurement for cortisol offers equal detection rates. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid and simulates {{the effects of}} cortisol, including negative feedback on the pituitary gland. When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, cortisol levels >50 nmol/l (1.81µg/dl) would be indicative of Cushing's syndrome because an ectopic source of cortisol or ACTH (such as adrenal adenoma) exists which is not inhibited by the dexamethasone. A novel approach, recently cleared by the US FDA, is sampling cortisol in saliva over 24 hours, which may be equally sensitive, as late-night levels of salivary cortisol are high in cushingoid patients. Other pituitary hormone levels {{may need to be}} ascertained. [...] Performing a physical examination to determine any visual field defect may be necessary if a pituitary lesion is suspected, which may compress the optic <b>chiasm,</b> causing typical bitemporal hemianopia.|$|E
2500|$|Protons {{may also}} be used in {{radiosurgery}} in a procedure called Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) or proton therapy. Protons are extracted from proton donor materials by a medical synchrotron or cyclotron, and accelerated in successive transits through a circular, evacuated conduit or cavity, using powerful magnets to shape their path, until they reach the energy required to just traverse a human body, usually about 200MeV. They are then released toward the region to be treated in the patient's body, the irradiation target. In some machines, which deliver protons of only a specific energy, a custom mask made of plastic is interposed between the beam source and the patient to adjust the beam energy to provide the appropriate degree of penetration. The phenomenon of the Bragg peak of ejected protons gives proton therapy advantages over other forms of radiation, {{since most of the}} proton's energy is deposited within a limited distance, so tissue beyond this range (and to some extent also tissue inside this range) is spared from the effects of radiation. This property of protons, which has been called the [...] "depth charge effect" [...] by analogy to the explosive weapons used in anti-submarine warfare, allows for conformal dose distributions to be created around even very irregularly shaped targets, and for higher doses to targets surrounded or backstopped by radiation-sensitive structures such as the optic <b>chiasm</b> or brainstem. The development of [...] "intensity modulated" [...] techniques allowed similar conformities to be attained using linear accelerator radiosurgery.|$|E
