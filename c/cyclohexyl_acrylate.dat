50|$|Ethyl {{acrylate}} is a reactant for homologous alkyl acrylates (acrylic esters) by transesterification {{with higher}} alcohols through acidic or basic catalysis. In that way speciality acrylates are made accessible, e.g. 2-ethylhexyl acrylate (from 2-ethylhexanol) used for pressure-sensitive adhesives, <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (from cyclohexanol) used for automotive clear lacquers, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (from ethylene glycol) which is crosslinkable with diisocyanates to form gels used with long-chain acrylates (from C18+ alcohols) as comonomer for comb polymers for {{reduction of the}} solidification point of paraffin oils and 2-dimethylaminoethyl acrylate (from dimethylaminoethanol) for the preparation of flocculants for sewage clarification and paper production.|$|E
40|$|Pulsed laser polymn. (PLP) of <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (CHA) {{was carried}} out to {{optimize}} the PLP conditions for detn. of consistent propagation rate coeffs. (kps). Concurrence of mid-chain radicals (MCRs) formed primarily by backbiting and propagating radicals as an unavoidable feature of acrylate polymn. for kinetic study was confirmed by ESR spectroscopy. The mol. wt. distributions (MWDs) of the resultant polymers measured by GPC were carefully inspected to exclude {{the influence of the}} low reactivity and b-fragmentation of MCR in order to obtain consistent values of kp. The PLPs at the low initiator concns. where the influence of MCR could be minimized were found to give MWDs suitable for kp detn. The kp values obtained for CHA were comparable with reported values for other acrylic esters. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{interest}} in the esthetical natural nail coatings have encouraged more in-depth studies particularly of UV curable coatings: their formation, processing, structure, characteristics and removing. Typical requirement for nail coatings is good adhesion, but preferably for the short time of functioning (usual 2 - 4 weeks). This study investigated the impact of four different monomers (tertiobutyl <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (TBCHA), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate (THFA), hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA)) to viscosity of uncured mixture and degree of conversion, mechanical properties, surface gloss, micro hardness and adhesion loss for cured films. Specific coating application requires comparatively high coating flexibility and stability of deformation characteristics. This can be achieved with composition containing 30 % of monomer TBCHA, what shows ultimate elongation εB = 0, 23 - 0, 24, modulus of elasticity E = 670 - 710 MPa and comparatively constant properties in 72 hours (ΔE = 1. 3 %, ΔεB= 6. 0 %). A composition with 40 % of TBCHA shows the fastest coating destruction achieving adhesion loss within 3 min...|$|E
40|$|The ESR {{spectrum}} of the propagating radical of <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> (CHA) overlaping with a three-line {{spectrum of}} a mid-chain radical was recorded in benzene as a non-polar solvent. The hyperfine coupling constant for the α- and β-hydrogens of the propagating radical of CHA were assigned based on the {{spectrum of the}} polymer radical of CHA-α-d. The polymerization of CHA was found to proceed {{in the presence of}} two types of radical species with different reactivities, the propagating radical and the mid-chain radical. The content of the mid-chain radical produced by abstraction of the α-hydrogen of the monomeric unit of the polymer was found to increase up to 25 % with increasing conversion. The content of branching in the polymers arising from the hydrogen abstraction, 1. 2 - 3. 5 %, determined by C NMR spectroscopy was also found to increase with progress of the polymerization. The rate of the intramolecular formation of the mid-chain radical relative to propagation was estimated from the branching content at an infinitely low conversion, which was obtained by extrapolation, to be 0. 65 % at 1 mol/l of CHA. The absolute rate coefficients for the propagation (k(p)) and termination (k(t)) of CHA were determined using kinetic data obtained by FT-near infrared spectroscopy and the concentration of the propagating radical extrapolated to 0 % conversion to minimize the influence of the mid-chain radicals: k(p) = 1224 1 /mol s and k(t) = 5. 7 x 10 1 /mol s at 60 °C. These seemed to be apparent values because the propagating radical is repeatedly converted to the less reactive mid-chain radical by the intramolecular hydrogen abstraction during the lifetime of each radical. Slow initiation by the mid chain radical would result in the propagating radical which propagates further and accompanies the conversion to the mid-chain radical. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
