The agreement {{called for a}} federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E

25|$|The Clinton {{health care}} plan remains the most {{prominent}} national proposal associated with Hillary Clinton and may have influenced her prospects in the 2008 presidential election. There are some similarities between Clinton's plan and Republican Mitt Romney's {{health care plan}}, which has been implemented in Massachusetts, though Romney has since distanced himself from <b>Clinton</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue, in particular arguing that his plan calls for more control {{at the state level}} and the private market, not from the federal government.|$|E
25|$|According to the New York Times {{the party}} {{as a whole has}} shifted to the left. Although {{the country as a whole}} has shifted to the left, they aren't {{increasing}} their liberalness at the same rate as Democrats. Democrats like Bill Clinton were considered to be centrists but Obama has run to the left of <b>Clinton</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> budget, social issues, welfare reform, entitlement reform, and Israel relations. Obama has focused on income inequality while President Clinton stressed opportunity and mobility. Bill Clinton lowered capital gains taxes while the current president supports raising it.|$|E
25|$|Saginaw was {{decommissioned}} on 28 June 1994, {{but instead}} of being immediately recommissioned as HMAS Kanimbla, it was announced at the decommissioning ceremony that the United States Congress {{had decided not to}} release the ships into foreign service. This last-minute move was part of a sale blockage for the fifteen surplus Newports to nine nations, and was caused by the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services in an attempt to pressure US President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> perceived running-down of the USN's amphibious warfare capability, as well as the concerns of one Senator over human rights in Morocco (one of the other nations slated to acquire a ship).

25|$|In 1994, the RAN {{was able}} to acquire the surplus Saginaw and her sister ship Fairfax County for the {{combined}} price of A$61 million (US$40 million). Saginaw was to be renamed Kanimbla. Prior to Saginaws decommissioning and transfer, a RAN crew was sent to Norfolk, Virginia, for several weeks training aboard the vessel, as they were to sail her to Australia after she was commissioned into the RAN. Saginaw was decommissioned on 28 June 1994, but instead of being immediately recommissioned as HMAS Kanimbla, it was announced at the decommissioning ceremony that the United States Congress {{had decided not to}} release the ships into foreign service.

500|$|Additionally, the act {{raised the}} value of {{inherited}} estates and gifts that could be sheltered from taxation. Gingrich has been credited with creating {{the agenda for the}} reduction in capital gains tax, especially in the [...] "Contract with America", which set out to balance the budget and implement decreases in estate and capital gains tax. Some Republicans felt that the compromise reached with <b>Clinton</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> budget and tax act was inadequate, however Gingrich has stated that the tax cuts were a significant accomplishment for the Republican Congress in the face of opposition from the Clinton administration. Gingrich along with Bob Dole had earlier set-up the Kemp Commission, headed by former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, a tax reform commission that made several recommendations including that dividends, interest, and capital gains should be untaxed.|$|E
500|$|During Cornwallis's absence, {{control of}} the British forces had passed to Henry <b>Clinton</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{resignation}} of General Howe; as a consequence, Cornwallis was now second in command in North America. After the surrender of John Burgoyne's army at Saratoga and the entry of France into the war, the British decided to withdraw from Philadelphia to concentrate defenses in New York against the French threat. [...] Cornwallis commanded the rearguard during the overland march from Philadelphia to New York City and {{played an important role}} in the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778. [...] After a surprise attack on the British rearguard, Cornwallis launched a counter-attack which checked the American advance. [...] However, when he then led elite units against an entrenched Continental Army position, it refused to budge, and Cornwallis was forced to withdraw with heavy casualties. [...] Even though Clinton commended Cornwallis for his performance at Monmouth, he eventually came to blame the earl for failing to win the day.|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} early stages of her presidential {{campaign}} for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled [...] "Love Her", [...] "Hate Her", while Mother Jones titled its profile of her [...] "Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary". Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates, while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all. An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled [...] "The Waning Power of Hillary Hate". By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present about <b>Clinton</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation. She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton's laugh, that [...] "We know that there's language to condemn female speech that doesn't exist for male speech. We call women's speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton's laugh was being described as a cackle." [...] The [...] "bitch" [...] epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics, flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well. Following Clinton's [...] "choked up moment" [...] and related incidents {{in the run-up to the}} January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse. Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events [...] "brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics." ...|$|E
