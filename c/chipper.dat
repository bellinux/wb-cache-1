50|$|Stacked dado set {{consists}} of two circular saw blades fixed {{on either side of}} a set of removable <b>chippers.</b> As the dado set spins, the two outside blades cut the dado walls and the <b>chippers</b> remove the waste material in between and smooth the bottom of the dado. The <b>chippers</b> are added or removed to the set as required to make a dado of the desired width. <b>Chippers</b> can also be interspersed with spacers to finely adjust the dado width. Consequently, changing the dado width requires the complete removal of the dado blade set from the arbor.

After the season ended, the Yankees wanted Taylor to take part in an instructional league to work on his fundamentals. Taylor declined to attend the camp, and instead chose to return to his home in North Carolina.|$|E
