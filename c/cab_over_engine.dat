Tyres were large 900×16 types on deep-dish wheel rims to spread the ground weight of this heavy vehicle. These vehicles were somewhat underpowered for the increased load capacity (...) , and most had a hard working life. Less than 2,500 were made, and most had a utility body, but surviving examples often have custom bodywork. With an upgraded powertrain, they {{can be used as a}} small motorhome.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{vehicle to}} adopt {{the style of a}} van, with the engine {{installed}} in front of the driver was the 1970s Honda Life [...] "StepVan". Some microvans utilize a drivetrain with the engine installed transversely, using front or all wheel drive, while others use a <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> approach where the engine is installed beneath the driver, while still utilizing all wheel drive or rear drive powertrains. <b>Cab</b> <b>over</b> variants usually share their chassis with kei truck derivatives from the same manufacturer.|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} three common cab {{configurations}} used in tractors, two are still widely used. The conventional has an engine and hood over the front axle {{in front of the}} cab, as in most automobiles. This style is almost universal in North America. The <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> or cab forward has a flat nose cab with the driver {{sitting in front of the}} front axle. Widely used in the EU and Japan, this style has the advantages of good vision, maneuverability, and allows maximum trailer length relative to overall length. In the North America this type of cab can be useful in straight trucks, but now has little advantage in tractors and is rarely used. A North American style <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine,</b> now largely obsolete, had a flat nose cab located higher over the engine, with the driver sitting above the front axle. This allowed a sleeper compartment in a short tractor, and maximum wheelbase relative overall length, important for bridge formula weight restrictions. With the loosening of length restrictions in 1982 this style had limited applications, and is no longer manufactured for the U.S. market. This style is still however popular in Australia where length restrictions still apply on many roads and it is used to maximise the capacity of both single trailer and B double configurations, and American companies Freightliner and Kenworth still manufacture trucks in this style for this market. In Australia both styles of <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> truck as well as conventionals are in common use.|$|E
5000|$|Cab-over, {{also known}} as <b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine</b> (COE), cab forward (U.S.), or forward control (UK), is a body style of truck, bus, or van that has a {{vertical}} front, [...] "flat face" [...] or a semi-hood, with the cab of the truck sitting above (or forward of) the front axle. This contrasts with a conventional truck where the engine is mounted {{in front of the}} driver.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{popular among}} United States heavy truckers and {{trucking}} companies during the 1970s because of strict length laws in many states, when those length laws were repealed, most heavy-truck makers moved to other body styles. It is, however, still {{very popular in}} the light- and medium-duty truck segment. However American companies Paccar and Freightliner still manufacture traditional <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> designs for the Australian and South African markets where length restrictions still make them advantageous.|$|E

50|$|The Jeep Forward Control is a {{truck that}} was {{produced}} by Willys and then Kaiser Jeep from 1956 to 1965. It was also assembled in other international markets. The layout featured a <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> (forward control) design.|$|R
5000|$|The {{same basic}} design family {{was used for}} all of its trucks {{including}} the Suburban, panel trucks, canopy express and cab overs. The cab overs used the same basic cab configuration and similar grille but used a shorter and taller hood and different fenders. The unique Cab Over fenders and hood required a custom cowl area which makes the <b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine</b> cabs and normal truck cabs incompatible with one another while all truck cabs of all weights interchange.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> (COE) or flat nose, {{where the}} driver is seated {{on top of the}} front axle and the engine. The front doors are {{typically}} in front of and above the front tires. This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated. They were common in the United States and Canada but such body style in heavy duty type trucks lost prominence, when the legally permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, COE's are still popular among medium and light duty trucks in the United States. To access the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of tilt-cab. This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient path and trackways which require the additional turning capability of the <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> type. The operating conditions of these vehicles tend to be cooler than the conventional cab design and so the increased engine surface area used for cooling in hotter climates is not required. Access to a COE cab is commonly by steps forward of the front tires.|$|E
5000|$|In {{road vehicle}} design, Cab forward, {{also known as}} Cab-over, COE (<b>Cab</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Engine),</b> or forward control, is a body style of truck, bus or van that has a {{vertical}} front or [...] "flat face", with the cab sitting above the front axle. This body design allows for a more compact configuration. For example, the Jeep Forward Control model {{was the first time}} the payload (or pickup box) length - 9 ft with the tailgate up - exceeded the wheelbase of a truck.|$|E

50|$|The White Road Commander was {{a series}} of {{heavy-duty}} <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> trucks built by White Motor Company from 1972 until 1983. After Volvo's takeover the Road Commander received a light facelift and continued to be sold as the White High Cabover.|$|R
50|$|Several of {{the class}} were rebuilt with {{superheated}} boilers and new <b>cabs</b> <b>over</b> their long lives beginning in the 1920s. In 1912 during the coal strike of that year No. 10 was converted to an oil burning locomotive using Holden oil burning apparatus.|$|R
50|$|The {{cab forward}} truck {{configuration}} is currently common among European and Japanese truck manufacturers, because the laws governing overall vehicle lengths are strict {{and the body}} style allows longer trailers or a longer cargo area for the same overall length than a standard truck (with an engine compartment ahead of a conventional cabin). Better visibility and maneuverability in tight quarters, such as for city delivery, is a benefit of locating the truck's cab up front. Large trucks of this type are most often described as <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> (COE) or cab over models.|$|E
50|$|The STZ-5 {{features}} a fully enclosed metal, two person crew compartment (<b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> design) {{with a flat}} wood cargo bed with drop down wood side walls. The MA-1 gasoline engine (7.4 l. 4 in-line cylinders) was rated at 52HP (38.8 kW) at 1250 rpm. The STZ-5 was rated to carry 1.5 tonnes of cargo on its bed or tow 8 tonnes or less. Under optimum conditions its 6 gear transmission (5 forward, 1 reverse) could yield a maximum speed of 25 km/h (15 mph). It had an operational range of 140 km.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{as the war}} approached, the Autocar Company, who had been selling trucks to the Army since 1909, began {{adapting}} their commercial <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> <b>engine</b> trucks for military service. In 1939 the Model U70 5-ton (4,536 kg)(on road cargo rating) 4x2 was developed into the U2044 and U4044 [...] ton (2,268 kg)(off load rating) 4x4s, the U5044T and 7144T (“T” indicates tractor) 5-ton (4,536 kg) 4x4s, and the largest, the U8144T. In 1941 the U8144T became the Army's standard ponton tractor, and went into production.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} {{usability}} of a web application enabling ordering/booking of <b>cabs</b> <b>over</b> the Internet. The main questions were: What are users’ expectations for the service and Which parts of the web application have to be improved? A think-aloud protocol was used in which six subjects tried out the service by a computer, while reasoning about the application. The results show that the test subjects were expecting a simple, non time-consuming product in which they would have to provide the same information to order a <b>cab</b> <b>over</b> the Internet as when ordering by phone. The test subjects discovered a number of possible improvements, which mostly concerned more clear explanations/descriptions and the application’s design, mainly concerning perceptual problems.
