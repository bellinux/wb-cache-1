40|$|Over the years, the U. S. Supreme Court’s {{corporate}} personhood {{decisions have}} {{allowed for the}} corporation to become increasingly more “person-like” by recognizing corporate constitutional rights that were previously reserved for flesh-and-blood human beings. Yet {{in cases where the}} rights of corporations are evaluated, the Court’s analysis flows from an axiomatic conceptualization of the corporation as a static, theoretical being, as if plucked straight from a business organizations law school textbook. The result is a gulf between corporate rights as “persons” and corporate legal responsibilities. Nowhere is that gulf more evident than in the Court’s personal jurisdiction jurisprudence. In particular, this note addresses the fact that corporations are not amenable to suits brought via tag jurisdiction, because tag jurisdiction is premised on physical presence within a territory. A corporation, under the classic view, is only physically present in its state of incorporation, the state of its principal place of business, and wherever its contacts are so systematic and continuous that the exercise of personal jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. The Supreme Court has never addressed the issue of corporate tag jurisdiction, but several circuit courts have held that the doctrine does not apply to corporate entities. This note focuses on the implications of the Court’s decision in Hobby Lobby and asserts that the majority opinion in that case marked a fundamental deviation from the traditional notion of physical presence associated with corporate entities. In Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court <b>held</b> that <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> <b>corporations</b> were persons for purposes of claiming a religious exemption from the Affordable Care Act’s birth control mandate. Importantly, though, the Court departed from its motif of assessing the corporate personhood right at issue as it applied to all corporations and instead arbitrarily extended the religious exemption only to <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> <b>corporations,</b> which the majority failed to define. Drawing on the majority’s opinion and other existing definitions of <b>closely</b> <b>held,</b> this note proposes that <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> should be defined as corporations at least 50 % owned by a single shareholder, with no more than 100 total shareholders. Working with that definition in mind, this note then deconstructs the “new” corporate person spawned by the Hobby Lobby decision and argues that religious <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> <b>corporations</b> are so “person-like” that the divide between the theoretical corporation and its management no longer exists, and instead, <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> <b>corporations</b> now are more akin to other business entities like partnerships, which are subject to tag jurisdiction. Therefore, in an effort to better match corporate rights and responsibilities, this note argues that <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> <b>corporations</b> should be subject to tag jurisdiction...|$|R

A {{majority of the}} board wanted the company to be a <b>closely</b> <b>held</b> <b>corporation,</b> but Robinson disagreed: he wanted the shares to be freely available to the general public. The city franchise required that the lines be completed {{within a year of}} the amended ordinance, but money problems delayed the extension to Oakland.

[...] Robinson then incorporated the Atlantic & Pacific Street Railway and Securities Company in New Jersey to take over the North Jacksonville and complete the lines. He offered shares at one dollar to get as many local citizens to invest as possible, giving them an interest in the success of the line. This effort failed and the company was eventually sold to Telfair Stockton and his associates, thus passing out of control of the black community. Stockton built the authorized extensions, bringing the road to 6.4 mi with seven cars. Stockton, a former state legislator and prominent developer, had no particular interest in running a street railway and soon sold the property to the Jacksonville Electric Company (later renamed Jacksonville Traction Company). The black community relied heavily on the former North Jacksonville lines, and they were among the last routes to be abandoned, in December 1936.|$|E
