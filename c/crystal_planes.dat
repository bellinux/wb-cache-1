3000|$|The {{thickness}} of subsurface deformed layer on the machined surface varies with different cutting orientations. According to the analyzed relevance of subsurface deformation in nanometric cutting to nanoindentation, nanometric cutting along the 100 direction on the (010) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane,</b> 010 direction on the (101) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane,</b> and [121][112][211] [...] directions on the (111) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane</b> on germanium {{can lead to}} the thinnest {{thickness of}} deformed layer on the machined surface.|$|R
30|$|On {{the same}} <b>crystal</b> <b>plane,</b> the uncut {{thickness}} is {{in proportion to}} the depth of cut on the scale of our simulation. However, with the same undeformed chip thickness, the uncut thickness is almost the same on different machining <b>crystal</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|R
3000|$|Generally, the {{thicknesses}} of subsurface deformation {{are different}} from each other with various combinations of cutting <b>crystal</b> <b>plane</b> and orientation in nanometric cutting of monocrystalline germanium because of its anisotropy. Thus, a large number of simulations or experiments may be needed for investigating the relative depth of subsurface deformation with cutting directions, which is time-consuming. According to the analysis above, the relative depth of subsurface deformation when nano-cutting along different directions on the monocrystalline germanium can be obtained from the transformed phase distribution of the subsurface with nanoindentation on the same <b>crystal</b> <b>plane</b> with a spherical indenter, instead of extremely large numbers of simulations or experiments on nanometric cutting. That is, the larger extending range of transformed phase on the subsurface around a certain direction in nanoindentation, the greater thickness of deformed layer would occur with nano-cutting along the same direction on the same <b>crystal</b> <b>plane</b> of germanium. Thus, it helps to select the appropriate cutting direction considering the demands for the thickness of deformed layer in nanometric cutting of monocrystalline germanium. For example, {{in order to get the}} machined surface with the thinnest thickness of deformed layer in nanometric cutting, the cutting directions of 100 on the (010) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane,</b> 010 on the (101) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane,</b> and [121][112][211] [...] on the (111) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane</b> of germanium are suggested.|$|R

A sharp diffraction peak at 2 θ[*]=[*] 26 ° can be indexed as (002) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane</b> of graphite, indicating well-ordered structure of graphite layers with spacing of about 0.34 nm. The characteristic diffraction peak of (002) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane</b> disappears completely after the graphite is fully oxidized, and a new diffraction peak at approximately 11 ° emerges which can be ascribed to (001) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane</b> of graphite oxide[25]. After nitrogen doping and reduction reaction, the peak at 26 ° reappears with broader width and weaker intensity than pristine graphite and the peak at approximately 11 ° disappears, implying reduction of the graphite oxide. Nevertheless, residual oxygen functional groups, defects produced by the introduced nitrogen atoms, and carbon atom loss destroy the graphite crystal structure, meanwhile increase the degree of disorder within the graphene sheet. While GO could be well dispersed forming golden colloid solution in water, N-doped graphene was insoluble in water as suspended black solid. These experimental phenomena conform well to the XRD analysis.|$|R

40|$|Nanometric {{cutting of}} single crystal silicon on {{different}} crystal orientations {{and at a}} wide range of temperatures (300 - 1500 K) was studied through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using two sorts of interatomic potentials, an analytical bond order potential (ABOP) and a modified version of Tersoff potential, so as to explore the cutting chip characteristics and chip formation mechanisms. Smaller released thermal energy and larger values of chip ratio (ratio of the uncut chip thickness to the cut chip thickness) as well as shear plane angle were obtained when cutting was performed at higher temperatures or on the (1 1 1) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane,</b> implying an enhancement in machinability of silicon. Nonetheless, the subsurface deformation depth was observed to become deeper under the aforementioned conditions. Further analysis revealed a higher number of atoms in the chip when cutting was implemented on the (1 1 0) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane,</b> attributable to the lower position of the stagnation region which triggered less ploughing action of the tool on the silicon substrate. Regardless of temperature of the substrate the minimum chip velocity angle was found while cutting the (1 1 1) <b>crystal</b> <b>plane</b> of silicon substrate whereas the maximum chip velocity angle appeared on the (1 1 0) surface. A discrepancy between the two potential functions in predicting the chip velocity angle was observed at high temperature of 1500 K, resulting from the overestimated phase instability and entirely molten temperatures of silicon by the ABOP function. Another key observation was that the resultant force exerted by the rake face of the tool on the chip was found to decrease by 24 % when cutting the (1 1 1) surface at 1173 K compared to that at room temperature.
