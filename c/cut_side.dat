My perceptions were sharper and swifter {{than they had}} ever been in life; my thoughts rushed through my mind with incredible swiftness, but with perfect definition. I can only compare their crowded clarity {{to the effects of}} a reasonable dose of opium. In a moment it would all be over, and I should be free. I knew I was immortal, but what would happen I did not know. Should I drift off presently, like a puff of smoke from a gun, in some kind of half-material body, an attenuated version of my material self? Should I find myself suddenly among the innumerable hosts of the dead, and know the world about me for the phantasmagoria it had always seemed? Should I drift to some spiritualistic séance, and there make foolish, incomprehensible attempts to affect a purblind medium? It was a state of unemotional curiosity, of colourless expectation. And then I realised a growing stress upon me, a feeling as though some huge human magnet was drawing me upward out of my body. The stress grew and grew. I seemed an atom for which monstrous forces were fighting. For one brief, terrible moment sensation came back to me. That feeling of falling headlong which comes in nightmares, that feeling a thousand times intensified, that and a black horror swept across my thoughts in a torrent. Then the two doctors, the naked body with its <b>cut</b> <b>side,</b> the little room, swept away from under me and vanished, as a speck of foam vanishes down an eddy.|$|E

To do this, the squash is cut in half lengthwise (see pictures), lightly brushed with cooking oil or put in a thin layer of water and placed <b>cut</b> <b>side</b> down on a baking sheet. It is then baked for 45 minutes or until soft. Once roasted, it can be eaten in a variety of ways.The fruit is prepared by removing the skin, stalk, and seeds, which are not usually eaten or cooked.

50|$|To {{form the}} bale, the {{material}} to be baled, (which is often hay or straw) in the windrow is lifted by tines in the baler's reel. This material is then packed into the bale chamber, which runs the length of {{one side of the}} baler (normally the right hand side when viewed from the front). A combination plunger and knife move {{back and forth in the}} front of this chamber, with the knife closing the door into the bale chamber as it moves backwards. The plunger and knife are attached to a heavy asymmetrical flywheel to provide extra force as they pack the bales. A measuring device—normally a spiked wheel that is turned by the emerging bales—measures the amount of material that is being compressed and, at the appropriate length it triggers the knotters that wrap the twine around the bale and tie it off. As the next bale is formed the tied one is driven out of the rear of the baling chamber onto the ground or onto a special wagon or collecting sled hooked to the rear of the baler. This process continues as long as there is material to be baled, and twine to tie it with. The bales emerge with four sides. The twine runs, in two parallel loops, around the wider sides. Of the two narrower sides, there is a <b>cut</b> <b>side</b> and a dull side, and when stacked for storage or transport the bales are normally positioned with the <b>cut</b> <b>side</b> facing outwards.|$|E
50|$|A second, {{structurally}} different instrument ("Göttingen recorder") {{was discovered}} in 1987 in an archaeological excavation of the latrine of a medieval house in Göttingen, Germany. It has been dated to between 1246 and 1322. It is fruitwood in one piece with turnings, measuring about 256 mm long. It has a cylindrical bore about 13.6 mm at the highest measurable point, narrowing to 13.2 mm {{between the first and}} second finger holes, to 12.7 to(-) 12.8 mm between the second and third finger holes, and contracting to 11.5 mm at the seventh hole. The bore expands to 14.5 mm at the bottom of the instrument, which has a bulbous foot. Unusually, the finger holes taper conically outwards, the opposite of the undercutting found in Baroque recorders. The top of the instrument is damaged: only a <b>cut</b> <b>side</b> of the windway survives, and the block has been lost. A reconstruction by Hans Reiners has a strident, penetrating sound rich in overtones and has a range of two octaves. With the thumb hole and the first three finger holes covered, the reconstruction produces a pitch ca. 450 Hz.|$|E
50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, angle <b>cut</b> <b>side</b> cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|E

Steam-girdling blocked the movement of 14 C and T when 14 C-glucose and THO were introduced simultaneously by the flap-feeding technique. If THO moved as liquid water in the phloem along with the 14 C-sugars, as blockage by steam girdling suggests, then solution flow of sugar cannot be excluded as a mechanism of translocation...|$|E

The regular hip/valley rafter runs at a 45° angle to the main roof and the unit of measurement is 16.97 inches of run. Regular hip/valley and jack rafters have different bevel angles within any given pitch and the angle decreases as the pitch increases.The <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> of the hip/valley rafter = (Tangent)(12) = <b>side</b> <b>cut</b> in inches. The <b>side</b> <b>cuts</b> in the rafter table are all in a base 12. The arc tan can be determined from any given pitch. Most power tools and angle measuring devises use 90° as 0° in construction.

The taper, {{inclination}} of <b>cut</b> <b>side</b> walls, {{is one of}} {{the characteristic}} phenomena of the abrasive water jet (AWJ) cutting. The taper represents a serious problem in shape cutting, especially in corners and curvatures. However, deviation of the side walls occurs even in the straight line parts of trajectories. Some differences from character typical for metal cutting have been noticed when studying the rock materials. This article is aimed at the experimental research of the cut walls taper on several rock materials with different genesis and composition. The topic of this contribution to the common knowledge is pointing out the most important differences compared to previous research made mainly on metals. The widths of slots made in plan-parallel plates of rock materials were measured both on the top and on the bottom. The difference between these widths has been used for evaluation of the taper—the angle of the cut walls inclination. The results were compared with the regression equation obtained from experimental results on metals and presented in past. The discrepancy between new findings and previously determined equation is discussed and the most probable explanations are submitted. Web of Science 881 - 444944...|$|E
