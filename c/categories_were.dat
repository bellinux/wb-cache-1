5|$|The {{award was}} first {{presented}} at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2001. Before its introduction, the rock <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> separated by gender and ensembles, with an additional award for Best Rock Album. At the Latin Grammy Awards of 2010 two rock <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> presented, Rock Album and Best Rock Song. No information was released regarding the absence or possible withdrawal of the Best Rock Solo Vocal Album category.|$|E
5|$|At the 9th Academy Awards {{ceremony}} held in 1937, Gale Sondergaard was {{the first}} winner of this award {{for her role in}} Anthony Adverse. Initially, winners in both supporting acting <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> awarded plaques instead of statuettes. Beginning with the 16th ceremony held in 1944, however, winners received full-sized statuettes. Currently, nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the actors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the Academy.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with this}} ceremony, the AMPAS music branch divided the {{category}} of Best Original Score into two categories: Best Dramatic Score and Best Musical or Comedy Score. This {{was seen as a}} response to the dominance of Walt Disney Feature Animation films in the Original Score and Original Song categories in recent years. Four years later, the two scoring <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> merged back into one category.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{there was}} only one general award. In 1976, the General <b>category</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}}. The Boy's/Girl's <b>category</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 1980, then split in 1984 into separate Boy's and Girl's awards. The Children's <b>category</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 1982. From 1976 to 1989, the General <b>category</b> <b>was</b> called the Seinen/General category (Seinen ippan muke bumon).|$|R

5|$|In 1890 the English {{zoologist}} Edward Bagnall Poulton categorised animal colours {{by their}} uses, which cover both camouflage and mimicry. Poulton's <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> largely followed by Hugh Cott in 1940. Relevant Poulton categories {{are listed in}} the table. Where Poulton's definition covers a method but does not name it explicitly, the category is named in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the {{combined}} Hard Rock/Metal category returned following a major overhaul of Grammy Award categories. The separate Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> merged into the slightly renamed Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category. However, in June 2013, {{it was announced}} that {{the combined}} category was being discontinued in favor of reinstating Best Metal Performance. Beginning in 2014, quality hard rock performances were recognized under the category Best Rock Performance.|$|E
5|$|The Lambda Literary Awards include {{awards for}} science fiction, fantasy and horror. The awards were first {{presented}} in 1989, with separate categories for speculative fiction for {{lesbians and gay}} men. In 1993 these <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> merged and the combined award has undergone several name changes since then. Although the awards are given based {{on the quality of}} the writing and the LGBT themes, the author's sexual orientation is also a factor.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a {{complete}} <b>category</b> <b>is</b> a <b>category</b> {{in which all}} small limits exist. That <b>is,</b> a <b>category</b> C <b>is</b> complete if every diagram F : J → C where J is small has a limit in C. Dually, a cocomplete <b>category</b> <b>is</b> one in which all small colimits exist. A bicomplete <b>category</b> <b>is</b> a <b>category</b> which <b>is</b> both complete and cocomplete.|$|R
50|$|The sounds {{involved}} in alternations {{of the sounds}} of the second and the third <b>category</b> <b>are</b> known as correlatives. The only difference between the second and the third <b>category</b> <b>is</b> {{the degree to which a}} given <b>category</b> <b>is</b> morphologized. Kruszewski's example for the second <b>category</b> <b>is</b> u-umlaut in Icelandic. He does not strictly separate the second and the third category.|$|R
50|$|The T1 <b>category</b> <b>is</b> for cyclists with {{significant}} balance issues. The T2 <b>category</b> <b>is</b> for cyclists with moderate balance issues. In both <b>categories,</b> tricycles <b>are</b> used.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the awards in 1975, seven <b>{{categories}}</b> <b>were</b> presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have changed since then, and no changes have been made to the rules. 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology category. No changes have been made since.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} four seasons, {{prospect}} UFC fighters from two different weight <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> selected to compete. The fighters are divided into two teams, irrespective of weight class, with each team coached by a current UFC headliner. The teams then compete (in a manner which varies by season) with the loser being eliminated from the competition. Often, incentives are provided for the team of a winning fighter. This can include the right for their team to select the next matchup, in order to pick off fighters from the opposing team by selecting favourable matchups.|$|E
5|$|Local {{forecast}} {{offices of}} the National Weather Service, radio and television stations, and emergency planners often use the forecasts to gauge the potential severe weather threats to their areas. Even after the marginal and enhanced risk <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> added in October 2014, some television stations have continued to use the original three-category system to outline forecasted severe weather risks (though stations that do this may utilize in-house severe weather outlooks that vary to some degree from the SPC convective outlooks), while certain others that have switched to the current system {{have chosen not to}} outline marginal risk areas.|$|E

5000|$|In mathematics, a {{skeleton}} of a <b>category</b> <b>is</b> a subcategory which, roughly speaking, does not contain any extraneous isomorphisms. In a certain sense, the {{skeleton of a}} <b>category</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "smallest" [...] equivalent category which captures all [...] "categorical properties". In fact, two <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> equivalent {{if and only if}} they have isomorphic skeletons. A <b>category</b> <b>is</b> called skeletal if isomorphic objects are necessarily identical.|$|R

5|$|Prior to 1981, the {{gender-neutral}} {{category of}} Best Jazz Vocal Performance existed. The first award specifically for female performances {{was presented to}} Ella Fitzgerald in 1981 for the album A Perfect Match. The category remained unchanged until 1985, when it was combined with the award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male and presented in the genderless category. Gender-specific awards were once again presented from 1986 until 1991. In 1992, the two <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> combined and presented as the category Best Jazz Vocal Performance. This category was later renamed to Best Jazz Vocal Album beginning in 2001. While the gender-specific award has not been presented since the category merge in 1992, an official confirmation of its retirement has not been announced.|$|E
5|$|Since their {{inception}} in 1989, awards {{have been given}} in various categories in fiction and non-fiction. The category for speculative fiction works has changed several times; from science fiction and mystery, to science fiction and fantasy, and finally to LGBT Sci-Fi, fantasy and horror. This category is open to submissions {{in the form of}} novels, novellas, short stories, collections and anthologies. Initially the genre <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> also split into gay men's and lesbian categories, but were merged in 1993. This article lists all the award nominees and winners for all the variously titled science fiction categories.|$|E

Originally designed to celebrate lifetime or career contributions to animation {{in the fields of}} producing, directing, animation, design, writing, voice acting, sound and sound effects, etc., in 1992 it began to honor animation as a whole, and created the category of Best Animated Feature. New <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> subsequently added for different animation media. Wainwright has been nominated once.|$|E
5|$|The Video of the Year {{category}} was discontinued {{with the establishment}} of the MTV Video Music Awards in 1984, whose top award is also presented for Video of the Year. The Academy replaced the category with awards for Best Video, Short Form and Best Video Album beginning with the 26th Grammy Awards. For the awards held in 1988 and 1989, the criteria changed and honors were presented for the categories Best Concept Music Video and Best Performance Music Video. The Academy returned to the previous format in 1990, though the two <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> renamed Best Long Form Music Video (changed to Best Music Film in 2014) and Best Short Form Music Video (shortened to Best Music Video in 2014) respectively.|$|E
5|$|The only {{discontinued}} awards {{which were}} instated in the WSFS constitution as permanent <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> the Best Professional Magazine and Best Original Art Work Hugo Awards. Worldcon committees may also give out special awards during the Hugo ceremony, {{which are not}} voted on. Unlike the additional Hugo categories which Worldcons may present, these awards are not officially Hugo Awards and do not use the same trophy, though they once did. An additional award, the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, is presented at the Hugo Award ceremony and voted on by the same process, but is not formally a Hugo Award. Beginning an 2018, an unnamed Best Young Adult Book award, also not formally a Hugo Award, will be run similar to the Campbell Award.|$|E

5|$|Winners {{for artistic}} and {{traditional}} music <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> announced on June 21, 2008 at Taipei County Hall {{in a ceremony}} separate from that for popular music categories. It was the second consecutive year that the ceremony for this category group was held separately, {{and it did not}} attract as much media attention as the ceremony for the popular music categories. By contrast, artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and Canada attended the awards ceremony for popular music categories, which was held at the Taipei Arena on July 5, 2008. Actress sisters Barbie and Dee Shu, former news anchor Patty Hou, and actress Matilda Tao hosted this event, whose list of award presenters included Canadian recording artist Daniel Powter and Japanese drama stars Akito Kiriyama, Junta Nakama, and Yuya Takaki. Both events were broadcast on the satellite cable Azio Television channel on June 28 and July 5, respectively.|$|E
