25|$|Because {{the gate}} on Earth was found without a DHD, the Stargate team on Earth {{developed}} {{the technology to}} interface with the gate in order to power it and dial it {{by the use of}} computers. Unlike a DHD, their version is essentially manual dialing, as the system physically moves the inner ring to lock in the address. Dialing on a DHD automatically locks in the symbols, making the DHD much faster at dialing. However, the SGC's dialing <b>computer</b> <b>has</b> the advantage of controlling access to the Stargate and storing working addresses, whereas a DHD can be used by anyone and has no easy to access list (a limited number of previously accessed gate addresses are stored in the DHD crystals, but the technology and knowledge to access them is not widespread).|$|E
25|$|After a person, {{program or}} <b>computer</b> <b>has</b> {{successfully}} been identified and authenticated {{then it must}} be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they {{will be allowed to}} perform (run, view, create, delete, or change). This is called authorization. Authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures. The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. The access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies. Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms—some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms. The access control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.|$|E
25|$|Fast tissues absorb gas {{relatively}} quickly, {{but will}} generally release it quickly during ascent. A fast tissue may become saturated {{in the course}} of a normal sports dive, while a slow tissue may have absorbed only a small part of its potential gas capacity. By calculating the levels in each compartment separately, researchers are able to construct more effective algorithms. In addition, each compartment may be able to tolerate more or less supersaturation than others. The final form is a complicated model, but one that allows for the construction of algorithms and tables suited to a wide variety of diving. A typical dive <b>computer</b> <b>has</b> an 8–12 tissue model, with half times varying from 5 minutes to 400 minutes. The Bühlmann tables use an algorithm with 16 tissues, with half times varying from 4 minutes to 640 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the <b>computer</b> <b>has</b> some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E
500|$|... ot only do {{opinions}} diverge widely, {{but they}} are frequently adhered to strongly, even vehemently: at one extreme is the view that since we can never be certain that a <b>computer</b> <b>has</b> been used it is pointless to attempt a distinction, so we should simply evaluate a 'study' on its content, without reference to its origins; {{at the other extreme}} is the view that using [...] a 'mouse' to lift an interesting position from a ready-made computer-generated list is in no sense composing, so we should outlaw every such position.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, a major {{ransomware}} Trojan {{known as}} Reveton began to spread. Based on the Citadel Trojan (which itself, {{is based on}} the Zeus Trojan), its payload displays a warning purportedly from a law enforcement agency claiming that the <b>computer</b> <b>has</b> been used for illegal activities, such as downloading unlicensed software or child pornography. Due to this behaviour, it is commonly referred to as the [...] "Police Trojan". The warning informs the user that to unlock their system, they would have to pay a fine using a voucher from an anonymous prepaid cash service such as Ukash or Paysafecard. To increase the illusion that the computer is being tracked by law enforcement, the screen also displays the computer's IP address, while some versions display footage from a victim's webcam to give the illusion that the user is being recorded.|$|E
500|$|The {{personal}} decompression computer, or dive computer, {{is a small}} computer {{designed to}} be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing and which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. Most are wrist mounted, but a few are mounted in a console with the submersible pressure gauge and possibly other instruments. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. Other data such as water temperature and cylinder pressure are also sometimes displayed. The dive <b>computer</b> <b>has</b> the advantages of monitoring the actual dive, {{as opposed to the}} planned dive, and does not assume on a [...] "square profile" [...] – it dynamically calculates the real profile of pressure exposure in real time, and keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm.|$|E
