40|$|Background: Offspring {{of cancer}} {{survivors}} {{may be at}} risk for <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> due to the mutagenic therapies received by their parents. Our population-based cohort study aimed to investigate the risk for <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> in offspring of early-onset cancer survivors compared to offspring of their siblings. Methods: We identified hospital contacts due to <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> during {{the first two years of}} life in 6, 862 offspring of cancer survivors and 35, 690 offspring of siblings. Survivors were diagnosed between 1953 and 2004. Using the Finnish Cancer Registry, Central Population Register, and Hospital Discharge Register, we identified the study cohorts and <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Associations between <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> and cancer were evaluated using generalized linear regression modelling. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The ratio of <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> in offspring of cancer survivors (3. 2 %) was slightly, but nonsignificantly, elevated compared to that of offspring of siblings (2. 7 %) [prevalence ratio (PR) 1. 07, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 91 - 1. 25, p= 0. 44]. When offspring of childhood and adolescent survivors (0 - 19 years at cancer diagnosis) were compared to siblings' offspring, the risk for <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> was nonsignificantly increased (PR 1. 17, 95 %CI 0. 92 - 1. 49, p= 0. 19). No such increase existed for offspring of young adult survivors (20 - 34 years at cancer diagnosis) compared with siblings' offspring (PR 1. 01, 95 %CI 0. 83 - 1. 23, p= 0. 94). Conclusion: In our study, we did not detect an overall elevated risk for <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> in offspring of survivors diagnosed in young adulthood.

All malformed cases occurring to mothers with pregestational diabetes (diabetes cases) were compared to all malformed cases in the same registry areas to mothers without diabetes (non-diabetes cases). RESULTS: There were 669 diabetes cases and 92, 976 non diabetes cases. Odds ratios in diabetes pregnancies relative to non-diabetes pregnancies comparing each EUROCAT subgroup to all other non-chromosomal anomalies combined showed significantly increased odds ratios for neural tube defects (anencephaly and encephalocele, but not spina bifida) and several subgroups of congenital heart defects. Other subgroups with significantly increased odds ratios were anotia, omphalocele and bilateral renal agenesis. Frequency of hip dislocation was significantly lower among diabetes (odds ratio 0. 15, 95 % CI 0. 05 – 0. 39) than non-diabetes cases. Multiple <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> were present in 13. 6 % of diabetes cases and 6. 1 % of non-diabetes cases. The odds ratio for caudal regression sequence was very high (26. 40, 95 % CI 8. 98 – 77. 64), but only 17 % of all caudal regression cases resulted from a pregnancy with pregestational diabetes.

Methods: For the present study, we {{analysed}} data on 1, 972, 058 newborns {{registered in the}} Netherlands Perinatal Registry database (inclusion criteria 16 weeks of gestation). Logistic regression techniques were applied to estimate risks of preterm (< 37 weeks), very preterm (< 32 weeks) and extremely preterm (< 24 weeks) birth for newborns with <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Adjustments were made for neonatal (gender, plurality) and maternal (age, parity, previous abortions, assisted reproductive management, diabetes) characteristics. Results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs). Results: The overall risk of preterm birth was 3. 8 - fold higher in newborns with <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies,</b> as compared to newborns without <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Preterm birth risk was elevated in all organ systems, but especially among newborns with <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> of {{the central nervous system}} (OR 8. 8) or the respiratory system (OR 5. 8), and among newborns with chromosomal or syndromal anomalies (OR 8. 0).

40|$|Background: Congenital {{abnormalities}} constitute one of {{the major}} causes of infant mortality, particularly in developing countries. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the epidemiology of <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> in Cote d′Ivoire. Materials and Methods: It was a multicentric study of three academic hospitals and the Heart Institute of Abidjan over 10 years. The epidemiologic Data concerned the Parturients, the annual frequency of congenital abnormalities. Distribution of the congenital abnormalities according to the organs, overall mortality and lethality of congenital abnormalities were evaluated. Results: Over 10 years, 1. 632 newborns with 1. 725 <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> were recorded. Frequency was 172. 5 <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> per annum. Parturients were less than 35 years in 33 % of cases, multigravida in 20 %, multiparous in 18 % and had a low socio economic status in 96 % of cases. Prenatal diagnosis of <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> was performed in 1. 5 %. <b>Congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> were orthopedic in 34 %, neurological in 17 %, gastrointestinal in 15 %, facial in 11. 5 %, parietal in 13 %, urogenital in 9 % and cardiac in 0. 5 % of cases. The overall mortality rate of <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> was 52 % and gastroschisis was the most lethal disease with 100 % mortality. Conclusion: This descriptive study reveals the low socio economic status of Parturients with <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> and their poor prenatal diagnosis. These factors explain the very high mortality of <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> due to a delay management in our country in which medical expenses were borne by parents and where technical platforms remain obsoletes for good resuscitation and neonatal surgery...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the prevalence of <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> in twin pregnan-cies by chorionicity and by major subtype and compare the rates with those in singletons. METHODS: The study population included 2329 twin pregnancies (4658 twins) and 147 655 singletons delivered in the Northeast of England during 1998 – 2002. Data were obtained from the population-based Northern Multiple Pregnancy Register and Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey. RESULTS: The rate of <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> in twins was 405. 8 per 10 000 twins versus 238. 2 per 10 000 singletons [rate ratios (RR) 5 1. 7, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 5 – 2. 0]. In twins with known chorionicity (84. 8 % of all twins), the prevalence of <b>congenital</b> <b>anomalies</b> in monochorionic (MC) twins (633. 6 per 10 000) was nearly twice that in dichorionic (343. 7 per 10 000; RR 5 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 – 2. 5).
