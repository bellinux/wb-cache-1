5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented <b>children</b> <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E
30|$|Because a <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> MI is not {{mature enough}} to point out objectively what he wants from an assistive technology, we suggest that such {{investigation}} is initially done with his caregivers or the rehabilitation specialists by means of brainstorming or focus groups.|$|R
50|$|During the morning, they {{proceeded}} to interrogate, torture, and execute {{the men in}} several locations. Around noon, they began taking the women and older girls in groups, separating them from their children and machinegunning them after raping them. Girls <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> 10 were raped, with soldiers reportedly heard bragging how they especially liked the 12-year-old girls. Finally, they killed the children at first by slitting their throats, then by hanging them from trees, with one <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> two years old. After killing the entire population, the soldiers {{set fire to the}} buildings.|$|R
50|$|At a {{very young}} age, {{children}} are able to identify different, basic facial emotions. If a parent makes a negative face and a positive emotional face toward two different toys, a <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> five months would avoid the toy associated with a negative face. Young children tend to associate a face showing disgust with anger instead {{of being able to}} identify the difference. Adults, however, are able to make the distinction. The age of understanding seems to be around ten years old.|$|R

[...] In numerous legal cases throughout the 1990s, several border guards, along with political officials responsible for the defence policies, were found guilty of manslaughter and served probation or were jailed for their role in the Berlin Wall deaths. Out of an estimated number of 5,000 escapees, a total of 239 people died while trying to cross the Berlin Wall.|$|R

25|$|Paraguay's {{population}} {{was only about}} 450,000 in 1865, a figure lower {{than the number of}} people in the Brazilian National Guard, and completely dwarfed by the Allied population of 11million.
