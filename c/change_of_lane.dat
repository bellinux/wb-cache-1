40|$|AbstractTraffic Rotary at road intersections {{is special}} form <b>of</b> grade <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>lanes</b> to {{channelize}} movement of vehicles {{in one direction}} around a central traffic island. With rapid growth of traffic it is experienced that widening of roads and providing flyovers have become imperative to overcome major conflicts at intersections such as collision between through and right- turn movements. In this way, major conflicts are converted into milder conflicts like merging and diverging. The vehicles entering the rotary are gently forced to move in a clockwise direction. They then weave out of the rotary to the desired direction. The crossing of vehicles is avoided by allowing all vehicles to merge into a stream around the rotary and then to diverge out to the desired radiating road. Thus the crossing conflicts eliminate and convert into weaving manoeuvre or a merging operation from right and a diverging operation to the left. In this paper, designing rotaries at road intersections is discussed and a software package is developed {{to be used in}} road works...|$|R

40|$|In this {{literature}} survey little evidence is found of studies primarily investigating the road safety effects of cruise control. Those effects which were examined (mainly through practical tests {{with and without}} cruise control) showed {{that in addition to}} positive effects governing individual fuel consumption, cruise control was also likely to cause positive road safety effects. This was linked to the fact that: (1) drivers would have fewer tasks to perform; (2) they would be driving at lower average speeds; and (3) that the traffic flow would be more `stable'. On theoretical grounds, these studies anticipate a significant road safety effect following the general introduction of cruise control on motorways in the form of cruise control on motorways {{in the form of a}} 50 per cent reduction in the number of fatal accidents involving passenger cars. This dramatic effect is linked to the calculation that the widespread introduction of cruise control would slightly reduce average speeds and significantly reduce the distribution of speeds on these road types. This would result in fewer <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane,</b> less overtaking and less braking, all of which would cause fewer accidents. One possible specific application of cruise control is in cars towing caravans, for which comfort and road safety are important factors...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{simulation}} programs {{describe the}} reality with {{different levels of}} detail: models of territorial planning are essentially macroscopic (flow - variable), those for the design are microscopic (flow kinetic characteristic - variable). Study of the intersections requires models of this second kind. On roundabout, {{with at least two}} lanes, four are conditions of circulation: immission in flow, circulation on the ring with other vehicles, <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> (to right or to left) and leaving intersection. Each of these conditions requires an interpretation model that must indicates what measurable greatness (speed, accelerations, gap, lag and so on) could link to drivers behaviour and what are variations of these for different flow conditions. Into intersection each driver is to operate successively in the four flow conditions shown. From this sequence is obtained the microsimulation model as link of partial submodels. As more they are accurate so many good the full program will work. For study the shown manoeuvrings has been realized a first survey on three different intersections with similar geometric characteristics, with different circulation conditions (variable flows) and with different drivers customs (the roundabouts are in two regions). The data acquisition, extraction and next analysis has furnished necessary indications to define some behavioural models.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the author}} {{developed}} a retroreflective sheeting selection technique for traffic signs. Previous research {{was used to}} determine the luminance needed by drivers (demand luminance). The author used roadways scenarios to determine the amount of luminance the retroreflective sheeting on a sign would produce (supply luminance). A spreadsheet was developed to determine the performance of different retroreflective sheeting types by comparing the demand and supply luminance for specific roadway scenarios. Using the results of previous studies, three demand luminance levels were created: replacement, adequate, and desirable. The replacement level represents the level of luminance when a sign needs to be replaced and is 2. 5 cd/m 2. The adequate level is the recommended amount of luminance when installing new traffic signs and is 10 cd/m 2. The desirable level is the approximate level when additional luminance has diminishing returns and is 30 cd/m 2. Supply luminance on a specific traffic sign was determined by evaluating roadway geometries, sign placement, retroreflective sheeting type and vehicle data. The author reviewed roadway geometries in Texas to estimate typical number of lanes, shoulder widths and horizontal curvature in the US. Sign placement from the MUTCD determined the typical lateral placements, sign heights, and sign twists. Vehicle data included vehicle dimensions and headlamp type. Both the supply and demand luminance were determined for a specific viewing distance for a given scenario. The viewing distance is the distance a driver needs to read or recognize a sign to respond properly. In addition, the type of sign, alphanumeric or symbol, determined how this distance was calculated. The author developed four sign groups to calculate the distance required to read and respond to a traffic sign, including 1) Stop required, 2) Reduction in speed required, 3) Read the message provided, and 4) <b>Change</b> <b>of</b> <b>lane</b> required. For symbol signs, the minimum required visibility distance (MRVD) was determined for the sign group and for text signs, the viewing distance at a legibility index (LI) of 30 ft/in was found. At these distances, the author calculated the supply luminance and then compared it to the demand luminance levels to determine the performance level. The author developed the Retroreflective Sheeting Selection Spreadsheet (RSSS) to allow others to use the methodology presented in this thesis. RSSS allows users to input the roadway data, vehicle data, and sign data. RSSS takes this information and looks up the supply luminance for the scenario. RSSS then compares the supply luminance to the demand luminance levels and outputs the retroreflective sheeting performance level for the scenario...|$|E

We study such a problem in its equivalent variational formulation. In this case, the corresponding lagrangian depends {{on the state of the}} characteristic dynamical system. As the Lax-Hopf formulae that give the solution in a semi-explicit form for an homogeneous lagrangian do not hold, we use a capture basin algorithm to compute the Moskowitz function as a viability solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Moskowitz problem with general conditions (including initial, boundary and internal conditions). We present two examples of applications. In the first one we introduce the variable speed limit as a regulation parameter. Our approach allows to compute the Moscowitz function for all values of the variable speed limit in a selected range and then to analyze its influence on the traffic flow. In particular, we study the case when the variation of the speed limit is applied locally, in space and time. Our second example deals with the local load capacity variations on the road. Such a variation can be a permanent property of the road (road narrowing) or it can be due to a temporary <b>change</b> <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>lanes</b> (an accident or roadworks, for example).

40|$|Vehicles are an {{integral}} part of everyday life. Since drivers depend on these transport means to perform their activities, it is important to investigate how they behave inside the vehicles in order to facilitate their task and avoid any undesired consequences (e. g. congestion, accidents). Different components of the driving environment have an influence on the driving behavior and the main objective of this thesis is to identify the points where the driving behavior changes due to these driving factors. From the driving conditions the traffic flow and its composition, the road geometry, the traffic signs and the traffic lights are selected and are analyzed through the use of vehicle-based systems. The actual situation that occurs in the road is determined from cameras mounted on the vehicle. For the identification of the driving behavior a simple car-following model is used, the Helly model. The first part of this study consists of the estimation of the parameters of the car-following model, while the second part consists of the identification of the points where these parameters change due to the exogenous driving factors. The estimation of the parameters is achieved through an optimization procedure which uses a moving estimation window and searches for constant sets of parameters in that time window. The estimation model performs well only under car-following situations. When the car-following task is achieved, the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>lanes,</b> the traffic lights and the changes in the traffic conditions are found to have an influence in the parameters of the Helly model. In contrast, the composition of traffic and the existence of on-ramps and off-ramps in the road do not influence the driving behavior. The proposed system captures the intra-heterogeneity in driver's behavior when performing the same action under the same circumstances. A future real-time application which would identify the driving behavior and the action points would be a valuable tool for the traffic management operations because the traffic flow phenomena could be recognized and predicted directly and more accurately. Another useful application could be found in traffic safety operations where the automated vehicles would be able to provide the right information in the appropriate phase.
