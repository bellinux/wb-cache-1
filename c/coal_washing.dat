25|$|The {{principal}} waste-waters {{associated with}} mines and quarries are slurries of rock particles in water. These arise from rainfall washing exposed surfaces and haul roads {{and also from}} rock washing and grading processes. Volumes of water can be very high, especially rainfall related arisings on large sites. Some specialized separation operations, such as <b>coal</b> <b>washing</b> to separate coal from native rock using density gradients, can produce wastewater contaminated by fine particulate haematite and surfactants. Oils and hydraulic oils are also common contaminants.|$|E

In industry, any sludge or slurry is sourced from food processing wastes, pulp and paper wastes, chemical sludges, pharmaceutical wastes, industrial waste processing sludges, and petrochemical wastes. These wastes can include mixed sludge, mineral slurry, dust sediment, selected <b>coal</b> <b>washing</b> mud, biological sludge, primary sludge, and straw, wood or waste paper pulp.|$|E

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of industrial waste materials (e. g., <b>coal</b> <b>wash</b> and steel furnace slag) {{has become a}} critical environmental problem in Australia in recent years. The possible re-use {{of these types of}} materials as structural fill for transport embankments and land reclamation is one of the preferred options from a waste management perspective. Consequently, an experimental testing program was undertaken using the triaxial apparatus to evaluate the shear behavior of compacted mixtures of <b>coal</b> <b>wash</b> (CW) and steel furnace slag (SFS). The effect of varying the confining pressure and the percentage of <b>coal</b> <b>wash</b> on the isotropic compression line, the stress-strain behavior, and particle degradation during drained shearing was evaluated. The percentage of <b>coal</b> <b>wash</b> was found to influence the shearing behavior of the CW-SFS mixtures. When the content of <b>coal</b> <b>wash</b> increased, the shear strength of the CW-SFS mixtures decreased and the axial strain corresponding to the peak stress ratio increased. Moreover, the incidence of particle breakage increased for those mixtures with a higher CW content due to the low particle strength of CW. This paper also provided a non-linear strength envelope and a corresponding empirical equation to capture the shear strength of CW-SFS mixtures...|$|R

2500|$|The British {{coal mining}} {{industry}} was nationalised in 1947. [...] Whilst this was done, {{in the words}} of the Labour Party Constitution, [...] "To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service" [...] as part of a wider process of nationalisation it did allow the coalfield to be modernised and streamlined in a way that had not been achieved in the previous decades. [...] The National Coal Board management in the 40 years following nationalisation, closed inefficient and worked out collieries, amalgamated and combined other collieries to form larger production units where significant assets such as skip winders and <b>coal</b> <b>washing</b> and grading facilities could be used by several collieries and opened new drift mines which could be fitted with the latest equipment. The results of these actions carried out against a backdrop of a volatile and declining market was that by the time the collieries of South Yorkshire were sold to private owners in the mid nineties the coal they produced was some of the cheapest in the developed world.|$|E
40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>wash</b> is a {{granular}} waste {{material that is}} readily available {{in the vicinity of}} coal mining operations. While its potential use in structural fills has been recognized in the past, the effects of particle breakage on the geomechanical performance of the material have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, an experimental study on a selected <b>coal</b> <b>wash</b> is undertaken to characterize the influence of compaction and particle breakage on its corresponding stress-strain behavior. Particular emphasis is given to the role of compaction energy level and associated breakage incurred during compaction on the drained and undrained shearing behavior. The incidence of particle breakage for undrained and drained shearing was observed to be different, which in turn had a strong influence in the yielding behavior and the critical state. Furthermore, the critical state conditions for <b>coal</b> <b>wash</b> seem to be better described through a three-dimensional surface incorporating the effect of breakage...|$|R

In this paper, detailed laboratory investigations carried out on <b>coal</b> <b>wash</b> (i. e. coarse coal washery reject), produced at Dendrobium coal mine near Wollongong, are presented.

5000|$|Raw coal often {{contains}} impurities such as slate, sulphur, ash (or [...] "bone"), clay, or soil, {{which requires}} {{that it be}} cleaned before shipment to market. Mine workers sampled the coal as {{it came out of}} the mine to determine whether the level of impurity recommended washing (if washing was available). Slate, sulphur, and ash have a higher relative density than coal, and will sink in agitated water. Passing the coal through the tipple was an essential pre-treatment process for <b>coal</b> <b>washing,</b> however, because the impure coal must be of similar sized lumps for <b>coal</b> <b>washing</b> to work.
