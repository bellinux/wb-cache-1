Although the requirement of other replicative DNA polymerases, DNA polymerases α and δ (Polα and δ), for <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> has been well documented by genetic and biochemical studies, the precise role, if any, of Polɛ in <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> is still obscure. Here we show, {{with the use of a}} cell-free replication system with Xenopus egg extracts, that Xenopus Polɛ is indeed required for <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> In Polɛ-depleted extracts, the elongation step of <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> is markedly impaired, resulting in significant reduction of the overall DNA synthesis as well as accumulation of small replication intermediates. Moreover, despite the decreased DNA synthesis, excess amounts of Polα are loaded onto the chromatin template in Polɛ-depleted extracts, indicative of the failure of proper assembly of DNA synthesis machinery at the fork. These findings strongly suggest that Polɛ, along with Polα and Polδ, is necessary for coordinated <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in eukaryotic cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{initiation}} of <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in human cell nuclei {{is not well}} understood because of its complexity. To allow investigation of this process on a molecular level, we have recently established a cell-free system that initiates chromo-somal DNA replication in an origin-speci®c manner under cell cycle control in isolated human cell nuclei. We have now used fractionation and recon-stitution experiments to functionally identify cellular factors present in a human cell extract that trigger {{initiation of}} <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in this system. Initial fractionation of a cytosolic extract indicates the presence {{of at least two}} independent and non-redundant initiation factors. We have puri-®ed one of these factors to homogeneity and identi-®ed it as the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA. The prokaryotic single-stranded DNA binding protein SSB cannot substitute for RPA in the initi-ation of human <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> Antibodies speci®c for human RPA inhibit the initi-ation step of human <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in vitro.

40|$|Abstract Background DNA {{polymerase}} ε (Pol ε) {{is involved}} in DNA replication, repair, and cell-cycle checkpoint control in eukaryotic cells. Although the roles of replicative Pol α and Pol δ in <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> are relatively well understood and well documented, the precise role of Pol ε in <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> is not well understood. Results This study uses a Xenopus egg extract DNA replication system to further elucidate the replicative role(s) played by Pol ε. Previous {{studies show that the}} initiation timing and elongation of <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> are markedly impaired in Pol ε-depleted Xenopus egg extracts, with reduced accumulation of replicative intermediates and products. This study shows that normal replication is restored by addition of Pol ε holoenzyme to Pol ε-depleted extracts, but not by addition of polymerase-deficient forms of Pol ε, including polymerase point or deletion mutants or incomplete enzyme complexes. Evidence is also provided that Pol ε holoenzyme interacts directly with GINS, Cdc 45 p and Cut 5 p, each of which {{plays an important role in}} initiation of <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in eukaryotic cells. Conclusion These results indicate that the DNA polymerase activity of Pol ε holoenzyme plays an essential role in normal <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in Xenopus egg extracts. These are the first biochemical data to show the DNA polymerase activity of Pol ε holoenzyme is essential for <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in higher eukaryotes, unlike in yeasts. </p...|$|R

Although ORC of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been studied extensively from biochemical and genetic perspectives, its structure remains unknown.

50|$|As {{described}} above, bacterial <b>chromosomal</b> <b>replication</b> {{occurs in}} a bidirectional manner. This was first demonstrated by specifically labelling replicating bacterial chromosomes with radioactive isotopes. The regions of DNA undergoing replication during the experiment were then visualized by using autoradiography and examining the developed film microscopically.

Shortly after, the E. coli chromosome was also shown to replicate bidirectionally.|$|E
50|$|Recombination {{may also}} occur during mitosis in eukaryotes where it ordinarily {{involves}} the two sister chromosomes formed after <b>chromosomal</b> <b>replication.</b> In this case, new combinations of alleles are not produced since the sister chromosomes are usually identical. In meiosis and mitosis, recombination occurs between similar molecules of DNA (homologs). In meiosis, non-sister homologous chromosomes pair {{with each other}} so that recombination characteristically occurs between non-sister homologues. In both meiotic and mitotic cells, recombination between homologous chromosomes is a common mechanism used in DNA repair.|$|E

40|$|Many factors {{required}} for <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> {{have been identified}} in unicellular eukaryotes. However, DNA replication in complex multicellular organisms is poorly understood. Here, we report the identification of GEMC 1, a novel vertebrate protein {{required for}} <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> GEMC 1 is highly conserved in vertebrates and is preferentially expressed in proliferating cells. Using Xenopus egg extract we show that Xenopus GEMC 1 (xGEMC 1) binds to checkpoint and replication factor TopBP 1, which promotes xGEMC 1 binding to chromatin during pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation. We demonstrate that xGEMC 1 directly interacts with replication factors such as Cdc 45 and Cdk 2 -CyclinE by which it is heavily phosphorylated. Phosphorylated xGEMC 1 stimulates initiation of DNA replication whereas depletion of xGEMC 1 prevents DNA replication onset due to impairment of Cdc 45 loading onto chromatin. Likewise, inhibition of GEMC 1 expression by morpholino and siRNA oligos prevents DNA replication in embryonic and somatic vertebrate cells. These data suggest that GEMC 1 promotes initiation of <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in higher eukaryotes by mediating TopBP 1 and Cdk 2 dependent recruitment of Cdc 45 onto replication origins...|$|R

The nucleoside base was incorporated uniformly into the bacterial chromosome. He then isolated the chromosomes by lysing the cells gently and placed them on an electron micrograph (EM) grid which he exposed to X-ray film for two months.

40|$|Noncoding RNAs are {{recognized}} increasingly as important regulators of fundamental biological processes, such as gene expression and development, in eukaryotes. We report here {{the identification and}} functional characterization of the small noncoding human Y RNAs (hY RNAs) as novel factors for <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in a human cell-free system. In addition to protein fractions, hY RNAs are essential {{for the establishment of}} active <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> forks in template nuclei isolated from late-G 1 -phase human cells. Specific degradation of hY RNAs leads to the inhibition of semiconservative DNA replication in late-G 1 -phase template nuclei. This inhibition is negated by resupplementation of hY RNAs. All four hY RNAs (hY 1, hY 3, hY 4, and hY 5) can functionally substitute for each other in this system. Mutagenesis of hY 1 RNA showed that the binding site for Ro 60 protein, which is required for Ro RNP assembly, is not essential for DNA replication. Degradation of hY 1 RNA in asynchronously proliferating HeLa cells by RNA interference reduced the percentages of cells incorporating bromodeoxyuridine in vivo. These experiments implicate a functional role for hY RNAs in human <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication...</b>|$|R

The mechanisms of action of most of these systems are incompletely understood. The present report indicates that microbicidal activity by a neutrophil-derived antimicrobial system, consisting of myeloperoxidase, enzymatically generated hydrogen peroxide, and chloride ion, is accompanied by prompt cessation of DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli, as determined by markedly reduced incorporation of [3 H]thymidine into trichloracetic acid-precipitable material. Simultaneously, the myeloperoxidase system mediates {{a decline in the}} ability of E. coli membranes to bind hemimethylated DNA sequences containing the E. coli <b>chromosomal</b> origin of <b>replication</b> (oriC). Binding of oriC to the E. coli membrane is an essential element of orderly <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> Comparable early changes in DNA synthesis and DNA-membrane interactions were not observed with alternative oxidant or antibiotic-mediated microbicidal systems.

50|$|Although {{sporulation}} in B. subtilis is {{induced by}} starvation, the sporulation developmental {{program is not}} initiated immediately when growth slows due to nutrient limitation. A variety of alternative responses can occur, including the activation of flagellar motility to seek new food sources by chemotaxis, the production of antibiotics to destroy competing soil microbes, the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes to scavenge extracellular proteins and polysaccharides, or the induction of ‘competence’ for uptake of exogenous DNA for consumption, with the occasional side-effect that new genetic information is stably integrated. Sporulation is the last-ditch response to starvation and is suppressed until alternative responses prove inadequate.

In the absence of pRb, E2F1 (along with its binding partner DP1) mediates the trans-activation of E2F1 target genes that facilitate the G1/S transition and S-phase. E2F targets genes that encode proteins involved in DNA replication (for example DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase, dihydrofolate reductase and cdc6), and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>replication</b> (replication origin-binding protein HsOrc1 and MCM5). When cells are not proliferating, E2F DNA binding sites contribute to transcriptional repression.

In Escherichia coli, at least two negative regulators of FtsZ assembly form a bipolar gradient, such that the critical concentration of FtsZ required for FtsZ assembly is lowest at mid-cell between the two segregating chromosomes. This type of regulation seems to occur in other species such as Bacillus subtilis and Caulobacter crescentus. However, other species including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Myxococcus xanthus seem to use positive regulators that stimulate FtsZ assembly at mid-cell.|$|E

Using Xenopus laevis egg extract we show that Xenopus GEMC 1 (xGEMC 1) binds to the checkpoint and replication factor TopBP 1, which promotes binding of xGEMC 1 to chromatin during pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation.

Phosphorylated xGEMC 1 stimulates initiation of DNA replication, whereas depletion of xGEMC 1 prevents the onset of DNA replication owing to the impairment of Cdc 45 loading onto chromatin. Similarly, inhibition of GEMC 1 expression with morpholino and siRNA oligos prevents DNA replication in embryonic and somatic vertebrate cells.

Y RNA genes are present in all vertebrates and in some isolated nonvertebrates, but the conservation of Y RNA function and key determinants for its function are unknown. Here, we identify a determinant of Y RNA function in DNA replication, which is conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. Vertebrate Y RNAs are able to reconstitute <b>chromosomal</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in the human cell-free DNA replication system, but nonvertebrate Y RNAs are not. A conserved nucleotide sequence motif in the double-stranded stem of vertebrate Y RNAs correlates with Y RNA function. A functional screen of human Y 1 RNA mutants identified this conserved motif as an essential determinant for reconstituting DNA replication in vitro. Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides comprising this RNA motif are sufficient to reconstitute DNA replication, but corresponding DNA or random sequence RNA oligonucleotides are not. In intact cells, wild-type hY 1 or the conserved RNA duplex can rescue an inhibition of DNA replication after RNA interference against hY 3 RNA.
