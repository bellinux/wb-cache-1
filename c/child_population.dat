Originally a coaching inn known as the Artichoke, it has been occupied by the foundry since 1738, replacing smaller premises {{on the north side}} of the road. Davenant Foundation School moved to No.173 Whitechapel Road in 1818. The school expanded with a new hall and classrooms in 1896, with further improvements in 1909. However, a decreasing <b>child</b> <b>population</b> meant that in 1965, the school moved to Loughton, Essex. The building remains on the north side and is Grade II listed.|$|E

25|$|Sixty-four people {{stayed the}} first winter. They were {{supplemented}} from May 1918, bringing the summer population to 300. In {{the following years}} the town was gradually expanded with additional housing and work buildings. During the first years several names were in use for the settlement, including Kings Bay, Kingsbay and Brandal City. Ny-Ålesund came into use in the early 1920s and was soon the official name of the settlement. The mining was hit by two strikes in 1919, the first lasting from the summer to October, and the second from November to January 1920. Because of the ice, each year the shipping was limited from May through October. By 1919 the company had fallen into severe financial difficulties. A British take-over was waved off and instead state coal purchasing agreement, effectively subsidies, were enforced. By 1921 the men had started bringing their families, raising the female population to twenty-two and the <b>child</b> <b>population</b> to twenty-three. An improvised school was therefore taken into use.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{expressed}} concern about the country's increasing surveillance. In August 2004, the information commissioner, Richard Thomas, drawing a parallel with the way that governments in Eastern Europe and Spain gained too much power and information in the 20th century, {{expressed concern}} over this and other national databases, including the Citizen Information Project, NHS National Programme for IT, and the introduction of identity cards, warning that there was a danger of the country 'sleepwalk into a surveillance society'. On 18 April 2006, Des Browne, the Secretary of State for Defence, said 'the Department for Education and Skills should also consider whether there is scope to realise further efficiency and effectiveness benefits through a <b>child</b> <b>population</b> register', and it is thought that the database may be used in conjunction with the National Identity Register and other databases. Phil Booth, national coordinator of NO2ID, a group opposing identity cards, said this was 'cradle-to-grave surveillance'. Conservative Party member of parliament Oliver Heald said, 'there is already public concern at government plans for a compulsory identity card database, a nanny state children's database and a property database for the council tax ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{decline in}} death rate and birth rate that occurs during the {{demographic}} transition may transform the age structure. When {{the death rate}} declines during {{the second stage of}} the transition, the result is primarily an increase in the <b>child</b> <b>population.</b> The reason being that when the death rate is high (stage one), the infant mortality rate is very high, often above 200 deaths per 1000 children born. When the death rate falls or improves, this may include lower infant mortality rate and increased child survival. Over time, as individuals with increased survival rates age, there may also be {{an increase in the number}} of older children, teenagers, and young adults. This implies that there is an increase in the fertile population proportion which, with constant fertility rates, may lead to an increase in the number of children born. This will further increase the growth of the <b>child</b> <b>population.</b> The second stage of the demographic transition, therefore, implies a rise in child dependency and creates a youth bulge in the population structure. As a population continues to move through the demographic transition into the third stage, fertility declines and the youth bulge prior to the decline ages out of child dependency into the working ages. This stage of the transition is often referred to as the golden age, and is typically when populations see the greatest advancements in living standards and economic development. However, further declines in both mortality and fertility will eventually result in an aging population, and a rise in the aged dependency ratio. An increase of the aged dependency ratio often indicates that a population has reached below replacement levels of fertility, and as result does not have enough people in the working ages to support the economy, and the growing dependent population.|$|E

60|$|The {{problem of}} {{inducing}} the peasants {{to feed the}} towns is one which Russia shares with Central Europe, and from what one hears Russia has been less unsuccessful than some other countries in dealing with this problem. For the Soviet Government, the problem is mainly concentrated in Moscow and Petrograd; the other towns are not very large, and are mostly in the centre of rich agricultural districts. It is true that in the North even the rural population normally depends upon food from more southerly districts; but the northern population is small. It is commonly said {{that the problem of}} feeding Moscow and Petrograd is a transport problem, but I think this is only partially true. There is, of course, a grave deficiency of rolling-stock, especially of locomotives in good repair. But Moscow is surrounded by very good land. In the course of a day's motoring in the neighbourhood, I saw enough cows to supply milk to the whole <b>child</b> <b>population</b> of Moscow, although what I had come to see was children's sanatoria, not farms. All kinds of food can be bought in the market at high prices. I travelled over a considerable extent of Russian railways, and saw a fair number of goods trains. For all these reasons, I feel convinced that the share of the transport problem in the food difficulties has been exaggerated. Of course transport plays a larger part in the shortage in Petrograd than in Moscow, because food comes mainly from south of Moscow. In Petrograd, most of the people one sees in the streets show obvious signs of under-feeding. In Moscow, the visible signs are much less frequent, but {{there is no doubt that}} under-feeding, though not actual starvation, is nearly universal.|$|E
