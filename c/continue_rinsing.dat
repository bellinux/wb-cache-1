5000|$|Lily {{begins to}} {{experience}} strange events. On her {{first night in}} the house, the telephone is wrenched out of her hands by an unseen force. A spot of black mold appears on a section of wall and slowly grows as the months pass. Lily often finds {{a corner of the}} rug {{at the base of the}} stairs has been flipped up, but she is the only person in the house who walks on the first floor. Ms. Blum only calls Lily [...] "Polly," [...] never using her real name. Mr. Waxcap explains that Polly Parsons is the protagonist of Ms. Blum's most popular novel, The Lady in the Walls. Lily presses him about how the novel ends, but he says she must read it herself. Lily responds that she is easily scared, and cannot bring herself to read it. Later, Lily opens a copy of the book in Ms. Blum's study, and it has a dried chrysanthemum pressed between the pages. Steeling herself to read, Lily learns the novel's central conceit: that Ms. Blum communicated with the long-dead Polly, and is retelling Polly's story. Lily puts the book down after a few pages, too frightened to <b>continue.</b> While <b>rinsing</b> berries in the kitchen, black mold spots cover Lily's hands and arms, then her arms bloat and turn sickly gray as if they are rotting, but a second later she looks down again and everything is normal. She glimpses a figure dressed in white reflected on a TV screen, but no one is there when she turns around.|$|R
30|$|Within 1  month before {{surgical}} treatment, {{all patients}} received extensive oral hygiene instructions and mechanical non-surgical debridement of implants and remaining dentition using hand instrumentation and/or an ultrasonic device. Immediately before surgical treatment screw-retained suprastructures were removed. In {{order to obtain}} an optimal overview of the peri-implant area during surgery, prior to the procedure, only screw-retained suprastructures were removed. Cemented single crowns or bridges on mesostructures were left in place to prevent any damage to these structures. Directly after surgery, the screw-retained suprastructures were placed back. Cemented single crowns or bridges on mesostructures were left in place to prevent any damage to these structures. Vertical releasing incisions extending into the alveolar mucosa were placed using a surgical blade (no. 15), and full thickness mucoperiosteal flaps were raised buccally and lingually. Flaps were designed to allow optimal access to the peri-implant bone defect. Granulation tissue was removed using titanium curettes (Gracey; Hu-Friedy®, Chicago, IL, USA). The implant surfaces were mechanically cleaned using titanium curettes and gauzes and cotton pellets soaked in saline. Next, the patients were randomly allocated to either the test or control group. Subsequently, implants were cleaned with either local application of 35 % phosphoric acid gel (pH  1) for 1  min (Temrex gel, Temrex, Freeport, NY, USA) (test group) or by rinsing with an abundant amount of sterile saline for 1  min (control group). Care was taken to apply the phosphoric etching gel precisely on the implant surface using a syringe with a small tip. During 1  min, the etching gel was continuously rubbed on to the implant surface with a small brush. In both groups, the intervention <b>continued</b> with <b>rinsing</b> of the implant surface with an abundant amount of sterile saline for 1  min.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{develop an}} {{improved}} method for {{quantitative assessment of}} antimicrobial efficacy and substantivity of mouth rinses and dentifrices on in vivo treated plaque. Materials and Methods: Nine- and 72 -h-old plaques were formed in volunteers carrying out standardized hygiene using NaF-containing dentifrice. Plaques were collected before (baseline) in vivo treatment with dentifrices or chlorhexidine mouth rinse, immediately post-treatment and after 1 or 6 h, dispersed in demineralized water and stained with live/dead stain after which bacteria were enumerated. Dispersed baseline plaques were treated with dentifrices or chlorhexidine to determine antimicrobial efficacy against planktonic bacteria. Results: Baseline plaques revealed 56 - 41 % viable organisms in 9 - and 72 -h-old plaques, respectively. Treatment of planktonic (dispersed baseline plaque) bacteria resulted in 1 - 4 % viable organisms. Chlorhexidine mouth rinse and dentifrices produced strong immediate antimicrobial effects, but after 1 or 6 h, the proportion of viable organisms in 9 -h-old plaques rebounded significantly with only chlorhexidine mouth rinse retaining significant efficacy. Seventy-two-hour-old plaques were less susceptible to antimicrobials, although dentifrices appeared more effective after 6 h than initially, whereas efficacy of chlorhexidine <b>rinse</b> <b>continued</b> to drop with time post-treatment. Conclusions: The proposed method holds promise for assessment of both immediate and retained antimicrobial actions of oral treatments against dental plaque in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Dental caries on approximal tooth {{surfaces}} in adolescents {{is still a}} problem in Sweden, {{as well as in}} many other industrialised countries. The aims of the present thesis were therefore: 1) to study whether caries prevalence is underestimated, 2) to evaluate the effect of cessation of fluoride mouth rinse (FMR) programmes in schoolchildren with low caries prevalence, and 3) to reconsider the school as an arena for population-based fluoride (F) varnish and FMR programmes in order to minimise caries development in 13 - 16 -year-olds. Papers I and II showed that the adolescents own dentists consistently registered less caries compared to the recordings made by calibrated dentists from outside. Based on 420 16 -year-olds at 12 different dental clinics in two neighbouring counties in Sweden, the differences were statistically significant at 10 of the 12 clinics when caries prevalence was both high in 1984 (Paper I) and somewhat lower in 1987 and 1990 (Paper II). About 80 % of all approximal caries lesions were enamel lesions and are therefore not reported to the Swedish authorities, as only dentin lesions and fillings are currently included in the official caries data. The basis for Paper III was that many counties in Sweden abandoned school-based FMR programmes in the mid-late 1980 s, as the official caries data revealed low caries prevalence among children. The cessation of FMR for 3 years for a group of 13 - 16 -year-old adolescents (n= 60) with low caries prevalence did not reveal any statistically significant differences in new caries lesions and fillings or in the progression of existing enamel lesions compared to a group of 13 - 16 -year-olds (n= 60) who <b>continued</b> to <b>rinse</b> for 3 years. Nor did a supplementary cross-sectional study reveal any differences in caries prevalence among adolescents who had or had not taken part in FMR programmes for the last 3 years. In Papers IV and V, new models for school-based F treatment were evaluated in two 3 -year randomised controlled trials, RCT studies. Fluoride varnish (Duraphat) treatment, carried out at school by specially trained dental nurses using a simple mobile unit, among 854 13 - 16 -year-olds from low, medium and high caries risk areas, showed that the control groups developed more caries than the varnish groups (Paper IV). The largest difference was found in the high risk area. The prevented fraction (PF) with approximal enamel lesions as the diagnostic threshold was 69 % in high, 66 % in medium and 20 % in low risk areas for F varnish applied twice a year at 6 -month intervals. Supervised school-based FMR among 788 13 - 16 -year-olds with a low to moderate caries risk (Paper V) showed that FMR on the first three and the last three school days during the school term, i. e. 12 rinses/year, had a PF of 59 %. Enamel lesions constituted > 90 % of the new approximal caries lesions in both Papers IV and V. The main conclusions from this thesis are: (1) that enamel caries lesions on approximal surfaces should be included in epidemiological caries data in order to show true caries prevalence, (2) that the cessation of weekly FMR for 3 years did not lead to a statistically significant increase in caries incidence in a relatively small group of adolescents with low caries prevalence, and (3) that the school should be reconsidered as an arena for new models for population-based F school programmes. Fluoride varnish treatment twice a year at 6 -month intervals in medium and high caries risk areas, as well as supervised FMR on the first and the last three school days during the school term in low and medium caries risk areas, are excellent caries prevention strategies for approximal {{surfaces in}} adolescents at the caries risk ages of 13 - 16 years, as a supplement to dental home care and preventive efforts at dental clinics...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to assess radiographically the effects of scaling/root planing {{combined}} with antibiotic therapy using tetracycline fibers (TCF) : (I) on alveolar bone density and linear discriptors and (II) on supracrestal soft tissue density. 19 subjects with generalized adult periodontitis (with at least 20 teeth present, at least 4 teeth with pockets > 4 mm and bleeding upon controlled force probing) and high cultural counts of Porphyromonas gingivalis were recruited from a pool of 57 patients. The full mouth treatment group (FT) consisted of 10 patients, who underwent a full mouth supra-gingival scaling and prophylaxis treatment and were instructed to rinse 2 X daily with a 0. 1 % chlorhexidine solution. 1 week later, tetracycline-hydrochloride-containing fibers (Actisite® periodontal fiber) were applied around all teeth. After 7 - 12 days, the fibers were removed and all teeth were scaled and root planed under local anaesthesia. The chlorhexidine <b>rinsing</b> <b>continued</b> for another 2 months. In 9 subjects (local treatment group LT), 2 teeth with periodontal lesions with pocket probing pepth (PPD) ≥ 5 mm were treated by placement of tetracycline fibers, which remained in place for 7 to 12 days. Upon removal of the fibers, scaling and root planing was performed on these 2 teeth, {{while the rest of the}} dentition remained untreated, and no chlorhexidine rinse was applied. 2 of the untreated teeth revealing similar periodontal lesions were chosen to represent sites affected by untreated periodontitis (NT). In this group, a limited local treatment was performed (2 teeth) with the inherent potential for recolonization from the untreated pocket sites. Standardized periapical radiographs were obtained from the 4 monitored sites within each patient at baseline (before treatment) and 2 and 6 months thereafter. One radiograph was exposed in a standard way for bone assessment. The second radiograph was underexposed, at about a 1 / 5 of the original exposure time to allow the evaluation of soft tissue. Mean changes in the linear parameters and changes in density (CADIA) observed at multiple sites within each patient and treatment group were used as the best estimate of treatment outcome. Over the observation period of 6 months, a significant difference in bone height changes was found between the untreated sites (median loss - 0. 29 mm) and the sites from full-mouth treated patients (median gain 0. 24 mm, p= 0. 008). When comparing the baseline to the 6 months radiographs, a loss in bone density was observed for the untreated group (median=- 2. 13 CADIA). Both treatment groups revealed a gain in density (median= 1. 58 and 2. 43 CADIA for the locally and the full-mouth treated groups, respectively). Differences in density were significant, both between the nontreated and locally treated sites (p= 0. 026) and between the nontreated sites and the sites from the full mouth treated patients (p= 0. 002). The analysis of the soft tissues showed a similar pattern of changes in density to those seen in the bone defect. At 2 months, there was a tendency for loss in density for the nontreated group (median=- 0. 17 CADIA) that continued over the 6 month period (median=- 0. 31 CADIA). A significant increase in density was observed for the full-mouth treated sites (median= 1. 57 and 0. 64 CADIA for the 2 and 6 months radiographs, respectively). A significant increase was also observed for the locally treated group when compared to the untreated sites (median= 0. 13 and 0. 10 CADIA for the 2 and 6 months radiographs, respectively). Comparing untreated sites with full-mouth treated sites, a significant difference was observed for CADIA measurements (p< 0. 001). No significant difference was observed comparing locally treated and untreated sites (p= 0. 24). It was concluded that scaling and root planing combined with TCF therapy can result in increased bone density and alveolar bone height. Full-mouth treatment seemed to result in more pronounced gains compared to local treatment. Untreated sites continued to lose alveolar bone height and density. CADIA of supracrestal soft tissue ROI paralleled the remodelling observed in bone ROI. This is the first controlled study revealing that CADIA of soft tissue ROI in series of under-exposed standardized radiographs may render additional valuable information on remodelling of periodontal tissues after therapy. © Munksgaard 1998. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
