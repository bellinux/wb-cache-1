5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s {{to protect themselves from}} head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which <b>cleat</b> to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter <b>cleat</b> to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|E
25|$|Clipless pedals are bicycle pedals {{that require}} a special cycling shoe with a <b>cleat</b> fitted to the sole, which locks into a {{mechanism}} in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal. Most clipless pedals lock onto the <b>cleat</b> when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward, although {{in some cases the}} locking mechanism is built into the <b>cleat</b> instead of the pedal. The clipless pedal was invented in 1895 by Charles Hanson of Peace Dale, Rhode Island.|$|E

25|$|Long-pan systems (pans and seam lengths {{greater than}} 10-feet) {{accommodate}} the cumulative expansion stress over long spans of copper sheets. These installations can be complicated {{due to the}} length of roof pan versus seam length, <b>cleat</b> design and spacing, and the physical expansion characteristics of copper sheets.

500|$|In many cases, {{injuries}} sustained {{while playing}} can cause long-term damage.

More recently, rule changes to protect players from head injuries have been instituted. Equipment like the football helmet and pads are used to give players a level of protection from injuries, while other factors such as <b>cleat</b> size are used to minimize the risk of injuries due to field condition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There {{are lots}} of <b>cleats,</b> {{fractures}} and many other structure weak planes in coal seams, which make the bullet holes and <b>cleats</b> intersecting. During the hydraulic fracturing process in coal seams, fractures will initiate at coal rock body of borehole wall, and <b>cleats</b> or fractures are different from conventional reservoirs. Thus a new model for initiation pressure calculation during coal seams fracturing should be established. Based on the rock mechanics and elasticity mechanics, and also on network distribution characteristics of coal seam <b>cleats</b> and the space position relationships between the intersected bullet holes and <b>cleats,</b> stress distribution around the bullet holes and at the <b>cleats</b> wall were deducted. The model was established in tensile failure condition. The calculated initiation fracture pressure of Well HX- 3 was 10. 71 MPa. The pressure obtained from bottom hole pressure gauge was 11. 24 MPa. The relative error was 4. 72 %. The model could be applied for initiation pressure calculation during hydraulic fracturing process in coal seams. The fractures would initiate at the <b>cleats</b> during fracturing...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Cleats</b> {{began to}} be used in the United States in the 1860s when metal spikes were first used on {{baseball}} shoes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of different outsole hardness of turf <b>cleats</b> shoes on the lower limb kinematics and kinetics of soccer players playing on artificial turf. The participants were required to complete tasks of straight running and 45 ° left sidestep cutting movements, respectively, at the speed of 4. 5 ± 0. 2 m/s on artificial turf. They were asked to randomly select turf <b>cleats</b> shoes with a soft outsole (SO), medium hardness outsole (MO) and hard outsole (HO). During the stance phase of straight running, peak pressure and force-time integral in medial forefoot (MFF) of players wearing <b>cleats</b> shoes with MO were significantly higher than those wearing <b>cleats</b> shoes with SO. During the stance phase of a 45 ° cutting maneuver, players wearing <b>cleats</b> shoes with SO showed significantly higher peak knee flexion and abduction angles than the HO group. Players wearing <b>cleats</b> shoes with SO also showed higher ankle dorsiflexion and inversion angles compared with those wearing <b>cleats</b> shoes with HO. The vertical average loading rate (VALR) as well as peak pressure and force-time integral in the heel (H) and lateral forefoot (LFF) regions of players wearing <b>cleats</b> shoes with HO were significantly higher than those wearing shoes with SO. On the contrary, peak pressure and force-time integral of players wearing shoes with SO were significantly higher than those wearing shoes with HO in MFF. A higher vertical loading rate and plantar pressure of some areas may increase the potential risk of metatarsal stress fractures and plantar fasciitis. Therefore, this finding about turf <b>cleats</b> shoes could give some theoretic support for the design of turf <b>cleats</b> shoes and material optimization in the future...|$|R
