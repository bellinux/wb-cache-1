25|$|From 16 March 2015, Opera Mini's extreme {{compression}} mode uses an upgraded {{version of the}} Presto layout engine that is included in Opera 12. Consequently, Opera Mini supports most of the web standards supported in Opera 12. Presto's development has continued for Opera Mini and further support was added for HTML5 input types, CSS Flexbox model, CSS rem units and ECMAScript 5. However, unlike the desktop edition of Opera, frames are flattened because of client limitations, and dotted or dashed borders are displayed as solid borders due to bandwidth and memory issues. As Opera Mini reformats web pages, it does not pass the Acid2 standards <b>compliance</b> <b>test.</b> Opera Mini supports bi-directional text, meaning that it can correctly display right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew in addition to languages written left-to-right. However, it will not display right-to-left text if the font size is set to small or very small. Indic and Chinese scripts are supported only if an appropriate font is installed on the device as the default system font.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, the <b>compliance</b> <b>test</b> suites {{have been}} criticized for being buggy and incompleteâ€”most notably, in 2005 Ulrich Drepper criticized the LSB for poorly written tests which can cause {{incompatibility}} between LSB-certified distributions when some implement incorrect behavior to make buggy tests work, while others apply for and receive waivers from complying with the tests. He also denounced a lack of application testing, pointing out that testing only distributions can never solve the problem of applications relying on implementation-defined behavior.|$|E

50|$|Only four {{manufacturers}} make DCI-approved {{digital cinema}} projectors; these are Sony, Barco, Christie and NEC. Except for Sony, who {{use their own}} SXRD technology, all use the Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology developed by Texas Instruments (TI). Although D-Cinema projectors are similar in principle to digital projectors used in industry, education, and domestic home cinemas they differ in two important respects: first, they must conform to the strict performance requirements of the DCI specification; second, they must incorporate anti-piracy devices intended to protect the content copyright. For these reasons all projectors intended {{to be sold to}} theaters for screening current release movies must be approved by the DCI before being put on sale. They now pass through a process called CTP (<b>compliance</b> <b>test</b> plan). Because feature films in digital form are encrypted and the decryption keys (KDMs) are locked to the serial number of the server used (linking to both the projector serial number and server is planned in the future), a system will allow playback of a protected feature only with the required KDM.|$|E
40|$|Curing has {{substantial}} {{effects on}} the long-term performance of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement. TxDOT requires two applications of curing compounds, with a maximum 180 sf/gal per each application. However, no <b>compliance</b> <b>testing</b> is conducted for curing and, from a practical standpoint, compliance with specification requirements are rarely verified. The purpose {{of this research was}} to identify simple testing procedures that can be implemented to verify the compliance with specification requirements on curing. To this end, various test methods that appear to have potential for <b>compliance</b> <b>testing</b> for curing were evaluated in the field. The test methods evaluated include penetration resistance, initial surface adsorption, surface temperature, reflectance, relative humidity, and dielectric constant. A factorial experiment was set up for field testing, and the test methods were evaluated in the field. Varying rate of curing compound applications as well as application time was included as variables in the factorial experiment. Advantages and limitations of each method were identified and discussed. Based on the findings, it is concluded that the methods evaluated are neither practical nor accurate enough to be included in TxDOT specifications as a <b>compliance</b> <b>testing.</b> Rather, it appears that evaluating curing compound application rates by measuring curing cart speed could present most feasible method for <b>compliance</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Curing of {{concrete}} has substantial {{effects on the}} performance of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement. Curing effectiveness depends {{on the quality of the}} curing materials, time of curing compound application in relation to evaporation, and the amount and uniformity of the curing compound applications. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) developed and maintains a quality monitoring (QM) program for curing compounds to ensure that curing compounds used in TxDOT projects meet the minimum requirements. The timing of curing compound application as required in the specifications is well adhered. On the other hand, the uniformity and the amount of curing compounds applied are not monitored as well as they should be, primarily due to the lack of simple and proper methods for verifying their compliance with the specification requirements. To ensure good quality of curing in TxDOT paving projects, there is a need for simple and easy-to-use <b>compliance</b> <b>testing.</b> TxDOT Research Project 0 - 5106 evaluated and identified potential <b>compliance</b> <b>testing</b> for curing compound application rate and uniformity. Speed control of the curing machine was the basis for the <b>compliance</b> <b>testing</b> utilizing non-contact Doppler radar speed sensor and wireless data logger system. This project evaluated the feasibility of implementing this <b>compliance</b> <b>testing</b> in TxDOT construction projects. The findings include (1) speed control of the curin...|$|R

50|$|CAFE {{footprint}} {{requirements are}} set up such that a vehicle with a larger footprint has a lower fuel economy requirement than a vehicle with a smaller footprint. For example, the fuel economy target for the 2012 Honda Fit with a footprint of 40 sq ft is 36 mpg, equivalent to a published fuel economy of 27 mpg, and a Ford F-150 with its footprint of 65 - 75 sq ft has a fuel economy target of 22 mpg, i.e., 17 mpg published. Individual vehicles {{do not have to}} meet their fuel economy targets; CAFE compliance is enforced at the fleet level. CAFE 2016 target fuel economy of 34.0 MPG (44 sq. ft. footprint) compares to 2012 advanced vehicle performance of Prius hybrid on the <b>compliance</b> <b>test</b> cycles: 70.7 MPG, Plug-in Prius hybrid: 69.8 MPGe and LEAF electric vehicle: 141.7 MPGe. The compliance fuel economy of plug-in electric vehicles such as the Plug-in Prius or LEAF is complicated by accounting for the energy used in generating electricity. In 2012, the LEAF's compliance fuel consumption was considered to be 0 gal/mi, or infinite fuel economy, as it uses no liquid fuel on board, and that of the Plug-in Prius was also adjusted for the portion of vehicle energy use originating from the electric grid.|$|E

40|$|For <b>compliance</b> <b>test</b> purposes, {{the noise}} level of a HVAC is usually {{measured}} with a pressure microphone positioned at a certain distance. This measurement is normally performed in an anechoic room. However, this method doesn't provide the engineer any insight on what noise sources do contribute to the overall noise level measured. A new Microflown based low sound level source path contribution analysis measurement approach is presented to pinpoint the various noise sources that vary in time, frequency and place. The new method shows all place and time dependent noise sources, and allows assessment of {{the extent that they}} contribute to the overall noise level determined for the <b>compliance</b> <b>test</b> using the sound pressure microphone.
