6000|$|In another {{movement}} {{in the region of}} ecclesiastical machinery, from which much was hoped, though little is believed to have come, Mr. Gladstone was concerned, though I do not gather from the papers that he watched it with the zealous interest of some of his friends. Convocation, the ancient assembly or parliament of the clergy of the church of England, was permitted in 1852 to resume the active functions that had been suspended since 1717. To Mr. Gladstone some revival or institution of the <b>corporate</b> <b>organisation</b> of the church, especially after the Gorham judgment, was ever a cherished object. Bishop Wilberforce, long one of the most intimate of his friends, was chief mover in proceedings that, as was hoped, were to rescue the church from the anarchy in which one branch of her sons regarded her as plunged. Some of Mr. Gladstone’s correspondence on the question of convocation has already been made public.(112) Here it is enough to print a passage or two from a letter addressed by him to the bishop (Jan. 1, 1854) setting out his view of the real need of the time. After a generous exaltation of the zeal and devotion of the clergy, he goes on to the gains that might be expected from their effective organisation:— ...|$|E

This research aimed to evaluate the initiative {{in order to understand the}} benefits, barriers and partnership working and sought to answer the question: how is CSR being leveraged through sport by <b>corporate</b> <b>organisations</b> in the lead up to mega-sporting events? The case-based methodology employed a series of semi-structured interviews that were conducted with senior directors and managers within National Governing Bodies (NGBs) and <b>corporate</b> <b>organisations.</b> Interview data were supplemented by a content analysis of documentation associated with, and about, the initiative. Findings included: corporate leveraging to achieve subtle human resourcing objectives, indirect involvement and market research into the Olympic Games and the increase of corporate capital. This research concludes that CSR relationships in sport can be innovative and creative but require objective alignment, appropriate timing and the management of expectations...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{technology}} for competitive advantage has become a necessity, not only for <b>corporate</b> <b>organisations,</b> but for higher education institutions (HEIs) as well. Consequently, <b>corporate</b> <b>organisations</b> and HEIs alike must be equipped {{to protect against the}} pervasive nature {{of technology}}. To do this, they implement controls and undergo audits to ensure these controls are implemented correctly. Although HEIs are a different kind of entity to <b>corporate</b> <b>organisations,</b> HEI information technology (IT) audits are based on the same criteria as those for <b>corporate</b> <b>organisations.</b> The primary aim of this research, therefore, was to develop a set of IT control criteria that are relevant to be tested in IT audits for South African HEIs. The research method used was the Delphi technique. Data was collected, analysed, and used as feedback on which to progress to the next round of data collection. Two lists were obtained: a list of the top IT controls relevant to be tested at any organisation, and a list of the top IT controls relevant to be tested at a South African HEI. Comparison of the two lists shows that although there are some differences in the ranking of criteria used to audit <b>corporate</b> <b>organisations</b> as opposed to HEIs, the final two lists of criteria do not differ significantly. Therefore, it was shown that the same broad IT controls are required to be tested in an IT audit for a South African HEI. However, this research suggests that the risk weighting put on particular IT controls should possibly differ for HEIs, as HEIs face differing IT risks. If further studies can be established which cater for more specific controls, then the combined effect of this study and future ones will be a valuable contribution to knowledge for IT audits in a South African higher education context.

50|$|Frugality {{has been}} adopted as a {{strategic}} imperative by large enterprises {{as a means of}} cost reduction through engenderment of a philosophy of careful spending amongst the workforce. Cost reduction is often perceived negatively, be it within a <b>corporate</b> <b>organisation</b> or in society, so inviting each employee to embrace frugality transfers the burden of cost reduction from management to the employee. In doing so, corporations introduce a moral obligation to cost cutting, proposing the notion that careful management of costs is in the company, shareholder and employee's best interests.|$|E

5000|$|Promotional {{merchandise}} {{is rarely}} bought directly by corporate companies {{from the actual}} manufacturers of the promotional products. A manufacturer's expertise lies in the physical production of the products, but getting a product in front of potential customers is a completely different skill set and a complex process. Within the UK & Ireland promotional merchandise industry a comprehensive network of promotional merchandise distributor companies exist. A promotional merchandise distributor {{is defined as a}} company who [...] "has a dedicated focus to the sale of promotional merchandise to end users". (An 'end user' is a corporate company or organisation that purchases promotional merchandise for their own use.) These distributor companies have the expertise to not only take the product to market, but are also to provide the expert support required. The unique aspect of promotional merchandise is that on most occasions the product is printed with the logo, or brand, of a <b>corporate</b> <b>organisation.</b> The actual manufacturers rarely have the set up to actually print the item. Promotional merchandise distributor companies are expert in artwork and printing processes. In addition to this the promotional merchandise distributors also provide full support in processing orders, artwork, proofing, progress chasing & delivery of promotional products from multiple manufacturing sources.|$|E
