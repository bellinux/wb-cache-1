5|$|The long barrow gained {{its name}} from the <b>Chestnuts,</b> an area of {{woodland}} that crowns the hill on the slopes of which the barrow is located. Prior to the adoption of this name, the site was known locally as Stony or Long Warren.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recessive}} nature the <b>chestnut</b> or [...] "red" [...] coat in horses {{occurs because}} a single {{copy of the}} E allele is dominant over the e allele. Therefore, for example, bay and black horses may be heterozygous for e and if so, could produce a <b>chestnut</b> foal when bred to another horse {{with at least one}} copy of [...] "e". However, all <b>chestnut</b> horses are homozygous for the [...] "e" [...] allele and thus breeding a <b>chestnut</b> to another <b>chestnut</b> will always produce a <b>chestnut</b> foal. Thus, unlike many coat colors, <b>chestnut</b> can be true-breeding; if any color other than <b>chestnut</b> occurs, then one of the parents was not <b>chestnut.</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>Chestnuts</b> Long Barrow, {{also known}} as Stony or Long Warren, is a {{chambered}} long barrow located near {{to the village of}} Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed circa 4000 BCE, during the Early Neolithic period of British prehistory, today it survives only in a ruined state.|$|E
5|$|A typical French Christmas dish is {{turkey with}} <b>chestnuts.</b> Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and foie gras. The Yule log {{is a very}} French {{tradition}} during Christmas. Chocolate and cakes also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France. This cuisine is normally accompanied by Champagne. Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal {{in reference to the}} twelve apostles and Christ.|$|E
5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined dilapidation, with a small road being built through the centre of the {{monument}} by the 19th century at the latest. Local folklore grew up around the site, associating it with the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the early 18th century, and was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. Both it and the nearby <b>Chestnuts</b> Long Barrow are open for public viewing by appointment with the landowner.|$|E

5|$|The gorge {{has over}} 225species of wildflowers, plants and trees, with {{scattered}} stands of old growth forest {{on some of}} its steepest walls. The rest of the gorge is covered with thriving second growth forest that can be over one hundred years old. Since clearcutting, nearly 90percent of the forest land has burnt at least once. Typical south-facing slopes here have mountain laurel below oak and hickory trees, while north-facing slopes tend to have ferns below hemlocks and hardwoods. Large <b>chestnuts</b> and black cherry can also be found.|$|E
5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; {{those on the}} {{northern}} side are mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. It is probable {{that there was an}} ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological Folkestone beds, as is evident at <b>Chestnuts</b> Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, it may have been quarried.|$|E
5|$|The {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} fields around the lake are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which {{date back to the}} most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Mature oak (Quercus) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and <b>chestnuts</b> (Castanea sativa). Many elm (Ulmus) trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists have {{established}} that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Addington Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced {{in the vicinity of}} the River Medway, now known as the Medway Megaliths. Of these, it lies near to both <b>Chestnuts</b> Long Barrow and Coldrum Long Barrow on the western side of the river. Three further surviving long barrows, Kit's Coty House, the Little Kit's Coty House, and the Coffin Stone, are located on the Medway's eastern side.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Charles Horton Peck had {{reported}} A.phalloides in North America. In 1918, samples from the eastern United States were identified as being a distinct though similar species, A. brunnescens, by G. F. Atkinson of Cornell University. By the 1970s, it had become clear that A.phalloides does occur in the United States, apparently having been introduced from Europe alongside <b>chestnuts,</b> with populations on the West and East Coasts. Although a 2006 historical review concluded the East Coast populations were introduced, the origins of the West Coast populations remained unclear, due to scant historical records. A 2009 genetic study provided strong evidence for the introduced status of the fungus on the west coast of North America.|$|E

50|$|The name <b>chestnut</b> {{derives from}} {{the color of the}} nut of the <b>chestnut</b> tree.The first {{recorded}} use of <b>chestnut</b> as a color term in English was in 1555. The color maroon is also named after the <b>chestnut</b> (via French marron).|$|R
50|$|Hypovirus CHV1 is {{the only}} hypovirus found in Europe up to 2000. It is known for {{reducing}} the virulence of the fungus that causes <b>chestnut</b> blight (i.e. hypovirulence). Cryphonectria parasitica, the ascomycete fungus, originated in Asia and causes the disease <b>chestnut</b> blight in several <b>chestnut</b> species (Castanea sp.). Although symptoms are mild in Asian <b>chestnut</b> species that have co-evolved with the fungus, they are very severe in the North American <b>chestnut</b> species C. dentata {{and also in the}} European sweet <b>chestnut,</b> C. sativa. Hypovirus has been used for protection against <b>chestnut</b> blight in Europe since the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} staple crops {{consumed}} during Han were wheat, barley, foxtail millet, proso millet, rice, and beans. Commonly eaten {{fruits and vegetables}} included <b>chestnuts,</b> pears, plums, peaches, melons, apricots, strawberries, red bayberries, jujubes, calabash, bamboo shoots, mustard plant and taro. Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, cows, sheep, pigs, camels and dogs (various types were bred specifically for food, while most were used as pets). Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes. Commonly hunted game, such as owl, pheasant, magpie, sika deer, and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed. Seasonings included sugar, honey, salt and soy sauce. Beer and wine were regularly consumed.|$|E
5|$|The {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} fields of the valley are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which {{date back to the}} most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Hedgerows support the nationally rare bithynian vetch (Vicia bithynica). Mature oak (Quercus) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and <b>chestnuts</b> (Castanea sativa).

5|$|They can {{be divided}} into two {{separate}} clusters: one {{to the west of the}} River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between 8 and 10km. The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow, Addington Long Barrow, and the <b>Chestnuts</b> Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Kit's Coty House, Little Kit's Coty House, the Coffin Stone, and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.|$|E
