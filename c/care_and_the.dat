5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge College {{was built}} as Scotland's first {{college in the}} late 19th century. As Coatbridge has {{moved away from the}} {{traditional}} heavy industries the teaching focus has shifted from traditional industry courses towards commerce, <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arts. St Ambrose, St Andrew's and Coatbridge High are the best-known secondary schools serving Coatbridge. The first two are Roman Catholic. St Ambrose was the subject of an HMI follow-up assessment visit in January 2009. Sports journalist and broadcaster Bob Crampsey was formerly headmaster of St Ambrose. Singer and television presenter Michelle McManus is a former pupil of the school. Prominent football referee Willie Collum taught religious education at St Ambrose in the early 2000s.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{situation}} {{improved in}} May 1119 when he enticed Fulk to switch sides by finally agreeing to marry William Adelin to Fulk's daughter, Matilda, and paying Fulk {{a large sum}} of money. Fulk left for the Levant, leaving the County of Maine in Henry's <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> King was free to focus on crushing his remaining enemies. During the summer Henry advanced into the Norman Vexin, where he encountered Louis's army, resulting in the Battle of Brémule. Henry appears to have deployed scouts and then organised his troops into several carefully formed lines of dismounted knights. Unlike Henry's forces, the French knights remained mounted; they hastily charged the Anglo-Norman positions, breaking through the first rank of the defences but then becoming entangled in Henry's second line of knights. Surrounded, the French army began to collapse. In the melee, Henry {{was hit by a}} sword blow, but his armour protected him. Louis and William Clito escaped from the battle, leaving Henry to return to Rouen in triumph.|$|E
