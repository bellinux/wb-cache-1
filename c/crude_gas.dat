The room was empty, of course; but, as he stepped in, it became filled all at once with a stir of many people; because the strips of glass on the doors of wardrobes and his wife's large pier-glass reflected him from head to foot, and multiplied his image into a crowd of gentlemanly and slavish imitators, who were dressed exactly like himself; had the same restrained and rare gestures; who moved when he moved, stood still with him in an obsequious immobility, and had just such appearances of life and feeling as he thought it dignified and safe for any man to manifest. And like real people who are slaves of common thoughts, that are not even their own, they affected a shadowy independence by the superficial variety of their movements. They moved together with him; but they either advanced to meet him, or walked away from him; they appeared, disappeared; they seemed to dodge behind walnut furniture, to be seen again, far within the polished panes, stepping about distinct and unreal in the convincing illusion of a room. And like the men he respected they could be trusted to do nothing individual, original, or startling--nothing unforeseen and nothing improper.|$|E

A second pathway uses plant mate-rial such as agricultural residues in a fer-mentation process leading to biogas from which the desired fuels can be isolated.

40|$|Petrochemical {{products}} have played an inarguably {{key role in}} the activity of mankind {{since the turn of the}} last century. The conversions of fossil fuels such as <b>crude</b> <b>gas</b> and oil into olefins and aromatics are very important catalytic reactions, producing platform chemicals used in the syntheses of numerous commodity chemicals and polymer materials. Zeolites are one of the most commonly used catalysts for these conversions. The recent development in the catalytic conversions of biomass to petrochemical products and environmental applications over zeolites is of great significance. Due to the inherent acidity in zeolites that is caused by the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, zeolites catalyse many hydrocarbon reactions, such as isomerisation, oligomerisation, alkylation and cracking. In addition, the combination of the intrinsic shape and size selectivity of internal channels and pore mouths along with mass transport effects makes zeolites a great candidate in selective molecular sorption and for catalysis reactions. Despite the extensive applications of zeolites, the catalysis chemistry in zeolites is in fact not well understood from the structural perspective. This is largely due to the fact that most spectroscopic and thermal methods provide limited structural information about the local atomic information of the molecular adsorbates with respect to the acid sites. Despite many theoretical calculations of zeolites have studied the acid properties and the mechanistic study of catalysis reactions, there are however various application limitations. In fact, the recent progressive advancement in the diffraction techniques has allowed the structural study of organic molecules in different microporous materials. In this thesis, using high resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) as the primary characterisation technique, we propose a novel methodology in understanding the molecular chemistry in zeolites (with H-ZSM- 5 as an illustration) from the structural perspective. The following topics are discussed in a systematic manner: (i) 	the acid-base interactions with functional molecules, (ii) 	the locations of the substituted Al sites (the Brønsted acid sites), (iii) the structural chemistry of various organic adsorbates in the framework, (iv) 	the potential storage capability for functional gases, (v) 	the mechanistic study of a novel biomass reforming reaction, and (vi) 	the mechanistic study of the initial step of the industrially important methanol-to-hydrocarbons process. It is also envisaged that this methodology can be broadly applied to the study of other zeolites or crystalline microporous materials. </p...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} {{to comply with}} the standards given by the ordinance on biological waste treatment facilities (30. BImSchV). A main focus thereby was done on the environmental impact of the waste gas cleaning system called non catalytic (regenerative) thermal oxidation (RTO). As a result of the new environmental standards the conception of mechanical biological (pre-) treatment plants (MBT/P) had to change. In particular the low standards for organic carbons in the exhaust gas of MBT necessitate a thermal treatment of this gas at least for heavily loaded gas streams. As the knowledge about emissions of RTO plant used for the treatment of MBT exhaust gas was very limited, extensive measurements were made within this research work. Beside the emission standards for several pollutants the ordinance on biological waste treatment facilities gives weight specific standards (loads) for organic carbons and nitrous oxide. These loads involve the waste input quantities and the exhaust air volumes of MBT plants into the emission calculation. An emission source analysis with a special focus on the organic carbon emissions from plant components of a modern MBT plants was made at the MBT in Borken (North Rhine-Westphalia). The found emission progression in both the discharge area and the area of mechanical waste treatment gave reason to the conclusion that a cleaning of gas from these areas via biofilters as publicised by several companies will not work properly. So these gas amounts have to be used in subsequent areas of MBT such as the biological waste treatment. In the area of biological waste treatment an additional and extensive reduction of the total amount of exhaust gas from MBT plants can be achieved by a more effective usage of oxygen in the air and by a more effective energy removal. To what extent both factors can be varied without interfering the rotting process was examined by laboratory and pilot plant studies. The results are pointing to the potential of exhaust gas reduction at MBT plants considering previous control factors and help keeping the standards. The multiple-shift usage of exhaust gas from several plant components of MBT and the thereby caused increase of organic carbon concentrations affects an economical and associated with this an additional ecological benefit. The RTO technology needs energy to maintain the oxidation process. This energy can be supplied by external energy sources or by the energy content of the pollutants in the waste gas. Chapter 5 gives theoretical calculations that show that an autothermic operation could be reached when the organic carbon concentrations exceed 500 to 1. 000 mg/m" 3 depending on the energy content adopted to carbons in the <b>crude</b> <b>gas.</b> Finally, the collected results are brought together against the background of MBT technology and chances as well as risks that arise from the experimental results appreciated.
