50|$|Biological {{activity}} of <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> as excipient {{has been widely}} described in the scientific literature. <b>Cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> acts by creating a positive charge that provides bioadhesive properties of the cationic nanoemulsions on the negatively charged ocular surface. Hence, increasing the penetration of active ingredients formulated in cationic nanoemulsions into ocular tissues. Even more, <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> cationic emulsions seem to improve healing of corneal lesions.|$|E
50|$|Even though <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> is {{belongs to}} the family of {{benzalkonium}} chloride, the ophthalmic use of <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> cationic nanoemulsions {{have been shown to be}} safe.These observations are explained by the fact that <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> present in oil-in-water emulsions is bound to the oil nanodroplets therefore sequestered from the water phase and not available to cause damages to ocular tissues.Pansoral has been on the market since 1981 and Cationorm since 2008, both products being well accepted by patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> {{can be used}} in {{different}} applications depending on its concentration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (CKC) is a {{quaternary}} ammonium compound of the alkyl-benzyldimethylammonium chloride family, the alkyl group having a chain length of C16 (16 carbons). It is used in pharmaceutical products either as an excipient (Cationorm, Retaine MGD) or as an active ingredient (Bonjela, Pansoral). It {{may be found in}} very small amount in the excipient benzalkonium chloride mixture (typically less than 5% of the total mixture). <b>Cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> is purchased as a raw material in dry form as a white powder.|$|E
5000|$|Benzalkonium chloride, {{benzethonium}} chloride, methylbenzethonium chloride, <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimonium, cetrimide, dofanium chloride, tetraethylammonium bromide, and {{domiphen bromide}} - antimicrobial ingredients found in various over-the-counter products ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> {{can also}} be used as a {{pharmaceutical}} excipient due to its amphiphilic property and cationic charge.For example, it has recently been included in a contact lens to bind an anionic active drug to serve as reservoir and extend the release rate of the molecule.Most frequently, it is used as an emulsifier and cationic agent in ophthalmic nanoemulsions in products like Cationorm and Retaine MGD. Due to its high lipophilicity, <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> is strongly associated to oil nanodroplets at the oil/water interface in oil-in-water emulsions, hence providing a positive charge at the surface of the oil nanodroplets. This polarization of the nanodroplets stabilizes the emulsion by creating an electrostatic repulsion between the nanodroplets and is {{the driving force behind the}} biological adhesion of the nanodroplets to negatively charged cell epithelium in vivo. In life science the cationic charge of cetalkonium is used to separate biological extracts according to their charge.|$|E
50|$|This {{formulation}} is {{also sold}} in Australia as Bonjela Teething gel, {{for the treatment}} of teething pain in babies. By contrast, Bonjela Teething Gel in the UK and Ireland, is a different formulation, as salicylate-based products cannot be used in under-16's in the UK. This formulation of Bonjela Teething gel contains the local anesthetic lidocaine and the antiseptic <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bonjela is a {{brand of}} oral {{treatments}} aimed to relieve the pain of mouth ulcers and denture sores. The brand covers a range of products. Bonjela Adult and Cool are oral gels containing keratolytic and mildly antiseptic salicylic acid {{in the form of}} its salt choline salicylate and the antiseptic <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> as active ingredients. Both products are suitable only for people aged 16 or over because of a possible association between salicylates and Reye's syndrome.|$|E
50|$|It {{can be used}} as {{an active}} {{ingredient}} to relieve the pain of mouth ulcers and denture sores in buccal solutions or gels such as Pansoral or in Bonjela. The usual concentration in these products is 0.01% (w/w).However, it isn't known as a potent bactericidal compound, mainly because of its low solubility in water. For example, US and European pharmacopeias enforce suppliers of benzalkonium chloride to limit the amount of <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> in the mixture to less than 5% w/w.|$|E
50|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} compounds {{have also}} been shown to have antimicrobial activity. Certain quaternary ammonium compounds, especially those containing long alkyl chains, are used as antimicrobials and disinfectants. Examples are benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, methylbenzethonium chloride, <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimonium, cetrimide, dofanium chloride, tetraethylammonium bromide, didecyldimethylammonium chloride and domiphen bromide. Also good against fungi, amoebas, and enveloped viruses, quaternary ammonium compounds are believed to act by disrupting the cell membrane. Quaternary ammonium compounds are lethal {{to a wide variety of}} organisms except endospores, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-enveloped viruses.|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{control of}} virulent {{bacteria}} strains {{is a challenge}} for today’s medicine. An example of this, is one widely used drug employed in treating less serious external oral and ocular bacterial infections. This is a gel containing both <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> and choline salicylate. However, whether {{in the era of}} expanding bacterial resistance this gel is still effective, is not clear. Hence, in our work, its antibacterial effect was studied against 13 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 strains of Staphylococcus spp. and 6 strains of Streptococcus spp. drawn from the collection of the Department of Microbiology, Virology and Immunology, Kazakh National Medical University, as well as against 30 strains of Staphylococcus spp. recently isolated from Kazakh medical students. This work demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was insensitive to this preparation in all samples, while the sensitivity of Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. was almost halved, compared to untreated samples. An interesting discovery was the greater resistance of strains obtained from student volunteers than from the collection. However, despite the evident resistance of some strains to the combined <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> and choline salicylate gel, we put forward that it can still be used in less serious external bacterial infections...|$|E
40|$|Topical treatment, with drug-containing ointments, of {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major in BALB/c mice was studied. Twenty chemotherapeutic agents having potential or established antileishmanial activity were formulated in different ointment and cream bases. Only 15 % paromomycin sulfate with 12 % methylbenzethonium chloride, 12 % benzethonium chloride, 12 % <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> or 12 % dimethyl sulfoxide, all incorporated in white soft paraffin (United Kingdom patent application no. 2117237 A), were completely effective. Topical treatment twice daily for 6 {{or more days}} caused total elimination of the parasites and healing of the lesion in all treated mice. All the other antileishmanial compounds, including sodium stibogluconate, pentamidine, amphotericin B, emetine hydrochloride, metronidazole, co-trimoxazole, allopurinol, and rifampin, either showed a slight effect on the parasites or were highly toxic to the animal host at the concentrations tested...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK 5) is a {{potential}} target for prostate cancer treatment, the enzyme being essen-tial for prostate tumor growth and formation of metastases. In the present study, we identified agents that target prostate cancer cells based on CDK 5 expression. CDK 5 activity was suppressed by transfection of PC 3 prostate cancer cells with a dominant-negative construct (PC 3 CDK 5 dn). PC 3 CDK 5 dn and PC 3 control cells were screened for compounds that selec-tively target cells based on CDK 5 expression, utilizing the Johns Hopkins Drug Library. MTS proliferation, clonogenic and 3 D growth assays were performed to validate the selected hits. Screening of 3, 360 compounds identified rutilantin, ethacridine lactate and <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> as compounds that selectively target PC 3 control cells and a tilorone analog as a selective inhibitor of PC 3 CDK 5 dn cells. A PubMed literature study indicated that tilorone may have clinical use in patients. Validation experiments confirmed that tilorone treatment resulted in decreased PC 3 cell growth and invasion; PC 3 cells with inactive CDK 5 were inhibited more effectively. Future {{studies are needed to}} unravel the mechanism of action of tilorone in CDK 5 deficient prostate cancer cells and to test combination therapies with tilorone and a CDK 5 inhibitor for its potential use in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} toxicological profiles of two quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC), benzalkonium chloride (BAK), and <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (CKC), in standard solution or cationic emulsion formulations in rabbit eyes using newly developed in vivo and ex vivo experimental approaches. Methods: Seventy eyes of 35 adult male New Zealand albino rabbits were used in this study. They were randomly divided into five groups: 50 µl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), PBS containing 0. 02 % BAK or 0. 002 % CKC (BAK Sol and CKC Sol, respectively), and emulsion containing 0. 02 % BAK or 0. 002 % CKC (BAK Em and CKC Em, respectively) were applied to rabbit eyes 15 times at 5 -min intervals. The ocular surface changes induced by these eye drops were investigated using slit-lamp examination, flow cytometry (FCM), impression cytology (IC) on conjunctiva, and corneal in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). Standard immunohistology in cryosections was also examined for cluster of differentiation (CD) 45 + infiltrating and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-nick end labeling (TUNEL) + apoptotic cells. Results: Clinical observations and IVCM showed that the highest toxicity was induced by BAK Sol, characterized by damaged corneal epithelium and {{a high level of}} inflammatory infiltration. BAK Em and CKC Sol presented moderate effects, and CKC Em showed the lowest toxicity with results similar to those of PBS. Conjunctival imprints analyzed by FCM showed a higher expression of RLA-DR and TNFR 1 markers in BAK Sol-instilled eyes than in all other groups...|$|E
40|$|Biofilms are slimy {{aggregates}} of microbes {{that are}} likely responsible for many chronic infections {{as well as for}} contamination of clinical and industrial environments. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent hospital pathogen that is well known for its ability to form biofilms that are recalcitrant to many different antimicrobial treatments. We have devised a high-throughput method for testing combinations of antimicrobials for synergistic activity against biofilms, including those formed by P. aeruginosa. This approach was used to look for changes in biofilm susceptibility to various biocides when these agents were combined with metal ions. This process identified that Cu 2 + works synergistically with quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs; specifically benzalkonium chloride, <b>cetalkonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> cetylpyridinium chloride, myristalkonium chloride, and Polycide) to kill P. aeruginosa biofilms. In some cases, adding Cu 2 + to QACs resulted in a 128 -fold decrease in the biofilm minimum bactericidal concentration compared to that for single-agent treatments. In combination, these agents retained broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that also eradicated biofilms of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Cholerasuis, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. To investigate the mechanism of action, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to show that Cu 2 + and QACs do not interact in aqueous solutions, suggesting that each agent exerts microbiological toxicity through independent biochemical routes. Additionally, Cu 2 + and QACs, both alone and in combination, reduced the activity of nitrate reductases, which are enzymes that are important for normal biofilm growth. Collectively, {{the results of this study}} indicate that Cu 2 + and QACs are effective combinations of antimicrobials that may be used to kill bacterial biofilms...|$|E
