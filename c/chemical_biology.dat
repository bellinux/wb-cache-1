25|$|Having a paper (article or letter) {{published}} in Nature or any Nature publication such as Nature chemistry or Nature <b>chemical</b> <b>biology</b> is very prestigious, and the papers are often highly cited, {{which can lead}} to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these positive feedback effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like Nature and its closest competitor, Science, can be very fierce. Natures impact factor, a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by Thomson ISI), among the highest of any science journal.|$|E

50|$|Schreiber’s {{laboratory}} {{has served}} as a focal point for the field of <b>chemical</b> <b>biology,</b> first by the ad hoc use of small molecules to study three specific areas of biology, and then through the more general application of small molecules in biomedical research.

Academic screening centers have been created that emulate the Harvard Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology and the Broad Institute; in the U.S., there has been a nationwide effort to expand this capability via the government-sponsored NIH Road Map. Chemistry departments have changed their names to include the term <b>chemical</b> <b>biology</b> and new journals have been introduced (Cell <b>Chemical</b> <b>Biology,</b> ChemBioChem, Nature <b>Chemical</b> <b>Biology,</b> ACS <b>Chemical</b> <b>Biology)</b> to cover the field.
