40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} impact of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> on food production in a typical low-income developing country. Furthermore, it provides an estimation of the determinants of <b>adaptation</b> to <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and the implications of these strategies on farm productivity. The analysis relies on primary data from 1, 000 farms producing cereal crops in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia. Based on monthly collected meteorological station data, the thin plate spline method of spatial interpolation was used to interpolate the specific rainfall and temperature values of each household. The rainfall data were disaggregated at the seasonal level. We found that <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> and <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> <b>adaptations</b> have significant impact on farm productivity. Extension services (both formal and farmer to farmer), as well as access to credit and information on future <b>climate</b> <b>changes,</b> affect <b>adaptation</b> positively and significantly. Farm households with larger access to social capital are more likely to adopt yield-related adaptation strategies.
