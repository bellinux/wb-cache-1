At this time the line from Jamaica to East New York had many more stations along Atlantic Avenue spaced at closer intervals, much like an elevated/subway rapid transit line. The four tracks between Jamaica and Woodhaven Junction lent itself to this service with rapid transit trains using the outer two tracks while commuter trains used the inner two tracks.|$|R

40|$|Call Level Interfaces (CLI) are {{difficult}} to use mainly in intensive database applications with many Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) expressions. As low level API, they are not suited to promote the development process of business tiers as reusable components, leading to the need of writing additional source code whenever a new CRUD expression is needed. To tackle this gap, this paper proposes an architecture for building reusable business tier components herein referred to as Reusable Business Tier Architecture (RBTA). It relies on a single customizable wide <b>typed</b> <b>service</b> to address a business area, such as accounting. The <b>typed</b> <b>service</b> is able to manage all the required CRUD expressions for that business are, which are deployed at runtime {{in accordance with the}} user’s needs. The only constraint is that the required service to manage each CRUD expression must be a sub-set of the implemented wide <b>typed</b> <b>service.</b> A proof of concept based on Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is also presented...|$|R
30|$|<b>Service</b> <b>type</b> mapping and {{the second}} {{scheduling}} Small amount of data burst flows were usually adopted for transmitting some traffic safety information in the past transportation system, but nowadays are unable {{to meet the needs}} of ITS information growth. For the future ITS, massive information flows in different forms of <b>service</b> <b>type,</b> such as audio, video, as well as data burst will be exchanged not only for enriching passengers’ driving experience, but also for providing safe high-effect transportation guarantee in modern traffic communication system. Therefore, in the proposed system, after the first scheduling, packets with different traffic safety importance weights will be further classified based on their <b>service</b> <b>type</b> characteristics and delivered into corresponding buffer queues in a sequence by <b>service</b> <b>type</b> mapper. There are two kinds of buffer queues defined in our paper, which are real-time <b>service</b> <b>type</b> and non-real-time <b>service</b> <b>type,</b> respectively. Every <b>service</b> <b>type</b> buffer’s HOL packet will be once again associated with corresponding <b>service</b> <b>type</b> importance weight, which adaptively decided by: HOL packet’s <b>service</b> <b>type</b> QoS requirements, such as transmission delay limitation threshold, target packet error rate, etc.; the instant practical QoS performance of information flow which that HOL packet belongs to, such as HOL packet’s instant waiting time in its <b>service</b> <b>type</b> buffer, HOL packet instant data transmission rate, etc. At every scheduling time, the second level scheduler will adaptively decide the scheduling order of every <b>service</b> <b>type</b> buffer queue’s HOL packet: HOL packets with lager importance weights related to traffic safety and <b>service</b> <b>type</b> are always delivered to the target VS terminals prior to that with smaller importance weights.|$|R
