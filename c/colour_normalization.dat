40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for the <b>colour</b> <b>normalization</b> of Giemsa-stained {{peripheral blood cell}} images. The normalization is applied separately to the foreground and background regions. A rough estimation of the foreground-background regions is done by mathematical morphology and followed by a refined segmentation using histograms of these regions. Then an illumination independent response is calculated using the background region. The normalization is completed by transforming the foreground region according to a reference set. The proposed method has been tested on many images and has been found successful...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{negative}} result. It {{is well known}} that the colours in a scene do not depend only on the surface properties of the objects present but also on the illumination conditions and the capturing device's characteristics. Indeed, this dependence is so strong that computer vision techniques based on colour, such as object recognition [18] fail unless this relationship is accounted for. Much effort has been put into finding <b>colour</b> <b>normalization</b> techniques and colour invariants (features that do not change with changing illuminant), and many different approaches {{have been reported in the}} literature. All of these techniques, however, rely on the linearity property of the imaging process and hence on calibrated images. In this paper we set out to evaluate current state- of-the-art normalization and invariant methods on an uncalibrated image database [3]. The results of this experiment show that none of the existing techniques performs well enough to support colour based object recognition, and so suggest the need for new, improved algorithms...|$|E
