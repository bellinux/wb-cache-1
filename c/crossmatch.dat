40|$|The {{process of}} testing {{a sample of}} a patient's blood against units of blood from {{inventory}} to ensure compatibility is called <b>crossmatching.</b> When a physician orders blood, it is <b>crossmatched</b> and then held for a patient. As a precautionary measure, physicians tend to order blood {{in excess of the}} amount that is transfused (used by the patient). Consequently, a large proportion of blood held for a patient (often higher than 50 percent) is eventually not transfused. This leads to increased outdates. The effects of <b>crossmatching</b> on outdates are widely acknowledged, but have seldom been included in blood inventory control models. In this paper, we develop a model for determining outdates and shortages for <b>crossmatched</b> blood using generally accepted parameters, such as proportion of <b>crossmatched</b> blood that is actually transfused, and the number of days after which <b>crossmatched</b> blood is released if not transfused.

40|$|Flow cytometric {{techniques}} are increasingly used in pretransplant <b>crossmatching,</b> although there remains debate regarding the clinical significance and predictive value of donor-specific antibodies detected by flow cytometry.

We selected cut-off values for pretransplant flow cytometric <b>crossmatching</b> (FCXM) based on the correlation of retrospective results with the occurrence of antibody-mediated rejection.

40|$|The aim of {{this change}} {{management}} project was {{the implementation of a}} Maximum Surgical Blood Ordering Schedule (MSBOS). Institutional MSBOS’s utilised in many hospitals provide a template recommendation for <b>crossmatching</b> of red blood cells for a broad range of surgical procedures; however, for many lower risk surgical procedures these requirements are almost negligible. This project utilised the HSE Change model to implement a new guideline for elective procedures. Recommendations were taken from literature and stated for any elective procedure having greater than 19 cases (N ≥ 19) the following rules would apply: transfusion rate less than 5 % requires no type and screen specimen processed, transfusion rate between 5 %- 30 % a specimen is processed and no red blood cells <b>crossmatched,</b> and for procedures with a transfusion rate above 30 % a specimen is required and red blood cells <b>crossmatched.</b> Evaluation results were successful with a reduction seen in the number of type and screen specimens proceed by the laboratory and a {{reduction in the number of}} red blood cells <b>crossmatched.</b> The elimination of routine type and screen specimens for these procedures and the resultant change to the hospital’s MSBOS could potentially result in an estimated saving of € 47, 000 per year. In conclusion, in the absence of a preoperative indication, routine type and screen specimens should be eliminated for select lower risk surgical procedures along with a selective approach for ordering red blood cells in higher risk procedures.

The presence of DSA and its level at the time of transplantation were retrospectively tested using Luminex single antigen assays. Results: DSA was present in 16 (57. 1 %) of 28 patients.

40|$|Background: Reservation {{of blood}} leads to blood wastage if {{the blood is}} not transfused. Therefore, in some centers only blood type and screen are evaluated. In this study, the {{efficacy}} of a blood crossmatch-to-transfusion ratio was measured and then compared with the standard levels. Methods: This prospective study was conducted during one year in a university hospital. During this period, 398 patients for whom blood had been requested were studied. In these patients, at the first surgical type, the laboratory tests (hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, and prothrombin time) {{and the number of}} preoperative <b>crossmatched</b> and intraoperative transfused blood units were recorded. Then the crossmatch-to-transfusion ratio, transfusion probability, transfusion index, and correlation between related factors, and the transfusion ratio were evaluated. Results: In this cross-sectional study, blood was requested for 398 patients. According to available blood unit deficiency, from 961 blood unit requisitions, only 456 units were <b>crossmatched</b> and 123 units were transfused. The crossmatch-to-transfusion ratio, transfusion probability, and transfusion index were 3. 71 (7. 81 if all requisitions were <b>crossmatched),</b> 16. 83 %, and 0. 31, respectively. The most unfavorable indexes were observed in patients who had ear, nose, and throat surgeries (0 transfused from 19 <b>crossmatched</b> blood units) and obstetric and gynecologic surgery (crossmatch-to-transfusion ratio was 18. 6). The best indexes were related to thoracic surgery and neurosurgery (crossmatch-to-transfusion ratio was 1. 53 and 1. 54, respectively). There were no significant correlations between hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and prothrombin time with the number of transfused blood units (P = 0. 2, 0. 14, 0. 26, and 0. 06, respectively). Conclusion: The data for the crossmatch-to-transfusion ratio, transfusion probability, and transfusion index were suboptimal at this center, especially for ear, nose, and throat and obstetric and gynecologic surgeries.

Materials and Methods: This prospective longitudinal study was conducted on over 5000 red cell units transfused to AS-negative patients admitted to the hospital. Pretransfusion testing comprised blood grouping and AS followed by IS <b>crossmatch,</b> {{at the time of}} issue of red cell unit. The patients were transfused IS compatible red cell units.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{determined}} {{the impact of}} a positive cytotoxic <b>crossmatch</b> on the outcome of liver transplantation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Liver allografts rarely undergo hyperacute rejection, but transplants performed across a positive cytotoxic <b>crossmatch</b> tend to follow a different clinical course, with higher intraoperative blood use, postoperative graft dysfunction, and, in some cases, graft loss. How this affects overall graft survival has not been determined. METHODS: The authors provide a retrospective analysis of 1520 liver transplants performed between November 1989 and December 1993, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. All cases had a cytotoxic <b>crossmatch</b> using serum pretreated with dithiothreitol. RESULTS: There were 1390 negative <b>crossmatch</b> and 130 positive <b>crossmatch</b> cases. There was no difference in overall graft survival, although early survival rates were lower in the positive <b>crossmatch</b> group, with the maximum difference at 6 months: 0. 76 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 74 - 0. 78) for a negative <b>crossmatch</b> versus 0. 68 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 61 - 0. 77) for a positive <b>crossmatch.</b> These differences become negligible by the 2 -year mark. Using stepwise logistic regression, the authors identified seven variables independently associated with outcome: 1) donor age, 2) donor gender, 3) prior liver transplant, 4) medical urgency status, 5) ischemia time, 6) indication for transplantation, and 7) primary immunosuppressant. CONCLUSIONS: The cytotoxic <b>crossmatch</b> is not statistically associated with overall graft survival after liver transplantation.
