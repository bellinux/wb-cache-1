5000|$|The Boston <b>Cyberarts</b> Gallery (formerly Axiom Center for New and Experimental Media) is one {{of several}} venues showing {{cutting-edge}} [...] "high tech" [...] and experimental artworks.

The periodic Festival has been replaced by year-round programs, as described on their website.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "cyberarts" [...] is {{vague and}} {{relatively}} new; nevertheless {{much of the}} work described by this term is rarely described any other way. For instance, a common type of <b>cyberart</b> which is produced programmatically by applying a set of design rules to a natural or preexisting process.

50|$|In {{contrast}} {{to some of}} the hippies of the 1960s who were antiscience and antitechnology, the cyberpunks of the 1980s and 1990s ecstatically embraced technology and the hacker ethic. They believed that high technology (and smart drugs) could help human beings overcome limits, that it could liberate them from authority and even enable them to transcend space, time, and body. They often expressed their ethos and aesthetics through <b>cyberart</b> and reality hacking.|$|E

The work expanded the last 12 minute of Kurosawa’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Throne of Blood (1957), into a sonic performance saga.In 2014, he collaborated with computer science researcher Baptiste Caramiaux to create a new work, Septic, commissioned by transmediale festival.In 2015, the spatial sound collective 4DSOUND commissioned him a new monumental work, 0-Infinity, which premiered at TodaysArt Festival in The Hague within the program Circadian.In 2016, he collaborated with experimental filmmaker Vincent Moon in a series of live shows during the Michelberger Music event in Berlin.|$|E

40|$|The insistent interrogations by digital {{artists of}} the fluid spaces that have been created by new and {{sophisticated}} technologies do not only concern novel kinds of spatial awareness. They even more specifically attempt to map the new forms of human positions and positioning produced by our active and continuous interchanges in real-time, which implies nothing less than new modes of subjectivity. Although maps have to some extent always fulfilled these functions, what is different today are the technologies at our disposal which not only generate new dynamic spaces but also demand {{the development of new}} mapping strategies allowing for both improvisational and subjective positioning in constant negotiations for space. I would go even further and suggest that the works by these artists imply that the subject-object framework be relinquished for that of an implicated agent and an expansive field in which the agency of any identifiable presence is intertwined with other agencies. This pragmatic approach implicates a dialogic and communicative self immersed in incessant recontextualization and, therefore, involves mappings of the intermeshing between agents responding to their environments in ceaseless participation. Pragmatic-semiotic research and <b>cyberart</b> converge here as such an approach would seem to carry the potential not only for theorizing different fields of research but also for a fruitful dialogue among cultural theory, technicity, and digital art. This will be discussed by examining the works by digital artists Stelarc, Rejane Cantoni and Daniela Kutschat...|$|E
40|$|That {{maps are}} among our most {{valuable}} heuristic instruments has {{become even more}} pronounced in our contemporary technosocial environment which demands continuous cognitive activity: the sophisticated new technologies pervading everyday life have not only {{become an integral part}} of it but also effectively produce new forms of human positions and positioning involving us in active and continuous interchanges in realtime. This implies that they generate nothing less than new modes of subjectivity. Although maps have to some extent always fulfilled these functions, what is different today are the technologies at our disposal, which not only generate new dynamic spaces but which also enable and challenge us to come up with new strategies of mapping allowing for both improvisational and subjective positioning in constant negotiations for space. This development has been increasingly interrogated by digital artists. Seeing the need to create new mapping strategies, these artists have their works even go so far as to imply that the subject-object framework be relinquished for that of an implicated agent and an expansive field in which the agency of any presence is intertwined with other agencies. Such an approach would involve mappings of the intermeshing between agents responding to their environment in ceaseless participation. What would these maps look like? Are we, as some suggest, at the point of entering a new shift of mapping paradigm, similar to the one that occurred in early modernity when the “scientific” maps produced by cartographic projection replaced the illustrated and highly narrative medieval maps? Cartographic research and <b>cyberart</b> join here as such an approach would seem to carry the potential not only for theorizing forms of mapping our rapidly changing technosocial space but also for a fruitful dialogue among art, technology and science. This will be discussed by examining the works by digital artists Stelarc, Char Davis, Rejane Cantoni and Daniela Kutschat...|$|E

50|$|The term <b>cyberarts</b> is a {{portmanteau}} {{combining the}} root word of cybernetics, {{dealing with the}} study of control systems in machines and human nervous systems, and the word for the broad creative fields dealing {{with the creation of}} objects of form, beauty, and expression. Inspiration for the <b>CyberArts</b> International conferences revolved around the artistic implications of the rapidly changing technologies related to computers, input devices, digital storage, networking, and reproduction — parallel technologies that were revolutionizing the traditional visual and sonic arts and making possible new forms of artistic expression.|$|R
