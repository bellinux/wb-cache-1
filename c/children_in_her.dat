The filmmakers had been considering removing Japeth, but chose not to when he proved popular at these screenings. The children also particularly liked Twitchy, {{which led to the}} expansion of the character's role.|$|E
5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{vulnerable}} {{physical and emotional}} state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled {{his face with a}} handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|The {{music of}} Richard Strauss, {{whom he met}} in 1902 at the Budapest premiere of Also sprach Zarathustra, {{strongly}} influenced his early work.

25|$|The <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> charge were spoilt {{and often}} disobedient. She had great {{difficulty}} controlling them {{and had little}} success in instilling any education. She was not empowered to inflict punishment, and when she complained about their behaviour received no support, but was criticised for not being capable. The Inghams, dissatisfied with their children's progress, dismissed Anne. She returned home at Christmas, 1839, joining Charlotte and Emily, who had left their positions, and Branwell. The episode at Blake Hall was so traumatic that she reproduced it in almost perfect detail in her novel Agnes Grey.|$|E

25|$|Quentin Alice Louise Strachan {{was born}} in 1942 in Brisbane, the second of four daughters.

While living in Belmont she attended the Camp Hill State School, and there first met her future husband, Michael Bryce.|$|E
25|$|Rev. Balmain {{was also}} like his protege Bishop Meade {{active in the}} American Colonization Society.

Balmain's {{last will and testament}} gave his wife Lucy the power to emancipate their slaves (whom Meade remembered them treating as their <b>children)</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life or own last will (unlike Dolley Madison, Lucy Balmain did emancipate all her slaves when she died in 1845).|$|E
