40|$|SummaryVoltage-gated sodium, potassium, {{and calcium}} {{channels}} {{are made of}} a pore domain (PD) controlled by four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). The PD contains the ion permeation pathway and the activation gate located on the intracellular side of the membrane. A large number of small molecules are known to inhibit the PD by acting as open channel blockers. The voltage-gated proton channel Hv 1 is made of two VSDs and lacks the PD. The location of the activation gate in the VSD is unknown and open channel blockers for VSDs have not yet been identified. Here, we describe a class of small molecules which act as open channel blockers on the Hv 1 VSD and find that a highly conserved phenylalanine in the charge transfer center of the VSD {{plays a key role}} in blocker binding. We then use one of the blockers to show that Hv 1 contains two intracellular and allosterically <b>coupled</b> <b>gates...</b>|$|E

Double-gate FinFET technology mitigates this limitation by the excellent control over a thin silicon body by two electrically <b>coupled</b> <b>gates.</b> In this paper a variable threshold voltage keeper circuit technique using independent-gate FinFET technology is proposed for simultaneous power reduction and speed enhancement in domino logic circuits.

[...] University of Washington, 2012 L-type Ca 2 + (Ca V 1. 2) {{channels}} {{shape the}} cardiac action potential waveform and {{are essential for}} excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in the heart. We find that a transient subpopulation of 2 to 6 Ca V 1. 2 channels gate concertedly via a novel <b>coupled</b> <b>gating</b> modality. In {{the presence of the}} scaffolding protein AKAP 150 : PKC&alpha, calmodulin inhibition, and the G 406 R mutation that causes Timothy syndrome (TS), also known as long QT syndrome type 8 (LQT 8), increase the probability of <b>coupled</b> <b>gating.</b> As for the mechanism of <b>coupled</b> <b>gating,</b> we propose that Ca V 1. 2 channels interact with each other via their carboxy tails when calmodulin is dislodged from the IQ domain, and <b>coupled</b> <b>gating</b> requires AKAP 150 to bind to the Ca V 1. 2 carboxy tails via its leucine zipper domain and to act as a scaffold. To study further the role of <b>coupled</b> <b>gating</b> and AKAP 150 in arrhythmogenesis in LQT 8, we created a LQT 8 transgenic mouse expressing cardiac-specific Ca V 1. 2 -LQT 8 -tRFP channels. Importantly, we then crossed these LQT 8 transgenics with AKAP 150 -/- mice, and the LQT 8 / AKAP 150 -/- mice show a rescue of the wild-type (WT) phenotype. Compared to WT and LQT 8 / AKAP 150 -/- ventricular myocytes, LQT 8 ventricular myocytes have delayed inactivation in whole-cell I Ca, and there is increased frequency in <b>coupled</b> <b>gating</b> and open time in cell-attached i Ca. These myocytes also have prolonged action potential duration and arrhythmogenic voltage fluctuations, such as early and delayed afterdepolarizations. With respect to EC coupling, LQT 8 ventricular myocytes have increased [Ca 2 +] transient amplitudes and more frequent arrhythmogenic spontaneous Ca 2 + releases. On the whole animal level, LQT 8 mice have prolonged QTC interval and more frequent incidence of Torsades de Pointes ventricular tachycardia than WT or LQT 8 / AKAP 150 -/-. In conclusion, AKAP 150 mediated <b>coupled</b> <b>gating</b> of Ca V 1. 2 channels plays {{a central role in the}} pathophysiology of LQT 8, causing local perturbation on EC coupling that lead to arrhythmogenesis...|$|R
40|$|During {{skeletal}} muscle stimulation, {{there is a}} summation of local events of Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, known as Ca 2 + sparks. Ca 2 + sparks originate from groups of skeletal ryanodine receptors (RyR 1) that activate and close in synchrony. This synchrony allows for the rapid and massive release of Ca 2 + from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to initiate contraction and, more important, would provide a mechanism to terminate Ca 2 + release under conditions where independent RyR 1 are normally active. RyR 1 mutations can result in abnormal intracellular Ca 2 + signaling {{that is associated with}} numerous {{skeletal muscle}} disorders including malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. Therefore, investigating the mechanisms that control RyR 1 function can help identify how these mutations cause deleterious Ca 2 + handling. Currently, most published research on RyR 1 s gating utilizes single RyR 1 reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers to test isolated RyR 1. However, in vivo, arrays of RyR 1 function in synchrony. Attempts to reconstitute RyR 1 s into planar lipid bilayers result in experiments that contain multiple channels, which under specific conditions may gate in synchrony, also known as <b>coupled</b> <b>gating.</b> <b>Coupled</b> RyR 1 <b>gating</b> was first reported by A. Marks 2 ̆ 7 laboratory and attributed to FK- 506 binding protein 12 (FKBP 12) associating with neighboring RyR 1 s the stabilization of RyR 1 -RyR 1 interactions that promote <b>coupled</b> <b>gating.</b> Previous studies suggested that ATP is required for coupled RyR 1 gating; however, the mechanism by which ATP promotes the coordinated activity of RyR 1 s has not been elucidated and is the focus of this thesis. Therefore, my hypothesis is that the agonist action of ATP and FKBP 12 bound to RyR 1 are required for <b>coupled</b> RyR 1 <b>gating.</b> In addition, new pharmacological tools are required to better understand <b>coupled</b> RyR <b>gating.</b> Thus, an additional goal is to identify pharmacological agents that modulate RyR 1 s in an innovative manner, i. e., help to uncover novel aspects of RyR 1 gating and conduction. This investigation suggests that the adenosine based nucleotides, ATP, ADP and AMP, are agonists of RyR 1 s and promote <b>coupled</b> RyR 1 <b>gating</b> in planar lipid bilayers. However, ADP and AMP were unable to maintain <b>coupled</b> RyR 1 <b>gating</b> with physiological levels of Mg 2 +. This suggests that <b>coupled</b> <b>gating</b> would be impaired when the levels ATP decrease, as in muscle fatigue. When ATP was compared to other nucleotides (GTP, ITP, and TTP), the results suggest that the nucleotide agonist action on RyR 1 s is dependent on the phosphate groups and amino group on the nucleobase. As ATP is the most efficient nucleotide for <b>coupled</b> <b>gating,</b> I also investigated the indirect action of ATP to act as a kinase substrate or alter the cytoskeletal network. The addition of kinases, phosphatases and cytoskeletal modulators did not produce a significant disruption of <b>coupled</b> RyR 1 <b>gating.</b> I also tested the role of addition of exogenous FKBP 12 to RyR 1 s that gated independently or had partial <b>coupling,</b> but <b>coupled</b> <b>gating</b> was never improved. Also, the addition of high doses of rapamycin to remove FKBP 12 from coupled RyR 1 failed to functionally uncouple the channels. Finally, I attempted to find pharmacological agents that could aid in the understanding of coupled RyR 1. Some agents were found to modulate RyR 1 s; however, I did not find a probe that would affect kinetics/conductance of RyR 1 s and was suitable for comparing <b>coupled</b> <b>gating</b> in bilayers with Ca 2 + sparks in cells. Overall, <b>coupled</b> RyR <b>gating</b> is dependent on the physiological modulators ATP and Mg 2 +. This thesis represents a step forward in identifying the requirements for <b>coupled</b> RyR 1 <b>gating</b> and understanding how RyR 1 s function in cells. Until an understanding of how these receptors communicate in cells is obtained, how different mutations alter the Ca 2 + leak will continue to be quite difficult to study...|$|R

CLIC- 2 (0. 2 – 10  μM) added to the cytoplasmic side of RyR 2 channels in lipid bilayers depressed activity in a reversible, voltage-independent, manner {{in the presence of}} activating (10 – 100  μM) or sub-activating (100  nM) cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentrations. Although the number of channel openings to all levels was reduced, the fraction and duration of openings to substate levels were increased after exposure to CLIC- 2. CLIC- 2 reduced increases in activity induced by ATP or adenosine 5 ′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate. Depression of channel activity by CLIC- 2 was greater in the presence of 100  μM cytoplasmic Ca 2 + than with 100  nM or 10  μM Ca 2 +. Further, CLIC- 2 prevented the usual ∼ 50 -fold increase in activity when the cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration was increased from 100  nM to 100  μM.

The results are {{explained in terms}} of wave vector matching of the spin polarized electron states at the ferromagnetic / nanotube interfaces. 2 Due to their unique structural and electrical properties, carbon nanotubes have been investigated extensively for possible electronic device applications. 1 Carbon nanotube spin electronics, while less thoroughly explored, also holds substantial promise. 2 Carbon nanotubes have large electron scattering lengths (measured to be 10 microns or higher at room temperature) 3 and weak spin orbit coupling, so that the nanotube spin scattering length is expected to be extremely large. Initial evidence for spin transport through nanotubes was provided by the observation of hysteretic magnetoresistance switching in ferromagnetically contacted multi wall nanotubes (MWNTs). 4 These results have since been reproduced and expanded on by a number of authors. 5,...|$|R
40|$|We have {{fabricated}} the Bloch transistor shunted on-chip by a small-sized Cr resistor with Rs about 1 kOhm. The Bloch transistor normally {{consists of}} two small Josephson junctions connected in series, which in our case {{have been replaced by}} two superconducting interferometer loops, each with two junctions in parallel. A capacitively <b>coupled</b> <b>gate</b> is supplied to control the induced charge of the small intermediate electrode (island) of the transistor. The measured I-V curves show no hysteresis and correspond to the operation of a effective Josephson junction at the high-damping and strong-noise limits. The critical current of the system was found to be close to its nominal value, that is in accordance with the electromagnetic environment theory. The I-V curves were modulated by the gate with a period of e and a maximum swing of about 2 /mu_V. Such rather moderate modulation results from the Josephson-to- charging energies ratio, Ej/Ec about 9, in our sample being far from its optimum value of 0. 3 up to 1.
