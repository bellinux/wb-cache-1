40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Cullman, Alabama to evaluate the effects of three different rollers/crimpers on terminating a rye (Secale cereale L) cover crop, soil moisture, and sweet corn yield in a no-till system. Three roller types were tested: a straight bar roller, a smooth roller with crimper, and a two-stage roller at speeds of 2 and 4 MPH. Termination rates provided by the three rollers/crimpers were compared to a smooth <b>drum</b> <b>roller</b> (no crimping bar) plus glyphosate (Roundup TM WeatherMax) * * applied at 1 lb/acre. Initialdata indicates that three weeks after rolling 100 % termination was attained by the smooth roller and glyphosate. A termination of 68 % was attained following the smooth roller with crimper at 4 MPH; however, {{no significant differences were}} found between the straight bar roller at both speeds, the smooth roller with crimper and the two-stage roller at 4 MPH (67 %). Roller type did not affect soil moisture after the first and second week from rolling. No significant difference in sweet corn yield was found between straight bar roller at 4 MPH, two-stage roller at 2 MPH, and smooth roller plus glyphosate. The lowest yield was found with smooth <b>drum</b> <b>roller</b> plus glyphosate. The highest yield (15, 348 lbs/ac or 6. 85 tonnes/ac) was recorded following the smooth roller with crimper at 4 MPH...|$|R

40|$|Pervious {{concrete}} is {{a relatively}} new material, standards and rigorous specifications for construction and placement are therefore still missing. One the one hand, the main characteristic to achieve is a high permeability to allow meteoric water percolate in the pavement and evaporate from the subgrade. On the other hand, developing pavement cementitious mixtures able to retain high void contents and reach significant mechanical performance entails an in-depth analysis of materials and construction practices. Pervious concrete can indeed be placed using a standard paver as for asphalt mixtures but the compaction stage is usually demanded to the contractor practices: light steel hand-rollers or standard <b>drum</b> <b>rollers</b> are both used without an in-depth knowledge of compaction properties of the cementitious mixture. The present paper aims at investigating the influence of compaction methods on the mechanical performance and void contents of pervious concrete mixtures. Several compaction procedures were tested modifying the compaction energy and the mixture characteristics while preserving high permeability. The main objective was to simulate and identify the effect of commonly adopted in situ compaction techniques - i. e. : tamper compaction as provided by the paver, steel hand-roller compaction, or standard <b>drum</b> <b>roller</b> compaction. Results showed how the compaction energy, water/cement ratios, and the percentage of cement affect the Indirect Tensile Strength and void contents of the mixtures. Further investigations were also conducted in order to comprehensively evaluate how the variation in the percentage of cement and water/cement ratio influenced the stiffness of the material.

50|$|The {{commercial}} process, done at purchase, {{usually involves}} an operator taking the part as chile roaster which involves standing near and turning a cylindrical <b>cage</b> <b>drum</b> over propane fueled flames, ensuring the chile pods are heated on every side, as they shed their skins; this ensures the chile skins blister appropriately, {{to allow for}} easier peeling of the chile. This process {{is the most popular}} method, since the smell has become a staple during the early New Mexican autumn, it offers a physical display of the chile, it offers the sound of the chiles crackling, the sight of the blistering and falling skins, accompanied by the widely distributed smell of the roasting peppers.|$|R
50|$|Road rollers use {{the weight}} of the vehicle to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot <b>drum</b> <b>roller,</b> which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single <b>drum,</b> smooth tandem <b>roller</b> or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth <b>drum</b> <b>roller,</b> a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|R

He devised a time lapse camera that stood twelve feet, built out of spare parts from a nearby junkyard, with a temperature controlled incubator.|$|R
40|$|Asphalt {{pavements}} {{have been}} compacted using steel <b>drum</b> <b>rollers</b> for a century. However, {{the problems that}} are observed today on these pavements are universal with no solution in sight. Intensive research work has been invested to identify the mechanisms that cause these problems. A recent development was the introduction of SuperPave mix design, GP asphalt cements, {{and the use of}} reinforcing elements ranging from polymer to steel bars. Yet it seems that none of these solutions have succeeded in eliminating any of the old problems. The pavements suffer from serious distresses regardless of the geographic location of the pavements and its design, materials, traffic loads, and climate condition. This paper presents a new approach to deal with the problems facing the asphalt pavements. While the research efforts to date concentrated on materials-related solutions, this paper identifies conventional compaction equipment as the cause of many problems observed on the pavements. The paper provides the development of the new Asphalt Multi-Integrated Roller, AMIR, and discusses new developments leading to a number of commercial field trials on several Ontario highways. The paper concludes that current compactors must be replaced with soft flat plates in order to achieve the required specifications for long term performance...|$|R
