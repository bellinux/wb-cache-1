The color version of Gotcha was not widely produced, with between 20 and 100 machines released, but is believed to be the first color arcade game ever made, released over a month before Wimbledon, a color Pong clone.|$|E

40|$|In this article, we are {{concerned}} with the role of colors in reading written texts. It has been argued that <b>colored</b> <b>overlays</b> applied above written texts positively influence both reading fluency and reading speed. These effects would be particularly evident for those individuals affected by the so called Meares-Irlen syndrome, i. e. who experience eyestrain and/or visual distortions – e. g. color, shape or movement illusions – while reading. This condition would interest the 12 - 14 % of the general population and up to the 46 % of the dyslexic population. Thus, <b>colored</b> <b>overlays</b> have been largely employed as a remedy for some aspects of the difficulties in reading experienced by dyslexic individuals, as fluency and speed. Despite the wide use of <b>colored</b> <b>overlays,</b> how they exert their effects has not been made clear yet. Also, according to some researchers, the results supporting the efficacy of <b>colored</b> <b>overlays</b> as a tool for helping readers are at least controversial. Furthermore, {{the very nature of the}} Meares-Irlen syndrome has been questioned. Here we provide a concise, critical review of the literature...|$|R
40|$|A <b>colored</b> <b>overlay</b> {{has been}} used as an assistive device for people with visual stress. Recently, a kind of mobile <b>colored</b> <b>overlays</b> has been developed; however, it can’t be applied to all {{contents}} of its environment. In this paper, I implemented a mobile overlay application based on the Android operating system and it can be applied to not only all contents in the system but also external contents such as book using camera mode. To achieve this, I measured film <b>overlay</b> <b>colors</b> at transmit mode and reflect mode by using spectrum colorimeter and estimated and implemented color information to apply to virtual overlays. Chromaticity measured in reflect mode was heavier than the one measured in transmit mode. I found I needed to use chromaticity measured in reflect mode {{in order to keep the}} film’s overlay effect in virtual <b>colored</b> <b>overlay,</b> which was applied to printed paper. The test results showed that it had the same effect as when existing film overlay was used on white paper, with the exception of color effect on the white screen of mobile devices...|$|R
40|$|Children {{with autism}} {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD), together with controls matched for age and ability participated in three experiments that assessed the therapeutic benefit of <b>colored</b> <b>overlays.</b> The {{findings from the}} first experiment showed that a significantly greater proportion of children with ASD, than controls, increased reading speed when using a <b>colored</b> <b>overlay.</b> This finding was replicated in the second experiment which also showed that therapeutic benefits were only observed when participants were instructed to select colors that improved textual clarity and not when colors were {{selected on the basis}} simply of preference. In the final experiment, children were required to discriminate between pictorially presented objects with and without overlays self-selected for improvements in clarity. Participants with ASD, both with and without concurrent intellectual impairment, showed significant gains in performance when using an overlay. The beneficial effects of <b>color</b> <b>overlays</b> and the implications of these results for current neuropsychological models of ASD are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Battlezone is a first-person tank combat arcade {{game from}} Atari, Inc. {{released}} in November 1980. The player controls a tank which is attacked by other tanks and missiles.

40|$|Aim: To test {{a theory}} of visual stress by {{investigating}} the inter-relationships between (1) the threshold contrast/saturation at which individuals first report discomfort when viewing colored gratings of progressively increasing contrast and decreasing saturation; (2) {{the choice of a}} <b>colored</b> <b>overlay</b> for reading; (3) any increase in reading speed when the overlay is used. Method: Ninety-five young adults, with normal color vision, reported illusions from square-wave gratings (Pattern Glare Test), chose any <b>colored</b> <b>overlays</b> that improved clarity (Intuitive <b>Color</b> <b>Overlays)</b> and read aloud randomly ordered common words (Wilkins Rate of Reading Test). This was followed by an automated choice of tints for text using various screen colors on a tablet, and a test of discomfort from patterns of progressively increasing contrast and decreasing saturation, using software developed for this study. All participants wore their optimal refractive correction throughout the procedure. Results: Fifty-eight participants chose a <b>colored</b> <b>overlay</b> and reported that it made text easier and more comfortable to read. On average, these individuals had a greater improvement in reading speed with their overlays (p = 0. 003), a lower contrast threshold at which discomfort from achromatic gratings was first reported (p = 0. 015), and a tendency to report more pattern glare (p = 0. 052), compared to the other participants. Participants who chose both a most and least preferred tint for text using the automated procedure reported discomfort from colored gratings at a significantly higher contrast with their most preferred color compared to their least preferred color (p = 0. 003). The choice of a colored tint was moderately consistent across tests. The most and least preferred colors tended to be complementary. Conclusion: Colored tints that improved reading speed reduced pattern glare both in terms of the illusion susceptibility and in terms of discomfort contrast threshold, supporting {{a theory of}} visual stress. An automated test that incorporates colored gratings and a choice of most and least preferred color might better identify individuals whose reading speed improves with <b>colored</b> <b>overlays...</b>|$|R

We have used two different methods that use high pressure freezing (HPF) combined with correlative light microscopy (LM) and TEM.

This pre-embedding method optimizes ultrastructural preservation. A second, post-embedding method preserves fluorescence and immunoreactivity from embedded and polymerized thin sections.

30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{detection}} of perfusion defects with cCTA, dual-energy CT may be useful. A relatively higher kVp is needed for optimal tissue penetration to optimize coronary imaging, while a lower kVp is useful to improve sensitivity {{for the detection of}} small differences in myocardial enhancement. A dual-source scanner may be used to simultaneously provide adequate penetration for coronary cCTA as well as low kVp imaging to improve detection of myocardial perfusion. A low energy “iodine perfusion map” is displayed as a <b>color</b> <b>overlay</b> on the high-resolution coronary CTA image to provide excellent diagnostic correlation with SPECT imaging (sensitivity: 91 %, specificity: 92 %) [36]. This same group demonstrated cCTA detection of reversible SPECT defects without stress imaging [37]. They have suggested that such defects may be visible without stress imaging because of the superior spatial resolution and dynamic range of CT as compared with nuclear SPECT or secondary to the intrinsic vasodilatory effects of iodinated contrast [38].|$|E
