Further nails {{in the floor}} provide additional safety for the platform and the sliding valve chamber (see Figs.  1, 7) against buoyancy. Below the barrage’s base, a stiffening “shoe plate” on three rows of short micropiles was provided, improving the underlying weathered rock’s resistance against mechanic and hydraulic impact (Mutschler and Triantafyllidis 2009).

40|$|Geological and {{geotechnical}} {{study was conducted}} in concrete gravity dam which is planned to be constructed in the Maychew River 40 km south of Axum town for the purpose of water supply for the town. The objectives of this research were to map geology of the area to characterize geological defects within and around dam site to evaluate the water tightness of the dam site and to determine the bearing capacity of the dam foundation. The research involved review of different literatures lithological and structural mapping characterizing rock masses by using different rock mass classification methods interpretation of subsurface data geophysical core drilled data test pit data etc [...] Results of the study indicate that the area is underlain by Quaternary sediments metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks. The Quaternary sediments are characterized by low permeability low plasticity and are poorly graded nature. Metasedimentary rocks are found covering the right abutment of the dam whereas at reservoir area it is found intercalating with metavolcanic rocks. These rocks are moderately jointed and sheared with faulting and folding noticed due to these they have a relatively high permeability. Metavolcanic rocks which are found covering the left abutment are strong less permeable and fractured. Most of discontinuities such as fractures bedding and foliation in the study area are oriented E-W NNW-SSE and NNE-SSW. The VES tomography and drilled core result revealed that the potential problems seepageleakage could occur due to presence of faults joints karstified black limestone lithological variations groundwater depth and topography at right abutment. Differential settlements may also occur because empirically estimated moduli of deformation Ed of rock masses indicate that for right abutment much less than left abutment and different geological defects across the dam axis. To minimize these problems <b>contact</b> <b>grouting</b> and consolidation grouting are recommended as mitigation measurements...|$|E
40|$|A pre-grouted rock mass is {{subjected}} to stress re-distribution as the tunnel excavation progresses. The strength and deformation characteristics of grouted rock joints are therefore of interest in any effort to predict the rock mechanical behavior {{as well as the}} failure of sealing in a grouted rock mass. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the basic behavior of grouted rock joints and to study its rock mechanical interaction. Direct shear tests were performed on both grouted and ungrouted, identical high-strength rock joint replicas while injecting water in the joint plane. The tests were done under normal stresses between 2 and 4 MPa with cement grouts having water-cement ratios between 0. 7 and 0. 9. The obtained results were then fitted and used for numerical modeling of representative tunneling situations. The grouted cement affects the joint shear strength in two ways; a cohesive part is added and the friction is reduced. Grout sealing failure of a joint {{subjected to}} shear displacement occurs as a consequence of dilation. Test results indicated that the shear strength of grouted joints were reduced up to 25 % and seepage commenced when the range of elastic, relative shear displacement was exceeded. The results implied that for most applications, that the peak shear strength of grouted joints can be regarded {{as a function of the}} rock <b>contact</b> friction and <b>grout</b> bond strength, using a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The grout sealing failure occurs concurrently with the shear failure. It was concluded from the numerical modeling that, shear displacement in a single, adversely located joint represents a possible seepage path. The most common adverse joint location was found to be parallel with the principal shear stress. It was also concluded that the secondary compressive stress field after tunnel excavation increased the joint shear strength and suppresses the dilation that causes grout sealing failure...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Superplasticisers are used to improve the flow properties of fresh cement and offer undoubted benefits to the construction sector. There is concern in the nuclear industry, however, that organic additives may increase the solubility of radionuclides when in <b>contact</b> with cementitious <b>grouts</b> or backfill. The research presented in this thesis describes {{the effect of a}} commercial polycarboxylated poly ether comb type superplasticiser on the behaviour of U (VI), Th (IV), Eu (III) and Ni (II) in blended cements. Both Blast Furnace Slag (BFS) and Pulverised Fly Ash (PFA) blends with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) were investigated. Solubility experiments approached from oversaturation were conducted in a range of high pH aqueous solutions that are representative of the respective cement pore waters. Results show that the as received superplasticiser is responsible for an increase in solubility of all the metals investigated, however, the extent of solubility enhancement is dependent on the metal investigated {{and the nature of the}} high pH solution. U (VI) and Eu (III) display solubility enhancement over several orders of magnitude while Ni (II) and Th (IV) solubility is enhanced to a lesser extent. Batch experiments of Ni (II) and Eu (III) uptake onto BFS:OPC and PFA:OPC cement were investigated from two view points i. 	By regarding the superplasticiser as a ligand where batch experiments of metal uptake on crushed cement are carried out with increasing concentrations of free superplasticiser in solution. ii. 	By investigating metal uptake in cements prepared with superplasticiser already present. Results of the batch experiments show that the presence of free superplasticiser in solution reduces uptake of Ni (II) and Eu (III) by both BFS:OPC and PFA:OPC. Further, metal bound in the presence of free superplasticiser is readily remobilised on exposure to fresh cement solution. Conversely, metal uptake is quantitative and irreversible when exposed to crushed cement prepared with superplasticiser in the original mix. Leaching of U (VI), Th (IV) and Ni (II) from hardened cement with and without the addition of superplasticiser was investigated by the preparation of monolithic BFS:OPC and PFA:OPC cement samples. BFS:OPC samples prepared with superplasticiser suffered from bleed and a significant proportion of the original metal inventory was found in the BFS:OPC bleed water after 48 hours, varying from 19...|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the effects of aging on and the expected forms of plutonium in Tank 18 waste residues. The findings are based on available information on the operational history of Tank 18, reported analytical results for samples taken from Tank 18, and the available scientific literature for plutonium under alkaline conditions. These findings should apply in general to residues in other waste tanks. However, the operational history of other waste tanks should be evaluated for specific conditions and unique operations (e. g., acid cleaning with oxalic acid) that could alter the form of plutonium in heel residues. Based on the operational history of other tanks, characterization of samples from the heel residues in those tanks would be appropriate to confirm the form of plutonium. During the operational period and continuing with the residual heel removal periods, Pu(IV) is the dominant oxidation state of the plutonium. Small fractions of Pu(V) and Pu(VI) could be present {{as the result of the}} presence of water and the result of reactions with oxygen in air and products from the radiolysis of water. However, the presence of Pu(V) would be transitory as it is not stable at the dilute alkaline conditions that currently exists in Tank 18. Most of the plutonium that enters Savannah River Site (SRS) high-level waste (HLW) tanks is freshly precipitated as amorphous plutonium hydroxide, Pu(OH) {sub 4 (am) } or hydrous plutonium oxide, PuO{sub 2 (am,hyd) } and coprecipitated within a mixture of hydrous metal oxide phases containing metals such as iron, aluminum, manganese and uranium. The coprecipitated plutonium would include Pu{sup 4 +} that has been substituted for other metal ions in crystal lattice sites, Pu{sup 4 +} occluded within hydrous metal oxide particles and Pu{sup 4 +} adsorbed onto the surface of hydrous metal oxide particles. The adsorbed plutonium could include both inner sphere coordination and outer sphere coordination of the plutonium. PuO{sub 2 (am,hyd) } is also likely to be present in deposits and scales that have formed on the steel surfaces of the tank. Over the operational period and after closure of Tank 18, Ostwald ripening has and will continue to transform PuO{sub 2 (am,hyd) } to a more crystalline form of plutonium dioxide, PuO{sub 2 (c) }. After bulk waste removal and heel retrieval operations, the free hydroxide concentration decreased and the carbonate concentration in the free liquid and solids increased. Consequently, a portion of the PuO{sub 2 (am,hyd) } has likely been converted to a hydroxy-carbonate complex such as Pu(OH) {sub 2 }(CO{sub 3 }) {sub (s) }. or PuO(CO{sub 3 }) {center_dot} xH{sub 2 }O{sub (am) }. Like PuO{sub 2 (am,hyd) }, Ostwald ripening of Pu(OH) {sub 2 }(CO{sub 3 }) {sub (s) } or PuO(CO{sub 3 }) {center_dot} xH{sub 2 }O{sub (am) } would be expected to occur to produce a more crystalline form of the plutonium carbonate complex. Due to the high alkalinity and low carbonate concentration in the grout formulation, it is expected that upon interaction with the grout, the plutonium carbonate complexes will transform back into plutonium hydroxide. Although crystalline plutonium dioxide is the more stable thermodynamic state of Pu(IV), the low temperature and high water content of the waste during the operating and heel removal periods in Tank 18 have limited the transformation of the plutonium into crystalline plutonium dioxide. During the tank closure period of thousands of years, transformation of the plutonium into a more crystalline plutonium dioxide form would be expected. However, the continuing presence of water, reaction with water radiolysis products, and low temperatures will limit the transformation, and will likely maintain an amorphous Pu(OH) {sub 4 } or PuO{sub 2 (am,hyd) } form on the surface of any crystalline plutonium dioxide produced after tank closure. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopic (XAS) measurements of Tank 18 residues are recommended to confirm coordination environments of the plutonium. If the presence of PuO(CO{sub 3 }) {sub (am,hyd) } is confirmed by XAS, it is recommended that experiments be conducted to determine if plutonium carbonates are transformed back into PuO{sub 2 (am,hyd) } upon <b>contact</b> with <b>grout...</b>|$|R
