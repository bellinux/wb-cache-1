First, a rough clustering of handwritten data is made taking into account both characters’ global and local information. Next, the clustering is refined {{in order to obtain}} clusters of characters belonging to the same allograph that is finally computed. Experiments on allograph extraction made using characters from UNIPEN international database yield an allographs per <b>character</b> <b>rate</b> up to 7, 2 in upper-case characters. The quality of allographs is also tested using them to initialize a handwriting recognizer achieving an average recognition rate of 90, 15 %. 1...|$|E

The cell line is of connective tissue origin, and its characteristic property is the synthesis and secretion of acid mucopolysaccharides, mainly hyaluronic acid. This differentiated cell function, {{the activity of}} which depends on continuous gene action, {{was found to be}} possessed by each of eleven clonal substrains, and is therefore a genetically heritable cell <b>character.</b> <b>Rate</b> of acid mucopolysaccharide biosynthesis falls sharply {{under the influence of the}} environmental conditions existing in crowded cultures, and this rate also declines if protein synthesis is directly inhibited with puromycin.

The separation of influencing volumetric and near-electrode effects on the plasma parameters has been made. The increase of the effective conduction in the flow nucleus and released specific power at increase of the super critical <b>character</b> <b>rate</b> in the magnetic field has been discovered firstly.

With the GIS software ArcINFO and Arc View, the <b>character,</b> <b>rate</b> and processes {{of land use}} change were analyzed. The changes of landscape metrics were analyzed using the landscape structure analysis program FRAGSTATS. The results showed that arable land and grassland remained the main land use in 15 -year period. Land degradation was very serious, and 26. 9 % of dense grassland were degraded to mid-density grassland and some sparse grassland were turned into bore land. The soil salinization mainly occurred in farmland. The landscape change showed that landscape fragmentation process and landscape diversity are increased and patch shape is dispersed. Five, counties (cities) had their own landscape dynamics. The change of landscape pattern in Linhe city and Hangjin Hou County were most active, which {{was the same as}} the result of spatial difference of land use change...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to reveal what factors are a base for mutual {{influence}} of the atoms in the complex oxides by means of analysing magnetic properties in the diluted solid solutions of the complex oxides with spinel structure and laminated structure of the K* 002 NiF* 004 type. A wide number of the solid solutions including the different 3 d-elements and also diamagnetic elements has been synthesized firstly, and their magnetic susceptibility has been investigated. The general approach to the problem of mutual influencing atoms in the different sublattices has been formulated. It has been shown that the stability of the complex oxides, distribution of the atoms over non-equivalent positions, valent and spin states, character and energetics of the interatomic interactions are determined with the competition of the metal-oxygen bonds in the diamagnetic and paramagnetic sublattices characterizing the different ionic <b>character</b> <b>rate.</b> Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{if there is}} a difference in viewer perception of computer animated character facial expressions based on character body style, specifically, realistic and stylized character body styles. Participants viewed twenty clips of computer animated characters expressing one of five emotions: sadness, happiness, anger, surprise and fear. They then named the emotion and rated the sincerity, intensity, and typicality of each clip. The results indicated that for recognition, participants were more slightly more likely to recognize a stylized character although it was not a significant difference. Stylized characters were on average rated higher for sincerity and intensity and realistic characters were on average rated higher for typicality. A significant difference in ratings was shown with fear (within sincerity and typicality) having realistic <b>characters</b> <b>rated</b> higher, happiness (within sincerity and intensity) having stylized <b>characters</b> <b>rated</b> higher and stylized being rated higher once for anger (stylized) and realistic (typicality) being rated once for anger.

We provide a statistical analysis showing that if, for example, the expected <b>character</b> error <b>rate</b> is around 1 %, then with a test set of at least 10; 000 statistically independent handwritten characters (which could be obtained by taking 100 characters from each of 100 different writers), we guarantee, with 95 % confidence, that: (1) the expected value of the <b>character</b> error <b>rate</b> is not worse than 1 : 25 E, where E is the empirical <b>character</b> error <b>rate</b> of the best recognizer, calculated on the test set; and (2) a difference of 0 : 3 E between the error rates of two recognizers is significant.

50|$|The HDL namesake {{originates}} {{from the}} dice mechanic for the game, called the Half Die Level. For simplicity, all variables {{boil down to}} a simple number, which determines the die rolled. The number equals half the sides on the die. Thus, HDL 2 = 1d4, HDL 6 = 1d12, and HDL 10 = 2d10. In general, all rolls are based on an HDL equal to a certain stat, plus the <b>character’s</b> <b>rating</b> in the associated skill. For instance, attacking with a sword is based on gross motor coordination, or the Coordination stat, and the Sword: Slashing skill, so a character would roll the HDL of his Coordination, then add his Sword: Slashing skill.|$|R
40|$|Document images undergo various {{degradation}} processes. Numerous {{models of}} these degradation processes {{have been proposed}} in the literature. In this {{paper we propose a}} modelbased restoration algorithm. The restoration algorithm first estimates the parameters of a degradation model and then uses the estimated parameters to construct a lookup table for restoring the degraded image. The estimated degradation model is used to estimate the probability of an ideal binary pattern, given the noisy observed pattern. This probability is estimated by degrading noise-free document images and then computing the frequency of corresponding noise-free and noisy pattern pairs. This conditional probability is then used to construct a lookup table to restore noisy images. The impact of the restoration process is then quantified by computing the decrease in OCR word and <b>character</b> error <b>rate.</b> We find that given the estimated degradation model parameter values, the restoration algorithm decreases the <b>character</b> error <b>rate</b> by 16. 1 % and the word error rate by 7. 35 %. In some categories of degradation (e. g. model parameters that give rise to broken characters) there is a 41. 5 % reduction in <b>character</b> error <b>rate</b> and 20. 4 % reduction in word error rate. 1...|$|R
