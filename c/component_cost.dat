50|$|Metals {{come in all}} forms. In {{the case}} of {{aluminum}} as an example, bar stock and plate {{are the two most}} common forms from which machined parts are made. The size and shape of the component may determine which form of material must be used. It is common for engineering drawings to specify one form over the other. Bar stock is generally close to 1/2 of the cost of plate on a per pound basis.

50|$|In the mid-1980s, a {{designer}} would choose an ASIC manufacturer and implement their design using the design tools {{available from the}} manufacturer. While third-party design tools were available, there was not an effective link from the third-party design tools to the layout and actual semiconductor process performance characteristics of the various ASIC manufacturers. Most designers ended up using factory-specific tools to complete the implementation of their designs. A solution to this problem, which also yielded a much higher density device, was the implementation of standard cells. Every ASIC manufacturer could create functional blocks with known electrical characteristics, such as propagation delay, capacitance and inductance, that could also be represented in third-party tools. Standard-cell design is the utilization of these functional blocks to achieve very high gate density and good electrical performance. Standard-cell design fits between Gate Array and Full Custom design {{in terms of both}} its non-recurring engineering and recurring <b>component</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E

40|$|This memo {{introduces}} SKAcost as a {{tool for}} estimating end-to-end <b>component</b> <b>costs</b> for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The intention is not to provide definitive costs, but to demonstrate the utility of the tool.

This memo demonstrates how SKAcost might be used in a similar study for the SKA. SKAcost represents the first attempt to estimate the cost of SKA systems including: • a scalable phased array feed and beam-forming model; • a scalable computing model for spectral line imaging; and • Monte Carlo simulation to determine appropriate contingency for uncertain technology trends and <b>component</b> <b>costs.</b> Six broad conclusions were drawn from applying SKAcost to arrays with equivalent survey speeds but differing technologies: 1.

50|$|Processor {{clock rates}} were {{typically}} 1-2 MHz for 6502 and 6809 based CPU's and 2-4 MHz for Z80 based systems (yielding roughly equal performance), but this aspect was not emphasized by users or manufacturers, as the systems' limited RAM capacity, graphics abilities and storage options {{had a more}} perceivable effect on performance than CPU speed. For low-price computers the cost of RAM memory chips contributed greatly to the final product price to the consumer, and fast CPUs demanded expensive, fast memory. So designers kept clock rates only adequate; in some cases like the Atari and Commodore 8-bit machines, coprocessors were added to speed processing of graphics and audio data. For these computers clock rate was considered a technical detail of interest only to users needing accurate timing for their own programs. To economize on <b>component</b> <b>cost,</b> often the same crystal used to produce color television compatible signals was also divided down and used for the processor clock. This meant processors rarely operated at their full rated speed, and had the side-effect that European and North American {{versions of the same}} home computer operated at slightly different speeds and different video resolution due to different television standards.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{deterministic}} economic model to estimate the costs associated with (1) the <b>component</b> <b>cost</b> per case of hyperketonemia (HYK) and (2) the total cost per case of HYK when accounting for costs related to HYK-attributed diseases. Data from current literature was used to model the incidence and risks of HYK (defined as a blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentration ≥ 1. 2 mmol/L), displaced abomasa (DA), metritis, disease associations, milk production, culling, and reproductive outcomes. The <b>component</b> <b>cost</b> of HYK was estimated based on 1, 000 calvings per year; the incidence of HYK in primiparous and multiparous animals; the percent of animals receiving clinical treatment; the direct costs of diagnostics, therapeutics, labor, and death loss; and the indirect costs of future milk production losses, future culling losses, and reproduction losses. Costs attributable to DA and metritis were estimated based on the incidence of each disease in the first 30 DIM; the number of cases of each disease attributable to HYK; the direct costs of diagnostics, therapeutics, discarded milk during treatment and the withdrawal period, veterinary service (DA only), and death loss; and the indirect costs of future milk production losses, future culling losses, and reproduction losses. The <b>component</b> <b>cost</b> per case of HYK was estimated at $ 134 and $ 111 for primiparous and multiparous animals, respectively; the average <b>component</b> <b>cost</b> per case of HYK was estimated to be $ 117. Thirty-four percent of the <b>component</b> <b>cost</b> of HYK was due to future reproductive losses, 26 % to death loss, 26 % to future milk production losses, 8 % to future culling losses, 3 % to therapeutics, 2 % to labor, and 1 % to diagnostics. The total cost per case of HYK was estimated at $ 375 and $ 256 for primiparous and multiparous animals, respectively; the average total cost per case of HYK was $ 289. Forty-one percent of the total cost of HYK was due to the <b>component</b> <b>cost</b> of HYK, 33 % to costs attributable to metritis, and 26 % to costs attributable to DA. The high total cost of HYK at reported incidences of 40 to 60 % highlights the importance of appropriate transition cow nutrition and management to decrease the effect of HYK...|$|E
