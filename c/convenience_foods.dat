5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other <b>convenience</b> <b>foods),</b> where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E

40|$|Independent {{living in}} their own home is {{currently}} an ideal shared by many older people. However, weakening physical strength and illness are often associated with nutritional risks. <b>Convenience</b> <b>food</b> is one option to ensure that nutritional needs are met, but <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> itself and its packaging face negative attitudes. This article analyzes the factors connected to acceptability of and obstacles to using <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> among older people in Finland. The analysis was done by using three sets of data gathered using a qualitative research method for examining how older people relate to <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> and food packaging. The methods used were empathy-based stories (2011 n = 114) and two rounds of focus group discussions (2012 n = 22, 2014 n = 32). By and large, the study participants associated negative meanings with <b>convenience</b> <b>food.</b> Some saw <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> as an easy solution in certain situations. Our study showed that elderly individuals valued healthiness of food, freedom of choice, and right of self-determination in eating. Acceptability of <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> requires an availability of meals matching taste preferences and sensory capabilities. Moreover, healthiness of food and easy-to-use and environmentally friendly packaging were valued by many interviewees...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a critical review}} of recent research on the consumption of ‘convenience’ food, highlighting the contested nature of the term and exploring its implications for public health and environmental sustainability. It distinguishes between <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> in general and particular types of <b>convenience</b> <b>food,</b> such as ready-meals, tracing the structure and growth {{of the market for}} such foods with a particular emphasis on the UK which currently has the highest rate of ready-meal consumption in Europe. Having established the definitional complexities of the term, the paper presents the evidence from a systematic review of the literature, highlighting the significance of <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> in time-saving and time-shifting, the importance of recent changes in domestic labour and family life, and the way the consumption of <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> is frequently moralized. The paper shows how current debates about <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> are part of a longer discursive history about food, health and nutrition. It discusses current levels of public understanding about the links between <b>convenience</b> <b>food,</b> environmental sustainability and food waste. The paper concludes by making a case for understanding the consumption of <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> in terms of everyday social practices, emphasising its habitual and routine character...|$|R

2500|$|Obesity: Obesity is a {{paramount}} problem, {{especially among}} the poor and socially disadvantaged, in cities worldwide, according to the WHO (Hawkes et al., 2007; Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007). The increased amount of obesity can be contributed to the nutrition transition that describes how people are now increasingly turning to high-fat, sugar, and salt food sources because of their availability and price. [...] This food transition has fueled the obesity epidemic. This nutrition transition tends to start in cities because of [...] "greater availability, accessibility, and acceptability of bulk purchases, <b>convenience</b> <b>foods,</b> and 'supersized' portions" [...] (Dixon et al., 2007). [...] Physical activity and exercise is strongly determined by the design of cities, including density of homes, heterogeneous land uses, {{the extent to which}} streets and sidewalks connect, the walkability, and the provision of and access to local public accommodations and parks for recreation and play. [...] These factors, along with increasing reliance on cars, results in the shift of the population toward physical inactivity, which damages health (Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007).|$|E
40|$|<b>Convenience</b> <b>food</b> is {{characterized}} by a value added to the product core that corresponds to fast changing consumer needs. Thus, <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> can be considered as an example {{of one of the most}} innovative product categories in the domain of the food industry. Concerning innovative activities the prevailing perception of <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> is that all decisive impulses are coming from the market e. g. are driven by the power of demand. If so, than food producers have the chance to react on these impulses when developing novel <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> solutions timely and close to the market development intent meeting the requirements of the consumers. In this paper we are going to propose a different viewpoint: firms who are developing, producing and selling <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> products may follow a corporate strategy which is not necessarily and primarily in line with the consumer welfare but is rather oriented to their competitors. Thus, the strategic dimension is also or predominantly geared to a firm’s competitive environment when trying to find attractive niche positions and aiming on competitive advantage by using internal resources and competencies. We understand that <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> shows clear distinctive characteristics in comparison to conventional foods. These require a very particular set of competencies in the sense of how to employ resources and capabilities in a useful way. Additionally, we argue that the characteristics of <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> to employ an innovation strategy based on fast processes of resource reconfiguration.

40|$|Households in the UK discard much food. A {{reduction}} in such waste to mitigate environmental impact {{is part of}} UK government policy. This study investigated whether household food waste is linked to a lifestyle reliant on <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> in younger consumers. A survey of 928 UK residents aged 18 - 40 years and responsible for the household food shopping (male n = 278; female n = 650) completed an online questionnaire designed to measure attitudes to <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> and to quantify household food waste. Cluster analysis of 24 food-related lifestyle factors identified 5 consumer groups. General linear modelling techniques were used to test relationships between the purchase frequency of <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> and household food waste. From the cluster analysis, five distinct convenience profiles emerged comprising: ‘epicures’ (n = 135), ‘traditional consumers’ (n = 255), ‘casual consumers’ (n = 246), ‘food detached consumers’ (n = 151) and ‘kitchen evaders’ (n = 141). Casual consumers and kitchen evaders were the most reliant on <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> and notably were the most wasteful. The demographic profile of kitchen evaders matched the population groups currently targeted by UK food waste policy. Casual consumers represent a new and distinct group characterised by “buy a lot and waste a lot” behaviour. Household size, packaging format, price-awareness and marketing all appear to influence levels of food waste. However, it seems that subtle behavioural and sociocultural factors also have impact. Further {{research is needed to}} elucidate the factors that mediate the positive association between the purchase of <b>convenience</b> <b>food</b> and reported food waste in order to inform food waste policy and initiatives...|$|R
