5|$|The crosier was {{displayed}} {{as a symbol}} of pastoral jurisdiction by bishops, abbots, abbesses, and cardinals even if they were not bishops. The crosier of a bishop is turned outward or to the right. Frequently the crosier of an abbot or abbess is turned inward, either toward the mitre or to the left, but this distinction is disputed and is not an absolute rule. Pope Alexander VII decreed in 1659 that the crosiers of abbots include a sudarium or veil, but this is not customary in English heraldry. The veil may have arisen because abbots, unlike bishops, did not wear gloves when carrying an actual crosier. Because the cross has similar symbolism, the crosier was suppressed for cardinals and bishops by the Catholic Church in 1969, and is now used only on some corporate arms, and the personal arms of abbots and some abbesses. In English custom and in the Anglican Churches, two crosiers are often found crossed in saltire behind the shield. In the Lutheran <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden,</b> the crosier is displayed in the arms of bishops in office but is removed when a bishop retires.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> was instigated by King Gustav I (1523–60) {{and within}} the half century {{following}} his death had become established as a Lutheran state church with significant power in Swedish society, itself {{under the control of}} the state apparatus. A degree of freedom of worship (for foreign residents only) was achieved under the rule of Gustav III (1771–92), but it was not until the passage of the Dissenter Acts of 1860 and 1874 that Swedish citizens were allowed to leave the state church – and then only provided that those wishing to do so first registered their adhesion to another, officially approved denomination. Following years of discussions that began in 1995, the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> was finally separated from the state as from 1 January 2000. However, the separation was not fully completed. Although the status of state religion came to an end, the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> nevertheless remains Swedens national church, and as such is still regulated by the government through the law of the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden.</b> Therefore, it would be more appropriate to refer to a change of relation between state and church rather than a separation. Furthermore, the Swedish constitution still maintain that the Sovereign and the members of the royal family has to confess an evangelical Lutheran faith, which in praxis means they need to be members of the <b>Church</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> to remain in the line of succession. Thusly according to the ideas of cuius regio, eius religio one could argue that the symbolic connection between state and church still remains.|$|E
