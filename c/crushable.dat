500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season one, Monica is 25 years old. Rita Loiacono of SheKnows Media believes that Monica is the show's most fully realized character {{from the very beginning}} of the series because her [...] "quirks were developed to a tee." [...] Like several strong female sitcom characters who were popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Monica possesses a natural maternal instinct, constantly [...] "vocalising a desire for motherhood." [...] As the group's [...] "unofficial den mother," [...] Monica occupies the role of their mother hen, and is thus often perceived as the most level-headed member of the sextet, with Ken Parish Perkins of the Chicago Tribune identifying Monica as the show's most grounded character. Jill O'Rourke of <b>Crushable</b> described her as [...] "the glue that held the group together." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly believes that Monica serves as [...] "the solid center in a circle of wacky pals" [...] due to her [...] "sunny" [...] personality, combined with the fact that she maintains a secure job while appearing to possess the most common sense. Furthermore, Tucker identified Monica as the show's [...] "straight woman." [...] Writing for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor believes that Monica exhibits [...] "the strongest ties to reality" [...] as the sitcom's most realistically portrayed character. Bustle's James Tison agreed that Monica is the show's most relatable character. Referring to Monica as one-half of the series' [...] "head friends," [...] the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Robert Bianco described the character as sensible, explaining that both her and brother Ross represent [...] "the relatively stable centers around which the other friends rotate." [...] Describing her as [...] "ultra-competent," [...] Natural Living Todays Emily Nussbaum likened Monica to the fairy tale character Snow White, on whose homemaking skills the five other main characters heavily rely, similar to the relationship between Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Although Monica began Friends as the show's straight person, the writers eventually made her funnier by incorporating aspects of Cox's own personality into the character, in addition to writing wittier material for her.|$|E

We {{have no right}} to crush the poor creature because he is so easily <b>crushable.</b> I feel already pricks of conscience because I am bringing down Jack Cheekey upon him.

"As to the berry question, I might {{answer it}} with a gem from Dr. Watts, {{relative}} to 'Satan' and idle hands,' but will merely say, that, {{as a matter of}} public safety, you'd better leave me alone; for such is the destructiveness of my nature, that I shall certainly eat something hurtful, break something valuable, or sit upon something <b>crushable,</b> unless you let me concentrate my energies by knocking on these young fellows' hats, and preparing them for their doom." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{nine o'clock}} exactly on {{that much to}} be remembered Tuesday the Cornbury {{carriage}} stopped at {{the gate of the}} cottage at Bragg's End, and Rachel, ready dressed, blushing, nervous, but yet happy, came out, and mounting on to the step was almost fearful to take her share of the seat. [...] "Make yourself comfortable, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Cornbury, [...] "you can't crush me. Or rather I always make myself <b>crushable</b> on such occasions as this. I suppose {{we are going to have}} a great crowd?" [...] Rachel merely said that she didn't know. She supposed there would be a good many persons. Then she tried to thank Mrs. Cornbury for being so good to her, and of course broke down. [...] "I'm delighted,--quite delighted," [...] said Mrs. Cornbury. [...] "It's so good of you to come with me. Now that I don't dance myself, there's nothing I like so much as taking out girls that do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friends, we {{are going}} into a terrible danger, and we need arms of many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember {{that he has the}} {{strength}} of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind, and therefore breakable or <b>crushable,</b> his are not amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold him, but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his touch. Keep this near your heart." [...] As he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him, [...] "put these flowers round your neck," [...] here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms, [...] "for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife, and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast, and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] I laughed, [...] "what is it {{that has}} {{happened}} to you?" [...] My question had not been in the least intended for pressure, but it made her turn and look at me, and this, I quickly recognised, was all the answer the most pitiless curiosity could have desired--all the more, as well, that the intention in it had been no greater than in my words. Beautiful, abysmal, involuntary, her exquisite weakness simply opened up the depths it would have closed. It was in short a supremely unsuccessful attempt to say nothing. It said everything, {{and by the end of}} a minute my chatter--none the less out of place for being all audible--was hushed to positive awe by what it had conveyed. I saw as I had never seen before what consuming passion can make of the marked mortal on whom, with fixed beak and claws, it has settled as on a prey. She reminded me of a sponge wrung dry and with fine pores agape. Voided and scraped of everything, her shell was merely <b>crushable.</b> So it was brought home to me that the victim could be abased, and so it disengaged itself from these things that the abasement could be conscious. That was Mrs. Server's tragedy, that her consciousness survived--survived with a force that made it struggle and dissemble. This consciousness was all her secret--it was at any rate all mine. I promised myself roundly that I would henceforth keep clear of any other.|$|E

5000|$|Phoenix was 'zero-length' launch being {{projected}} {{into the}} air from a launch-rail mounted {{on the back of}} a truck. The launch rail having been originally developed for the US Army Aquilla UAV that failed to enter service. The Phoenix was recovered by parachute, landing on its back, with a <b>crushable</b> [...] "hump" [...] on the back taking up the impact. The zero-length take-off and landing was an essential requirement for operating in NATO's Central Region and deployment in a forward divisional area. Maximum flight time was around 4 hours.|$|E
50|$|At 24000 ft {{the forward}} heat shield was jettisoned using four pressurized-gas {{compression}} springs. The drogue parachutes were then deployed, slowing the spacecraft to 125 mph. At 10700 ft the drogues were jettisoned {{and the pilot}} parachutes, which pulled out the mains, were deployed. These slowed the CM to 22 mph for splashdown. The portion of the capsule that first contacted the water surface contained four <b>crushable</b> ribs to further mitigate the force of impact. The Command Module could safely parachute to an ocean landing with only two parachutes deployed (as occurred on Apollo 15), the third parachute being a safety precaution.|$|E
