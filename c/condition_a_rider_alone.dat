25|$|In 1977 their rivalry {{culminated in}} what became a {{peculiar}} race. Maertens punctured on the Koppenberg {{and was given}} a wheel by a spectator who pushed {{him all the way}} up. De Vlaeminck broke clear, but punctured shortly after and was caught by a returning Maertens. <b>As</b> both <b>riders</b> were <b>alone</b> {{at the front of the}} race, De Vlaeminck refused to work. For 70km Maertens rode to the finish with De Vlaeminck on his wheel and was easily beaten by the latter in a two-man sprint. It was De Vlaeminck's only win. To this day, both protagonists make contradictory statements about what happened. Maertens stated that the judges had told him he would be disqualified for his illegal wheel-change and that De Vlaeminck had offered him 300.000 francs to keep riding. De Vlaeminck denies this, saying that he tactically stayed on Maertens' wheel, whom he considered the better sprinter. After the race, the controversy heightened even more, when Maertens and third-place finisher Walter Planckaert tested positive for doping and were both disqualified.|$|R

50|$|The {{first race}} {{of the day was}} a switch from the Superbike's to the less {{powerful}} Supersport's due to wet conditions. The race was also reduced from six to five laps with two sighting laps. The race was won by Alastair Seeley after a last lap battle with Cameron Donald. The paddock was evacuated after the race because of a bomb hoax. The second delayed {{race of the}} day was for the Superbike race. However, due to deteriorated <b>conditions</b> <b>a</b> number of <b>riders,</b> including the pole sitter Michael Rutter, decided not to take part. Seeley was leading Michael Dunlop when the race was stopped after one lap due to an oil split. The event was abandon at 17:20 BST.|$|R
50|$|Both the Trabant and Wipeout move {{forwards}} and backwards. Because {{the forces}} experienced {{on the ride}} can cause <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> to move sideways and potentially slip under the lap bar if riding <b>alone,</b> <b>riders</b> must be seated in pairs (sharing a lapbar). Most parks and carnivals require that <b>riders</b> be <b>a</b> minimum of 42 inches tall with an adult, and 48 inches tall without an adult.|$|R

50|$|The {{difference}} between a kitewing and a sports kite or traction kite is that a kitewing {{does not have a}} separate control system (see kite control systems). Instead, a kitewing is held directly {{in the hands of the}} user, which provides greater control, stability and depower when compared to a traditional power kite. In addition a kitewing does not have lines to tangle, and can be manoeuvred easily to perform a wide variety of tricks, turns and fast speeds. This additional control also makes a kitewing safer to use. The instant depower reduces the risk of riders being overrun in strong gusts, and the proximity of the kitewing to the rider makes it safer for other users of the space as there is no risk of injury from kite lines. A Kitewing can be used in varied wind ranges. For initial learning only a small space and low wind speeds are required to allow riders to familiarise themselves with the Kitewing assembly and handling characteristics. In the correct wind <b>conditions</b> <b>an</b> experienced <b>rider</b> can reach speeds up to 90 km/hour. Some very experienced riders can perform controlled jumps of up to 500 meters (on declining terrain) or perform jump turns and other advanced manoeuvres.|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} shown that distance, time and safety are the factors that {{contribute}} to the reckless riding behavior among motorcyclists. Distance can be defined as the amount of space between two places or things which determine the speed of motorcyclist in riding their motorcycle. Time constraints will increase the probability of a motorcyclist to ride motorcycles at high speed. Safety would define a person rides his or her motorcycle. A person tends to ride motorcycle faster when he or she ensure about their safety measurement when riding a motorcycle either long or short term or distance journey. Reckless driving behavior is <b>a</b> <b>condition</b> when <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> who aggressively driving or riding on the road as actual or intended behavior which resulting a physical or psychological harm to the victim experiences as such. With the increase number of new registered motorcycles on the road in Malaysia and outbreak of number of accident and casualties that among motorcyclists that mostly reported caused by the reckless riding behavior, {{it is important to know}} the relationship between distance, time and safety with the reckless riding behavior. Thus, this study to determine whether the distance, time and safety which are the independent variables have contributed to the reckless riding behavior among motorcyclists as the dependent variables at Jalan Hang Tuah, Melaka or vice versa. A purposive sampling of 200 respondents whom were motorcyclists from Jalan Hang Tuah, Melaka that work, live and study at Jalan Hang Tuah, Melaka has answered the questionnaires given. The independent variables were examined. The reckless riding behavior among motorcyclist at Jalan Hang Tuah, Melaka was significantly contributed by the factors namely distance, time and safety. The study indicates that there was a significant relationship between reckless riding behavior and the independent variables...|$|R

During his 12-year term, President Rozanski raised and invested more than $150 million for institutional development. Dr. Rozanski considers his greatest legacy to be the more than 45,000 students who graduated during his 22 years as a university president, 13,000 at <b>Rider</b> <b>alone.</b> And he shook the hands {{of most of the}} graduates.|$|R

50|$|Time {{trials have}} been part of cycling for more than a hundred years. The first time trial was run in 1895 after a ban on road racing was imposed by the National Cyclists' Union. It wasn't until 1939 that the time trial made its world stage debut as an {{official}} stage of the Tour de France. It was originally used as a method of drawing more people to listen to the Grand Tour on the newly available radio broadcast of the 1939 race. The main thing that distinguished the first time-trial from the traditional form of road racing was that the riders started at intervals instead of one large group and they raced against the clock instead of each other. Unlike road racing where the <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> can hang in the peloton and draft off of other riders to conserve energy, time trial races put the <b>rider</b> out <b>alone</b> on the course. There are no breaks and no one to draft off, causing <b>a</b> <b>rider</b> to push as hard as they can the entire race and as fighter planes evolved from the propeller driven fighters of World War I to the modern jet, bicycles have also evolved to accommodate this new form of racing, with most of the breakthroughs occurring in the last 40-50 years with the introduction of triathlons.|$|R
