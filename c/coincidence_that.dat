5|$|Production {{was based}} in the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California. Howard Hughes {{was one of the}} inspirations for the comic book, and the filmmakers {{acknowledged}} the <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> they would film Iron Man creating the flying Mark III where the Hughes H-4 Hercules was built. Favreau rejected the East Coast setting of the comic books because many superhero films had already been set there.|$|E
5|$|Romulus' father Orestes was a Roman citizen, {{originally}} from Pannonia, {{who had served}} as a secretary and diplomat for Attila the Hun and later rose through the ranks of the Roman army. The future emperor was named Romulus after his maternal grandfather, a nobleman from Poetovio in Noricum. Many historians have noted the <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the last western emperor bore the names of both Romulus, the legendary founder and first king of Rome, and Augustus, the first emperor.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E

5|$|During the {{occupancy}} of {{the palace}} by Dom Pedro and Maria I, the chapel was central to the daily routine of their court. It was no <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the chapel was the first part {{of the palace}} to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her husband—the couple attended mass several times a day. Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies. Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity. Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in Rio de Janeiro in 1816.|$|E
5|$|Frank Carter the {{original}} vocalist of Gallows announced in early July 2011 {{that he would}} be leaving Gallows because of differing opinions in writing the band's follow-up album to their second release Grey Britain. His departure was effective on 1 August after the band's final tour dates. Just eight days after Frank's departure, on the 9 August 2011, MacNeil was confirmed as the new Gallows vocalist. MacNeil has stated that the members of Gallows asked him initially out of <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Alexisonfire had disbanded and Gallows needed a new singer. With Frank's departure fans of the band started to believe that he left because he wanted to continue playing heavy music, while the band wanted to go in a more melodic direction; the band decided to release something to show this as false.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries {{of the security}} forces were brought to court in the process of de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization {{of the security forces}} as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents of the security forces.|$|E

25|$|This {{political}} void {{was quickly}} {{filled with a}} number of opposition parties which recognized Muslims as a separate nation. Among them was the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, as a document from the 1930s reveals.

25|$|Heating is {{the most}} obvious application, but solar cooling can be {{achieved}} for a building or district cooling network by using a heat-driven absorption or adsorption chiller (heat pump). There is a productive <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the greater the driving heat from insulation, the greater the cooling output. In 1878, Auguste Mouchout pioneered solar cooling by making ice using a solar steam engine attached to a refrigeration device.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} claims that Sonboly {{deliberately}} targeted people of Turkish or Arab origin, groups he apparently felt had picked on him at school. The state government {{said that the}} victims were not chosen in any way and Sonboly did not know any of them. Police {{thought it was a}} <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> all of the fatalities were of immigrant backgrounds, as the McDonald's near the shopping mall was patronised by the children of migrants.|$|E
25|$|Radiocarbon dating {{traces the}} {{disappearance}} of ground sloths in the United States to around 11,000 years ago. Steadman et al. {{argue that it is}} no <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> studies have shown that {{the disappearance of}} ground sloths occur a few years after humans inhabited their living areas, however, recent scientific work is beginning to reveal that climate change had much more of an impact on the decline of the mega fauna in North America.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} the current Guatemalan Holy Week one {{must go back}} to the religion of the Maya, where there were amazing <b>coincidences</b> <b>that</b> perhaps helped the Catholic religion fit more with the beliefs of Native Americans.

50|$|The Unity of Time - The {{alternative}} title of Mistakes of the Night illustrates that the Unity of Time is carefully observed.

Yet {{there comes a}} point when so many <b>coincidences</b> <b>that</b> cumulatively fit together so well begin to grow to something of great constancy: a point when mere coincidence begins to seem the less likely hypothesis. It is evident that Vere and Gilbertson memorialised something; it becomes difficult not to believe, despite all necessary scepticism, that that something includes Shakespeare.|$|R
25|$|Rogers was philanthropist Edward Harkness's {{favorite}} architect, and Harkness {{would often}} condition {{a gift for}} a new academic or medical building upon the institution's agreement to hire Rogers for the project. It is thus no <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Rogers' work is abundant at Yale, Columbia and the other institutions Harkness supported lavishly. Though Harkness loved Rogers's work, when Harkness donated a new home for Wolf's Head, his society at Yale, another architect (Bertram Goodhue) was chosen.|$|E
25|$|In theory, {{invisible}} fetters {{and bonds}} {{could be controlled}} from a loom, and if a lady loosened a knot in the woof, she could liberate the leg of her hero. But if she tied a knot, she could stop the enemy from moving. The men may have fought on the battle field in sweat and blood, but in a spiritual way, their women took part. It is not by <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> archaeologists find weaving tools and weapons side by side.|$|E
25|$|Deepak's {{works are}} characterised by their tragic, dark endings. His {{characters}} find {{death as a}} constant companion, and often succumb to it. Often, critics have suggested that Deepak walks alongside his characters with a loaded gun—recoiled and ready to fire. Maybe, one can trace the beginnings of Deepak's present mental ordeal to the dark stories that he was writing even in the early 1970s. Perhaps, it is no <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Deepak's favourite authors are Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf, who succumbed to mental agony themselves.|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} data {{gathering}} and analysis procedures used in Einstein-Podoisky-Rosen-Bohm experiments with photons, we construct a simulation algorithm that satisfies Einstein's criteria of local causality and realism and generates {{the same type of}} data as recorded in these idealized expefinnents. The simulation data is analyzed according to the experimental procedure to count <b>coincidences,</b> <b>that</b> is by using an expression for the <b>coincidence</b> counts <b>that,</b> besides depending on the settings of the variable polarizers, explicitly depends on the difference of the time tags of the detection signals in both observation stations and on an adjustable time window. We demonstrate that the simulation algorithm produces data that agrees with the two-particle correlation for the singlet state. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Early morning on 22 April, English police fully loaded with machine-guns laid siege to Lyallpur and arrested 12 people including Lyallpuri.|$|E
25|$|The {{oldest and}} most celebrated of the chansons de geste is The Song of Roland (earliest version {{composed}} c. 1098), seen by some as the national epic of France (comparable with Beowulf in England, the Song of the Nibelungs in Germany and the Lay of el Cid in Spain). It is perhaps no <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the Song of Roland was first written down at a date very close to that of Pope Urban's call (1095) for the First Crusade; its plot {{may be seen as}} a glorification of the crusader ethos.|$|E
25|$|Marlovians (as {{those who}} {{subscribe}} to the theory are usually called) base their argument on supposed anomalies surrounding Marlowe's reported death and on the significant influence which, according to most scholars, Marlowe's works had on those of Shakespeare. They also point out the <b>coincidence</b> <b>that,</b> despite their having been born only two months apart, {{the first time the}} name William Shakespeare is known to have been connected with any literary work whatsoever was with the publication of Venus and Adonis just a week or two after the apparent death of Marlowe.|$|E
