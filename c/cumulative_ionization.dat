40|$|The {{functionality}} of spacecraft electronics must {{be maintained}} in the harsh environments found in space. The radiation environments can consist of either low-energy x-rays at {{the surface of the}} spacecraft or high-energy electrons, high-energy protons and high-energy photons within the spacecraft. Space radiation varies significantly and induces various types of effects (e. g [...] <b>cumulative</b> <b>ionization,</b> low dose rate effects, single event effects and displacement damage) in common device technologies. Harsh radiation environments can also induce electrical charging in spacecraft materials. Within the solar wind, direct irradiation by the Sun’s emissions creates relatively low-voltage charging. Large particle currents, carried by the solar wind, interact with planetary magnetospheres creating trapped high-energy particle belts around certain planets (e. g., Earth, Saturn and Jupiter). Spacecraft passing through these belts can charge spacecraft materials with internal fields that can cause damaging electrostatic discharges. Another harsh environment found in space is extreme low temperature. This can affect the functionality of spacecraft electronics, particularly for interplanetary or deep space applications. Devices and assemblies can experience performance and reliability issues either at extreme low temperatures or as a result of cycling to extreme low temperatures. Mitigation of these damaging effects leads to understanding physics of failure and making changes in the device design, electronic assembly or the electronic packaging materials. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{designed}} a crossed beam apparatus, the new aspect {{of which is}} that an atomic beam is subsequently crossed by two parallel electron beams. The first electron beam has the function to produce metastable atoms which are then ionized in the second beam. In this way we measured the energy dependence of the cross sections for ionization of He from the metastable 23 S and 21 S states. These measurements require a high ion detection efficiency. The high sensitivity of the apparatus also enabled us (i) to measure <b>cumulative</b> <b>ionization</b> within one electron beam (and to measure excitation to the 23 S and 21 S states of He) and (ii) to very accurately measure the cross section for direct ionization from the ground state. We reduced the effect of thermal energy spread in the electron beam on the latter experimental results using mathematical unfolding techniques. For direct ionization from the ground state of He we obtained the following threshold dependence of the cross section Qi (in 10 - 16 cm 2) on the electron energy Ee (in eV) : Qi = (8. 6 ± 0. 5) × 10 - 3 (Ee - 24. 58) 1. 13 ± 0. 02 for 24. 58 eV ≤ Ee ≤ 27. 1 ± 0. 3 eV, and Qi = 0. 0125 [Ee - (25. 14 0. 04) ] for 27. 1 ± 0. 3 eV ≤ Ee ≤ 34 eV. These formulae agree with experiment within the experimental uncertainty. We cannot decide whether a more complicated formula would give a better fit...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the low‐voltage arc mode of the hot‐cathode discharge {{has been carried out}} in a diode utilizing planar electrode geometry. The investigation consisted predominantly of Langmuir‐probe measurements of the discharge in a neon atmosphere. Measurements were also obtained in argon, xenon, and hydrogen and hydrogen‐neon and argon‐neon mixtures. The probes were of planar, guard‐ringed geometry. The volt‐ampere characteristic of the hot‐cathode discharge in the Torr range of gas pressure was investigated to further define the low‐voltage arc. For ample electron emission at the cathode there are two stable high‐current, low‐voltage discharge modes that occur in the noble gases; these are termed the low‐voltage arc and the ball‐of‐fire modes of the hot‐cathode discharge. No low‐voltage discharge modes were obtained in hydrogen. The steady‐state characteristics obtained for the low‐voltage arc indicated peak plasma potentials of approximately 14, 6, and 4. 5 V for neon, argon, and xenon, respectively, considerably lower than the first excitation level of the respective gases. There is a minimum value of the product of pressure and electrode spacing for the existence of the low‐voltage arc; this condition also yields a minimum value of discharge voltage. The discharge voltage and peak electron densities increase with increasing pressure‐ spacing product, while the peak plasma potential decreases gradually. Measurements on the discharge in neon atmospheres containing small admixtures of hydrogen indicated that <b>cumulative</b> <b>ionization</b> is important for the generation of the low‐voltage arc. It was not possible to detect in the measurements on pure noble gas experimental atmospheres any effects due to the presence of impurities. The study of the Penning impurity effect in the low‐voltage arc was limited, but showed that mixtures of less than 0. 06 % argon in neon do affect the discharge...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{constitutes}} {{a study of}} the current limitation phenomenon of a low pressure arc discharge in mercury vapour. A new theory is presented which provides a theoretical relation between the D. C. current limit, I L and the independent discharge parameters of gas density p and tube radius r 0. This theory is {{based on the fact that}} arc existence is impossible for values of the lumped parameter (pr) less than a critical value. If at I = 0, p = p 0, where p 0 is such that (p 0 r 0) is above the critical value, then by increasing the current to a sufficiently high level (i. e. to I = I L) such a degree of neutral rarefaction is brought about (due to the high level of ionization) that the local p is lowered to the point where (pr) is equal to the critical value. Similarly a lower current limit is found, for as I is decreased, the wall sheath grows, effectively reducing r to such a point that (pr) reaches the critical value. Arc existence is only possible between these two limits. The upper and lower limit converge at a certain finite pressure, and below this, no arc existence is possible whatsoever. Proper experimental testing of such a theory, derived from fundamental relations, requires very careful control of the physical variables, especially local neutral density. Accordingly a special discharge tube, 5 metres in length, was constructed and the experimental results obtained therefrom were found to be in excellent agreement with the new theory. Theoretical predictions of the radial variation of neutral density for all values of I, were confirmed by experimental measurements of density using the absorption of resonance radiation. The case of constricted positive column geometry is considered, where a double sheath is formed at the diameter change. It is argued that if the double sheath is followed by a long uniform column, then the current limit I L, will be that of the smaller diameter tube, even though severe neutral depletion occurs near the double sheath. Experimental evidence is presented in confirmation of this prediction. Other aspects of the current limit theory are confirmed by Langmuir probe measurements and by heavy particle wall flux measurements using ionization gauges. These latter measurements also shed further light on the unresolved phenomenon of current-sustained pressure effects in the positive column. In the positive column at high currents, the neutral velocity distribution is found to be no longer Maxwellian (due to selective ionization of fast particles and of those with long flight paths) which leads to the unusual case of a non-Gaussian radiation absorption profile, although the only broadening influence is that due to the Doppler effect. The resultant profiles are computed and experimental results are presented which substantiate the calculations. The possibility of Hg sputtering by Hg ion bombardment of liquid Hg surfaces on the positive column walls is considered and a possible application to Hg valve technology is suggested. Measurements of metastable particle densities are presented and related calculations indicate the role of <b>cumulative</b> <b>ionization</b> in low pressure discharges. The Bohm sheath criterion for ions is generalized to include a number of complications, including that of oblique ion motion relative to the sheath edge. The plasma-sheath boundary is found to be mathematically equivalent to the Mach surface of fluid flow. </p...|$|E
