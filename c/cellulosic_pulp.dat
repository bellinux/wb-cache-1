40|$|ABSTRACT: Brazil {{continues}} to use wood {{as the principal}} raw material source for the pulp industry; although, non-wood fibers have been revealed to be a competent substitute to produce paper with different and exceptional properties. Keeping this in focus, this study aimed to assess potential of Schoenoplectus californicus fibers (C. A. Mey.) Soják, commonly identified as bulrush or reed, in <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> generation, as an alternative fiber source for the pulp and paper industry. On analyzing the chemical composition of reed fibers, extractives of lignin, carbohydrates, uronic acids and minerals were reported. Physico-chemical characteristics of reed-based <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> were estimated including viscosity, hexenuronic acids, etc., as well as anatomical features of length, width, etc. From the chemical analyses of the reed the presence of high concentrations of extractives and silica was clear, making them unfit as raw material for <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> production. Pulp kraft pulping process produced brown pulps low in viscosity (34. 5 m Pa. s) and hexenuronic acid content. Reed is thus classifiable as short-fiber source for pulp and paper industries...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} organosolv pulping {{of sugar}} maple bark was performed adopting {{the concept of}} forest biorefinery in order to transform bark into several valuable products. Our organosolv process, consisting of pre-extracting the lignocellulosic material followed by pulping with ferric chloride as a catalyst, was applied to sugar maple bark. The pre-extraction step has yielded a mixture of phenolic extractives, applicable as antioxidants. The organosolv pulping of extractives-free sugar maple bark yielded a solid <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> (42. 3 %) and a black liquor containing solubilized bark lignin (24. 1 %) and products of sugars transformation (22. 9 % of hemicelluloses), mainly represented by furfural (0. 35 %) and 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF, 0. 74 %). The bark <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> {{was determined to be}} mainly constituted of glucose, with a high residual lignin content, probably related to the protein content of the original bark (containing cambium tissue). The biorefinery approach to the transformation of a solid bark residue into valuable biopolymers (lignin and cellulose) along with phenolic antioxidants from pre-extraction and the HMF derivatives from black liquor (applicable for 2, 5 -diformylfuran production) {{is an example of a}} catalytic process reposing on sustainable engineering and green chemistry concepts...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> was {{analysed}} {{after two}} {{and five years}} of natural ageing in two different burial environments - lake water and peat soil - in order to investigate the chemical and structural changes undergone by the material. This {{research is part of}} a monitoring program developed in the archaeological site of Biskupin, whose final aim is to estimate the best re-burial conditions for an in situ conservation of archaeological wood. We applied SEM, FT-IR, XRD and Py-GC/MS with thermally assisted silylation using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) to obtain broad information on <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> degradation. SEM provided information on the structural changes undergone by the fibres and on the microbial activity. FT-IR highlighted a depletion of the carbohydrates in the most degraded samples. Py(HMDS) -GC/MS confirmed these observations and provided detailed molecular information on cellulose alteration. The crystallinity index (CI) of cellulose was estimated by XRD, showing that the degradation began in amorphous regions. The correlation between the CI and the relative abundance of anhydrosugars detected by Py(HMDS) -GC/MS demonstrated that pyrolytic reactions are also influenced by the degree of crystallinity of cellulose. A mechanism of cellulose degradation in these natural environments was formulated: the degradation of cellulose in these natural environments proceeds through a depolymerisation step, initially involving the amorphous regions of cellulose, until the size of oligomers becomes sufficiently small to allow metabolisation by microorganisms or solubilisation by water. Secondly, a loss of carbohydrates was detected after five years of ageing and the loss reached 25...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} is the {{production}} of dissolving pulps from sugarcane bagasse, for cellulose derivatives production. The pulps were produced by soda delignification process, with or without anthraquinone, of sugarcane bagasse pretreated by steam explosion. The soda-anthraquinone process showed to be more advantageous, with 32. 17 % less cellulose degradation than for soda pulping. The best pulp yield was reached at lower temperatures, where the process provides {{a reduction in the}} recalcitrance of lignocellulosic material with a solubilization of lignin fragments of low molecular weight without high cellulose degradation. A future goal is to use these <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulps</b> as precursors in cellulosic derivatives...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, the esparto’s limbs, in the {{manufacturing}} process of the <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulps,</b> are delignified according to the process chlorinates – alkaline which alternate the action of caustic’s soda and chlorine; {{the reason is that}} these sheets cannot be free from the silica which they contain that only in strongly alkaline medium. In spite of the relative simplicity of implementation of this process, it does not remain free from grievance about it: low yield, an excessive consumption of bleaching agents (5, 4 % of total chlorine) for a whiteness not exceeding 80 points, a signifi-cant time of pulping (3, 5 h), the pulp’s quality is low, difficulties of regenerating the chemical agents, which generates the pollu-tion of the environment, due to the rejections of the effluents in nature. The study that we present constitutes a contribution in the search of the pulping process likely to replace that current. To this end, we chose the process with the neutral sulphite (NSSC pulping) for its simplicity of application, the yield {{and the quality of the}} pulp obtained in the treatment of wood. Following the conclusive preliminary tests that we carried out, the pulping parameters were selected of such kind, which the pulp have of the kappa number ranging between 20 – 30, i. e., of the pulp easy to bleach, intended for the manufacture of papers for impression and writing. Mechanical tests carried out on hand sheets supplement the study on the research of the optimization of <b>pulping</b> process.

This is the first application of CZE {{for the detection of}} EA in industrial streams from <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> production. The EA determinations in wood extractives and in pulp filtrates were succeeded only after sample acidification. This new CZE analytical procedure allowed reliable determinations of EA in E. globulus wood (1. 1 +/- A 0. 6 g kg(- 1) of dry wood) and in the filtrates from unbleached kraft pulp (98 +/- A 0. 7 mg L- 1).

40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} with {{chemically modified}} tips {{was used to}} evaluate the inter fiber bonding properties of typical wood pulp fibers. Using –OH functionalized AFM tips as a model of <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> fiber surfaces, pull-off forces and work of adhesion were measured in aqueous media. Three distinct tip-surface interactions were identified from force-displacement curves, representing three typical surface conditions of wet pulp fiber surfaces: solid, swollen and micro-fibrillated. The work of adhesion calculated shows that van der Waals forces are the major contributing factor on non-swollen solid regions of fiber surfaces. The difference in inter-molecular bond strength of different pulp fibers is relatively small. The inter-fiber bonding properties of pulp fibers are mainly controlled by the surface deformability, which determines the area of molecular contact at fiber-fiber physical interaction points. </span...|$|E
40|$|Furans {{are high}} {{value-added}} biomass-derived chemicals {{that can be}} used to replace petrochemicals. In this study, sulfated solid acid catalysts were prepared by precipitation and impregnation and were used for the conversion of a <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> sheet into furans. The physicochemical properties of the prepared sulfated solid acid with different calcination temperatures and different mol ratios of Ti-Al were characterized using XRD, elemental analysis, TG, and NH 3 -TPD. Furthermore, the effects of various processing parameters such as temperature, time, and catalyst dosage on the reaction performance were studied. The combined yield of 5 -hydroxymethyl-furfural and furfural reached 8. 9 % and 4. 5 % of pulp sheet mass with a 5 % dosage of SO 42 -/TiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 catalyst at 220 oC for 30 min.

40|$|The {{effect of}} high {{pressure}} (HP) pre-treatments on the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose from bleached kraft Eucalyptus globulus pulp by cellulase from Tricoderma viride was evaluated. Pressure pre-treatments of 300 and 400 MPa during 5 – 45 min, lead to both an increased rate {{and degree of}} hydrolysis, reaching values ranging from 1. 5 - to 1. 9 -fold, quantified by the formation of reducing sugars. Both the pressure and time under pressure influenced the enzymatic hydrosability of the <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulps,</b> with the former being more important. The {{results indicate that the}} pressure pre-treatments promoted an increased accessibility of cellulose towards cellulase in the cell wall. The results obtained open promising possibilities, to contribute to overcome conventional limitations of enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis for the production of fermentable glucose, for the production of second generation bioethanol and chemicals by enhancement of both rate and yield of hydrolysis. The results are also of interest for the preparation of “pressure engineered” celullose with incremented tailored hydrolysis patterns...|$|R

Acid and alkali pulping were investigated by using nitric acid and caustic soda on a laboratory scale, with the purpose of producing printing or writing grade pulp. The chemical composition of fiber strands from palmyra palm fruits were examined, such as holocellulose, cellulose, pentosan, lignin and extractives. The yields of acid and soda pulps were below 40 %. The main physical and mechanical properties of hand sheets produced from acid and soda processes were evaluated on 80 g/m 2 test sheets as functions of the following parameters: tensile index, tear index, and brightness. The mechanical properties of soda pulps were developed by twin-roll press while it was not necessary to fibrillate acidic pulps through the beating step. The soda pulp sheets presented a lower brightness than that of acidic pulp sheets. The mechanicaland physical properties of the acidic and alkaline pulps verified that they were of an acceptable quality for papermaking...|$|R
40|$|Research {{work on the}} {{suitability}} of poplar wood from different clones (Muhle-Larsen, Androscoggin, Scott Pauley and Oxford), different sites and ages as a raw material for wood-based panels and paper pulps led to the following results: UF- and PF-particleboards prepared from differnt 5 -jear-old clones exhibit slight differences in their elasto-mechanical behaviour. The influence of clone site is by {{far more important than}} that of the clone age. Bark content up to 15 per cent has no negative influence on the elasto-mechanical properties of UF-bonded boards. PF-bonded boards are more sensitive to bark than UF-boards. <b>Cellulosic</b> <b>pulps</b> were prepared using the neutral sulphite semichemical (NSSC) and the sulphate pulping methods. NSSC-pulps from poplar wood are in general of higher mechanical properties compared to beech NSSC-pulps. Bark up to 15 per cent can be tolerated in NSSC-pulps as far as the mechanical properties are concerned. Mechanical properties of sulphate pulps depend on clone and the pulping conditions used.

40|$|AbstractThe role of {{anthraquinone}} (AQ) greatly {{depends on}} the nature of the <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> during alkali refining. AQ acts in two ways; firstly penetration within the molecular chains separating them further apart leading to their decrystallisation; secondly stabilization of the polysaccharide chains. Cotton linter is known by its long macromolecular crystalline chains. The cold refining helps the swelling cotton linter and the penetration of AQ leads to decrystallisation of linter even at low AQ concentration (namely 0. 025 %). In comparison with paper Kraft pulp AQ does not reflect a considerable change on its characteristics, except on hot refining using higher AQ concentration (namely 0. 2 %). This is due to the nature opening structure of the paper Kraft pulp in addition to the hemicellulose content which preferentially stabilized by AQ giving a reasonable increase in the pentosan content. This is associated by improving in the reactivity towards xanthation...|$|E

40|$|A {{range of}} MgO and SiO 2 blends mixed with water are {{analyzed}} to develop clinker-free fiber-cement products reinforced with cellulosic fibers. The target {{is the development}} of a binder which is not chemically aggressive to the fibers, but which develops high mechanical strength Mechanical performance of the materials developed is not only influenced by magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H) gel content, but is more related to the void content within the paste due to unreacted water, meaning that the gel-space ratio concept is valuable in describing the compressive strengths of these materials. A higher MgO content in the mix formulation leads to M-S-H gels with increased Mg/Si ratio. The Mg/Si ratio also increases over time for each mix, indicated by changes in the gel structure as reaction is not yet complete after 28 days. SEM shows a heterogeneous microstructure which also has regions of high Si content. The 60 wt%MgO- 40 wt%SiO 2 system is chosen as the optimal formulation since it is the least alkaline binder with high mechanical strength.

About 50 – 80 % of the xylan and up to 50 % of the lignin in unbleached birch Kraft pulp was extracted by the HWE without losses in cellulose yield. The residual xylan content in the extracted pulps was predominantly too high for dissolving-grade applications, {{but some of the}} pulps with a xylan content of 5 – 7 % might still be suitable as rayon-grade pulps.

Further, a partial least squares (PLS) model was developed to assist {{the determination of the}} characteristic UVRR bands of different lignin structures. The UVRRS-PLS method was further applied to interpret the more complex lignin spectra. The results correlated well with the results obtained by Py-GC/FID for the quantification of guaiacyl and syringyl lignin structures and with results obtained by NMR spectroscopy for the quantification of condensed lignin structures in guaiacyl-type lignin. Chromophoric lignin structures were studied by exciting pulp samples in the visible range. The overwhelming fluorescence emission was suppressed by applying a carbon disulfide (CS 2) based Kerr gate technique. The fluorescence rejection ratio was estimated to be as high as 250. Chromophores in chlorine dioxide and peroxide bleached pulps were of different nature, as indicated by the different correlations with brightness and kappa number. Residual lignin and hexenuronic acids in the unbleached and bleached chemical pulps were quantified with PLS calibration and with direct band height ratios. PLS calibration gave relatively good predictions, while the direct band height ratio was more a straightforward method. The band height ratio method is not, however, applicable to unbleached pulps with lignin contents of about 5 % because in these pulps the cellulose bands are indiscernible and cannot be used as a reference band. Carbonyl groups in <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulps</b> were studied by the UVRRS and by the CCOA (carbazole- 9 -carbonyloxyamine) method, which showed that part of the carbonyls exist in hydrate, hemiacetal and/or hemiketal forms.

It is evident that there is a complexation or aggregation of soluble and colloidal carbohydrates with the polysaccharide molecules that are then adsorbed on fines and:or retained on cellulosic fibers upon addition of the polysaccharides at very low dosages corresponding to those used in industrial practice.

40|$|Organosolv {{fractionation}} {{allows the}} separation of lignocellulosic biomass in its three major components; sugars from hemicelluloses, <b>cellulosic</b> fibres (<b>pulp),</b> and solid, low molecular weight, lignin. The kinetics of fractionation of wheat straw in aqueous ethanol was studied and a new generalised kinetic model was proposed to simulate the experimental results. This model was applied to correlate the kinetic results for non-isothermal experimental conditions, incorporating the effects of reaction time, temperature and acid concentration. Using the proposed model, optimal fractionation time, {{in terms of the}} quality of the resulting cellulose fraction, can be calculated for the conditions of a given experiment. As an example, for isothermal reaction conditions at 140 degreesC and catalyst concentration equal to 0. 2 N H 2 SO 4, Minimum lignin content (2 % w/w on the resulting pulp) would be obtained for 52 min reaction time. At these conditions, pulp yield 42 % (w/w on dry straw), maximum solubilized lignin 96 % (w/w on original lignin), and soluble total sugars 27 % (w/w on the original straw polysaccharides) would be obtained.

Viscous flow, sliding velocity sweep and transient friction tests were carried out and resulting wear scars in the steel plates were evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Different frictional responses were found depending on the thickener, especially at high temperature. Excepting for most severe conditions, wear is negligible when using chemically modified chitin and methylcellulose-based greases as lubricants.

40|$|Organosolv pulping is {{the clean}} {{chemical}} process of using organic solvents {{to aid in}} the removal of lignin and hemicellulose from lignocellulosic raw materials. This method provides facility for solvent recovery {{at the end of the}} process. In this work, it was to produce bamboo <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulp</b> by the organosolv process evaluating different temperatures and reaction times, and the pulps were analyzed aiming their future application in the reinforcement of composites. The production of bamboo pulp by the organosolv process was studied varying the cooking conditions at 1, 2 and 3 h and 150, 170 and 190 oC of temperature, in order to achieve the ideal conditions of yield, chemical and morphological characteristics of the pulp for its potential application in the reinforcement of composites. The best results for delignification (kappa number of 38), with relatively lower fiber degradation (viscosity of 625 cm 3 g- 1), aspect ratio of 40. 4 and the index zero-span of 204 Nm g- 1, were achieved for the pulping process at 190 oC for 2 h. These pulping conditions can be considered as the more appropriate in the range of time intervals evaluated in this work. The higher mechanical strength and the lower incidence of morphological defects in the fiber (6. 0 % of curls and 10. 6 % of kinks) can demonstrate the potential of organosolv bamboo pulp as a reinforcing element...|$|E
40|$|A indústria da pasta e do papel tem um importante peso na indústria portuguesa, contribuindo com 4, 5 % do PIB industrial. Antevendo alterações no cenário produtivo da indústria da pasta celulósica, a investigação científica tem desenvolvido trabalhos na área dos produtos alternativos ao papel de valor acrescentado, como a pasta solúvel e celulose micro-fibrilada (CMF), cuja produção pressupõe a eliminação das hemiceluloses mais abundantes da pasta (xilanas). Sendo o E. globulus a espécie de madeira mais usada no processamento da pasta celulósica kraft nacional, há um crescente interesse no desenvolvimento desses produtos a partir da pasta celulósica kraft branca dessa espécie. Nesse âmbito, o isolamento, a caracterização química e estrutural das xilanas, presentes na pasta branca, revelam-se muito importantes para o seu processamento {{posterior}} visando igualmente produtos de valor acrescentado. Sendo assim, este trabalho teve dois objetivos principais: 1. º) avaliação do perfil de extração alcalina das xilanas da pasta branca kraft do E. globulus com solução de hidróxido de sódio; 2. º) caracterização química e estrutural das xilanas isoladas. Foi determinado o teor de pentosanas removido e os parâmetros correspondentes que resultaram numa melhor relação entre a taxa máxima de remoção e o rendimento de xilana: extração com solução de NaOH 10 % durante 1 hora. No entanto, dependendo do processamento posterior das xilanas e para dar resposta ao interesse industrial, foi igualmente estudado o tempo da extração alcalina com NaOH a 5 %, concentração que resultou no teor de pentosanas removido em cerca de 70 % do máximo encontrado com NaOH 10 %. As xilanas extraídas com diferentes tempos de extração e com hidróxido de sódio de concentração 5 % e 10 % foram caracterizadas quimicamente e estruturalmente através de análise de açúcares neutros e por metanólise ácida, RMN 1 D e 2 D e os pesos moleculares determinados através de SEC. A pureza das xilanas extraídas foi avaliada através da análise dos monossacarídeos neutros que demonstraram teores de xilose compreendidos entre 93, 5 % e 99, 6 %. Nas xilanas resultantes da extração com NaOH 10 %, os teores de glucose apresentaram-se entre 2. 3 % e 6. 5 %. O elevado grau de pureza de todas as amostras de xilanas isoladas e a previsível co-precipitação da β- e γ-celulose na extração com NaOH 10 % foram confirmados através de metanólise ácida. Através de RMN de 1 H foi possível observar, em todas as amostras de xilanas da pasta branca kraft, os sinais normalmente correspondentes às ressonâncias dos protões anoméricos das unidades urónicas (MeGlcA e MeGlcA- 2 Gal) e da cadeia polimérica principal da xilana, concluindo-se a concordância da suaestrutura face às condições extractivas. As estruturas de xilanas foram confirmadas através de RMN de 13 C e técnicas RMN bidimensionais. Através de SEC, as amostras extraídas com NaOH 10 % apresentaram um peso molecular ligeiramente superior às amostras extraídas com NaOH 5 %. Foi também demonstrada a tendência para o seu aumento até às 2 horas de extração, tempo a partir do qual aumenta o risco de degradação e conversão em derivados com menor peso molecular. Em conclusão, este trabalho permitiu, por um lado, optimizar o perfil de extração alcalina e, por outro, dar um contributo para o conhecimento das características estruturais das xilanas da pasta branca kraft do E. globulus, informação importante per se e fundamental para a I&D do seu processamento posterior, trabalhos associados já a decorrer e futuros. The {{paper and}} pulping industry {{have an important}} contribution to the Portuguese industry, representing 4, 5 % of the industrial GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Anticipating changes in the productive scenario of the <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulping</b> industry, research has been developing studies on alternative products to the value added products, as soluble pulp and microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), which production presumes the elimination of the more abundant hemicelluloses in the pulp (xylans). As the E. globulus is the most used specie in the national processing of <b>cellulosic</b> kraft <b>pulp,</b> there is an increasing interest in the developing of those products from the bleached <b>cellulosic</b> kraft <b>pulp</b> of this specie. Therefore, the isolation, the chemical and the structural characterisation of the xylans present in the bleached pulp are very important for its afterwards processing, having as scope value added products. This work had two main goals: 1. st) evaluation of the alkaline extraction profile of the xylans present in the kraft bleached pulp of the E. globulus with sodium hydroxide solution; 2. nd) chemical and structural characterisation of the isolated xylans. It had been determined the pentosans pulp content and the parameters which showed a better correlation between the maximum solubility value and the xylans extraction yield: extraction with a 10 % NaOH solution for one hour. However, depending on the afterwards processing of the xylans, and to respond to the industrial interest on the subject, it had also been studied the kinetics of the alkaline extraction with a 5 % solution of NaOH, which removed a pentosans content of around 70 % of the maximum obtained with a 10 % NaOH solution. The xylans extracted with different extraction times, and 5 % and 10 % of sodium hydroxide solutions, were chemically and structurally characterised using neutral sugars analysis and acid methanolysis, NMR 1 D and 2 D, and its molecular weights were determined using SEC. The xylans purity was evaluated by the neutral viiionosaccharides analysis, which showed xylans contents between 93, 5 % and 96. 6 %. The xylans extracted with NaOH 10 % solution presented glucose contents in the range 93, 5 % - 99, 6 %. The high purity level of all isolated xylans samples, and the expected co-precipitation of the β- e γ-cellulose in the extraction with NaOH 10 % solution, were confirmed with acid methanolysis. The 1 H NMR of all xylans extracted from the bleached kraft pulp showed the signals usually corresponding to the resonance of the anomeric protons of the uronic units (MeGlcA and MeGlc- 2 Gal), and of the main polymeric chain of the xylans, which showed the independence of the structure from the extraction conditions. The xylans structures were confirmed by 13 C NMR and bidimensional NMR analyses. SEC results showed that the xylans extracted with NaOH 10 % solution have a molecular weight slightly higher than the samples extracted with NaOH 5 %. It had also been showed that the xylans molecular weight tends to increase until two hours of extraction time reaction. After two hours, it started increasing the risk of degradation and conversion into lower molecular weight compounds. In conclusion, this work not only allowed to optimise the alkaline extraction profile, but also gave a contribution to the knowledge of the structural characteristics of the xylans of the bleached kraft pulp from the E. globulus. This information is important per se and essential for the R&D of the afterwards processing of the pulp, ongoing and future works.

40|$|Wood, {{composed}} of cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses, {{is the main}} raw material used to produce cellulosic fibres. Mills producing cellulosic fibres, also called kraft mills, look {{very much like a}} “biorefinery ” plant: isolated cellulose is almost pure, and then exploited today mainly as paper; hemicelluloses and lignin are degraded and solubilised during the process as a very complex mixture, called “black liquor”, which is burnt in a recovery boiler. The heat thus produced covers largely the energy needs of the kraft mill, which may then become a net producer of electricity. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present two examples of research pathways aiming at enlarging the products portfolio a pulp mill could offer. The first example deals with the definition of hemicelluloses extraction from softwood, prior to its transformation into <b>cellulosic</b> paper <b>pulp</b> by the kraft process. The hemicelluloses fraction (in the case of softwood species, mainly {{composed of}} C 6 sugars) should be extracted in a relatively pure form, whereas the cellulose fraction would continue to be obtained as fibres for papermaking. Thus, lignin becomes the main component of the “black liquor ” and might continue to be used as fuel for the energy needs of the mill. The extracted hemicelluloses are hydrolysed into hexoses and then fermented into bio-ethanol. This type of second generation bio-ethanol should eventually substitute the first bio-ethanol generation produced today from food raw materials. In the study, softwood chips were submitted to various hydrolysis treatments. Temperature, time and pH wer...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of energy and chemicals from renewable resources has gained significant attention {{as a means to}} support the transition from fossil fuels towards clean and sustainable technologies. Due to its availability and rich carbohydrate composition, lignocellulosic biomass represents a valuable starting material and requires primary processes to unlock its components. The main focus of this research was to study and develop further knowledge on the primary steps of conversion of lignocellulosic materials, i. e. biomass fractionation, cellulose/ hemicellulose hydrolysis, and the {{production of}} furanic compounds (furfural, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural) and levulinic acid. In an initial stage, the fractionation of Miscanthus giganteus and sugarcane bagasse was investigated using hydrogen peroxide in formic acid solutions. This treatment removed more than 70 % of the lignin in the feedstocks after 13 h at room temperature and after 15 min at temperatures over 150 oC. The use of hydrogen peroxide in formic acid under transient temperature facilitated the separation of > 90 % of the lignin and 80 - 98 % of hemicellulose sugars, resulting in nearly pure <b>cellulosic</b> <b>pulps.</b> Likewise, lignin was recovered from the liquor and presented aromaticity properties proper of Organosolv lignins. The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to levulinic acid and furfural via acid hydrolysis was undertaken using sulphuric acid as catalyst. Biomass feedstocks, including agricultural, municipal wastes (paper) and rotational crops from Brazil and Ireland, led to levulinic acid yields between 150 and 400 kg/ton dry biomass. Additionally, the kinetics of acid hydrolysis of Miscanthus to produce levulinic acid and furfural were studied at mild temperatures (150 - 200 oC) and high acid concentrations (0. 10 - 0. 53 M H 2 SO 4). A two-stage process was found to maximise furfural (27. 3 mol%) in a first reactor operated at 185 oC with 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4. A second stage leads to levulinic acid yields between 58 - 72 mol% at temperatures of 160 - 200 oC. A kinetic modelling study of the dehydration reactions of xylose, arabinose and glucose was carried out using formic acid as catalyst. Experimental data was obtained from the conversion of xylose, arabinose, glucose and furfural at 130 - 170 oC and high formic acid concentrations (10 - 64 wt%). High temperatures (> 160 oC) favoured the formation of furfural (62 - 68 mol%) from xylose and arabinose; however, fundamental di erences in the reaction mechanisms followed by the pentoses were found. Formic acid was not an effective catalyst of the conversion of glucose at temperatures under 150 oC. Temperatures above 200 oC favoured the formation of 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (20 mol%), while levulinic acid was maximised (40 mol%) at milder temperatures (170 - 200 oC). Experimental evidence was obtained in relation to the side reactions affecting the conversion of xylose in liquors from the fractionation of Miscanthus. The conversion of xylose, arabinose, and glucose and the formation of 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural and levulinic acid in the liquors were described satisfactorily by the kinetic models. However, when lignin was not separated prior to the reaction, the furfural concentrations observed were significantly 40 % lower than those predicted by the models. By inducing the lignin separation from the liquor, no losses in the selectivity of furfural were observed. The effect of lignin model compounds and polymeric soluble lignin on the selectivities of the dehydration of xylose and glucose was investigated at 150 and 170 oC and acid concentrations of 60 - 62 wt% HCOOH. The results con rmed that the oligomeric soluble lignin led to detrimental effects on the selectivity of the furfural formation from xylose...|$|R
