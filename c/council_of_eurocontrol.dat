40|$|The European Organization for the Safety <b>of</b> Air Navigation (<b>Eurocontrol)</b> {{was created}} in 1960 for the {{centralization}} and harmonization of air traffic control, to meet the new requirements of increasing air traffic. The primary functions <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol</b> were modified because of the reluctance of several European member States to transfer their control on ATC. But air traffic was still increasing and is deemed to increase until the next century. The problem remains unsolved. Today, a new political trend in favor <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol</b> is emerging. This trend is shared {{by most of the}} European States as well as other organizations as the European Community and the European Civil Aviation Conference. The main legal aspects <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol</b> are analysed in this thesis, as well as its cooperation with other organizations involved. Eventually, the future <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol</b> is analyzed with respect to future air navigation systems (FANS) based on satellite technology...|$|R

40|$|Leading {{decision}} makers, {{academics and}} experts including Frank Brenner, Director <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol,</b> and Matthew Baldwin, Director for Air Aviation and International Transport Policy in DG MOVE, {{gathered at the}} 5 th Florence Air Forum to discuss “the market approach” in Air traffic Control (ATC) and the evolving role <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol.</b> Both issues are closely related: Eurocontrol supports the introduction of market elements for certain ATC support services {{in order to increase}} efficiency in the Single European Sky without conflicting with its Member States’ interest to maintain a national Air Traffic Control system. This in turn will contribute to further evolving the role <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol</b> and reshaping the current structure of ATC in Europe. One part of the discussion focussed on where and how market elements can play a role in air traffic management whereas the other part looked at what governance structure would be appropriate and which actors could take over which functions in the future...|$|R

50|$|Although Eurocontrol is not {{an agency}} of the European Union, the EU has {{delegated}} parts of its Single European Sky regulations to Eurocontrol, making it the central organization for coordination and planning of air traffic control for all of Europe. The EU itself is a signatory <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol</b> and all EU member states are presently also members <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol.</b> The organization works with national authorities, air navigation service providers, civil and military airspace users, airports, and other organisations. Its activities involve all gate-to-gate air navigation service operations: strategic and tactical flow management, controller training, regional control of airspace, safety-proofed technologies and procedures, and collection of air navigation charges.|$|R
50|$|A {{result is}} given {{directly}} after the test, or via a letter, e-mail or phone call. These results are computed {{by the central}} computer <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol</b> in Brussels (each candidate is connected with this computer via internet). The score required to proceed to {{the next round of}} selection differs from one air traffic control organisation to another. If a candidate has already successfully participated in a FEAST test, Eurocontrol offers a special certificate for trying it again elsewhere. Each company has a different opinion of whether an applicant is allowed to try the test again or not. According to the rules <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol,</b> unsuccessful applicants must wait 2 years before a second attempt.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, the FEAST test {{is seen to}} be a very fair test: if this test is taken {{directly}} at Eurocontrol, all travel expenses and costs of hotels are reimbursed, as far as the applicant's residence is out of an area of 50 km from the Maastricht upper area control centre. Everyone, especially those of poorer member-countries <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol,</b> has a fair and realistic chance. Excessively so, no specific knowledge of mathematics or physics are required. Psychological [...] "pre-selections" [...] do not exist either. Applicants from all member countries <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol</b> are encouraged to participate and since the systems of education of each of the member states are rather different, Eurocontrol sets the priority of the FEAST test on basic skills.

40|$|Under {{contract}} <b>of</b> <b>EUROCONTROL,</b> the German Aerospace Center (DLR), {{together with}} its partner institute the National Aerospace Laboratory of the Netherlands (NLR), carried out research {{activities on the}} selection and evaluation of candidate concepts for advanced operations under low visibility conditions making use of the surveillance function of Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems (A-SMGCS). These activities were carried out for the Airport Unit (AP) of the Centre of Expertise for Air Traffic Management (CoE/AT) <b>of</b> <b>EUROCONTROL.</b> As part <b>of</b> this research, two candidate concepts, Virtual Block Control and Separation Bubbles, have been evaluated in real-time cockpit simulator trials in the Generic Cockpit Simulator GECO of DLR in Braunschweig in May 2009. Virtual Blocks and Separation Bubbles are simple and low cost additions to the A-SMGCS surveillance function. They are aimed to increase airport throughput capacity in low visibility in a safe way. During the cockpit trials, pilots from major airlines taxied in the GECO within a simulated Rotterdam Airport environment. Aircraft were under control of a pseudo-controller applying Virtual Block Control with support of Separation Bubble Alerting. The main objective of the cockpit trials was {{to find out about}} the perception of the described procedures by pilots when taxiing under low visibility conditions. Different options for markings on the taxiways that are meant to support pilots in identifying the positions of virtual holding points were also investigated. The trials revealed that the concepts work down to the lowest visibility at which taxiing is possible at all. Pilots favoured Virtual Block Control supported by Intermediate Holding Lights as markings for holding positions and supported by Separation Bubbles as the best solution...|$|R

50|$|The European Parliament at {{the time}} {{expressed}} concern about the lack of clear intergovernmental agreements to ensure common air traffic control services across the continent. In 1979, Eurocontrol signed a working cooperation agreement with the European Commission, attempting to create a synergy <b>of</b> <b>Eurocontrol’s</b> technical expertise and EU’s regulatory authorities. Several initiatives originating in this period become a lasting element of the organization, such as the Eurocontrol forecasting service, which became STATFOR, as well as the Aeronautical Information Service. By 1986, the pressures on the European ATC network was so big that a new, wider mandate was already being considered for <b>Eurocontrol,</b> with much <b>of</b> the initiative coming from ECAC’s Ministers of Transport. Subsequently, ECAC urged all of its member states to join Eurocontrol.|$|R
