The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>disorders,</b> including spasticity and seizures, and eye defects. Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.|$|E

2500|$|Prozac {{was one of}} {{the first}} therapies in its class to treat {{clinical}} depression by blocking the uptake of serotonin within the human brain. [...] It is prescribed to more than fifty-four million people worldwide. Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression. In 2001 Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for Prozac and in January 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lilly's final appeal, a decision that allows other companies to make generic versions of the drug. Prozac has given rise to a number of comparably functioning therapies for the treatment of clinical depression and other <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>disorders</b> such as obsessive compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, and panic disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Athetosis is {{characterized}} as a symptom that is present in many forms of <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>disorders</b> that affect the body movement coordination, such as cerebral palsy. [...] Children may struggle to engage in social communication, since the poor coordination of the tongue and mouth muscles can reduce their speech ability and hinder their social interaction to a greater degree. The caregivers of the affected children are encouraged to closely monitor their nutrition and growth and {{to provide them with}} hearing aids in order to relieve their symptoms as well as support their academic plans. A growing number of patients is shown to benefit from communication devices such as shorthand typing programs and computer speech devices, as well as simple picture boards.|$|E

5000|$|Decreased {{respiratory}} effort: <b>Central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> impairment {{leads to}} decreased respiratory effort. <b>Central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> <b>disorders</b> may cause hypoventilation, such as stroke and tumors.

2500|$|The {{development}} of {{nicotinic acetylcholine receptor}} agonists {{began in the early}} 1990s after the discovery of nicotine’s positive effects on animal memory. [...] The {{development of}} nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists {{has come a long way}} since then. [...] The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist are gaining increasing attention as drug candidates for multiple <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> <b>disorders</b> such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and nicotine addiction. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are receptors found in the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous systems and skeletal muscles. They are ligand-gated ion channels with binding sites for acetylcholine as well as other agonists. When agonists bind to a receptor it stabilizes the open state of the ion channel allowing influx of cations.|$|E
