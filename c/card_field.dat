To assist in using their position for navigation, HyperTalk also included a variety of ordinal and cardinal referencing systems to simplify the syntax further.

However, {{as is the case}} in most human languages, certain styles of addressing were more natural given the context of the surrounding text, and the programmer would often change styles to make the code more readable.|$|E

5000|$|A notable {{feature of}} the HyperTalk {{container}} model was its handling of text. Every collection of text, whether a literal string in a program or text typed into a text field, was itself considered a container with multiple collections of containers within it. This allowed scripts to parse text using the same navigational commands as any other container. For instance, while parsing a space-delimited data file, one might want to extract the third column, like this: put the third word of theFilesText into colThreeThis syntax allowed the script to [...] "walk" [...] down the text to find particular data, as in this example: put the first character of the third word of line 5 of <b>card</b> <b>field</b> [...] "sometext" [...] into theCharThis process of treating text as a container was known as [...] "chunking", and the functions as [...] "chunk expressions". These same sorts of expressions were used to handle file manipulation, along {{with a set of}} file management functions. The following code opens a known file, reads from it, extracts data, and then closes the file: on mouseDown answer file [...] "Please select a text file to open." [...] if it is empty then exit mouseDown put it into filePath if there is a file filePath then open file filePath read from file filePath until return put it into cd fld [...] "some field" [...] close file filePath set the textStyle of character 1 to 10 of <b>card</b> <b>field</b> [...] "some field" [...] to bold end if end mouseDownHyperTalk also included functions for chunking strings using a substring find operation using the [...] operator. The following code finds all examples of a given pattern using the [...] as part of the [...] loop, while [...] finds the location of that pattern within the string: function replaceStr pattern,newStr,inStr repeat while pattern is in inStr put offset(pattern,inStr) into pos put newStr into character pos to (pos +the length of pattern)-1 of inStr end repeat return inStr end replaceStr ...|$|E
5000|$|A key concept {{within the}} HyperTalk {{language}} {{was the way}} it referred to containers through a navigational system based on the visual hierarchy of the stack. Every container in the stack was given a unique ID number when it was created, and could also be given a name. Scripts could refer to objects by using either of these identifiers, along with an object type addressed using the [...] operator. The [...] operator used a natural language syntax that made for easily readable, self-documenting code. For instance, a script stored in a button on a card might wish to read the content of text field the user had typed into, in which case the field might be referred to in this fashion: put the value of <b>card</b> <b>field</b> [...] "typehere" [...] into theValueThis script is running {{in the context of a}} button on a card, so [...] "which card" [...] is [...] "the card the user is currently interacting with". In this case the code uses the [...] operator to assign the value of the text field into a new variable called [...]|$|E

40|$|Repayment decisions—how much of {{the loan}} to repay and when to make the payments—directly {{influence}} consumer debt levels. The authors examine how minimum required payment policy and loan information disclosed to consumers influence repayment decisions. They find that though presenting minimum required payment information has {{a negative impact on}} repayment decisions, increasing the minimum required level has a positive effect on repayment for most consumers. Experimental evidence from U. S. consumers shows that consumers’ propensity to pay the minimum required each month moderates these effects; U. K. credit <b>card</b> <b>field</b> data indicates that these effects are also moderated by borrowers’ credit limit and balance due. However, increasing the minimum level is unlikely to completely eliminate the negative effect of presenting minimum payment information. In addition, disclosing supplemental information, such as future interest cost and time needed to repay the loan, does not reduce the negative effects of including minimum payment information and has no substantial positive effect on repayments. This research offers new insights into the debt repayment process and has implications for consumers, lenders, and public policy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUntil 2009, Java Cards {{have been}} mainly {{threatened}} by Logical Attacks based on ill-formed applications. The {{publication of the}} Java Card 3. 0 Connected Edition specifications and their mandatory on-card byte code verification may have then lead {{to the end of}} software-based attacks against such platforms. However, the introduction in the Java <b>Card</b> <b>field</b> of Fault Attacks, well-known from the cryptologist community, has proven this conclusion wrong. Actually, the idea of combining Fault Attacks and Logical Attacks to tamper with Java Cards appears as an even more dangerous threat. Although the operand stack is a fundamental element of all Java Card Virtual Machines, the potential consequences of a physical perturbation of this element has never been studied so far. In this article, we explore this path by presenting both Fault Attacks and Combined Attacks taking advantage of an alteration of the operand stack. In addition, we provide experimental results proving the practical feasibility of these attacks and illustrating their efficiency. Finally, we describe different approaches to protect the operand stack's integrity and compare their cost with a particular interest on the time factor...|$|E

We argue that utile forms have significant social and political effects irrespective of the ‘truth value’ of the knowledge they contain.

We draw on examples of utile forms from British India and more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In the 1990 s a corporate Geochemistry Database was set up using ORACLE to encompass all geochemical data gathered throughout BGS for the UK landmass, including sample and site information. This required a standardisation of coding on <b>field</b> <b>cards</b> both within geochemical activities and {{in relation to the}} use of BGS codes, for example the description of rocks and minerals. In order to load all the data from the G-BASE <b>field</b> <b>cards</b> it is necessary to coordinate the process from completing the card on location; inputting data into the field database, and to the concluding process of loading the field data to the BGS corporate Geochemistry Database.

This report describes new and revised protocols to be used throughout the process of G-BASE field data gathering and to populating the Geochemistry Database. It details the codes that are to be used and the translations that are necessary to transfer from the G-BASE format to Geochemistry Database format. The history of the use of field forms and field databases in G-BASE is described.
