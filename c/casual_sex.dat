FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called to the scene; Mulder {{believes}} that the man's death {{was caused by a}} fatal dose of pheromones. There is also ambiguity in similar murders as to the sex of the killer. Evidence from the crime scene leads the duo to an Amish-like community in Steveston, Massachusetts, which Mulder calls the Kindred.|$|E
5|$|As {{the film}} opens a black Ferrari circles on a race {{track in the}} desert, its engine roaring {{in and out of}} the shot. When it {{eventually}} stops, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) steps out. Marco is a Hollywood actor who, despite his recent rise to fame, does not feel much meaning in his daily life. He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film: he is photographed with his co-star (Michelle Monaghan), gives interviews to the press, and attends an award ceremony in Italy. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy (Chris Pontius), a fellow actor and childhood friend, Marco spends much time alone, driving his Ferrari motorcar, drinking beer, taking pills, and having <b>casual</b> <b>sex</b> with various women. Twice he has pole-dancing twins (Kristina and Karissa Shannon) set up their equipment and perform in his room, the first time he falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic.|$|E
40|$|PIP: The aim of {{this study}} was to define {{epidemiologic}} and psychosocial characteristics of women with a history of <b>casual</b> travel <b>sex</b> abroad. The participants were 996 women seeking contraceptive advice, of whom 276 admitted that they had experienced <b>casual</b> travel <b>sex.</b> The remaining women served as a comparison group. In structured interviews, questions were asked about educational level, partnerships, reproductive history, contraceptive and drug use, smoking, and psychosocial factors such as wariness, success, and attractiveness. The women who had experienced <b>casual</b> travel <b>sex</b> were more often single, had more often experienced broken relationships, were more often smokers, and used alcohol or cannabis at a higher frequency. Their educational level was higher and a history of induced abortions was more common. The results of this study indicate that women with experience of <b>casual</b> travel <b>sex</b> not only take sexual risks but also take other risks that might represent a danger to their health...|$|R

40|$|In a {{study of}} 972 women, sexual {{characteristics}} of 66 women with a cervical human papillomavirus infection (CHPI) were compared to the remaining study population. Among a number of sexual variables that were significantly correlated with CHPI were number of lifetime sexual partners, short partnerships, many recent partners, infidelity, <b>casual</b> travel <b>sex,</b> sexual debut abroad, oral and anal sex, and sexual abuse. In multifactorial analyses four variables remained significantly correlated with CHPI, i. e., number of lifetime sexual partners, <b>casual</b> travel <b>sex,</b> sexual debut abroad, and infidelity.

5|$|Babe hires Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) {{to work as}} her kitchen's {{assistant}} after Abi confides in Babe {{about her}} jealousy towards her sister, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), which she felt she could relate to. Babe notices Abi's boyfriend, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), flirting with Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), so helps Abi to take revenge. Abi later reveals to a busy pub, including Ben and Paul, that she is pregnant, however it transpires Babe encouraged Abi to fake her pregnancy until she becomes pregnant. However, Ben suspects he has caught an STI from having <b>casual</b> <b>sex,</b> so Babe suggests that Abi has sex with a stranger and she has sex with Babe's relative, Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard), but does not become pregnant. Babe later discovers that Les Coker (Roger Sloman) is a crossdresser. During an argument between Ben and his father, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Babe pushes Abi into Ben and she falls so Babe rushes {{her out of the}} Vic, claiming to be taking her to the hospital. When they return, Abi tells her friends and family that she has miscarried. After Abi and Babe fall out, Babe writes a letter to Ben explaining the truth, and although it is intercepted by Ben's half-sister, Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper), Abi still inadvertently reveals the truth to Ben, ending their relationship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the journal}} Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago {{writes that the}} Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an {{obstacle}} to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, {{since the publication of}} the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of <b>casual</b> <b>sex</b> in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.|$|E

25|$|A 2006 {{systematic}} review (analyzing data from 59 countries worldwide) found no association between regional sexual behavior tendencies, such as {{number of sexual}} partners, and sexual-health status. Much more predictive of sexual-health status are socioeconomic factors like poverty and mobility. Other {{studies have suggested that}} people with multiple <b>casual</b> <b>sex</b> partners {{are more likely to be}} diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, a U.S. {{university}} {{study of}} international promiscuity found that Finns {{have had the}} largest number of sex partners in the industrialized world, and British people have the largest number among big western industrial nations. The study measured one-night stands, attitudes to <b>casual</b> <b>sex,</b> and number of sexual partners. A 2014 nationwide survey in the United Kingdom named Liverpool the country's most promiscuous city.|$|E
25|$|Promiscuity is the {{practice}} of having <b>casual</b> <b>sex</b> frequently with different partners or being indiscriminate {{in the choice of}} sexual partners. The term can carry a moral judgment if the social ideal for sexual activity is monogamous relationships. A common example of behavior viewed as promiscuous by many cultures is the one-night stand, and its frequency is used by researchers as a marker for promiscuity.|$|E

40|$|Casual sexual hook ups are {{becoming}} more prevalent among heterosexual adults than in previous years. Although this may indicate a loosening of traditional sexual scripts that center male pleasure and relegate women as sexual submissives within heterosexual interactions, {{men and women are}} always ‘doing gender’, therefore, are {{in a constant state of}} power negotiations. Existing sociological research on oral sex in heterosexual hook-ups focuses on college women and adolescents and does not explicitly interrogate the association of oral sex with power. Drawing on a sample of 386 women’s advertisements for <b>casual</b> hook-up <b>sex</b> on Craig’s list, this study finds language that clearly associates oral sex with power. Fellatio is mentioned more often than cunnilingus and is linked in the ads to women’s sexual submission and dominance. Cunnilingus, on the other hand, is linked only with women’s dominance. These findings support previous research that <b>casual</b> hook-up <b>sex</b> tends to emphasize men’s domination as well as sexual pleasure. I argue that men’s domination and women’s submission, in the context of heterosexual sex is a mechanism for the doing of gender...|$|R

25|$|For {{most of the}} series' run, Raj had {{not been}} {{involved}} in any lasting romantic relationship, mostly due to his inability to speak to women. However, he was much more successful in <b>casual</b> <b>sex</b> than the more sexually aggressive Howard. He once dated Lalita Gupta, a childhood friend, in an arrangement made by his parents.

25|$|Another line of Bailey's {{research}} has concerned {{the ways that}} homosexuals are sex-atypical (or gender nonconforming) compared with heterosexuals, {{as well as the}} ways that homosexuals are sex-typical and gender conforming. For example, he published a meta-analysis showing that on average, homosexual men and women recall being much more gender nonconforming children, compared with heterosexual children. In contrast, he also showed that for many traits related to mating (such as interest in <b>casual</b> <b>sex,</b> and emphasis on a partner's physical attractiveness), homosexuals appear to be similar to heterosexuals of their own sex. Recently, he has researched the gaydar phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{activity}} {{can be classified}} into the gender and sexual orientation of the participants, {{as well as by}} the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, intimate partners, <b>casual</b> <b>sex</b> partners or anonymous. Sexual {{activity can}} be regarded as conventional or as alternative, involving, for example, fetishism, paraphilia, or BDSM activities. Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, armpits or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include erotic asphyxiation and self-bondage. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes (choking and bondage, respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.|$|E

25|$|Females {{were more}} likely than males to be monogamous. One third or more of the lesbians were monogamous, while the rest fell into the other categories. There were even larger {{differences}} between males and females in sexual behavior. Nearly half of the males had over 500 different sexual partners in a lifetime, another third had between 100 and 500, and over 90 per cent had at least 25 (black gay men were on average slightly less promiscuous than white gay men). Much sex between men took place between strangers, met in baths or bars. 25 per cent of white gay men at some time had sex with boys who were sixteen or younger, after they themselves reached the age of 21. Most lesbians, however, had fewer than 10 same-sex partners over a lifetime, and very few cruised or looked for <b>casual</b> <b>sex.</b> Little lesbian sex took place between strangers. Women's sexual behavior showed a relatively greater level of heterosexual activity and a relatively lower level of homosexual activity compared to that of men.|$|E
