50|$|The {{dividing}} line between near and mid peripheral vision at 30° radius is based on several features of visual performance. Visual acuity declines by about 50% every 2.5° from the center up to 30°, at which point visual acuity declines more steeply. Color perception is strong at 20° but weak at 40°. 30° is thus taken as the {{dividing line}} between adequate and poor color perception. In dark-adapted vision, light sensitivity corresponds to rod density, which peaks just at 18°. From 18° towards the <b>center,</b> <b>rod</b> density declines rapidly. From 18° away from the <b>center,</b> <b>rod</b> density declines more gradually, in a curve with distinct inflection points resulting in two humps. The {{outer edge of the}} second hump is at about 30°, and corresponds to the outer edge of good night vision.|$|R

50|$|This {{excitatory}} signal, however, {{will only}} be transmitted by the rod cells {{in the center of}} the Ganglion cell receptive field to ganglion cells because horizontal cells respond by sending an inhibitory signal to the neighboring rods to create a balance that allows mammals to perceive more vivid images.

5|$|The {{offensive}} line was another uncertainty for the 1997 team. Three linemen from the 1996 team {{had been selected}} in the 1997 NFL Draft: <b>center</b> <b>Rod</b> Payne (3rd round, 76th overall), offensive guard Damon Denson (4th round, 97th overall) and defensive tackle William Carr (7th round, 217th overall). As a result, Michigan began the season with only one {{offensive line}}man, offensive tackle Jon Jansen, who had started a game. Jansen, a junior, had 25 consecutive starts entering the season. The offensive line was further weakened when left tackle, Jeff Backus, suffered a ruptured appendix. In spring practice, offensive line coach Terry Malone made a plea for help during a staff meeting, searching for talent to fill in on the line. To fill the holes on the offensive line, two defensive linemen, Steve Hutchinson and Chris Ziemann were moved to the offensive line.|$|R

50|$|Boxer primers {{are similar}} to Berdan primers with one major difference: the {{location}} of the anvil. In a Boxer primer, the anvil is a separate stirrup piece that sits inverted in the primer cup providing sufficient resistance to the impact of the firing pin as it indents the cup and crushes the pressure-sensitive ignition compound. The primer pocket in the case head has a single flash-hole in its center. This positioning makes little or no difference to the performance of the round, but it makes fired primers vastly easier to remove for re-loading, as a single, <b>centered</b> <b>rod</b> pushed through the flash hole from the open end of the case will eject the two-piece primer from the primer cup. A new primer, anvil included, is then pressed into the case using a reloading press or hand-tool. Boxer priming is universal for US-manufactured civilian factory ammunition.|$|R

40|$|Currently, wheelchairs in {{developing}} countries are supplied both through donations from NGOs and local wheelchair workshops in these countries. A popular type of wheelchair manufactured by these workshops is a three-wheeled wheelchair, which has a long wheel base and third castor wheel {{in front of the}} chair. These wheelchairs perform better in the rough terrain of the developing world, but do not have a folding frame, and thus cannot be transported. This severely diminishes the ability of the wheelchair's user to travel far distances and generate income. Because of this problem, this project aims at developing a frame for the three-wheeled wheelchair that folds into small dimensions similar to a traditional four-wheeled wheelchair. (cont.) The major considerations when designing this wheelchair were weight, cost, and local availability of materials. All materials used for the wheelchair {{can be found in the}} majority of developing countries, as they consist of mild steel, bicycle parts, ABS plastic, and canvas for the seat. After evaluation of designs, a double L-brace, which very closely resembles the x-braces used in traditional four-wheeled wheelchairs, was decided upon. Being similar to these wheelchairs will increase user acceptance of this wheelchair. Analysis optimized the dimensions of the L-brace, and found all forces and moments on the wheelchair, so that the size of mild steel piping could be minimized, thus reducing both the weight and cost. The maximum moment in the <b>center</b> <b>rod</b> of the wheelchair was found to be 236. 0 Nm and in the L-brace the maximum moment was 315. 9 Nm. With the application of a safety factor, these values lead to the selection of mild steel piping with a diameter of 48. 25 mm and a thickness of 1. 5 mm for the <b>center</b> <b>rod</b> and a diameter of 60 mm and a thickness of 1. 2 mm for the rest of the frame. Using these materials give a final material cost of $ 89. 01, significantly less than the current cost of $ 230. The final weight is estimated to be 55. 1 pounds, which is much higher than the current weight of only 45 pounds. This will be an important feature to look at in future work, and hopefully this new design can be reduced to about 45 pounds. by Amanda Joy Maguire. Thesis (S. B.)
