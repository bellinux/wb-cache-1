25|$|Signalling by LIFR {{intracellular}} domain homodimerisation {{has been}} demonstrated in hepatoma and neuroblastoma cells, embryonic stem cells and <b>COS-1</b> cells by utilizing chimeric receptors that homodimerise upon stimulation with their cognate cytokines (i.e. GCSF, neurotrophin-3, EGF). However a GCSFR/LIFR chimera was not capable of signaling in M1 or Baf cells.|$|E
5000|$|The acronym [...] "COS" [...] {{is derived}} from the cells being CV-1 (simian) in Origin, and {{carrying}} the SV40 genetic material. Two forms of COS cell lines commonly used are <b>COS-1</b> and COS-7.|$|E

50|$|DC-SCRIPT {{contains}} a DNA-binding domain (11 C2H2 zinc (Zn) fingers), {{flanked by a}} proline-rich and an acidic region, which can interact with C-terminal-binding protein 1 (CtBP1), a global corepressor. In the immune system of both mice and humans, DC-SCRIPT {{was found to be}} specifically expressed in dendritic cells (DCs). In <b>COS-1</b> cells, DC-SCRIPT was shown to interact with the estrogen receptor DNA-binding domain (ERDBD) and represses ER activity through the association with RIP140, CtBP and histone deacetylases.|$|E
5000|$|The {{clinical}} {{significance of the}} biochemical consequences that result from the genetic abnormalities in patients with CPT II Deficiency is a contested issue. Rufer et al. support the theory {{that there is an}} association between level of enzyme activity and clinical presentation. [...] Multiple research groups have transfected <b>COS-1</b> cells with different CPT II mutations and found varying levels of reduction in enzyme activity compared with controls: Phe352Cys reduced enzyme activity to 70% of wild-type, Ser113Leu reduced enzyme activity to 34% of wild-type, and several severe mutations reduced activity to 5-10% of wild-type.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{pathogenic}} microorganisms, including C. albicans, Pneumocystis carinii and Leishmania donovani display glycans on their surfaces with terminal mannose residues that are recognised by the C-type CRDs of the mannose receptor, thereby {{acting as a}} marker of non-self. Upon recognition, the receptor internalises the bound pathogen and transports it to lysosomes for degradation via the phagocytic pathway. In this way, the mannose receptor acts as a pattern recognition receptor. The presence of a di-aromatic FENTLY (Phe-Glu-Asn-Thr-Leu-Tyr) sequence motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor is vital for its clathrin-mediated internalization. This {{is supported by the}} evidence that <b>Cos-1</b> cells transfected with the mannose receptor lacking its C-terminal tail are unable to endocytose C. albicans and P. carinii.|$|E
50|$|In cultured mouse hippocampal cells, {{expression}} {{is found in}} the cell soma, in neuritic varicosities along the developing neuronal extensions, and in neurite growth cones, but not in the nucleus. Kctd7 is widely expressed in neurons throughout the intact mouse brain, including in cortical neurons, in granular and pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus, and in cerebellar Purkinje cells. However, not all neuronal cells are immunopositive for Kctd7, and {{expression is}} not seen in astrocytes or microglial cells. Expression is constant from P5 to 2 months in cerebellar lysates. Overexpression of KCTD7 in HeLa and <b>COS-1</b> cells, which do not express endogenous KCTD7, shows diffuse cytosolic localization, with no colocalization with markers for endosomes, ER, Golgi, lysosomes, or the cytoskeleton.|$|E
50|$|The dmpk {{gene product}} is a Ser/Thr protein kinase {{homologous}} to the MRCK p21-activated kinases and the Rho family of kinases. Data obtained by using antibodies that detect specific isoforms of DMPK {{indicate that the}} most abundant isoform of DMPK is an 80-kDa protein expressed almost exclusively in smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscles. This kinase exists both as a membrane-associated and as a soluble form in human left ventricular samples. The different C termini of DMPK that arise from alternative splicing determine its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or cytosol in transfected <b>COS-1</b> cells. Among the substrates for DMPK proposed by in vitro studies are phospholemman, the dihydropyridine receptor, and the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit. However, an in vivo demonstration of the phosphorylation of these substrates by DMPK remains to be established, and a link between these substrates and the clinical manifestations of DM is unclear.|$|E
5000|$|Some of the capping ligands {{associated}} with AuNPs can be toxic {{while others are}} nontoxic. In gold nanorods (AuNRs), {{it has been shown}} that a strong cytotoxicity was {{associated with}} CTAB-stabilized AuNRs at low concentration, but it is thought that free CTAB was the culprit in toxicity [...] Modifications that overcoat these AuNRs reduces this toxicity in human colon cancer cells (HT-29) by preventing CTAB molecules from desorbing from the AuNRs back into the solution.Ligand toxicity can also be seen in AuNPs. Compared to the 90% toxicity of HAuCl4 at the same concentration, AuNPs with carboxylate termini were shown to be non-toxic. Large AuNPs conjugated with biotin, cysteine, citrate, and glucose were not toxic in human leukemia cells (K562) for concentrations up to 0.25 M. Also, citrate-capped gold nanospheres (AuNSs) have been proven to be compatible with human blood and did not cause platelet aggregation or an immune response. However, citrate-capped gold nanoparticles sizes 8-37 nm were found to be lethally toxic for mice, causing shorter lifespans, severe sickness, loss of appetite and weight, hair discoloration, and damage to the liver, spleen, and lungs; gold nanoparticles accumulated in the spleen and liver after traveling a section of the immune system.There are mixed-views for polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified AuNPs. These AuNPs were found to be toxic in mouse liver by injection, causing cell death and minor inflammation. However, AuNPs conjugated with PEG copolymers showed negligible toxicity towards human colon cells (Caco-2).AuNP toxicity also depends on the overall charge of the ligands. In certain doses, AuNSs that have positively-charged ligands are toxic in monkey kidney cells (<b>Cos-1),</b> human red blood cells, and E. coli because of the AuNSs interaction with the negatively-charged cell membrane; AuNSs with negatively-charged ligands have been found to be nontoxic in these species.In addition to the previously mentioned ‘‘in vivo’’ and ‘‘in vitro ’’ experiments, other similar experiments have been performed. Alkylthiolate-AuNPs with trimethlyammonium ligand termini mediate the translocation of DNA across mammalian cell membranes ‘‘in vitro’’ at a high level, which is detrimental to these cells. Corneal haze in rabbits have been healed ‘‘in vivo’’ by using polyethylemnimine-capped gold nanoparticles that were transfected with a gene that promotes wound healing and inhibits corneal fibrosis.|$|E
