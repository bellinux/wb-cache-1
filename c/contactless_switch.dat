40|$|This letter {{presents}} a novel three-state contactless radio frequency (RF) microelectromechanical systems switch for wireless applications. The switch is free from stiction and charge injection issues occurred inherently in contact-type RF MEMS switches, thereby increasing reliability and lifetime. The <b>contactless</b> <b>switch</b> {{is based on}} variable capacitance between signal lines and movable grounded electrodes controlled by electrostatic actuator. The movable grounded electrode has the capability to move bidirectionally, and therefore, the switch can change among ON-, OFF-, and deep OFF-states. Thus, additional isolation can be achieved in the deep OFF-state. The RF measurement {{results show that the}} <b>contactless</b> <b>switch</b> has a capacitance tuning ratio of 5. 25 between OFF- and ON-states, and a higher tuning ratio of 11. 18 between deep OFF- and ON-states. In addition, the switch exhibits - 3. 62 dB insertion loss and - 24. 43 dB isolation at 2. 4 GHz. At 5 GHz, the insertion loss and isolation are - 2. 95 dB and - 20. 65 dB, respectively.

40|$|Conventional {{brake systems}} using a mechanical-structure-based contact switch {{with a metal}} spring suffer from {{frequent}} malfunction problems over time caused by unstable contacts stemming from loose tension of the spring, a faulty air gap, and damage to the contact point due to overcurrent from load. In this paper, a novel <b>contactless</b> <b>switch</b> for brake systems using an eddy-current displacement sensor is proposed, fabricated, and verified to have reliable performance that overcomes conventional contact switch problems. A proposed <b>contactless</b> <b>switch</b> was fabricated using automotive-grade surface-mount devices (SMDs) {{on both sides of}} an FR- 4 printed circuit board for low-cost implementation. The measurement result shows a switching speed of less than 49. 7 mu s, on average, which is approximately ten times faster than conventional mechanical-structure-based contact switches. The overall dimension of the proposed switch is 36 mm x 26 mm x 64 mm, which can fit into most brake switch housings. The operating input voltage range is from + 8 V to + 22 V, with the temperature ranging from - 40 degrees C to + 85 degrees C, showing reliable performance under harsh environment test for automobile applications. close...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedThis thesis {{presents}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) for acoustic sensing, <b>contactless</b> RF MEMS <b>switching,</b> and resonant mass sensing {{based on}} piezoelectric transduction using zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films.; For acoustic sensing, a sensitive, broad-bandwidth piezoelectric MEMS transducer based on frequency interleaving of resonant transducers is designed and fabricated. High compliance cantilever and spiral-beam-supported diaphragms are {{designed and built}} on the edge-released MEMS structure to relieve initial residual stress and to avoid in-plane tension when bent. For a given pressure level and diaphragm size, the maximum strain on the spiral-beam-supported diaphragm is about {{an order of magnitude}} larger than that of a rectangular cantilever diaphragm. Also, the acoustic transducer built on the spiral-beam-supported diaphragm has a much higher sensitivity (but with less tolerance on the fabrication process variation and at the cost of lower usable bandwidth) than the one built on a rectangular cantilever diaphragm. By connecting many transducers in parallel, both the sensitivity and acoustic output were improved by about 30 times. The interleaving of the transducers increased not only the sensitivity, but also broadened the useable bandwidth.; For RF MEMS <b>switch,</b> the novel <b>contactless</b> piezoelectric <b>switch</b> employing ZnO actuation has been developed. The cantilever is built on a 0. 3 micron thick nitride. The piezoelectric deflection is demonstrated to be linear and bi-directional with fast frequency response. The <b>contactless</b> RF MEMS <b>switch</b> is composed of two surface-micromachined tunable capacitors and two bonded-wire inductors. By applying a dc bias voltage between the two piezoelectrically-actuated cantilevers, the free-standing bridge is pulled down to the cantilevers for simply-supported boundary conditions. The ON-state and OFF-state of the switch are achieved by deflecting a pair of piezoelectrically actuated cantilevers to move a simply-supported bridge up and down to vary the capacitance by a factor of 4 without any physical contact between the bridge and substrate.; For resonant mass sensing, film bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR) can be made into label-free mass sensors for identifying biological and chemical species. They have higher sensitivity than a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) due to their higher resonant frequency. Unlike current probe methods labeled with fluorescence, chemiluminescence, electrochemiluminescence, or radioactive tags, the resonant frequency of FBAR changes in response to mass added to its surface, and can be used for label-free quantitative measurement. A novel FBAR array is fabricated by connecting four resonators in parallel. Each device in the array has a distinct resonant frequency and sensing/reaction chamber, allowing for simultaneous detection of four different bio-chemical agents. Biotin-neutravidin interactions are chosen as a demonstration vehicle of the arrayed FBAR due to their well-known high affinity binding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} {{paradigms}} that could shape this century’s infrastructure in Australia {{and indeed the}} world. This paper outlines one feasible pathway to fill a glaring gap in public transport within our cities and do this whereas addressing a number of pressing social, environmental, and economic needs including providing transport users {{an alternative to the}} car and truck, reducing congestion in cities, promoting renewable energy sources, returning ‘people space’ to cities and suburbs, and making it a healthier and happier space to name a few. The pathway outlined in this paper involves using a fully-automated small vehicle system called Gazelle. The system uses linear motors for propulsion and an air cushion for frictionless levitation of the vehicle. <b>Contactless</b> electromagnetic <b>switching</b> allows the vehicles to be routed across the track network. It is selfsufficient in renewable energy. Use of vertical space facilitates safe automation and allows continued use of most ground vehicles. Citation: Chorvat, T. (2014).

40|$|High density {{magnetic}} recording, magnetic {{random access}} memories, displacement and current detection, <b>contactless</b> <b>switching</b> and electronic compass applications all require magnetic field sensors with unprecedented sensitivity. The spin-valve effect (giant magnetoresistance) found in 1988 in magnetic metallic multilayers provided {{a new form}} of magnetoresistance with promising possibilities. The name indicates its physical origin: the magnetic layers form magnetic field controllable valves for electrons with parallel spins, leading to low resistance under application of a magnetic field. The resistance is usually measured using a four point technique, with the current in plane. Now, ten years later, the first hard disk incorporating this effect has reached the marketplace. Its read head shows a spin-valve effect of about 5 % allowing for a capacity of 16. 8 Gbyte. The use of the much larger perpendicular spin-valve effect was limited because of the ultra low perpendicular resistance of the atomically thin multilayers. Subject of this thesis is the spin valve transistor, which we introduced 1995. It is able to circumvent the low resistance dilemma by its direct mean free path dependence in the output. In the spin valve transistor a spin-valve multilayer serves as a base region of an n-silicon metal base transistor structure: via an emitter barrier hot electrons are injected into the spin-valve, a collector barrier accepts only non-scattered electrons by means of its angle and energy selectivity. Since the number of collected electrons depends exponentially on the spin dependent mean free path in the spin-valve base, and since the mean free path changes with field due to the perpendicular spin-valve effect, the collector current change with magnetic field is much larger than the resistance change in current-in-plane measurements and can be effectively used for magnetic field detection. Since the electron energy of the injected electrons can be varied either using different Schottky barriers or bias variation using a tunnel emitter, the spin-valve transistor allows electron spectroscopy to be performed in spin-valves. Because the electron energy range is of the same order as the spin-split 3 d bands of the ferromagnetic metals Co, Fe and Ni, a direct investigation of the spin-dependent band structure which causes the spin-valve effect is possible. An extension of the two channel model has been formulated, showing that the collector current change can be extremely large, for example, implementation of a 5 % spin-valve (measured in plane) may lead to practically useful output current variations of more than 500 %. Moreover, thickness variation e. g. using wedges, allows determination of spin dependent mean free paths...|$|R
