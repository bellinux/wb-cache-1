In 1950 Helen Woodward Rivas, Orator's youngest daughter, paid for the first. Three years later, the Rev. Raymond Calkins funded additional work in memory of his wife's family, the Lathrops, giving the chapel its name. Among those renovations were a stained glass rose window; however it was replaced with the <b>current</b> <b>window,</b> depicting the Resurrection of Jesus as described at Matthew , six years later when Calkins objected to the rose window.|$|E
25|$|The Space bar is a {{horizontal}} {{bar in the}} lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the <b>current</b> <b>window,</b> half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses {{in addition to its}} normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.|$|E
