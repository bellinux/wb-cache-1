50|$|Hand-dug wells are {{excavations}} with diameters {{large enough}} to accommodate one or more people with shovels digging down to below the water table. The excavation is braced horizontally to avoid landslide or erosion endangering the people digging. They can be lined with laid stones or brick; extending this lining upwards above the ground surface to form a wall around the well serves to reduce both contamination and injuries by falling into the well. A more modern method called caissoning uses reinforced concrete or plain concrete pre-cast well rings that are lowered into the hole. A well-digging team digs under a <b>cutting</b> <b>ring</b> and the well column slowly sinks into the aquifer, whilst protecting the team from collapse of the well bore.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{fabricate}} micro surface textures on alumina ceramic, {{the effects of}} single pulse intervals processing and <b>ring</b> <b>cutting</b> processing on the laser surface textures were discussed. The advantages and disadvantages between the two kinds of processing method were compared. The crater diameter and depth increase {{with the increase of}} laser pulse energy, and the increasing number of pulses significantly affects the crater depth for the single pulse intervals processing. As for the <b>ring</b> <b>cutting</b> processing method, micro-pit depth changes with the average power, whereas the micro-pit diameter mainly changes with scan radium. By optimizing laser processing parameters the micro-pit dimensions could be independently controlled. These two methods could process micro-pits with different diameters and depth on alumina ceramic.

During a twelve-minute headway this went fine with three trams in each direction. The route {{could be done in}} 30 minutes, but without any slack. Oslo Sporveier ran the line with two trams per direction during the fifteen-minute headway services, but it was often difficult to keep the schedule with this scheme. During the summers 0 was combined with 13 so each service would run twice around the circle and then run on the Gamlebyen Line. From 1937 the reduced service and 0 and 13 combination was also run on Sundays. From 1940 line 13 was moved to the Sinsen Line.|$|R
5000|$|The SRR was {{introduced}} by Pendry in 1999, {{and is one of}} the most common elements of metamaterials. As a nonmagnetic conducting unit, it comprises an array of units that yield an enhanced negative effective magnetic permeability, when the frequency of the incident electromagnetic field is close to the SRR resonance frequency. The resonant frequency of the SRR depends on its shape and physical design. In addition, resonance can occur at wavelengths much larger than its size. Evidently, further for the shape optimization of the specified elements it is expedient to use genetic and ant algorithms of optimization. With reference to multifrequency decisions it is meaningful to apply fractal’s frameworks Serpinsky on the basis of Kokh's broken line or others fractal's decisions instead of <b>cutting</b> <b>ring</b> or square SRR.

An internal <b>cutting</b> <b>ring</b> {{at the base of}} the lysimeter casing produced a small annular gap between the soil monolith and the wall of the casing. This gap was filled with liquefied petrolatum, which provided a water-tight seal around the edge of the lysimeter. Water and solutes were unable to leak between the monolith and casing. The use of petrolatum as a sealant is suitable for water-flux and nutrient-leaching studies, but is not suitable for pesticide studies...|$|E

40|$|A new solar powered {{portable}} {{system for}} ice core drilling was developed especially {{for work on}} very high altitude glaciers requiring an extremely light {{and easy to use}} system. FELICS (Fast Electromechanical Lightweight Ice Coring System), with a net weight of 228 kg for the complete drilling system including power supply, represents a new design. The main features are the absence of an outer barrel and a tilting table, and the use of a one-piece <b>cutting</b> <b>ring,</b> which simplify utilisation of the device and make it very efficient. In addition, FELICS is designed to be installed inside a protective tent, effectively allowing a 24 hour working day. The new drilling system has been successfully employed in the European Alps and in the Andes (on Cerro Tapado, Chile at 5536 m a. s. l., on Illimani, Bolivia at 6300 m a. s. l. and on Chimborazo, Ecuador at 6250 m a. s. l.) with a drilling performance of 136 m in only 6 working days.

50|$|Yet another {{expedient}} shotgun slug {{design is}} the cut shell. These {{are made by}} hand from a standard birdshot shell by <b>cutting</b> a <b>ring</b> around and through the hull of the shell that nearly encircles the shell, with the cut traditionally located {{in the middle of}} the wad separating the powder and shot. A small amount of the shell wall is retained, amounting to roughly 1/4 of the circumference of the shotshell hull. When fired, the end of the hull separates from the base and travels through the bore and down range. Cut shells have the advantage of expedience. They can be handmade on the spot as the need arises while on a hunt for small game if a larger game animal such as a deer or a bear appears. In terms of safety, part of the shell may remain behind in the barrel, causing potential problems if not noticed and cleared before another shot is fired.|$|R

50|$|Fort Rock {{was created}} when basalt magma {{rose to the}} surface and {{encountered}} the wet muds of a lake bottom.

Steam explosions also loosened angular chunks of black and red lava rock comprising the valley floor. These blocky inclusions are incorporated into the fine-grained tuff layers at Fort Rock.

40|$|Cytokinesis {{in animal}} cells {{requires}} the constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring, whose architecture and mechanism remain poorly understood. We use laser microsurgery {{to explore the}} biophysical properties of constricting rings in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Laser <b>cutting</b> causes <b>rings</b> to snap open. However, instead of disintegrating, ring topology recovers and constriction proceeds. In response to severing, a finite gap forms and is repaired by recruitment of new material in an actin polymerization-dependent manner. An open ring is able to constrict, and rings repair from successive cuts. After gap repair, an increase in constriction velocity allows cytokinesis to complete {{at the same time}} as controls. Our analysis demonstrates that tension in the ring increases while net cortical tension at the site of ingression decreases throughout constriction and suggests that cytokinesis is accomplished by contractile modules that assemble and contract autonomously, enabling local repair of the actomyosin network. Consequently, cytokinesis is a highly robust process impervious to discontinuities in contractile ring structure.

50|$|The {{growth of}} diamond {{directly}} on a substrate allows {{the addition of}} many of diamond's important qualities to other materials.
