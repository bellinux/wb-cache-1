500|$|In {{contrast}} to his 1850 measurement, Foucault's 1862 measurement was aimed at obtaining an accurate absolute value for the speed of light, since his concern was to deduce an improved value for the astronomical unit. At the time, Foucault {{was working at the}} Paris Observatory under Urbain le Verrier. It was le Verrier's belief, based on extensive celestial mechanics calculations, that the <b>consensus</b> <b>value</b> for the speed of light was perhaps 4% too high. Technical limitations prevented Foucault from separating mirrors R and M by more than about 20meters. Despite this limited path length, Foucault was able to measure the displacement of the slit image (less than 1mm) with considerable accuracy. In addition, unlike the case with Fizeau's experiment (which required gauging the rotation rate of an adjustable-speed toothed wheel), he could spin the mirror at a constant, chronometrically determined speed. [...] Foucault's measurement confirmed le Verrier's estimate. His 1862 figure for the speed of light (298000km/s) was within 0.6% of the modern value.|$|E

Thirty-three laboratories collaborated in the inter-laboratory proficiency tests for characterization of iodine value, while thirty-two laboratories for characterization of slip melting point. The iodine value and slip melting point of palm oil, palm olein and palm stearin were determined in accordance to MPOB Test Methods p 3. 2 : 2004 and p 4. 2 : 2004, respectively. The <b>consensus</b> <b>values</b> and their uncertainties {{were based on the}} acceptability of statistical agreement of results obtained from collaborating laboratories. The <b>consensus</b> <b>values</b> and uncertainties for iodine values were 52. 63 ± 0. 14 Wijs in palm oil, 56. 77 ± 0. 12 Wijs in palm olein and 33. 76 ± 0. 18 Wijs in palm stearin. For the slip melting points, the <b>consensus</b> <b>values</b> and uncertainties were 35. 6 ± 0. 3 °C in palm oil, 22. 7 ± 0. 4 °C in palm olein and 53. 4 ± 0. 2 °C in palm stearin. Repeatability and reproducibility relative standard deviations were found to be good and acceptable, with values much lower than that of 10 %.

40|$|Summary: Various immunochemical assays {{are used}} for {{measuring}} the apolipoprotein A-I in human serum, but results obtained by these assays often cannot be compared owing to methodological problems, the lack of reference methods and inadequate standardization. The electrophoretic apolipoprotein A-I assay avoids {{the problems associated with}} antibody-antigen interaction. The method involves spectrophotometric meas-urement of the Coomassie blue eluted from the apolipoprotein A-I bands of human serum after electrophoresis in a gradient gel. The assay was linear from 0. 5 to 4. 0 micrograms of apolipoprotein A-I. Within-assay variability was 3. 2 % and between-assay variability was 5. 9 %. Overall analytical recovery was 98 %. The electrophoretic assay is suitable for the quantitation of apolipoprotein A-I in fresh, frozen or lyophilized serum pools. Analysis of 6 frozen serum pools showed a good correlation between this assay and an immunoturbidimetric assay (r = 0. 96), and between this assay and <b>consensus</b> <b>values</b> (r = 0. 99). <b>Consensus</b> <b>values</b> were derived from the results of different immunochemical assays performed in 6 laboratories in 3 different countries within 3 years.

The <b>consensus</b> <b>values</b> for these pools were 1. 04, 0. 86, and 0. 43 g/ 1, respectively, as derived from the data of different immunochemical assay measurements performed in 84 laboratories in 34 various countries.

40|$|Justice {{theory has}} {{suggested}} that transgressions {{pose a threat to}} the shared values that underlie broken rules or laws, suggesting that in order to address concerns over the values violated by an offence, perceived <b>consensus</b> regarding those <b>values</b> must be reaffirmed. However, little empirical research has been conducted examining how legal responses can address those value concerns. In the current research we argue that punishments, as a common response to injustice, can reaffirm perceived <b>value</b> <b>consensus</b> through two routes: (1) by symbolically labelling the offence as against group values, thus reinforcing values towards observers and (2) by attempting to reform the offender, thus reinforcing values towards the offender. Consistent with this argument, three empirical studies showed that the public and inclusive nature of punishment helps restore a perceived <b>value</b> <b>consensus</b> as such characteristics facilitate these two processes. Moreover, these characteristics had a positive effect on perceived punishment appropriateness particularly when value concerns were heightened. These findings implicate symbolic labelling and offender reform as two processes by which punishments can restore the perception of <b>value</b> <b>consensus</b> and suggest that these processes are integral to justice restoration through punishment when <b>value</b> <b>consensus</b> is a dominant concern...|$|R

All of our measurements of ANU sucrose (n = 351) as a secondary standard over the last 7 yr result in an average value of 1. 5016 ± 0. 0005 Fm (2 -σ standard error). After applying the same outlier tests used for IAEA reference standards, a weighted average value of 1. 5016 ± 0. 0002 Fm (n = 294) was calculated.
