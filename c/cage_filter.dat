40|$|Multi-colour and tunable colour pyroelectric {{detectors}} {{are compared}} {{in respect of}} gas analysis. The key elements of the detectors are a beam splitter and a Fabry-perot filter respectively. The beam splitter are micromachined plates with pyramids or V-grooves with a pitch of 100 … 150 µm to ensure a homogeneous distribution of the radiation flux. Narrow bandpass filters are arranged at a <b>filter</b> <b>cage</b> forming a four sided frustum of pyramid. The angle of 30 ° for the micro pyramids and the <b>filter</b> <b>cage</b> guarantees that the radiation hits the filter perpendicular. The tunable filter is a MEMS based fabry-perot filter. It {{is based on an}} approach using relatively thick reflector carriers, one of them being fixed and the other suspended by springs with compensating elements. In order to achieve the tuning of the resonator cavity, an electrostatic actuation using a parallel plate design has been chosen. Short and long cavity filters were designed for the spectral ranges of 5. 0 … 3. 7 µm and 4. 3 … 3. 0 µm respectively. Spectral flat, blackened pyroelectric chips are arranged behind the filters in both the multi-colour and tunable-colour detectors. Beam splitting results in a time parallel split-up and filtering of the incident radiation flux, whereas in the tunable-colour detector, the filtering is a time serial process...|$|R

The experiment was conducted by following the methodology prescribed by Heinrichs et al. 1985 with slight modifications. Exactly 10 female hoppers (adult gravids) were introduced after starving for 1 – 1.5  h into each cage through {{the top of the}} inverted plastic cup where the stem of the plant passes through. The opening of the cup is plugged with cotton to prevent escape of the insects. Spots on the filter paper are evident as soon as honeydew is excreted. After the hoppers have fed for 24  h, filter papers were removed from the <b>cage.</b> Collected <b>filter</b> paper is placed on A 4 size white paper as 2 or 4 filter papers per white paper. A 1  cm line was drawn on the A 4 size white paper {{at the top of the}} filter paper this will be used to set scale for measuring the area of spot by using ImageJ software.

40|$|ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Ageing male DBA/ 1 mice spontaneously develop {{arthritis}} in the hind paws. We {{and others}} have demonstrated that this model shares striking features with human spondyloarthritis, in particular entheseal involvement, progressive ankylosis but also dactylitis. Here, we report on our recent experience with this model highlighting how changes in the animal facility affect {{the development of the}} disease. FINDINGS: Ageing male DBA/ 1 mice from different litters were caged together (6 mice per cage) at the age of 10 weeks. The mice were checked twice a week for clinical signs of arthritis. Disease severity was assessed in further detail post-mortem by scoring for histomorphological characteristics. DBA/ 1 mice spontaneously develop macroscopically detectable arthritis, presenting as joint swelling or toe stiffness. Standard settings with open cages lead to an almost 100 % incidence by the age of 26 weeks. The introduction of larger <b>cages</b> and <b>filter</b> tops reducing exposure to other cages dramatically affected incidence. Other negative factors include excess bedding material reducing the impact of walking and running. Switching back to the original conditions resulted again in a high incidence, further optimized by sensory exposure to female mice. We also showed that the related DBA/ 2 strain is sensitive to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Changing environmental factors in the housing conditions of DBA/ 1 mice severely affects the spontaneous development of arthritis. This points out that the model is very sensitive to external stress and sensory factors that are likely affecting the behavior of the male mice and that the model needs to be optimized in different situations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{methodology}} is {{devised by}} coupling different codes. The study of weather conditions {{as part of}} the data of the site will determine the relative concentrations of radionuclides in the air using ARCON 96. The activity in the air is characterized depending on the source and release sequence specified in NUREG- 1465 by RADTRAD code, which provides results of the inner cloud source term contribution. Known activities and energy spectra are inferred using ORIGEN-S, which are used as input for the models of the outer cloud, filters and containment generated with MCNP 5. The sum of the different contributions must meet the conditions of habitability specified by the CSN (Spanish Nuclear Regulatory Body) (TEDE < 50 [*]mSv and equivalent dose to the thyroid < 500 [*]mSv within 30 days following the accident doses) so that the dose is optimized by varying parameters including <b>CAGE</b> location, flow <b>filtering</b> need for recirculation, thicknesses and compositions of the walls, etc. The results for the most penalizing area meet the established criteria, and therefore the CAGE building design based on the methodology presented is radiologically validated...|$|R
40|$|Allergy {{and asthma}} caused by {{proteins}} of laboratory animals, particularly rats and mice, {{are the most}} important occupational health hazards for the scientists and technicians who work with such animals. The influence of different cage litters, cage design, and stock density on measured rat urinary aeroallergen (RUA) concentrations has been examined in a room housing male rats, to determine practical means to reduce allergen concentration in animal laboratories. Eight hour static air samples were taken at 2 1 /min and the RUA concentrations measured by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) inhibition. High RUA concentrations occurred when the animals were housed on wood based, contact litter (geometric mean (GM) sawdust 7. 79 micrograms/m 3; woodchip 6. 16 micrograms/m 3). The use of noncontact absorbent pads was associated with a significant decrease in RUA concentrations (GM 2. 47 micrograms/m 3; p less than 0. 0001). Rat urinary aeroallergen concentrations fell more than fourfold when the animals were housed on woodbased, contact litter in <b>filter</b> top <b>cages</b> rather than conventional open top <b>cages</b> (GM <b>filter</b> top 0. 33 micrograms/m 3; open top 1. 43 micrograms/m 3; p less than 0. 0001). The number of rats (stock density) strongly influenced the RUA concentration and a linear relation was found between the log(e) allergen concentration and stock density under these study conditions. The measurement of airborne particle size on cleaning out days showed that all litter types generated similar sized particles: more than 80 % of the RUA was carried on particles larger than 8 microns in diameter for all litter types. The findings suggest that the exposure of animal husbandry personnel to RUA may be substantially reduced by the avoidance of contact litter, the use of <b>filter</b> top <b>cages</b> (where suitable), and by keeping stock density to a minimum...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesDecontaminating {{dental chair}} unit (DCU) suction systems in a convenient, safe and {{effective}} manner is problematic. This study aimed to identify and quantify {{the extent of the}} problems using 25 DCUs, methodically eliminate these problems and develop an efficient approach for reliable, effective, automated disinfection. MethodsDCU suction system residual contamination by environmental and human-derived bacteria was evaluated by microbiological culture following standard aspiration disinfection with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant or alternatively, a novel flooding approach to disinfection. Disinfection of multicomponent suction handpieces, assembled and disassembled, was also studied. A prototype manual and a novel automated Suction Tube Cleaning System (STCS) were developed and tested, as were novel single component suction handpieces. ResultsStandard aspiration disinfection consistently failed to decontaminate DCU suction systems effectively. Semi-confluent bacterial growth (101 – 500 colony forming units (CFU) per culture plate) was recovered from up to 60 % of suction filter housings and from up to 19 % of high and 37 % of low volume suction hoses. Manual and automated flood disinfection of DCU suction systems reduced this dramatically (ranges for <b>filter</b> <b>cage</b> and high and low volume hoses of 0 – 22, 0 – 16 and 0 – 14 CFU/plate, respectively) (P< 0. 0001). Multicomponent suction handpieces could not be adequately disinfected without prior removal and disassembly. Novel single component handpieces, allowed their effective disinfection in situ using the STCS, which virtually eliminated contamination from the entire suction system. ConclusionFlood disinfection of DCU suction systems and single component handpieces radically improves disinfection efficacy and considerably reduces potential cross-infection and cross-contamination risks. Clinical significanceDCU suction systems become heavily contaminated during use. Conventional disinfection does not adequately control this. Furthermore, multicomponent suction handpieces cannot be adequately disinfected without disassembly, which is costly in time, staff and resources. The automated STCS DCU suction disinfection system used with single component handpieces provides an effective solution...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{indicators}} {{have the}} capacity to integrate the temporal changes of contaminants, concentrations or fluxes over various time-scales, and are thus considered as interesting tools for water quality biomonitoring. Since the mid- 70 ies, French programs have developed water monitoring approaches based on the use of bivalve molluscs; and recently the natural background and the extent of water contamination were bioassessed at the scale of the whole western Mediterranean. But even if bivalve molluscs are viewed as reliable bioindicators, their use is not always made easy {{as a result of their}} absence in numerous coastal regions that force their transplantation (cages) during several months before their sampling and analysis. This weakness led several scientists to evaluate the bioindicator abilities of other marine organisms. Seagrasses, whose ability to bioaccumulate contaminants proportionally to environmental contamination levels has been clearly demonstrated, have thus been proposed as an appropriate alternative tool for coastal water quality assessment. Very little studies have however so far considered the combined utilization of these two groups of bioindicator organisms, i. e. caged bivalve molluscs and seagrasses. In the framework of the STARECAPMED project, we therefore compared and discussed the bioaccumulation of trace elements in the Neptune grass Posidonia oceanica and in caged Mediterranean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis. The sampling was performed at the scale of the western Mediterranean. The two species told two contamination stories which, although sometimes different, showed to be complementary. P. oceanica and M. galloprovincialis bioaccumulated dissolved trace elements from the water column and thus provided information regarding trace element contamination severity integrated over several days to a few months. Seagrasses, strongly rooted in the sediments, reflected the long-term exposure to trace elements since sediments offer a degree of time integration over several years to decades. <b>Caged</b> mussels, as <b>filter</b> feeder artificially maintained in the water column, bioaccumulated trace elements from their particulate phase, and therefore gave valuable information regarding continental-terrigenous inputs to coastal waters. In conclusion, seagrasses and mussels should neither supplant, nor substitute, but rather complement each other in order to provide the full time- and space-integrated coastal contamination story of the Mediterranean.
