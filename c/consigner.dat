40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} the {{construct}} of transport flexibility {{within the context of}} supply chain strategy. We assess the role of flexibility in satisfying competitive opportunities while accommodating supply chain uncertainties. In this way, we may then determine the role of different transport flexibility types in delivering strategic outcomes. The construct of transport flexibility is via a review of the existing literature with a focus on the role of operational flexibility for both competitive advantage and as a response to coping with supply chain uncertainty. The construct is explored via action-based research in a steel industry logistics triad, that is, a third party logistics provider, a <b>consigner</b> and a consignee. The findings highlight ineffectiveness in the logistics operations and are used as a catalyst to instigate supply chain re-engineering. The changes implemented are reviewed by the research team to measure any improvements in performance. Transport Supply chain Flexibility Steel industry...|$|E
40|$|Current service {{selection}} {{is unable to}} perform proactively. When a service provider overloads, the services list is ever-lengthening, which leads to backlog and failure of service composition. To compensate for this deficiency, this paper improves the proactive service selection. In this strategy, the service provider analyses a time series of services received to forecast the backlog and consign services to the others through a negotiation process. The least squares support vector learning is used to predict a random list of services, and an acquaintance model (AM) makes a <b>consigner</b> allocate backlog services to other providers with high degree of relationship. The backlog of services by forecasting is entrusted to the provider who can implement the same service, and negotiation between the providers with the same role would allow generation of a new service selection solution before a fault occurs. Experiments showed that the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) algorithm was more accurate in predicting a services list and a negotiation mechanism using AM decreased communication time effectively, which improved the success rate of service selection and reduced the execution time of service composition.

40|$|Subcontracting is {{a common}} {{practice}} in modernlogistics industry for delivering goods from a <b>consigner</b> to aconsignee. Visibility and security are critical concerns of the involved prime logistics enterprise and its subcontractors insharing logistics track and trace data, which appear fundamentally contracting to each other. Both role-based dataaccessing and sharing mechanism used in traditional databas e management applications and security control solutions based on EPC global infrastructure {{are not able to}} efficiently handle these issues together. In this work, a light-weight privacy protection mechanism is introduced for these enterprises with subcontracting relationships to share logistics track and trace data captured with Auto-ID systems equipped with RFID readers, sensors, or global positioning devices. The mechanism consists of a set of protocols designed for the involved stakeholders to register and cancel subcontracting relationship,to set up and clear outsourced logistics job, to upload, update and clear the job data, to track the job execution progress and trace the job execution history. A method for implementing the mechanism is also proposed in this paper, including major use cases, data flow diagrams, and a high-level architecture of a subtracting relationship based track and trace management prototype system...|$|E

In 1922 it was requested that the cattle-stop on the stockyard siding - which crossed a public road at the north end of the yard - be planked between the rails to enable the use of horses to place wagons at the loading bank. Prior to this request, <b>consigners</b> pushed wagons by hand across the road to a point where they could be worked by horses.|$|R

Revenue was driven by ensuring that stock was properly displayed, which in turn depended on assuring that enough staff were available to sort, tag, and lay out the products. The supply side of the business depended on the number of <b>consigners</b> available, the amount of product they brought to each store, and the speed at which these products could be displayed. The demand side depended on local advertising and word of mouth that stimulated traffic flow. All stores were situated in prominent locations with good visibility that stimulated walk-in traffic.|$|R
40|$|Within {{the field}} of supply chain {{management}} this work focuses on the logistics element studying from both theoretical and practical perspectives the role of logistics provision in creating enhanced value propositions. In particular, it focuses on relationship management involving logistics service providers and asks whether the "logistics triad", as it has become known, is a minimum appropriate unit of analysis for examining the role of modern outsourced logistics within the setting and goals of supply chain management. Recent decades have been characterised by a period of unprecedented change across industries and an intensification {{of the nature of}} competitiveness in the marketplace. One strategy deployed by companies has been to closely manage how they conduct their cross-functional business processes, both internally and externally. This inevitably has included developing relations with business partners. In freight distribution, as logistics service provision has become a popular outsourcing activity for many reasons, academic research has focused predominantly on the improved integration of logistics services within their specific supply chain network. Logistics has moved from being a liability to be managed, to a source of potential competitive advantage. Much of this literature has centred on the two-way or dyadic relationship between the outsourcer of logistics, the shipper, and the logistics service provider. However, in logistics provision, a third party logistics service provider in each supply chain it operates within has an inherent relationship with not one but two other connected parties: the party it is contracted to, the shipper (also known as the <b>consigner)</b> and the consignee. This leads to the conclusion that business relationships in logistics should be assessed and managed on a tripartite rather than a dyadic basis between all three inter-connected parties. This study explores this thinking assessing the feasibility of collaborative logistics provision on a tripartite rather than a dyadic basis. The research approach is structured in principally three phases. First, the inductive phase combines empirical research in {{the field of}} logistics service provision with critical literature reviews and has two principal aims. Firstly it aids the development of a fuller understanding of the issues and knowledge which contextually surround this evolving subject. Further, it helps refine the focus of the core research activity in the study, supporting the development of a theoretical framework and research questions {{on the subject of the}} collaborative logistics triad. The second phase is deductive in nature and features a longitudinal case study which assesses the strengths and weaknesses of selecting the logistics triad concept as a commercial approach. It is shown that when all three parties involved in the collaborative logistics triad focus on aligned goals with clear, shared performance indicators considerable improvement in logistics performance can be realised. The implications and potential for scaling up the collaborative logistics triad concept are then assessed. This is achieved by gauging the response of logistics professionals to questions stemming from the principal findings from both the exploratory study and the collaborative logistics triad case study at a major conference for logistics professionals. The overall findings have implications for supply chain management and logistics theorists as well as practising industry personnel involved in logistics provision. The study concludes that the collaborative logistics triad concept, although in theory a sensible unit of analysis, where improved performance by alignment of all three parties behind shared aims was demonstrated, in practice is a very challenging ideal to set up and sustain. However, there are clear advantages for those that can achieve it and it represents a good source of competitive advantage for those companies keen to compete through enhanced supply chain logistics practice excellence...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} cohort {{observational study}} was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence of Anaplasma marginale in Iowa feedlots and its association with morbidity, mortality, and treatment costs. Blood samples were taken from 659 calves from 31 <b>consigners</b> at processing and classified as seropositive to A. marginale using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) with a 30 % cutoff. Health and production parameters were modeled by A. marginale serostatus with mixed model regression analysis. The apparent prevalence of seropositive cattle was 15. 17 % (100 / 659). When the cELISA positive cutoff was at 42 % inhibition, the apparent prevalence was 5. 00 % (33 / 659). There was no significant association between A. marginale serostatus and production parameters; however, seropositive status had a weak positive association with undifferentiated fever (P = 0. 17). Although prevalence of anaplasmosis in Iowa feedlots is higher than reported in Montana-sourced calves arriving in Canadian feedlots, this was not associated with increased production costs...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to retailing new vehicles, automotive manufacturers in the United States sell millions of vehicles through leasing and to fleet customers every year. The {{majority of these}} vehicles are returned to the automotive manufacturers {{at the end of}} the contracted term and must be “remarketed. ” In 2007, about 10 million used vehicles were sold at more than 400 auctions in the United States. Large <b>consigners</b> face decisions every day about when, where, and at what price to offer these vehicles, which has significant financial implications for their profitability. To address the challenges of the distribution process, (), a division of J. D. Power and Associates, developed the PIN Optimal Distribution of Auction Vehicles System (ODAV), an automated decision optimization system that helps remarketers maximize profits through the most advantageous distribution of their auction vehicles. At the core of the system is a combination of three models that determine the distribution of the vehicles on a daily basis: a nearest neighbor linear regression model for short-term auction price forecasting; an autoregressive integrated moving average time-series analysis model for volume-price elasticity; and a genetic algorithm optimizer for vehicle distribution. Since its launch in 2003, PIN has been providing ODAV services on a daily basis, and to date, more than two million vehicles have been distributed through this system. In this paper, we will describe the PIN ODAV System, its implementation, and the business impact by using as an example the experience with our largest client, Chrysler Group LLC. used vehicle, auction price, distribution, forecasting, optimization...|$|R
