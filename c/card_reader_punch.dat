5000|$|Punched card devices {{included}} the 2501 card reader and the 2540 <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> <b>punch.</b> Virtually every System/360 had a 2540. The 2560 MFCM ("Multi-Function Card Machine") reader/sorter/punch, listed above, {{was for the}} Model 20 only. It was notorious for reliability problems (earning humorous acroymns often involving [...] "...Card Muncher" [...] or [...] "Mal-Function Card Machine").|$|E

50|$|The minimum {{hardware}} {{requirements of a}} CDC 6000 series computer system consists of the computer, including 32,768 words of central memory storage, any combination of disks, disk packs or drums to provide 24 million characters of mass storage, a <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> punch, printer with controllers, and two 7-track magnetic tape units. Larger systems {{can be obtained by}} including optional equipment such as: additional central memory, extended core storage (ECS), additional <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> <b>punches,</b> printers, and tape units. Graphic plotters and microfilm recorders are also available.|$|R

50|$|BSAM is {{used for}} devices that are {{naturally}} sequential, such as <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> <b>punches,</b> line printers, and magnetic tape. It is also used for data on devices that could also be addressed directly, such as magnetic disks. BSAM offers device independence: to the extent possible, the same API calls are used for different devices.|$|R
50|$|A {{data set}} is {{typically}} stored on a {{direct access storage device}} (DASD) or magnetic tape, however unit record devices, such as <b>punch</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> and line printers can provide input/output (I/O) for a data set (file).|$|R

50|$|Spooling is {{also used}} to mediate access to <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> and <b>punches,</b> {{magnetic}} tape drives, and other slow, sequential I/O devices.|$|R
5000|$|Network host to host access from {{commands}} {{and programs}} as well as access to or from remote network printers, <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> and <b>punches.</b>|$|R
50|$|While the H200 {{supported}} {{operation with}} just a console, <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and <b>punch</b> like the IBM 1401, the generic Input-Output instructions also supported line printers and magnetic tape drives.|$|R
50|$|Optional input/output devices {{included}} a <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and <b>punch,</b> a paper tape <b>reader</b> and <b>punch,</b> and a magnetic <b>card</b> <b>reader.</b> The magnetic <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> used a large card (30 cm x 35 cm) {{with the top}} part used as a printer ledger. A 2.5 cm 4-track magnetic strip was {{across the bottom of}} the card.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> {{could read}} <b>punch</b> <b>cards</b> {{at a rate}} of 200 cards per minute.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{stackers}} (NP, 4, 2/8) {{of approximately}} 1000-card after cards are punched. The 2/8 stacker {{is shared by}} the <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and <b>punch,</b> but timing considerations {{make it difficult to}} use for merging operations.|$|R
50|$|A {{peripheral}} first {{offered on}} the Model 20 is the IBM 2560 Multi-Function Card Machine (MFCM). Because of its reliability problems, often involving card jams, the acronym was frequently interpreted as referring to many less favorable names. Nevertheless, the 2560 combines {{the functions of}} a <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> interpreter, and card sorter, allowing the Model 20 to replace several separate pieces of punched-card equipment.|$|R
5000|$|A strong device {{independent}} input/output model {{that allows the}} same commands and programs to access terminals, disk files, printers, magnetic and paper tapes, <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> and <b>punches,</b> floppy disks, network hosts, and an audio response unit (ARU).|$|R
5000|$|Most early computers, {{such as the}} ENIAC, and the IBM NORC, {{provided}} for punched card input/output. [...] <b>Card</b> <b>readers</b> and <b>punches,</b> either connected to computers or in off-line card to/from magnetic tape configurations, were ubiquitous through the mid-1970s.|$|R
5000|$|Sequential {{data sets}} are {{normally}} read or written one record {{at a time}} from beginning to end, using BSAM or QSAM. This was the only technique {{that could be used}} for tape drives, <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> / <b>punches</b> and printers.|$|R
50|$|DOS/360 {{required}} a System/360 CPU (model 25 and above) {{with the standard}} instruction set (decimal and floating-point instruction sets optional). The minimum memory requirement was 16KB; storage protection was required only if multiprogramming was used. A 1052 Model 7 printer-keyboard, either a selector or multiplexor channel, {{and at least one}} disk drive was required â€” initially a 2311 holding 7.25MB. A <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> <b>card</b> <b>punch</b> and line printer were usually included, but magnetic tape drives could be substituted.|$|R
50|$|The CPU {{consisted}} of a total 24 printed circuit boards. The last eight positions in the rack were used for I/O devices operated by program control, such as the console Teletype, punched paper tape and <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and <b>punch,</b> line printer, display, operator's panel, and the real time clock.|$|R
50|$|QSAM is {{used both}} for devices that are {{naturally}} sequential, such as <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> and <b>punches</b> and line printers, and for data on devices that {{could also be}} addressed directly, such as magnetic disks. QSAM offers device independence: to the extent possible, the same API calls are used for different devices.|$|R
5000|$|... 1971: The IBM 129 Card Data Recorder (keypunch and {{auxiliary}} on-line card reader/punch) is the last, {{or among}} the last, 80-column card unit record product announcements (other than <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> and <b>card</b> <b>punches</b> attached to computers).|$|R
50|$|The early ribbon cables {{were used}} in the {{mainframe}} computer industry, on <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> <b>card</b> <b>punching</b> machines, and tape machines. Subsequently ribbon cables were manufactured by a number of different companies, including 3M. Methods and materials were developed to simplify and reduce the cost of ribbon cables, by standardizing the design and spacing of the wires, and the thickness of the insulation, so that they could be easily terminated through the use of insulation displacement connectors (IDC). The simplicity of the cables, their low profile (compared to contemporary alternatives), and low cost due to standardization, meant ribbon cables were long used in computers, printers, and many electronic devices.|$|R
50|$|Punched cards {{had been}} in use since the 1890s; their {{technology}} was mature and reliable. <b>Card</b> <b>readers</b> and <b>punches</b> developed for punched card machines were readily adaptable for computer use. Businesses were familiar with storing data on punched cards and keypunch machines were widely employed. Punched cards were a better fit than other 1950s technologies, such as magnetic tape, for some computer applications as individual cards could easily be updated without having to access a computer.|$|R
50|$|The {{first three}} {{machines}} were {{delivered in the}} northern spring of 1955; in late 1958 a DEUCE Mark II improved model appeared. This version employed a combined <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and <b>punch.</b> The combined IBM 528 <b>reader</b> and <b>punch</b> behaved like the separate Hollerith units on the earlier DEUCE Mark I machines; however, it was provided with hardware conversion of alphanumeric data to BCD on input, and vice versa on output. Data could also be read in and punched simultaneously at 100 cards per minute. The DEUCE Mark IIA provided seven extra mercury delay lines, each of 32 words.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM 533 Input-Output Unit, {{announced}} on July 2, 1953, was a <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and <b>punch</b> {{that served as}} the primary input-output unit for the IBM 650 computer. It had two independent card paths, one for reading and one for punching. IBM cards were fed face down, 12-edge first. All 80 columns could be read and punched by the computer as numeric data, but alphanumeric reading was severely limited on the basic 650 and require special control panel wiring.|$|R
50|$|California State University at Northridge had a dual 3170 that {{provided}} timesharing {{service to the}} California State University and College system. Many of the other campuses also had CDC 3150 machines for local batch operation. In 1970 CDC 3150s were installed at most campuses of the California State College system. San Jose State and LA State got CDC 3300s and served as regional data centers with (very flaky) data links to the other campuses. California State Polytechnic College (San Luis Obispo) and San Diego State University had IBM System/360s. The rest got 3150s. Typical configuration was 24K words of 24-bit core memory, four 7-track tape drives, drum printer, <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> two 8MB disc drives (removable packs). At Humboldt State College where I worked this was used for both administrative and instructional purposes. It replaced an IBM 1620.|$|R
50|$|HASP {{bypassed}} most {{operating system}} services with code specially tailored for efficiency. HASP operated {{as a single}} operating system task and used cooperative multitasking internally to run processors to perform tasks such as running <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> printers, and <b>punches,</b> managing the spool files, communicating with the system operator, and driving multiple communication lines for remote job entry.|$|R
50|$|While the {{architectures}} differ, {{the machines}} {{in the same class}} share electronics technologies and generally use the same peripherals. Tape drives use 7-track format, with the IBM 727 for vacuum tube machines and the 729 for transistor machines. Both the vacuum tube and most transistor models use the same <b>card</b> <b>readers,</b> <b>card</b> <b>punches</b> and line printers that were introduced with the 701. These units, the IBM 711, 721 and 716, are based on IBM accounting machine technology and even include plugboard control panels. They are relatively slow and it was common for 7000 series installations to include an IBM 1401, with its much faster peripherals, to do card-to-tape and tape-to-line-printer operations off-line. Three later machines, the 7010, the 7040 and the 7044, adopted peripherals from the midline IBM 1400 series. Some of the technology for the 7030 was used in data channels and peripheral devices on other 7000 series computers, e.g., 7340 Hypertape.|$|R
50|$|Within {{a couple}} of years of its founding, the company's first computer, the 820, was created as a special project for one customer. SEL's early computers, such as the 810A, the 8500, and the 8600, used wire-wrap {{construction}} to create the numerous system boards and backplane (called a swingplane). Components were low-scale resistor-transistor logic (RTL) integrated circuits comprising a few transistors per chip, and core memory was used. The 840A used all integrated circuit logic. It had up to 16K of 24-bit word core memory, all directly addressable. Cycle time was 1.75 microseconds. It also had three hardware index registers, priority interrupts with 60 levels, memory parity, and memory protect. By 1967, over 30 840A systems had been sold. Software included the 840A Real-Time Monitor, a FORTRAN IV compiler, MNEMBLER Assembler, Mathematical and Utility Routine Library, and Diagnostic Routines. Supported peripherals included: disc storage (24 Mbit, removable), 45-ips 9-track magnetic tape, <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> 300 LPM line printer, and various data acquisition interfaces.|$|R
50|$|A {{free-standing}} console is also provided, {{which includes}} binary displays of the machine's registers and switches to boot and debug programs. User input is by a Teletype Model 35 ASR unit and a high-speed paper tape reader (300 cps). Most systems {{include at least}} two magnetic tape drives, operating at up to 75 inches/second at 800 bpi. The normal variety of peripherals is also available, including magnetic drum units, <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> and <b>punches,</b> and an extensive set of analog-digital/digital-analog conversion devices. A (vector mode) graphic display unit is also available, {{but it does not}} include a means of keyboard input.|$|R
50|$|LEO I's {{clock speed}} was 500 kHz, with most {{instructions}} taking about 1.5 ms to execute. To {{be useful for}} business applications, the computer {{had to be able}} to handle a number of data streams, input and output, simultaneously. Therefore, its chief designer, Dr. John Pinkerton, designed the machine to have multiple input/output buffers. In the first instance, these were linked to fast paper tape <b>readers</b> and <b>punches,</b> fast <b>punched</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> and <b>punches,</b> and a 100 line a minute tabulator. Later, other devices, including magnetic tape, were added. Its ultrasonic delay line memory based on tanks of mercury, with 2K (2048) 35-bit words (i.e., 8Â¾ kilobytes), was four times as large as that of EDSAC. The systems analysis was carried out by David Caminer.|$|R
50|$|Tape Programming Support (TPS) {{supports}} {{systems with}} magnetic tape drives but no disk drives.The minimum configuration for TPS is 4096 bytes of main storage, a <b>card</b> <b>reader,</b> a <b>card</b> <b>punch,</b> a printer and two magnetic tape drives.On such systems TPS provides an assembler and tape manipulation utility programs.Additional capabilities are provided on systems with 8192 bytes of main storage,and still more with {{four or more}} magnetic tape drives.|$|R
