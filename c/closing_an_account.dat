Facebook originally held a policy that profiles of people known to be deceased would be removed after 30 days due to privacy concerns.

Facebook's Privacy Policy regarding memorialization says, [...] "If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the user's account.

The issue was whether the contractual right of <b>a</b> banker to <b>close</b> <b>a</b> client’s <b>account</b> was subject {{to the requirements of}} fairness. The Supreme Court of Appeal held that the Constitution does not envisage the duty of fairness to apply in all contractual settings. Rather, one must consider the specific circumstances of each case to determine whether a constitutional value is implicated. If not, one cannot complain about an overarching requirement of fairness: “If a contract is prima facie contrary to constitutional values, questions of enforcement would not arise. However, enforcement of a prima facie innocent contract may implicate an identified constitutional value. If the value is unjustifiably affected, the term will not be enforced.” ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{videotape}} recording for teaching politeness to learners of English as a Second Language is described. The recording attempts a step-by-step analysis of politeness realization markers and acts, especially face-threatening acts, simultaneously mapped onto the paralinguistic features accompanying them. It contains four bank scenes in which visitors request services of a bank teller, a goal-directed transaction that ultimately fails. Two of the scenes focus on <b>an</b> <b>account</b> withdrawal; two pertain to the <b>closing</b> of <b>an</b> <b>account.</b> In each pair of scenes, one teller handles the situation tactfully and one experiences pragmatic failure. Failure is used to de-emphasize the transaction aspect of the scene and point up the interpersonal aspect. Communication acts and problems are analyzed in captions and narrative voice-over. The intent is to suggest alternatives to behavior that leads to pragmatic failure. A transcription of the video scenes and narrative are appended.
