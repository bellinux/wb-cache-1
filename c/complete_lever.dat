5000|$|In 1862, Vacheron Constantin {{became a}} member of the Association for Research into {{non-magnetic}} materials. In 1885, the company created the first nonmagnetic timepiece which included a <b>complete</b> <b>lever</b> assortment made of materials able to withstand magnetic fields. Its construction included a balance wheel, balance spring and lever shaft that were made of palladium, the lever arms—in bronze and the escape wheel was in gold. In 1877, [...] "Vacheron & Constantin, Fabricants, Geneve" [...] became the official name of the company. In 1880, Vacheron & Constantin started using the Maltese cross as its symbol, which it still does as of 2016. This was inspired by a component of the barrel, which had a cross-shape and was used for limiting the tension within the mainspring.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bridging}} {{controls are}} a basic push button system while the computer assembles {{the bridge and}} deploys it. This limits the crew {{in their ability to}} make corrections based on slight mis-alignment of the chassis before deployment. The bridge must be fully extended, then recovered before corrections in chassis placement can be done. The M60 AVLB (Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge) system was <b>completed</b> by <b>levers</b> and buttons the operator must operate manually, thus giving them the ability to stop bridge deployment and make minute chassis adjustments without having to completely stow the bridge.|$|R
50|$|In February 2005 the Bramley Line Group {{purchased}} five Class 488 coaches, comprising a rake of four Standard {{class and}} one Club Class vehicles. A public appeal raised £2,500 {{to move the}} coaches to March but, following vandalism, it was decided in November 2007 that the coaches should be sold; being purchased by a New Zealand-based railway in May 2008. Bramley Line also acquired the former Smeeth Road signal box, <b>complete</b> with <b>lever</b> frame. Since closure the 'box had {{been used as a}} hairdressers and was complete and in good order. It was removed to a site in Wisbech, where it was stored, but not restored.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{continuation}} of my Engineering Capstone Design. The design itself involves the site plan of a fictitious mixed-use development in Polk County, Florida. The initial design was completed as a group (consisting of five people) under the fabricated engineering firm Lever Engineering, LLC and was completed as if it would be submitted to the County for actual approval. The project was designed over a 20 acre site (with an additional 10 acres available for purchase) in Winter Haven, Florida that is currently being used as a neighborhood park with several youth baseball fields. Lever Engineering was given specific design requirements for the site that were deemed necessary to serve the area’s growing population. In the development, it was requested that the campus include a YMCA with an outdoor pool and children’s athletic field, an elderly assisted living facility, multi-family housing, a child care facility with adequate play area, a library and cultural center, a public health clinic, a passive recreational park complete with forested area and picnic shelter, and a paved walking trail throughout the development. The plans must also include adequate parking, utility layout and design, roadway planning, and a complete stormwater management plan. It was also asked that the development be an integrated site plan with the various components organized and situated in a logical and aesthetic manner, while providing preservation of existing trees and other amenities where practical. Using the design developed, I have made recommendations to the “County” to develop this new neighborhood utilizing Low Impact Development (LID) technologies and practices. The LID proposal focuses on mimicking the natural hydrologic cycle of the area in an attempt to reduce environmental impact of development. Means of implementation include Bioretention swales, pervious pavements, and the strategized use of canopy trees. Each of these elements help stormwater to permeate into the soil as it normally would without development and reduce runoff. The enclosed engineering report <b>completed</b> by <b>Lever</b> Engineering includes the feasibility research of the above project, the site plan (including structural layout, utilities, roadway and parking design, grading details, and an integrated stormwater management plan), required permits, and a cost estimate. Also included within the report are reasons, means, estimated additional cost, and application of incorporating the recommended Low Impact Development technologies into the site...|$|R
60|$|In Lever's story {{there is}} a real change of attitude. There is no relenting towards Potts: he never gains our {{affections}} like Don Quixote and Pickwick: he has not even the infatuate courage of Tappertit. But we dare not laugh at him, because, somehow, we recognize ourselves in Potts. We may, some of us, have enough nerve, enough muscle, enough luck, enough tact or skill or address or knowledge to carry things off better than he did; to impose on the people who saw through him; to fascinate Katinka (who cut Potts so ruthlessly {{at the end of the}} story); but for all that, we know that Potts plays an enormous part in ourselves and in the world, and that the social problem is not a problem of story-book heroes of the older pattern, but a problem of Pottses, and of how to make men of them. To fall back on my old phrase, we have the feeling--one that Alnaschar, Pistol, Parolles, and Tappertit never gave us--that Potts is a piece of really scientific natural history as distinguished from comic story telling. His author is not throwing a stone at a creature of another and inferior order, but making a confession, with the effect that the stone hits everybody full in the conscience and causes their self-esteem to smart very sorely. Hence the failure of Lever's book to please the readers of Household Words. That pain in the self-esteem nowadays causes critics to raise a cry of Ibsenism. I therefore assure them that the sensation first came to me from Lever and may have come to him from Beyle, or at least out of the Stendhalian atmosphere. I exclude the hypothesis of <b>complete</b> originality on <b>Lever's</b> part, because a man can no more be completely original in that sense than a tree can grow out of air.|$|R
40|$|Traffic congestion, lack {{of parking}} spaces, {{and high levels}} of {{pollution}} in urban areas, together with an increased awareness of freight transportation impacts, stress the importance of City Logistics (CL) as a comprehensive approach aimed at mitigating the negative effects of distribution activities without penalizing social, cultural, and economic development. CL faces a relevant degree of complexity, which causes uncertainty about planning and managing urban logistics activities. Several models have been developed to optimize CL focusing on distribution warehouses, freight flows, the routing task, vehicle loading, the size and type of vehicles that can enter urban areas, and possible congestion charges. However, a successful implementation of such models requires a proper level of internal efficiency of the stakeholders involved. Among them, logistics service providers (LSPs) play a crucial role because they are expected to offer high quality services in urban areas. The paper proposes an empirical analysis on the operational factors determining the level of efficiency of a LSP, which is here assessed through productivity. Data about an Italian LSP involved in urban freight distribution are analyzed and a regression analysis is <b>completed.</b> Two managerial <b>levers</b> are found to affect the level of productivity: the organization of the distribution network, and the vehicle loading strategy. The first lever implies a more efficient location of warehouses, an extension of the area covered by each driver and a more effective routing structure. Furthermore, vehicles should not be excessively loaded, especially with big parcels, in order to ensure flexibility. This study represents an attempt to develop a comprehensive panel of operational variables affecting the efficiency of the urban distribution system of LSPs. The enhancement of LSP efficiency contributes to achieve a better quality of life in urban areas as well as the associated economic and environmental benefit...|$|R
