2500|$|Frequently in the U.S. the two carriageways are {{separated}} by some distance (wide medians with small forests or even hills in them), but drivers <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> whether the roadway is two-way or one-way—and, if one-way, {{the direction in which}} the traffic flows—by looking at the striping coloration. [...] For an example, see inset showing U.S. Route 52 near Lafayette, Indiana.|$|E

5000|$|By convention, {{there is}} a type that {{represents}} all other types. It is called [...] (or [...] ). Since [...] is a type, the member of it are objects. There is a dependent type [...] that maps each object to its corresponding type. In most texts [...] is never written.

2500|$|The town name is {{pronounced}} [...] (like [...] "Dairy-Ann"), with {{stress on the}} last syllable, and {{has been referred to}} as such at least as far back as 1913. Residents say this is still the proper pronunciation, which in most American English, including the local variety, is more precisely [...] [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> when someone is not from here, because they do pronounce it the way it's spelled," [...] Louise Berry, director of the town library, said in a 2006 interview.|$|E
2500|$|Yorkshire {{people are}} often stereotyped as {{friendly}} but [...] "bloody-minded", [...] (also known as [...] "Yorkshire-stubborn") and argumentative. Indeed, {{throughout the history of}} the area, dating from the tribal Brigantes, through the Norman period and the Wars of the Roses, the region has seen a number of rebellions against non-Yorkshire or non-Northern rulers. It is this stereotype which is referred to in the saying 'You <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> a Yorkshireman, but you can't tell him much'. However, the popular understanding of the Wars of the Roses is mostly false. The House of York had its support mostly in southern England, while northern England {{on either side of the}} Pennines mainly supported the House of Lancaster. Indeed, the city of York itself was a Lancastrian power base.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} save money by {{eliminating}} the need for model sheets, Bakshi let animator John Sparey draw some of the first sequences of Fritz. Bakshi states that he knew that [...] "Sparey would execute them beautifully." [...] Poses from his sequences were photocopied and handed out {{to the rest of the}} crew. The film was produced almost entirely without pencil tests. According to Bakshi, [...] "We pencil tested I'd say a thousand feet , tops. [...] We do a major feature without pencil tests—that's tough. The timing falls off. I <b>can</b> <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> an animator to draw it better, and I know if the attitude of the characters is right, but the timing you really can't see." [...] Bakshi had to judge the timing of the animation simply by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand, until he could see the completed animation on the screen. Veteran Warner Bros. animator Ted Bonnicksen was incredibly dedicated to his work on the film, to the point where he completed his animation for the synagogue sequence while suffering from leukemia, and would take the scenes home at night to work on them.|$|E

When they're brazen like that, {{and have}} had good looks, you <b>can</b> nearly <b>always</b> <b>tell.</b> You've got to wait for {{something}} to happen, and trust to luck {{to be on the}} spot, or near it. It's a toss-up, of course. One thing is sure, you can't make friends with that kind if they get a notion you're up to anything." ...|$|R

[...] "But if you should ever want a jaw with Jack Molloy while you're in this here port you've only got to hail him at the Sailors' Welcome, an' if he should happen to be out, they <b>always</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you where he's cruisin'. Good-night, an' luck go wi' ye!" ...|$|R
60|$|As we got {{near the}} Clyde the gentleman {{began to talk}} about ship-building, and pretty soon I saw in his face plain {{symptoms}} {{that he was going to}} have an attack of comparison making. I have seen so much of this disorder that I <b>can</b> nearly <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> when it is coming on a person. In about a minute the disease broke out on him, and he {{began to talk about}} the differences between American and English ships. He told Jone and me about a steamship that was built out in San Francisco which shook three thousand bolts out of herself on her first voyage. It seemed to me that that was a good deal like a codfish shaking his bones out through swimming too fast. I couldn't help thinking that that steamship must have had a lot of bolts so as to have enough left to keep her from scattering herself over the bottom of the ocean.|$|R

6000|$|... "MY DEAR NETTA: I {{have told}} you several times about the Mr. Simcoe [...] who saved uncle's life out in India, and who is so {{intimate}} at the [...] house. I can't say that either my acquaintance with or my liking [...] for him increases. He does not {{stand the test of}} the system, and [...] the more I watch his lips the less I understand him. He talks [...] fluently and quickly, and yet somehow I feel that there is a [...] hesitation in his speech, and that his lips are repeating what they [...] have learned, and not speaking spontaneously. You know that we have [...] noticed the same thing among those who have learned to speak by the [...] system but are not yet perfect in it, so I need not explain further [...] what I mean, as you will understand it. For example, I <b>can</b> <b>always</b> [...] <b>tell</b> at a public meeting, or when listening to a preacher, whether [...] he is speaking absolutely extemporarily or whether he has learned [...] his speech by heart beforehand.|$|R
500|$|The Blessing has {{provoked}} a more divided response. Waugh's judgement was {{that those who}} criticised the book were [...] "lazy brutes..... can't bear to see a writer grow up". More recently, Philip Hensher and others have [...] argued that although the novel is immensely enjoyable and that Mitford's [...] "marvellous voice" [...] is undiminished, she is on less sure ground with her [...] "Frenchness" [...] than with the English country house ambience, and her picture of France {{as the embodiment of}} everything civilised is less than convincing. Similar mixed comments greeted Mitford's final novel, Don't Tell Alfred, Waugh again hailing it as her best, [...] "clamouring for a sequel". In this judgement he was largely alone; other critics perceived in the anecdotal framework of the book an uncertainty as to what it was about. An American reviewer wondered what parts were to be taken seriously: [...] "What exactly goes on?... <b>Can</b> you <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> an Etonian, even when he goes beat? Is all modern architecture a fraud? Do U-people really talk this way?" [...] Similar questions were raised in the Times Literary Supplements review, in relation to Mitford's fictional output as a whole: [...] "Would she have been a better novelist if she had 'tried harder', gone in further, dropped the pose of amateurishness, cut the charm, looked beyond the worlds that she knew and, more importantly, loved?" ...|$|R

40|$|A {{basic problem}} with {{complexity}} {{is that we}} would like to characterize all complex systems both verbally and mathematically and do so in a clear, concise and distinctive manner, as do scientists with many of the systems found in other fields. Such characterizations are necessary if we are to distinguish complex systems from other kinds of dynamical systems, influence their functioning, forecast their behavior and formulate the public policies to be followed in dealing with them. In fact, some people seem to be making considerable progress. These include the people who study systems which can be modeled as biotic systems, cellular automata or networks, or as systems which can be adapted to the framework of statistical physics. However, the question remains, {{what about the rest of}} us? Whether or not such characterizations are possible for many types of complex systems remains very much an open question. This paper surveys progress to date and suggests some promising avenues for further research but reaches a guarded conclusion. Complexity is rather like pornography. We <b>can</b> almost <b>always</b> <b>tell</b> a complex system when we see one, but we frequently 1 © Windy Hill Associates 2010.

Moreover, if we don’t “get a better handle ” on complex systems and how they function, we will continue to have a hard time managing them and this, needless to say, is a very important issue. Cardiovascular systems, economies, markets, neurological systems, political societies and large telecommunications systems, to name only a few, are all complex systems, and many of them are not always managed well. So the writer asks his readers, Where do we go from here? Wither complexity...|$|R
