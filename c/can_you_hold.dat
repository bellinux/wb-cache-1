For his own purposes he opened the gates of Distance, he sent me down among the dwellers in Death, causing me to interpret their words for him. I did so, but the dwellers came back out of Death with me, and from that hour they have not left me, nor will they ever leave me; for night by night they sojourn at my side, tormenting me with terrors. He has told me that through my mouth that spirit whom he drew into my body prophesied that he should be 'lifted up above the people.' Let the prophecy be fulfilled, let him be lifted up, for then perchance the ghosts will depart from me and I shall win peace and sleep.

Now, you are the officers of the bodyguard who watch in the ante-chamber to-night, are you not? Well, when the guard is changed at midnight, the eight men who should replace them at {{the doors of the}} room of Salah-ed-din will not arrive; they will be decoyed away by a false order.

30|$|How long <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> your breath? During {{a breath}} hold, what causes you to finally {{give up and}} resume breathing? Although {{there are reports of}} yogis being buried alive and {{surviving}} {{for long periods of time}} (days or weeks) these are mostly anecdotal and may not represent actual occurrences. I like to show my students a film clip from 1929 in British-controlled India of a yogi buried for an hour and a half, after which he is disinterred and is undamaged by the experience. I then ask students to hold their breath as long as possible. Prior to the breath-hold, they are free to hyperventilate a bit if they wish, breathing in and out deeply five or six times. Most untrained humans can only hold their breath for about a minute or so after which the urge to breathe (air hunger or dyspnea) becomes so overwhelming that they must resume breathing.|$|E

30|$|The {{narratives}} {{convey a}} profound weight of responsibility {{felt by the}} participants. In stories of palliative care “done well” in a humanitarian setting, this weight felt lifted or at least lighter {{on the shoulders of}} participants. Many participants could not think of a case where palliative care was done well, but amongst those who could, their experience was a source of deep satisfaction. Providing effective palliative care “…allows the healthcare workers to feel that they are contributing and they haven’t failed” (P 6). However, even when care was done well, these encounters could still haunt participants as morally and existentially significant. For example, a nurse who had worked in an Ebola Treatment Centre described “a little girl, I think about the age of nine, and who called me, ‘Uncle <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> my hand’, and because I knew that we could {{sit down and talk to}} them, so – which I did, and once I held her hand, she died… and so, for - for many, many months, even when I came [home], I could still feel that touch…I could still feel - hear that voice” (P 20). This experience stayed with him, and he described it as one factor in his seeking psychological support after returning from his field mission.|$|E
