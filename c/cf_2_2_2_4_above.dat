Mono-olefins can add to nickel dithiolenes through interligand pathway, which is a two-step process or through intraligand pathway, which is a one-step process.

PFTBA vapour {{can be considered a}} potential greenhouse gas due being radiatively active in the mid-IR spectral region and having a long atmospheric lifetime. A recent paper by Hong et al. 1 as well as comparisons with previous works for the ethylene calculationsc determined that PFTBA has the highest radiative efficiency of any compound detected in the atmosphere with a detected a mixing ratio of 0. 18 parts per trillion by volume over Toronto, ON. Theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations are done using the B 3 LYP method and the 6 - 311 G(d,p) basis set.

It has been shown that man-made halogenated compounds {{play a key role in}} many real-world chemical processes. For example, in combustion, these compounds are used as fire retardant agents, and in atmospheric chemistry, they initiate ozone depletion reactions. [1 - 4] However little is known about the mechanisms governing these processes and many intermediates involved in these processes have been elusive to researchers for diverse reasons such as short lifetime and difficulty in distinguishing products from parents molecules. The studies compiled in this work are focused on exploring the photochemical behavior of various intermediates derived from polyhalogenated compounds.

ITPs were initiated by thermal decomposition of bis(4 -tert-butylcyclohexyl) peroxydicarbonate (BBCHPDC), in solution ({{in the presence of}} acetonitrile). The obtained telomers were characterized by different analyses such as elemental analyses, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and finally by thermal analyses such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses. These technical analyses enabled one to assess their chemical structures, various thermal properties, and their crystalline forms.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{operative in}} thermal oxidative degradation of Fomblin Z and hexafluoropropene oxide derived fluids {{and the effect}} of alloys and additives upon these processes are investigated. The nature of arrangements responsible for the inherent thermal oxidative instability of the Fomblin Z fluids is not established. It was determined that this behavior is not associated with hydrogen end groups or peroxy linkages. The degradation rate of these fluids at elevated temperatures in oxidizing atmospheres is dependent on the surface/volume ratio. Once a limiting ratio is reached, a steady rate appears to be attained. Based on elemental analysis and oxygen consumption data, <b>CF</b> <b>2</b> OCF <b>2</b> <b>CF</b> <b>2</b> O <b>2,</b> no. <b>CF</b> <b>2</b> <b>CF</b> <b>2</b> O, {{is one of the major}} arrangements present.

The effectiveness of antioxidation anticorrosion additives, P- 3 and phospha-s-triazine, in the presence of metal alloys is very limited at 316 C; at 288 C the additives arrested almost completely the fluid degradation. The phospha-s-triazine appears to be at least twice as effective as the P- 3 compound; it also protected the coupon better.

Detailed structure/properties relationship analyses demonstrated a lack of correlation between anion chemical structure, ionic conductivity, and glass transition temperatures. Among synthesized series, the PIL derivative having bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide counter anion showed the best compromise in performance: low glass transition temperature (T-g=- 268 degrees C), high thermal stability (T-onset = 340 degrees C) and superior ionic conductivity (sigma(DC) = 8. 5 x 10 (- 6) S/cm at 30 degrees C), which makes it an interesting candidate for various key modern electrochemical applications...|$|R
