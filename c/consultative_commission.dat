25|$|Although unified as {{a single}} nation at independence, {{the south and the}} north were, from an {{institutional}} perspective, two separate countries. Italy and the United Kingdom had left the two with separate administrative, legal, and education systems in which affairs were conducted according to different procedures and in different languages. Police, taxes, and the exchange rates of their respective currencies also differed. Their educated elites had divergent interests, and economic contacts between the two regions were virtually nonexistent. In 1960 the United Nations created the <b>Consultative</b> <b>Commission</b> for Integration, an international board headed by UN official Paolo Contini, to guide the gradual merger of the new country's legal systems and institutions and to reconcile the differences between them. (In 1964 the <b>Consultative</b> <b>Commission</b> for Legislation succeeded this body. Composed of Somalis, it took up its predecessor's work under the chairmanship of Mariano.) But many southerners believed that, because of experience gained under the Italian trusteeship, theirs was the better prepared of the two regions for self-government. Northern political, administrative, and commercial elites were reluctant to recognize that they now had to deal with Mogadishu.|$|E

25|$|Local level At {{the local}} level, in {{municipalities}} {{with more than}} 10,000 inhabitants <b>Consultative</b> <b>Commissions</b> for Local Public Services assist municipalities in regulating service providers. The Commissions were created through the 1992 water law. After the commissions initially met with little success, they were strengthened through another law in 2002. Their purpose now is to provide better information on public services through the review of annual reports by the service providers and to be consulted on key decisions such as the delegation of service provision {{to the private sector}} or the creation of a municipal enterprise. The <b>consultative</b> <b>commissions</b> are usually chaired by the mayor and their members are members of the municipal council or are nominated by the municipal council. According to a 2003 report by the Cour des Comptes only few Consultative Committees have been created and, where they have been created, they have sometimes never met.|$|R

In November 1979 Minister of Internal Affairs Allan Highet suggested that {{the design of the}} flag should be changed, and sought an artist to design a new flag with a silver fern on the fly, but the proposal attracted little support. In 1998 Prime Minister Jenny Shipley backed Cultural Affairs Minister Marie Hasler's call for the flag to be changed. Shipley, along with the New Zealand Tourism Board, backed the quasi-national silver fern flag, using a white silver fern on a black background as a possible alternative flag, {{along the lines of the}} Canadian Maple Leaf flag.
