40|$|In a subchronic 90 -day oral {{toxicity}} study, 5 {{groups of}} F 2 -descendants of BIO F 1 D Alexander hamsters received 0, 275, 550, 1, 100 and 2, 200 mg/kg b. w. /day doses, respectively, of <b>calcium</b> <b>cyclamate</b> in the drinking water. These doses caused no {{adverse health effects}} in any treated animal and the multifocal myocardial calcifications, detectable at a 100 % incidence in {{the male and female}} control hamsters were not exacerbated by the sweetener. Instead, the myocardial lesions exhibited a striking negative dose-response relationship with a 0 % incidence in the males and a 5 % incidence in the female hamsters of the highest dose group...|$|E
40|$|The sperm of (C 57 BL X C 3 H) F 1 mice were {{examined}} 1, 4, and 10 weeks after a subacute treatment {{with one of}} 25 chemicals at two or more dose levels. The fraction of sperm that were abnormal in shape was elevated above control values of 1. 2 - 3. 4 % for methyl methanesulfonate, ethyl methanesulfonate, griseofulvin, benzo[a]pyrene, METEPA [tris(2 -methyl-l-aziridinyl) phosphine oxide], THIO-TEPA [tris(l-aziridinyl) phosphine sulfide], mitomycin C, myleran, vinblastine sulphate, hydroxyurea, 3 -methylcholanthrene, colchicine, actinomycin D, imuran, cyclophosphamide, 5 -iododeoxyuridine, dichlorvos, aminopterin, and trimethylphosphate. Dimethylnitrosamine, urethane, DDT [1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane], 1, 1 -dimethylhydrazine, caffeine, and <b>calcium</b> <b>cyclamate</b> did not induce elevated levels of sperm abnormalities. The results suggest that sperm abnormalities might provide a rapid inexpensive mammalian screen for agents that lead to errors in the differentiation of spermatogenic stem cells in vivo and thus indicate agents which might prove to be mutagenic, teratogenic, or carcinogenic...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} 14 subjects, {{who had been}} {{identified}} from 261 volunteers in a 1 -week screen as being able to metabolize the sweetener cyclamate to cyclohexylamine (> 0. 2 % of a daily dose), and 31 nonconverters (< 0. 2 % metabolism) were given <b>calcium</b> <b>cyclamate</b> tablets (equivalent to 250 mg cyclamic acid, 3 times daily) {{for a period of}} 13 weeks. The metabolism of cyclamate to cyclohexylamine was determined using twice-weekly timed (3 h) urine collections during week 1 – 3 and 7 – 13. Urine specimens were collected on all other study days to investigate day-to-day fluctuations in cyclohexylamine excretion. Analyses of the twice weekly timed urine collections showed that subjects recruited as nonconverters essentially remained nonconverters. Of the converters, three showed consistently low metabolism, five showed erratic metabolism, five showed low metabolism initially, which increased during {{the latter part of the}} study, and one subject showed consistently high metabolism throughout the study. Analysis of the day-to-day urine specimens showed marked intrasubject variability. The plasma concentrations of cyclohexylamine measured on weeks 1 – 3 and 7 – 13 reflected the urine profiles. The highest individual long-term average steady-state excretion values based on the 3 -h urine collections and daily samples were 21 %, 23 %, 25 %, 29 %, 34 %, and 38 %. The maximum % metabolism detected in the high converters occasionally reached the value of 60 % reported in previous short-term studies, but this high activity was not maintained, and was followed by periods of lower metabolism. The results of this metabolism study support an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0 – 11 mg/kg body weight per day...|$|E
40|$|Bangladesh, often {{better known}} {{to the outside world}} as a country of natural calamities, {{is one of the most}} densely {{populated}} countries in the world. Despite rapid urbanization, more than 75 % of the people still live in rural areas. The density of the rural population is also one of the highest in the world. Being a poor and low-income country, its main challenge is to eradicate poverty through increasing equitable income. Since its independence in 1971, Bangladesh has experienced many ups and downs, but over the past three decades, its gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an impressive rate. Consequently, the country s economy is developing and the country has outperformed many low-income countries in terms of several social indicators. Bangladesh has achieved the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary school enrollment. A sharp decline in child and infant mortality rates, increased per capita income, and improved food security have placed Bangladesh on the track to achieving in the near future the status of a middle-income country. All these developments have influenced the consumption pattern of the country. This study explores the consumption scenario of rural Bangladesh, its changing consumption patterns, the relationship between technology and consumption in rural Bangladesh, cultural consumption in rural Bangladesh, and the myriad reasons why consumers nevertheless feel compelled to consume chemically treated foods. Data were collected in two phases in the summers of 2006 and 2008. In 2006, the empirical data were collected from the following three sources: interviews with consumers, producers/sellers, and doctors and pharmacists; observations of sellers/producers; and reviews of articles published in the national English and Bengali (the national language of Bangladesh) daily newspapers. A total of 110 consumers, 25 sellers/producers, 7 doctors, and 7 pharmacists were interviewed and observed. In 2008, data were collected through semi-structured in-depth qualitative interviews, ethnography, and unstructured conversations substantiated by secondary sources and photographs; the total number of persons interviewed was 22. [...] Data were also collected on the consumption of food, clothing, housing, education, medical facilities, marriage and dowry, the division of labor, household decision making, different festivals such as Eid (for Muslims), the Bengali New Year, and Durga puja (for Hindus), and leisure. Qualitative methods were applied to the data analysis and were supported by secondary quantitative data. The findings of this study suggest that the consumption patterns of rural Bangladeshis are changing over time along with economic and social development, and that technology has rendered aspects of daily life more convenient. This study identified the perceptions and experiences of rural people regarding technologies in use and explored how culture is associated with consumption. This study identified the reasons behind the use of hazardous chemicals (e. g. <b>calcium</b> carbide, sodium <b>cyclamate,</b> cyanide and formalin, etc.) in foods as well as the extent to which food producers/sellers used such chemicals. In addition, this study assessed consumer perceptions of and attitudes toward these contaminated food items and explored how adulterated foods and food stuffs affect consumer health. This study also showed that consumers were aware that various foods and food stuffs contained hazardous chemicals, and that these adulterated foods and food stuffs were harmful to their health. This study aims to identify the consumption patterns of rural Bangladesh and its changes over time. Moreover, this present study aims to answer many questions related to everyday life: How does consumption shape the lifestyles of rural people? What are their consumption experiences? How is the culture associated with consumption? What is the relationship between consumption and technology? This study also sheds light on the emerging consumer culture characterized by various Bangladeshi practices, discourses, and institutions...|$|R
