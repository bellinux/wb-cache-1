3000|$|After {{conversion}} from raw MIMOSA 26 {{data to the}} LCIO data format, a hot pixel {{search is}} performed marking pixels with firing frequencies above a certain threshold. Clusters are formed from fired, adjacent pixels and translated from two-dimensional entities on the individual telescope planes into hits in a global three-dimensional reference frame. Clusters containing at least one hot pixel are removed from the analysis. Triplets are built from hits in the three upstream and three downstream planes separately: First, doublets are defined by straight lines from all hits in plane 0 to all hits in plane 2. A valid triplet is found, if a matching hit in plane 1 is present within a matching distance of 100 μm, non-valid triplets are discarded. Triplet isolation is ensured by rejecting all triplets whose extrapolation at a chosen z-coordinate approaches other triplet extrapolations closer than 300 μm, the z-coordinate being the <b>centre</b> between <b>plane</b> 2 and plane 3. The procedure is repeated for the downstream planes. Matching triplets from the up- and downstream planes are identified by isolated triplets that intersect within a radius of 100 μm, again at the <b>centre</b> between <b>plane</b> 2 and plane 3.

In this paper we present the first application of the multiobjective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to the GENIE- 1 Earth System Model (ESM). Twelve model parameters are tuned to improve four objective measures of fitness to observational data. Grid computing and data handling technology is harnessed to perform the concurrent simulations that comprise the generations of the genetic algorithm.

The porosity distributions over the <b>centre</b> <b>plane</b> and at the surface were transferred into 2 D, and the damage accumulation was followed using the Gurson material model. The initial damage within the gear is here interpreted as the porosity distribution resulting from the manufacturing compaction process. It was found that an accurate description of initial damage distribution only has a small narrow influence on the resulting damage. The damage accumulation is a highly local phenomenon, and that the damage development is highly dependent on the local initial damage at the gear root. Based on this, a simple life estimate model, relating the number of cycles to accumulate a pre-described amount of damage to applied load and initial damage, is also presented...|$|E

40|$|During {{hot rolling}} a texture {{gradient}} is developed through {{the thickness of}} the slab.

The strain path is further complicated when a number of roll passes are involved, since the material is subjected to more complex strain paths. In the current investigation the effects of roll pass schedule (rolling direction, i. e. reverse rolling or continuous rolling) on the texture development during deformation and subsequent annealing have been characterised for an Al- 1 %Mn alloy. The study has shown that the texture of the surface region of the slabs is dependent on the roll pass schedule.

The method of design of experiments was used to investigate statistically the effects of processing variables on the microstructural features of the mouldings. The morphological features were identified by microtoming the samples in both transverse and longitudinal (flow) directions and observing the microtomed sections under a polarised light microscope. Morphology evolution along the flow direction was followed by microtoming the specimens along the <b>centre</b> <b>plane</b> longitudinally and sequentially. A five-layer skin core structure was identified for micromoulded polyoxymethylene.
