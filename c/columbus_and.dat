5000|$|A 2015 {{study of}} mammoth molars {{confirmed}} that M. columbi evolved from Eurasian M. trogontherii, not M. meridionalis {{as had been}} suggested earlier, and noted that M. <b>columbi</b> <b>and</b> M. trogontherii were so similar in morphology that their classification as separate species may be questionable. The study also suggested that the animals in the range where M. <b>columbi</b> <b>and</b> M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. In 2016, a genetic study of North American mammoth specimens confirmed that M. <b>columbi</b> <b>and</b> M. primigenius interbred extensively, were both descended from M. trogontherii, and concluded that morphological differences between fossils may therefore not be reliable for determining taxonomy. The authors also questioned whether M. <b>columbi</b> <b>and</b> M. primigenius should be considered [...] "good species", considering {{that they were able}} to interbreed after supposedly being separated for a million years, but cautioned that more specimens need to be sampled.|$|R
