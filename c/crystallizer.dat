5000|$|Whichever {{the form}} of the <b>crystallizer,</b> to achieve an {{effective}} process control it is important to control the retention time and the crystal mass, to obtain the optimum conditions in terms of crystal specific surface and the fastest possible growth. This is achieved by a separation - to put it simply - of the crystals from the liquid mass, in order to manage the two flows in a different way. The practical way is to perform a gravity settling to be able to extract (and possibly recycle separately) the (almost) clear liquid, while managing the mass flow around the <b>crystallizer</b> to obtain a precise slurry density elsewhere. A typical example is the DTB (Draft Tube and Baffle) <b>crystallizer,</b> an idea of Richard Chisum Bennett (a Swenson engineer and later President of Swenson) {{at the end of the}} 1950s. The DTB <b>crystallizer</b> (see images) has an internal circulator, typically an axial flow mixer - yellow - pushing upwards in a draft tube while outside the <b>crystallizer</b> there is a settling area in an annulus; in it the exhaust solution moves upwards at a very low velocity, so that large crystals settle - and return to the main circulation - while only the fines, below a given grain size are extracted and eventually destroyed by increasing or decreasing temperature, thus creating additional supersaturation. A quasi-perfect control of all parameters is achieved as DTF crystallizers offer superior control over crystal size and characteristics. This <b>crystallizer,</b> and the derivative models (Krystal, CSC, etc.) could be the ultimate solution if not for a major limitation in the evaporative capacity, due to the limited diameter of the vapour head and the relatively low external circulation not allowing large amounts of energy to be supplied to the system.|$|E

Batch <b>crystallizers</b> are widely used in production of fine chemicals, food ingredients, specialty chemicals, and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Control of the crystalline material properties is a challenging task due to complexity and nonlinearity of batch crystallization processes and the lack of reliable measurement and actuation techniques. The goal of the research presented in this thesis was to design, validate, and evaluate different model-based control strategies for industrial batch <b>crystallizers.</b> A systematic approach was adopted in the development of control strategies that satisfy the requirements of industrial control systems. The followed approach included a number of steps such as process modeling, model reduction, controllability analysis, and control-system design. In the iterative design process, a particular attention was paid to experimental validation of the full-order and reduced crystallization models, state estimators, and model-based controllers by making use of pilot crystallization facilities of different scale and type. As a result of an extensive experimental study, the seeding technology was shown to be the pillar of the designed model-based control systems as it resulted in a reproducible operation and an improved quality of the end product. The yield of the crystalline product was increased by using model-based predictive optimizing controllers. For the given chemical system and batch <b>crystallizers,</b> linear control techniques were shown to be as suitable as nonlinear control methods for application in the designed strategies for control of the crystallization process.

40|$|An {{increasing}} demand for pure enantiomers in last years {{is motivated by}} the high interest of the pharmaceutical and agricultural industry in chiral components. The well known fact is that usually, {{only one of the}} enantiomers shows the desired properties. In general two strategies for achieving pure enantiomers has been developed, i. e. enantioselective synthesis and separation of enantiomers from racemic mixtures. In opposite to the commonly used separation methods like chromatography an attractive and relatively simple process is the so-called enantioselective preferential crystallization [1]. Up to now this concept has been applied only for conglomerates. In solution such systems tend to reach an equilibrium state in which the liquid phase will have racemic composition and the solid phase will consist of a mixture of crystals of both enantiomers. However, before approaching this state, it is possible to preferentially produce just one of the enantiomers after seeding with homochiral crystals. Perfectly mixed batch <b>crystallizers</b> can be described mathematically in a simplified manner using a dynamic, one dimensional model which includes experimentally determined kinetic parameters. Such a model was applied in order to describe the process for the threonine-H 2 O system [2]. Based on the simplified approach, attractive and more effective operation modes using two <b>crystallizers</b> coupled via liquid phase has been studied. In each vessel one of both enantiomers is crystallizing simultaneously. An exchange of the liquid phase between the <b>crystallizers</b> leads to an increase of the process productivity. The influence of important process variables like enantiomeric excess, initial seed size distribution, exchange flow rate between <b>crystallizers,</b> and temperature has been analyzed theoretically. The results of the influence of enantiomeric excess (e. e.) in mother liquor on the productivity of the process are shown in Fig. 1 where an increase of e. e. leads to higher productivity. Furthermore for a given e. e. an optimal time exists for starting the exchange of the crystal-free mother liquids. [1] JACQUES, J.; COLLET, A.; WILEN, S. H.

40|$|The {{design of}} current {{industrial}} <b>crystallizers</b> is strongly focussed on optimization of known types of crystallization equipment. These <b>crystallizers</b> harbour various physical phenomena, which are strongly entangled. The application of generic principles of process intensification (PI) to crystallization processes requires individual control over physical phenomena. A new design method is applied that exploits elementary processing functions as {{building blocks for}} design instead of existing equipment, which enables the application of generic principles of PI. Innovations {{in the field of}} crystallization to manipulate shear forces, manipulate nucleation rates with external fields, and improve control over solvent removal with membranes are key technologies. A case study demonstrates the application of task-based design for solution crystallization. The results show how task-based design leads to high modularization of the process representation and model architecture. In addition, task-based design enables the application of generic PI principles, which results in a large flexibility to manipulate final product quality. Future needs include generalization of task-based design for crystallization and development of novel technologies for single task manipulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
