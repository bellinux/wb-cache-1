40|$|Gas-cluster ion-beam (GCIB) {{processing}} of surfaces provides individual atoms within an accelerated gas cluster (~ 1, 500 atoms per cluster), an energy approximately {{equal to the}} individual bond energy of the target surface atoms. The gas-cluster beam is thus capable of providing smoothing and etching of the extreme surface of numerous semiconductors, metals, insula-tors, and magnetic materials. For semiconductor material systems, the gas-cluster processing effect {{on the surface and}} subsurface material is of critical interest for device and circuitry application integrity. In the case of III-V GaSb, chemo-mechanical or touch polishing is the final step in the semiconductor-wafer manufacturing process, often leaving scratches of vari-ous depths or damage on the polished surface.

40|$|Recent rapid {{development}} of non-volatile memory and high density SRAM {{has called for}} the need of high quality dielectric on polysilicon. The high quality dielectric can improve the performance of TFT on SRAM as well as reliability of EEPROM. Dielectric on polysilicon substrate exhibits inferior properties compared with that grown on bulk Silicon or SOI. One of the major causes is the surface roughness of polysilicon film. By reducing the surface roughness of the polysilicon film, dielectric and TFT with improved properties can be realized. Two methods were proposed to improve the dielectric quality, the first one begin <b>Chemical-Mechanical</b> <b>Polish</b> (CMP) and the second one Metal-Induced-Lateral- Crystallization (MILC). Under Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), it is founded that the polysilicon film with either of CMP or MILC treatment possesses surface with reduced surface roughness when compared with polysilicon film without any treatment. It is found that on the planarized polysilicon film, dielectric can exhibit higher breakdown E-field, lower charge trapping rate, lower tunneling current density and higher charge to breakdown value.

50|$|Plating {{relies on}} liquid precursors, often a {{solution}} of water with a salt of the metal to be deposited. Some plating processes are driven entirely by reagents in the solution (usually for noble metals), but {{by far the most}} commercially important process is electroplating.

50|$|The {{extensive}} use of ultra-low-k dielectrics (such as spin-on polymers or other porous materials) means that conventional photolithography, etch, or even <b>chemical-mechanical</b> <b>polishing</b> processes {{are unlikely to be}} used, because these materials contain a high density of voids and gaps. At the ~10 nm scale, quantum tunneling (especially through gaps) becomes a significant phenomenon. Controlling gaps on these scales by means of electromigration can produce interesting electrical properties.|$|E
40|$|Non-volatile {{memory is}} an {{important}} part in low-power portable electronics such as PDA, mobile phone, digital camera as well as recently booming RFID. Recently development in such devices, especially digital camera, has spurred the need of high density non-volatile memory storage with reasonable cost. This can only be achieved by continuation of flash memory cell scaling, which is the mostly used non-volatile memory nowadays. However, the scaling of Flash memory cell has always been lagging behind that of logic CMOS due to the tight constrain in the lower limit of the gate dielectric and the existence of floating gate in floating-gate type memory cell. In this study, a 2 -D analytical model of the channel potential in the floating-gate flash memory cell is developed to study the effect of the floating-gate on the device scaling and it is found that the impact of the floating-gate increases with device scaling. To ensure the continuation of flash memory cell scaling, the interpoly capacitance must be increased which spurs the need of improved inter-poly dielectric performance. Conventionally, the inter-poly dielectric has always been of inferior quality due to the surface roughness as well as the existence of grain boundaries on the poly-Silicon floating gate. To improve the situation, two methods, CMP (<b>Chemical-Mechanical</b> <b>Polish)</b> and MILC (Metal Induced Lateral Crystallization), are developed to allow the formation of high quality dielectric on top of the floating gate. With the improved dielectric, it is believed that the scaling beyond l 00 nm can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Because {{the surface}} plays an {{important}} role in the electrical and optical properties of GaN devices, an improved understanding of surface effects should help optimize device performance. In this work, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and related techniques have been used to characterize three unique sets of n-type GaN samples. The sample sets comprised freestanding bulk GaN with Ga polar and N polar surfaces, epitaxial GaN films with laterally patterned Ga- and N-polar regions on a common surface, and truncated, hexagonal GaN microstructures containing Ga-polar mesas and semipolar facets. Morphology studies revealed that bulk Ga-polar surfaces treated with a <b>chemical-mechanical</b> <b>polish</b> (CMP) were the flattest of the entire set, with rms values of only 0. 4 nm. Conducting AFM (CAFM) indicated unexpected insulating behavior for N-polar GaN bulk samples, but showed expected forward and reverse-bias conduction for periodically patterned GaN samples. Using scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, these same patterned samples demonstrated surface potential differences between the two polarities of up to 0. 5 eV, where N-polar showed the expected higher surface potential. An HCl cleaning procedure used to remove the surface oxide decreased this difference between the two regions by 0. 2 eV. It is possible to locally inject surface charge and measure the resulting change in surface potential using CAFM in conjunction with SKPM. After injecting electrons using a 10 V applied voltage between sample and tip, the patterned polarity samples reveal that the N-polar regions become significantly more negatively charged as compared to Ga-polar regions, with up to a 2 eV difference between charged and uncharged N polar regions. This result suggests that the N-polar regions have a thicker surface oxide that effectively stores charge. Removal of this oxide layer using HCl results in significantly decreased surface charging behavior. A phenomenological model was then developed to fit the discharging behavior of N-polar GaN with good agreement to experimental data. Surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements obtained using SKPM further support the presence of a thicker surface oxide for N polar GaN based on steady state and restoration SPV behaviors. Scanning probe microscopy techniques have therefore been used to effectively discriminate between the surface morphological and electrical behaviors of Ga- vs. N-polar GaN...|$|R

The technique relies on the separation of a thin epi-GaAs tilm from its substrate followed by direct bonding of the thin film to a silicon substrate.
