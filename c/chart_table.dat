25|$|Moving aft {{into the}} saloon, {{there is a}} {{straight}} settee to port, the aft end of which provides seating for the aft facing nav station. A removable seat back slips in to give the navigator a comfortable back rest. The nav station has drawer storage beneath it and a large <b>chart</b> <b>table</b> with ample room to spread out on it. The electronics and electrical panels are arrayed in a convenient console style.|$|E
25|$|The Whitley had {{a crew of}} five: a pilot, co-pilot/navigator, a bomb aimer, a {{wireless}} operator, and a rear gunner. The pilot and second pilot/navigator {{sat side by side}} in the cockpit, with the wireless operator further back. The navigator rotated to use the <b>chart</b> <b>table</b> behind him. The bomb aimer position was in the nose with a gun turret located directly above. The fuselage aft of the wireless operator was divided horizontally by the bomb bay; behind the bomb bay was the main entrance and aft of that the rear turret. The offensive armaments were stowed in two separate bomb bays housed within the fuselage, along with a further 14 smaller cells contained within the wing area. Bomb racks capable of holding larger bombs were installed on the Whitley Mk III variant.|$|E
2500|$|At 8:55pm, with Voyager still {{turning to}} port, Melbournes {{navigator}} ordered the carrier's engines to half astern speed, with Robertson ordering an increase to full astern {{a few seconds}} later. At the same time, Stevens, returning to Voyagers bridge from the nearby <b>chart</b> <b>table,</b> gave the order [...] "Full ahead both engines. Hard a-starboard.", before instructing the destroyer's Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late to avoid a collision; Melbourne hit Voyager at 8:56pm.|$|E

2500|$|After {{spending}} time in the Pearl Harbor shipyard for $18 million in scheduled repairs, Port Royal departed for the open ocean off Oahu for sea trials at 08:15 on 5 February 2009. [...] The ship's fathometer was broken. [...] At 12:01, the Voyage Management System's (VMS— an automated navigation system) primary input at the <b>chart</b> <b>table</b> was shifted from a forward Global Positioning System to forward Ring Laser Gyro Navigation, an inertial navigator. [...] Three times the VMS dead-reckoned the ship's location, mistakenly reporting the ship's location as [...] from its actual position. [...] The error was not noticed by watchstanders. [...] The ship was undergoing her first sea trials, including full power, steering and helicopter flight operation checks.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{furnishings}} of the Contessa 32 cabin {{are typical}} of boats of her size and vintage. There is a V-shaped berth in the bow, followed by a small head (toilet) to port opposite a wet-locker and shower. The saloon (main cabin area) includes a folding table, with sofas that double as berths, the table lowering to convert the port berth to a double. At the aft end of the saloon next to the companionway, and to port, is a small U-shaped galley, consisting of a stove, sink (fed by an 18-gallon freshwater tank), and a counter. To starboard, there is a <b>chart</b> <b>table,</b> with a quarter berth extending aft of the navigators seat. An inboard marine diesel engine of 15 to 25 horsepower is mounted beneath the cockpit, fed by a 12-gallon fuel tank. Modern boats have a Beta Marine 20 or 25 horsepower engine with folding or feathering propellor, in conventional or hybrid configuration.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to its wooden wings, {{the hull of}} the CAMS 110 was all metal. [...] It was built from transverse and longitudinal light alloy frames and covered with védal, duralumin with an outer layer of aluminium for protection from sea-water. The planing bottom had two steps, one under {{the trailing edge of}} the wing and the other further aft. Longitudinal stability was assured by wing floats of similar construction to the hull. [...] The CAMS 110 was intended for long flights and carried five or six crew, all in enclosed accommodation. The commander, who was navigator, observer and bomb-aimer was housed in the nose in a cabin with three windows on each side and provided with a <b>chart</b> <b>table.</b> He could also operate one of the two machine guns on mounts just aft of the windows or use a position in the roof from which, behind a folding glass windscreen, he could observe in the open air. On top of the fuselage, offset to port, was a long glazed cabin which seated two pilots in tandem, provided with dual control. Below, {{on the other side of}} the fuselage was the flight engineer's position and behind him the radio operator's post. Machine gun mounts allowed a gunner to cover either side. Further aft there was a sleeping compartment, a kitchen and a toilet.|$|E

Behind these and facing forwards the wireless operator sat on a seat at the front of the main spar. On his left was a window, and above him was the astrodome, used for visual signalling and by the navigator for celestial navigation.|$|E

A wall separates the aft {{end of the}} galley from the cockpit sail locker. The galley is separated on its forward side from the main cabin by a low wall. Aft of the <b>chart</b> <b>table</b> is a quarter berth. Forward of the <b>chart</b> <b>table</b> and galley are two settees; the port settee is able to unfold into a double sleeping berth. Forward is a hanging locker to the starboard side and a head to the port side. The mast passes through the cabin roof at the aft-most point of the head. At the most forward section of the main cabin is door to the v-berth, master stateroom. This sleeping area contains a second hanging locker, plus an anchor locker door at the narrow end of the v-berth. The head has a door, sink with storage underneath, shower, and toilet. The galley has a sink, refrigerator or icebox, and a combined stove/oven.|$|E
