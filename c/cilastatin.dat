50|$|<b>Cilastatin</b> is a {{chemical}} compound which inhibits the human enzyme dehydropeptidase.|$|E
5000|$|It is a broad-spectrum {{beta-lactam}} containing equal {{quantities of}} imipenem and <b>cilastatin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Imipenem is metabolized in {{the kidney}} by dehydropeptidase 1; {{activity}} is blocked by <b>cilastatin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dehydropeptidase is {{an enzyme}} {{found in the}} kidney and is {{responsible}} for degrading the antibiotic imipenem. <b>Cilastatin</b> can therefore be combined intravenously with imipenem {{in order to protect}} it from dehydropeptidase and prolong its antibacterial effect. Imipenem alone is an effective antibiotic and can be given without the <b>cilastatin.</b> <b>Cilastatin</b> itself does not have antibiotic activity although it has been proved to be active against a zinc-dependent beta-lactamase that usually confer antibiotic resistance to certain bacteria; more precisely the carbapenem family of antibiotics. This property is due to the physico-chemical similarities between membrane dipeptidase (MDP), the compound it is usually set to target, and the bacterial metallo-beta-lactamase carried by the CphA gene Therefore, <b>cilastatin</b> is considered a beta-lactamase inhibitor, not an antibiotic per se. But as with other combinations of an antibiotic with an enzyme inhibitor, the combination allows the antibiotic to be more effective by changing the pharmacokinetics involved. Thus imipenem/cilastatin, like amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, is a commonly used combination product.|$|E
50|$|Imipenem {{inhibits}} bacterial cell-wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins; <b>cilastatin</b> prevents renal metabolism of imipenem.|$|E
50|$|Imipenem {{is rapidly}} {{degraded}} by the renal enzyme dehydropeptidase 1 when administered alone, and {{is almost always}} coadministered with <b>cilastatin</b> to prevent this inactivation.|$|E
50|$|Primaxin IV is a {{combination}} of imipenem, <b>cilastatin</b> sodium, and sodium bicarbonate which is added as a buffer.Primaxin IM lacks the sodium bicarbonate buffer.|$|E
50|$|Imipenem/cilastatin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Primaxin among others, is an {{antibiotic}} useful {{for the treatment of}} a number of bacterial infections. It is made from a combination of imipenem and <b>cilastatin.</b> Specifically it is used for pneumonia, sepsis, endocarditis, joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, and urinary tract infections. It is given by injection into a vein or muscle.|$|E
5000|$|Imipenem, {{the first}} {{clinically}} used carbapenem, was developed at Merck and Co. It was approved {{for use in}} the United States in 1985. [...] Imipenem is hydrolyzed in the mammalian kidney by a dehydropeptidase enzyme to a nephrotoxic intermediate, and thus is co-formulated with the dehydropeptidase inhibitor <b>cilastatin.</b> [...] Imipenem is available in both intravenous and intramuscular formulations.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, {{diarrhea}}, and pain {{at the site}} of injection. Other side effects may include Clostridium difficile diarrhea and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Imipenem is in the carbapenem family of medications and works by interfering with the bacteria's cell wall. <b>Cilastatin</b> blocks the activity of dehydropeptidase I which prevents the breakdown of imipenem.|$|E
50|$|Meropenem is {{bactericidal}} except against Listeria monocytogenes, {{where it}} is bacteriostatic. It inhibits bacterial wall synthesis like other β-lactam antibiotics. In contrast to other beta-lactams, it is highly resistant to degradation by β-lactamases or cephalosporinases. In general, resistance arises due to mutations in penicillin-binding proteins, production of metallo-β-lactamases, or resistance to diffusion across the bacterial outer membrane. Unlike imipenem, it is stable to dehydropeptidase-1, so can be given without <b>cilastatin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Thienamycin is {{extremely}} unstable and decomposes in aqueous solution. Consequently, it is impractical for the clinical treatment of bacterial infections, so stable derivatives were created for medicinal consumption. One such derivative [...] - [...] imipenem [...] - [...] was formulated in 1985. Imipenem, an N-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin, is rapidly metabolized by a renal dipeptidase enzyme {{found in the}} human body. To prevent its rapid degradation, imipenem is normally coadministered with <b>cilastatin,</b> an inhibitor of this enzyme.|$|E
50|$|Meropenem {{is stable}} to {{mammalian}} dehydropeptidases {{and does not}} require co-administration of <b>cilastatin.</b> It was approved {{for use in the}} United States in 1996. In most indications it is somewhat more convenient to administer than imipenem, 3 times a day rather than 4. Doses of less than one gram may be administered as an IV bolus, whereas imipenem is usually administered as a 20-minute to one hour infusion. Meropenem is somewhat less potent than imipenem against gram-positive pathogens, and somewhat more potent against gram-negative infections. Unlike imipenem, which produced an unacceptable rate of seizures in a phase 2 trial, meropenem is effective for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. A systematic review performed by an employee of the company that markets meropenem concluded that it provides a higher bacterial response and lower adverse event rates than imipenem in people with severe infections, but no difference in mortality rate.|$|E
50|$|Imipenem {{is rapidly}} {{degraded}} by the renal enzyme dehydropeptidase if administered alone (making it less effective); the metabolites can cause kidney damage.Imipenem is a broad-spectrum betalactam antibiotic used for severe bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms. Because imipenem is rapidly inactivated by renal dehydropeptidase I, it {{is given in}} combination with <b>cilastatin,</b> a DHP-I inhibitor which increases half-life and tissue penetration of imipenem. Imipenem/cilastatin, like other carbapenems, binds to bacterial penicillin-binding proteins and interferes with bacterial cell wall integrity and synthesis. It has activity against many aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. viridans- group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus species. Imipenem/cilastatin was approved {{for use in the}} United States in 1985. Imipenem/cilastatin is indicated for the treatment of severe or complicated skin, tissue, joint, respiratory tract, intra-abdominal, urinary tract and urogenital infections, but not meningitis (as it does not pass through the blood brain barrier), endocarditis, and sepsis due to susceptible organisms. Its use is generally restricted to severe infections largely in hospitalized patients. The recommended dosage is 250 mg to 1 gram given intravenously every 6 to 8 hours or in intramuscular doses of no more than 1.5 gm daily, usually for five to 14 days. It is commercially available as Primaxin as 250-mg or 500-mg infusion bottles for IV use or 500-mg or 750-mg vials of lyophilized powder for IM injection. The most common side effects of imipenem are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, pruritus, and injection-site reactions.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cilastatin</b> {{inhibits}} dehydropeptidase-I, a zinc metaloenzyme that metabolizes imipenem. Because zinc stabilizes the mammalian superoxide dismutase, we {{postulated that}} <b>cilastatin</b> would also inhibit the dismutase. <b>Cilastatin</b> concentrations at levels threefold {{higher than those}} expected in urine, however, did not inhibit the superoxide dismutase activity...|$|E
40|$|A major area {{in cancer}} therapy is {{the search for}} {{protective}} strategies against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. We investigated the protective effect of <b>cilastatin</b> on cisplatininduced injury to renal proximal tubular cells. <b>Cilastatin</b> is a specific inhibitor of renal dehydrodipeptidase I (DHP-I), which prevents hydrolysis of imipenem and its accumulation in the proximal tubule. Primary cultures of proximal cells were treated with cisplatin (1 – 30 M) in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>cilastatin</b> (200 g/ml). Apoptosis and mitochondrial injury were assessed by different techniques. Cisplatin uptake and DNA binding were measured by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. HeLa cells were used to control the effect of <b>cilastatin</b> on the tumoricidal activity of cisplatin. Cisplatin increased cell death, apoptotic-like morphology, caspase activation, and mitochondrial injury in proximal tubular cells in a dose- and time-dependent way. Concomitant treatment with <b>cilastatin</b> reduced cisplatin-induced changes. <b>Cilastatin</b> also reduced the DNA-bound platinum but did not modify cisplatin-dependent up-regulation of death receptors (Fas) or ligands (tumor necrosis factor, Fas ligand). In contrast, <b>cilastatin</b> did not show any effects on cisplatintreated HeLa cells. Renal DHP-I was virtually absent in HeLa cells. <b>Cilastatin</b> attenuates cisplatin-induced cell death in proximal tubular cells without reducing the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin in tumor cells. Our findings suggest that the affinity of <b>cilastatin</b> for renal dipeptidase makes this effect specific for proximal tubular cells and may be related to a reduction in intracellular drug accumulation. Therefore, <b>cilastatin</b> administration might represent a novel strategy in the prevention of cisplatin-induced acute renal injury...|$|E

40|$|Vancomycin {{is a very}} {{effective}} antibiotic for treatment of severe infections. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by nephrotoxicity. <b>Cilastatin</b> is a dehydropeptidase I inhibitor that acts on the brush border membrane of the proximal tubule to prevent accumulation of imipenem and toxicity. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the potential protective effect of <b>cilastatin</b> on vancomycin-induced apoptosis and toxicity in cultured renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). Porcine RPTECs were cultured in the presence of vancomycin with and without <b>cilastatin.</b> Vancomycin induced dose-dependent apoptosis in cultured RPTECs, with DNA fragmentation, cell detachment, and a significant decrease in mitochondrial activity. <b>Cilastatin</b> prevented apoptotic events and diminished the antiproliferative effect and severe morphological changes induced by vancomycin. <b>Cilastatin</b> also improved the long-term recovery and survival of RPTECs exposed to vancomycin and partially attenuated vancomycin uptake by RPTECs. On the other hand, <b>cilastatin</b> had no effects on vancomycin-induced necrosis or the bactericidal effect of the antibiotic. This study indicates that <b>cilastatin</b> protects against vancomycin-induced proximal tubule apoptosis and increases cell viability, without compromising the antimicrobial effect of vancomycin.

40|$|The {{antibiotic}} imipenum (thienamycin-formamidine) {{is partially}} hydrolyzed during excretion by a renal brush border dehydropeptidase.

To study the pharmacokinetics of imipenem and <b>cilastatin,</b> subjects with normal renal function and patients with different degrees of renal insufficiency received intravenously 250 mg imipenum alone and 250 mg imipenem with 250 mg <b>cilastatin.</b> The mean plasma half-life of imipenem varied from 52 min in subjects with normal renal function to 173 min in subjects with end-stage renal failure studied while off-dialysis. The plasma half-life of imipenem was not affected by the co-administration of <b>cilastatin.</b> The mean plasma half-life of <b>cilastatin</b> varied from 54 min in normals to 798 min in patients with end-stage renal failure. The co-administration of <b>cilastatin</b> resulted in an increase of the urinary concentration and in the urinary recovery of imipenem, the effect being more pronounced in the subjects with normal or only mildly impaired renal function. The plasma clearance of imipenem was decreased when <b>cilastatin</b> was co-administered, possibly due to inhibition of tubular secretion of imipenem. Elimination studies performed during haemodialysis indicated efficient removal of both imipenem and <b>cilastatin</b> during a 4 h session. In view of the important increase in half-life of <b>cilastatin</b> {{as a function of}} increasing renal failure, a dosage reduction is proposed in patients with severe renal failure. It is recommended that the maximum dose of imipenem/cilastatin would be limited to either 1000 / 1000 mg twice daily or 500 / 500 mg four times daily in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 15 ml/min. Also, a supplementary dose of imipenem and <b>cilastatin</b> after dialysis is recommended...|$|E

Concentrations of imipenem and <b>cilastatin</b> in plasma, urine, and feces were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography and radiometry. Plasma concentrations of imipenem assayed radiometrically were higher than those measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. In one subject studied at the end of drug administration, the open lactam metabolite of imipenem represented 9 % of the radioactivity. Plasma levels of <b>cilastatin</b> determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography and radiometry were virtually identical.

40|$|Imipenem is {{the first}} {{clinically}} available carbapenem antibiotic. Since it is hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase-I, a zinc metallo-enzyme resident in the brush border of the renal tubule, it is co-administered with <b>cilastatin,</b> a reversible inhibitor of this enzyme. This provides clinically relevant concentrations of imipenem in the urine for 8 - 10 h after a 500 mg dose. The half-life of both drugs is I h in normal volunteers. Plasma clearances are reproducible between volunteers and studies and average 220 ml/min for imipenem. Renal clearance of unchanged imipenem accounts for 60 - 70 % of plasma clearance when the imipenem is given with <b>cilastatin.</b> Administration of radio labelled drugs results in recovery of over 99 % of the radiolabel in the urine for both imipenem and <b>cilastatin.</b> With increasing renal dysfunction, the half-life of imipenem is controlled by a metabolic clearance pathway which is unaffected by <b>cilastatin.</b> Renal clearance is by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion for both imipenem and <b>cilastatin.</b> Renal dysfunction results in terminal half-lives of slightly greater than 4 h for imipenem and 16 h for <b>cilastatin</b> in the functionally anephric. Both drugs are well cleared by haemodialysis and supplemental 500 mg doses are recommended after a dialysis.

40|$|The first-dose and multidose {{pharmacokinetics}} of imipenem and <b>cilastatin</b> {{were evaluated}} in 41 premature infants {{during their first}} week of life. Premature infants (gestational age, {{less than or equal}} to 37 weeks) were assigned to receive 10 -, 15 -, 20 -, or 25 -mg/kg doses of imipenem-cilastatin (1 : 1) as a single- or multiple-dose regimen. A total of 39 infants received a single dose, whereas 18 infants received multiple doses. No differences were observed in pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for either agent relative to the dose administered or infant body weight; thus, the data were pooled. Elimination half-life, steady-state volume of distribution, and body clearance averaged 2. 5 h, 0. 5 liter/kg, and 2. 5 ml/min per kg, respectively, for imipenem and 9. 1 h, 0. 4 liter/kg, and 0. 5 ml/min per kg, respectively, for <b>cilastatin.</b> Similar values for these parameter estimates were observed after multidose administration, although substantial accumulation of <b>cilastatin</b> in serum was observed. A total of 21 % of the imipenem and 43 % of the <b>cilastatin</b> were excreted unchanged in the urine over a 12 -h collection period. Corresponding renal clearances averaged 0. 4 and 0. 2 ml/min per kg for imipenem and <b>cilastatin,</b> respectively. Substantial differences were observed in the route by which imipenem was cleared from the body compared with data from adult volunteers. These data suggest that infants should receive an imipenem dose of 20 mg/kg administered every 12 h for the treatment of bacterial infections outside the central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveImipenem–cilastatin is a {{well-established}} broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic {{used for the}} treatment of life-threatening infections worldwide. The preparation has been studied by various methods but not by ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, although this technique remains one of the simplest, most accurate and precise validated quality control laboratory methods. The aim {{of this study was to}} validate a method for separating the intercalating peaks of the UV spectra of imipenem and <b>cilastatin</b> and to compare the purity and quantities of these two active ingredients in different marketed brands. No previous studies have been conducted to compare the generic product (Cilanem®) with the original (Tienam®). MethodsFirst-order derivative UV spectrophotometry was used to separate the intercalating peaks of imipenem and <b>cilastatin</b> by measuring absorbance at 243  nm and 300  nm, respectively. ResultsCilanem® had better physical characteristics and a higher <b>cilastatin</b> concentration, while the brand product Tienam® contained a higher concentration of imipenem. ConclusionThe generic product Cilanem® is at least non-inferior to the brand product Tienam®...|$|E
