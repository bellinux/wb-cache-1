25|$|As {{technology}} continually advances, {{the flooding}} paradigm {{is no longer}} always the clear winner. It has been complemented since the 2000s by new permutations of liquid, aerosol, and gas delivery, such as minimum quantity lubrication and through-the-tool-tip <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooling</b> (detailed below).|$|E
25|$|On September 27, 1993 the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooling</b> {{system of}} the Tevatron Accelerator was named an International Historic Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The system, which {{provides}} cryogenic liquid helium to the Tevatron's superconducting magnets, was the largest low-temperature system in existence upon its completion in 1978. It keeps the coils of the magnets, which bend and focus the particle beam, in a superconducting state so that they consume only ⅓ of the power they would require at normal temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Vapor {{condensation}} is {{the most}} effective off-gas treatment technology for high (over 4,000 ppmV) VOC concentration vapor streams. The process involves cryogenically cooling the vapor stream to below 40 degrees C such that the VOCs condensate out of the vapor stream and into liquid form where it is collected in steel containers. The liquid form of the VOCs is referred to as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of solvents or light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) when the source of the liquid consists predominantly of petroleum or fuel products. This recovered chemical can then be reused or recycled in a more environmentally sustainable or green manner than the alternatives described above. This technology is also known as <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooling</b> and compression (C3-Technology).|$|E

50|$|Pomeranchuk cooling is the {{phenomenon}} in which liquid helium-3 will cool {{if it is}} compressed isentropically when it is below 0.3 K. This occurs because helium-3 has the unique property that solidification below 0.3 K requires pressure. This {{can be used to}} construct a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooler.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{titanium}} flexure assembly for the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) 1 -m {{primary mirror}} {{has been designed}} to accommodate: (1) the cryogenic cool-down effect on the optical performance of the mirror, (2) the Shuttle launch-load environment, and (3) the support-baseplate manufacturing tolerances. Numerous iterations involving a multidimensional design space search led to an assembly design that provides the stiffness and strength in the vertical (optical axis) and tangential directions to accommodate launch loads, but is compliant radially to accommodate <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cool</b> down. A 'folded back' titanium flexure system was required because of the differential thermal contraction of the aluminum telescope baseplate support and the fused-silica mirror. This unique and innovative flexure assembly represents a totally passive mechanism for accommodating the design launch loads, <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cool</b> down, and out-of-plane baseplate effects...|$|R
2500|$|The {{cycle is}} reversible, meaning that if {{supplied}} with mechanical power, it can {{function as a}} heat pump for heating or cooling, and even for <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooling.</b> [...] The cycle {{is defined as a}} closed regenerative cycle with a gaseous working fluid. [...] "Closed cycle" [...] means the working fluid is permanently contained within the thermodynamic system. This also categorizes the engine device as an external heat engine. [...] "Regenerative" [...] refers to the use of an internal heat exchanger called a regenerator which increases the device's thermal efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|Requires <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooling.</b> Traditionally {{this has}} been {{achieved}} using cryogenic liquids such as liquid nitrogen and liquid helium. More recently, closed-cycle cryocoolers, e.g., pulse tube refrigerators have gained considerable popularity as they eliminate cryogenic liquids which are both costly and require periodic refilling. <b>Cryogenic</b> <b>cooling</b> is also an advantage since it reduces the working environment's thermal noise.|$|E

40|$|The {{criteria}} and considerations {{for the design}} of the support system for the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) primary mirror are presented. A flexural-gimbal-baseplate design for the 0. 5 m primary mirror was developed. Preliminary studies have indicated that this design may be further improved by replacing the flexures by a post-gimbal system wherein the gimbal design accomodates both the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cool</b> down effects, the dynamic launch loads, and manufacturing tolerance effects. Additionally, a prestressed baseplate concept had evolved and was presented for the full scale 1. 0 m mirror. However, preliminary design studies indicate that this concept will not be required, and the post-gimbal-baseplate design similar to the 0. 5 m alternate support system will meet the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cool</b> down, dynamic launch load criteria, and manufacturing tolerance effects...|$|R

50|$|High {{temperature}} superconductors {{are required}} for practical FCLs. AC losses generate constant heat inside the superconductor, {{and the cost of}} <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooling</b> at liquid helium temperatures required by low temperature superconductors makes the whole device uneconomic.|$|E
50|$|At the low end, sensor {{diode noise}} {{can be reduced}} by <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooling.</b> On the high end, the {{resulting}} increase in local power dissipation can lead to thermal runaway that may cause momentary or permanent device failure.|$|E
5000|$|So as {{to reduce}} the {{instrument}} background and thermo-elerctronic detector noise, {{the temperature of the}} cold box is maintained at 93 K by a passive <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooler.</b> [...] This was preferred to a cryogenic machine {{due to the fact that}} the vibration levels of the latter can potential cause the degradation of the spectral quality.|$|R

The cooler contains a small pore, large free volume, low density material to restrain a cryogen through surface tension effects during launch and zero-g operations and maintains instrumentation within the temperature range of 10 to 140 K. The cooler operation is completely passive, with no inherent vibration or power requirements...|$|R
50|$|Medium-wave (MWIR) cameras {{operate in}} the 3 to 5 μm range. These can see almost as well, since those {{frequencies}} are less affected by water-vapor absorption, but generally require a more expensive sensor array, along with <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooling.</b>|$|E

40|$|The split <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooler</b> with {{a remote}} cold finger offers many {{advantages}} {{for use in}} cooling of infrared systems. A pneumatic drive for the displacer in such coolers was adopted in many cryocooler designs. This concept can be significantly improved by causing the displacer to move sinusoidally rather than in an essentially square wave, as {{in most of the}} present models.

50|$|In 2008, {{engineers}} at Harvard University achieved room temperature emission {{of several hundred}} nanowatts of coherent terahertz radiation using a semiconductor source. THz radiation was generated by nonlinear mixing of two modes in a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser.

The benefit of our plasmonic architecture on the detector performance is assessed by comparing it with detectors made using the same quantum well absorbing region, but processed into a standard 45 ° polished facet mesa. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement in responsivity, polarization insensitivity, and background limited performance.

50|$|Similar {{methods of}} {{supersonic}} expansion {{are used to}} adiabatically cool carbon monoxide lasers, which are then pumped either through chemical reaction, electrical, or radio frequency pumping.

It has a volumetric energy density of 17 Megajoules per liter (compared to 10 for hydrogen, 18 for methanol, 21 for dimethyl ether and 34 for gasoline). It must be compressed or cooled to be a liquid fuel, although it does not require <b>cryogenic</b> <b>cooling</b> as hydrogen does to be liquefied.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{acquisition}} {{is usually}} done using a CCD camera {{mounted in the}} optical path of the microscope. The camera may be full colour or monochrome. Very often, very high resolution cameras are employed to gain as much direct information as possible. <b>Cryogenic</b> <b>cooling</b> is also common, to minimise noise. Often digital cameras used for this application provide pixel intensity data to a resolution of 12-16 bits, much higher than is used in consumer imaging products.|$|E
