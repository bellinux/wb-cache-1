When he {{returned}} he developed the facilities of the glassworks in 1883 with among other things two additional furnaces to the existing six and introduced gas to replace wood for heating in the furnaces. The houses also got gaslight via a conduit now. At the same time, the production of green window glass, small glass and bottles ended and the light window glass (the <b>cylinder</b> <b>glass)</b> began to be made. The factory was subjected to a fire in autumn 1885 that entirely destroyed one wing of the factory building. In 1887 the complete glassworks was ravaged by a conflagration, but very soon after, it was rebuilt, in unchanged state from before the conflagration. On 22 March 1890 it was once again subjected to a fire, and afterwards, {{in addition to being}} rebuilt, also expanded, after this having 18 furnaces. These were heated by five generators. At that time, there were about 50 employees.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{buildings}} {{exist that}} were glazed at this period, Little Moreton Hall (1555-1559) in Cheshire, England, being particularly {{famous for the}} extensive nature of its leadlighting. During this period large sheets of glass were unavailable. Domestic windows were generally small and were made of broad glass or <b>cylinder</b> <b>glass</b> before crown glass was first made in England in 1678. Broad glass is usually around 1.5 to 2 mm thick and uneven, often with scars and marks on the surface {{where it has been}} 'ironed' flat, and often has a greenish tint. Later windows often had crown glass, which has a much better surface quality and shows slight concentric ripples that form as the disk is spun. Old windows often contain a mixture of several types of glass, as they will have been re-leaded about every 100 years, with the replacement of some of the quarries. The irregular glinting surface of diamond-pane windows is a distinctive feature of old European houses. The diaper shape of the panes gave greater stability than square-cut straight-set panes, and it is accordingly more common. It was also convenient to cut diamond-shaped panes from a single [...] "crown" [...] of glass with less waste than that caused by cutting square panes. Square panes are most often found in the grander or later buildings, and sometimes only on ground floor windows.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{consortium}} between academic and industry, this PhD work investigates the interest and capabilities of organic photo-sensors (OPS) for the optical characterization of suspensions and two-phase flows. The principle of new optical particle sizing instruments is proposed to characterize particle systems confined in a <b>cylinder</b> <b>glass</b> (standard configuration for Process Analytical Technologies). To evaluate and optimize the performance of these systems, a Monte-Carlo model has been specifically developed. This model accounts for the numerous parameters of the system: laser beam profile, mirrors, lenses, sample cell, particle medium properties (concentration, mean & standard deviation, refractive indices), OPS shape and positions, etc. Light scattering by particles is treated either by using Lorenz-Mie theory, Debye, or a hybrid model (that {{takes into account the}} geometrical and physical contributions). For diluted media (single scattering), particle size analysis is based on the inversion of scattering diagrams obtained over a wide angular range or near optical singularities (rainbow, critical scattering, diffraction). For dense media (multiple scattering), the solutions foreseen are based on the analysis of the backscattering spotlight characteristics. Comment: PhD Thesis, in French, Marseille, Dec 201...|$|E

When these tumours were inoculated within a <b>glass</b> <b>cylinder</b> which had been implanted s. c. in BALB/c mice 2 days earlier, 51 % of the animals died with progressively growing tumours, compared with 2 % in animals which had received the same inoculum directly s. c.

For the purpose of investigating whether the <b>glass</b> <b>cylinder</b> model could also modify the immune response of the host to a second tumour challenge, a leukaemia virus known to crossreact with MS was used.

In the present study, cells of S. cerevisiae 163, were immobilized by natural adhesion onto SBP. The retention of immobilized cells attained the level of about 1. 7 × 1011 cells/gram of dry SBP. Continuous ethanol production from sugar beet thick juice (TJ) was performed in a <b>cylinder</b> <b>glass</b> bioreactor at a temperature of 30 ºC and pH 5 during a 27 -day period.

The DC power supply was controlled by a voltmeter and be adjusted constant at 125 A/m 2 for each test runs. The initial SS concentration were varied from 1250, 2100, 3000, and 4000 mg/L by diluting wastewater.

One and two pairs of Fe-Al electrode will give SS removal efficiency are 97. 2 and 99. 6 %, respectively. However, the higher electrode number will need the shorter time to get certain removal efficiency of SS.  Number of electrodes didn’t give the significant impact to the final pHs.
