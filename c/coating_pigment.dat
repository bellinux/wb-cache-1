40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is the {{production}} of commercial quality precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) for use in papermaking as filler or <b>coating</b> <b>pigment.</b> The calcium source explored is not traditionally pure calcium (hydr) oxides or salts, but rather leachates extracted from steelmaking slags. Utilizing a waste-derived source for PCC production enables the possibility to valorize two thermal residues of steelmaking, namely the slag and carbon dioxide. Additionally, after the calcium extraction, the residual solids, rich in silica and aluminum oxide, can be valorized as a raw material for zeolite synthesis. The main challenge addressed in this work is the prevention of impurity contamination of the formed PCC’s, especially Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, Si and Ti. Three approaches are investigated: (i) the selective leaching of calcium, (ii) the purification of the calcium-rich leachates using physico-chemical separation methods, and (iii) the preferential crystallization of pure PCC by controlling precipitation conditions. The produced PCC’s are characterized for chemical, mineralogical, morphological and optical properties to assess their applicability for use in papermaking. The next stage of this research will be the utilization of the produced PCC’s in papermaking applications. status: publishe...|$|E

An important step in development of a smart coating is the successful impregnation of corrosion inhibitor into the nanocontainer as a <b>coating</b> <b>pigment.</b> In this study, halloysite was used as nanocontainer to encapsulate benzimidazole as corrosion inhibitor by vacuum method. FESEM, TEM, FTIR and TGA characterization techniques were used to confirm the loading of halloysite with benzimidazole. FESEM results indicated differences between the morphology of the unloaded-halloysite and benzimidazole loaded-halloysite.

40|$|Calcite marble from Brønnøy Kalk AS’ Akselberg deposit is raw {{material}} for production of Ground Calcium Carbonate (GCC) used as filler and <b>coating</b> <b>pigment</b> in paper industry. One {{of the most important}} parameters for GCC production is brightness. 10 % of the deposit is of sulphide speckled marble quality, with the brightness detrimental sulphides pyrrhotite and pyrite. Existing flotation methods at the production plant is not capable of removing the sulphides, and it is therefore of interest to test whether gravity and magnetic methods can be useful for removing pyrrhotite and pyrite, as an iron content of 0. 02 % is enough to reduce a high quality calcite marble brightness to below the required product brightness of 93 %. Gravity separation was performed with the Mozley Laboratory Mineral Separator (LMS), a Knelson KC-MD 3 centrifugal concentrator and the Mozley Multi-Gravity Separator (MGS). Magnetic separation was tested with the Jones P 40 Wet High Intensity Magnetic Separator (WHIMS). The material was then analyzed with the Tappi Brightness T 525 method, X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) major element analysis and the acid insoluble residue method. The study shows that there is a potential for removal of sulphides and therefore a better resource utilization of the Akselberg calcite marble by magnetic methods, but that further investigations must be carried out on mineralogy and liberation of the products, as well as optimizing and combining of methods for further reduction of sulphide content in order to obtain the necessary brightness of the calcite concentrate.

40|$|Ink {{absorption}} {{performance in}} inkjet receptive coatings containing synthetic zeolite pigments was studied. <b>Coating</b> <b>pigment</b> pore and {{particle size distribution}} are the key parameters that influence in modifying media surface properties, thus affecting the rate of ink penetration and drying time (Schölkopf, et al. 2004). The primary objective of this study was: (1) to investigate the synthetic zeolite pigment effects on inkjet ink absorption, dynamic contact angle and printability, and (2) to evaluate these novel synthetic zeolite pigments in replacing the fumed silica pigments in conventional inkjet receptive coatings. In this research study, single pigment coating formulations (in equal P:B ratio) were prepared using microporous synthetic zeolite pigments (5 A, Organophilic and 13 X) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) binder. The laboratory-coated samples were characterized for absorption, air permeance, roughness, drying time, wettability and print fidelity. Based on the rheological data, {{it was found that}} the synthetic zeolite formulated coatings depicted a Newtonian flow behavior at low shear; while the industry accepted fumed silica based coatings displayed a characteristically high pseudoplastic flow behavior. Our coated samples generated using microporous synthetic zeolite pigments produced low absorption, reduced wettability and accelerated ink drying characteristics. These characteristics were caused due to the synthetic zeolite pigments, which resulted in relatively closed surface structure coated samples. The research suggested that no single selected synthetic zeolite coating performed better than the conventional fumed silica based coatings. Experimental data also showed that there was no apparent relationship between synthetic zeolite pigment pore sizes and inkjet ink absorption. For future research, above coated samples should be evaluated for pore size distribution using Mercury Porosimeter, which quantifies surface porosity of coated samples. This presented approach can be easily used for investigating other such microporous coating pigments in formulating inkjet receptive coating. The research findings will benefit the coating formulators, engineers and material science students, in understanding the absorption characteristics of selected synthetic zeolite pigments thereby encouraging them in identifying other such alternative pigments in conventional inkjet receptive coatings...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} coating colours to obstruct {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation in the 300 - 385 nm region was examined {{with the aim}} of finding the best photo-stabilising formulation to inhibit discoloration of high-yield pulps. The influence of pigment type, bleaching of the pigments, pigment size, pigment size distribution, type of binder and addition of U-V-absorbing compounds were examined using a newly developed method for studying the reflectance and transmittance properties of thin coating layers. The pigment type and coat weight was found {{to be the most important}} factors for reducing the transmittance of UV-radiation. Kaolin clays were more effective than calcium carbonate pigments and are therefore a better <b>coating</b> <b>pigment</b> for photostability reasons. Bleaching of the pigments, resulted in an overall minor decrease in transmittance for both kaolin and ground calcium carbonate (GCC) pigments, especially at low coat weights. Bleaching of the pigments changed the particle size distribution somewhat, which probably alters the structure in the coating layer. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) pigments have a higher UV-screening potential compared to GCC pigments and should therefore be a better choice among the calcium carbonates. It was further concluded that a narrow pigment size distribution was beneficial for reducing the amount of transmitted UV-radiation that reaches the base paper. Styrene butadiene latex and polyvinylpyrrolidone were better in reducing the transmittance in the UV-region than polyvinyl alcohol. Adding a fluorescent whitening agent to a coating colour decreased the transmittance in the UV-region when the pigment was of the GCC type, and increased the transmittance when kaolin pigment was used. Addition of titanium dioxide (3 parts) to a coating colour containing kaolin pigment blocked about 90 % of the UV-radiation at a coat weight of 10 g/m(2), which is a common coat weight for a single coated paper. Another possibility is to double coat to increase the coat weight, which turns the transmittance factor closed to zero...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} the thermal transfer through porous media {{by means of}} measurement of the effective thermal conductivity and modelling of the structural parameters. While {{most of the work}} is of a general nature, the porous media in focus are pigment plus latex binder systems as used for paper coatings. As such, the application field of thermal effects in printing is discussed. At first the use of a dynamic measurement method for the thermal conductivity of porous <b>coating</b> <b>pigment</b> binder systems in the form of tablets is evaluated. In addition, a Lumped Parameter Model is developed to analyse the measured thermal conductivities in terms of the material volume fractions and their structural configuration. The model therefore uses two independent structural parameters instead of porosity alone as the governing parameter. This enables a discussion following modelling approaches adopting parameter modelling and structural modelling. A combination of both is used to discuss the solid-solid connectivity of pigment binder systems. It is shown by the model parameter of pigment connectivity that a disruption of the pigment packing already at low concentrations of binder occurs related to surface and colloid chemistry factors which cause the binder to accumulate first at pigment nodal points. The analysis of different pigment binder systems shows that, due to the presence of two interacting solid phases, the effective thermal conductivity cannot be modelled by using porosity and pore structure alone, but also requires the additional parameter of dual solid phase connectivity. It is proposed, therefore, that a combination of pore structure analysis and thermal conductivity measurement can be used to identify and parameterise subtleties in interactive particulate systems. For the application of toner fusing in electrophotography it is shown that a thermally insulating coating layer leads to a concentration of the fusing energy on the surface, thus aiding the fusing/adhesion development of the toner while shielding the base paper from undesired heating. In the heatset web-offset drying process, an insulating precoating in combination with liquid barrier properties can lead to a similar shielding of the base paper and thus helps to maintain an even moisture profile effectively reducing the waving/fluting tendency...|$|E
40|$|The {{target of}} this study was to {{identify}} the most important variables affecting the internal product integrity in the case of coated grades for coldset web offset printing. Internal product integrity was experimentally identified to mean in this work printing runnability and visual print quality. Printing runnability was experimentally defined to mean build-up formation tendency on the surface of the common impression cylinder (CIC) at satellite type coldset printing machines. Visual print quality was defined to mean set-off, print-through, contrast, dot-gain, evenness of printed surface and reproducibility of colors. The objectives {{of this study}} had significant commercial value and therefore the entire experimental part was carried out on industrial scale. This experimental set-up was aiming to speed-up the application of potential findings to industrial scale and to facilitate the exploitation of the results since the time consuming and risky step of scaling the laboratory results to industrial scale could be skipped over. The experimental part of this work consists of four parts: Pilot coating of industrial base papers, printing tests in commercial coldset printing process, comparison of print quality potential of different printing methods (coldset, waterless coldset and heatset) and laboratory analyses of base paper, unprinted and printed coldset samples. Laboratory analyses included structural tests, absorption tests, various microscopic methods, permeability tests, confocal Raman analyses and various printability tests. The results of the print quality testing showed that matt LWC printed in coldset reaches such a qualitative level that it allows the printer to exceed the technical obstacles by which the new business models are often confronted. It was further identified that <b>coating</b> <b>pigments</b> and base paper properties have influence on internal product integrity of matt LWC paper in coldset printing. The influence of <b>coating</b> <b>pigments</b> as a single variable in the fine tuning of the internal product integrity was smaller than expected. The influence of <b>coating</b> <b>pigments</b> on the internal product integrity is most likely depending on the base paper properties. A natural area for future studies would be to identify the most important paper technological variables influencing the internal product integrity via base paper properties. Latex properties as single variables did not have clear influence on internal product integrity. Latex coverage had some influence to the internal product integrity. Therefore, experimental designs profiting latex properties as multivariable parameters could bring new knowledge to the fine tuning of the internal product integrity.

Creation of a new product in printing paper industry should approach the standard concurrent engineering processes, where new product is widely tested in industrial scale after the innovation phase, but before market launch. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Coating {{shrinkage}} upon drying is {{a phenomenon}} well known to the paper coating industry, where it often causes changes in the final structure of the coating layer leading to poor results in terms of gloss, light scattering, surface strength, coverage, uniformity and printability. Such shrinkage has in previous studies been wrongly associated with shrinkage of the polymeric binders used in the coating formulation, by making erroneous comparison with solvent-based paint systems. Natural binders, as starch or proteins, which come from renewable resources and are therefore environmentally friendly, suffer more from this shrinkage phenomenon than synthetic binders. The aim of this research project was to improve {{the understanding of the}} processes involved in the drying of a coating layer and to create a model able to describe them. Shrinkage while the coating layer dries has been successfully measured by observing the deflection of coated strips of a synthetic elastically-deformable substrate. Ground calcium carbonate was used as the <b>coating</b> <b>pigment,</b> together with latex binders of both low and high glass transition temperature, Tg, respectively, and also with starch which is a natural film-forming water soluble binder. The final dry coatings were studied with mercury porosimetry and by scanning electron microscopy in order to characterise their porous structure. The flow and rheological properties of the coating colour formulations were measured in order to probe the particle-particle interaction between the different species in the wet coating colour. The void space of the dry coating layers was modelled using Pore-Cor, a software which generates simulated porous networks. A new algorithm was developed to model, within the simulated void space, the effective particles or "skeletal elements" representative of the solid phase of the dried porous system. The water-filled porous structures {{at the beginning of the}} shrinkage process (first critical concentration, FCC) were subsequently modelled by creating Pore-Cor structures with the same solid skeletal elements distribution as at the second critical concentration (at which the particles lock their positions), but with higher given porosity to account for the water present The capillary forces acting on the surface of the simulated coating were calculated, and found to be several orders of magnitude larger than the measured shrinkage forces. The shrinkage process was thus described as resulting from the effect of capillary forces in the plane of the coating layer resisted by a stick-slip process, where the capillary forces yield shrinkage only if a resistance force within the drying coating layer holds the structure in place and allows the menisci to form. The stick-slip theory was strongly supported by quantitative comparisons between the experimental forces required to intrude mercury, and the capillary forces within the simulated void structure.

40|$|The paper {{industry}} is constantly {{looking for new}} ideas for improving paper products while competition and raw material prices are increasing. Many paper products are pigment coated. Coating layer is {{the top layer of}} paper, thus by modifying <b>coating</b> <b>pigment</b> also the paper itself can be altered and value added to the final product. In this thesis, synthesis of new plastic and hybrid pigments and their performance in paper and paperboard coating is reported. Two types of plastic pigments were studied: core-shell latexes and solid beads of maleimide copolymers. Core-shell latexes with partially crosslinked hydrophilic polymer core of poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid) and a hard hydrophobic polystyrene shell were prepared to improve the optical properties of coated paper. In addition, the effect of different crosslinkers was analyzed and the best overall performance was achieved by the use of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). Furthermore, the possibility to modify core-shell latex was investigated by introducing a new polymerizable optical brightening agent, 1 -[(4 -vinylphenoxy) methyl]- 4 -(2 -henylethylenyl) benzene which gave promising results. The prepared core-shell latex pigments performed smoothly also in pilot coating and printing trials. The results demonstrated that by optimizing polymer composition, the optical and surface properties of coated paper can be significantly enhanced. The optimal reaction conditions were established for thermal imidization of poly(styrene-co-maleimide) (SMI) and poly(octadecene-co-maleimide) (OMI) from respective maleic anhydride copolymer precursors and ammonia in a solvent free process. The obtained aqueous dispersions of nanoparticle copolymers exhibited glass transition temperatures (Tg) between 140 - 170 ºC and particle sizes from 50 - 230 nm. Furthermore, the maleimide copolymers were evaluated in paperboard coating as additional pigments. The maleimide copolymer nanoparticles were partly imbedded into the porous coating structure and therefore the full potential of optical property enhancement for paperboard was not achieved by this method. The possibility to modify maleimide copolymers was also studied. Modifications were carried out via N-substitution by replacing part of the ammonia in the imidization reaction with amines, such as triacetonediamine (TAD), aspartic acid (ASP) and fluorinated amines (2, 2, 2 - trifluoroethylamine, TFEA and 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4 -heptafluorobuthylamine, HFBA). The obtained functional nanoparticles varied in size between 50 - 217 nm and their Tg from 150 - 180 ºC. During the coating process the produced plastic pigments exhibited good runnability. No significant improvements were achieved in light stability with TAD modified copolymers whereas nanoparticles modified with aspartic acid and those containing fluorinated groups showed the desired changes in surface properties of the coated paperboard. Finally, reports on preliminary studies with organic-inorganic hybrids are presented. The hybrids prepared by an in situ polymerization reaction consisted of 30 wt% poly(styrene- co-maleimide) (SMI) and high levels of 70 wt% inorganic components of kaolin and/or alumina trihydrate. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images and characterization by Fourier Transform Infrared Spcetroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) revealed that the hybrids had conventional composite structure and inorganic components were covered with precipitated SMI nanoparticles attached to the surface via hydrogen bonding.

40|$|In {{the study}} we {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} surface treatment on permanence and stability of various graphic paperboard types - board for books, brochures, business cards, calendars, protection package - under the conditions of accelerated ageing with increased temperature and relative humidity {{in the absence of}} light according to ISO/ 5630 / 3, and as specified for material on paper/board of permanent value by EN/ISO 9706 (8). Paperboards were coated with various coating colours, and subsequently lab printed in offset technique. The effect of artificial ageing on surface properties as well as on image optical and colour stability was monitored. The changes observed in surface characteristics such as smoothness, roughness, air permeability, absorptivity before and after the accelerated ageing process revealed a strong influence of <b>coating</b> components (<b>pigments,</b> binders) and surface treatment type. Increase in roughness, alteration of board absorption behaviour and change in optical and colour parameters - decrease in brightness, increase in yellowness, colour shift with samples containing higher amount of optical brightening agents - were the most pronounced results. Measured differences in printing colour (dE) and optical density values indicated that colour stability of offset image approached the limit values, which are set for an image of still acceptable quality. Black (K) exhibited the highest stability among CMYK colours. Image colour stability significantly depends on surface and optical board characteristics, especially on gloss and optical brightener agent, as well as on board fibre composition and <b>coating</b> <b>pigments.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{pigments}} {{covered by}} film-forming polymers have opened a prospect {{to improve the}} quality of water-based printing inks. In this study such pigments were prepared by the initiated polymerization of styrene and methacrylate derivative monomers in the aqueous pigment dispersions. The formation of polymer films covering pigment cores depends on the polymerization time and the ratio of pigment to monomers. At the time of 4 hours and the ratio of 1 / 10 almost <b>pigment</b> particles are <b>coated</b> by the polymer. The formed polymer covers of pigments have the average thickness of 5. 95 nm. The size increasing percentage of the coated particles after a week is 4. 5 %, about fourteen-fold lower than of the original ones. The obtained results indicate that the <b>coated</b> <b>pigments</b> are improved dispersion stability in water medium along with a guarantee for the optical colour. Keywords—Aqueous pigment dispersion stability, colored resin particles, emulsion polymerization, water based ink. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{identified}} a new spontaneous recessive mutation in the mouse, mhyp (mosaic hypopigmentation), in a screen for novel proviral integration sites in a multiple ecotropic provirus mapping stock. Integration of an 8. 4 -kb retrovirus results in mosaic loss of <b>coat</b> <b>pigment</b> in mhyp homozygotes. Patchy loss of pigmentation in the retinal pigmented epithelial {{layer of the}} eye with abnormal melanosomes is also evident. We mapped mhyp to mouse chromosome 7 and cloned the underlying gene. mhyp is a defect in the Trappc 6 a gene. Expression of Trappc 6 a is markedly diminished in mhyp homozygotes. The normal protein, TRAPPC 6 A, is a subunit of the TRAPP (transport protein particle) I and II complexes. While TRAPP complexes are essential for ER-to-Golgi and intra-Golgi vesicle trafficking in yeast, TRAPP subunits participate in additional, including post-Golgi, transport events in mammals. The data implicate mammalian TRAPPC 6 A in vesicle trafficking during melanosome biogenesis...|$|R
