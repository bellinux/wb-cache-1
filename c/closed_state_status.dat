40|$|The time {{course of}} Na channel {{inactivation}} from <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> was determined on inside-out excised patches from neuroblastoma N 1 E 115. Closed-state inactivation develops {{as a single}} exponential with mean time constants of 66. 4 ms at - 80 mV, 29. 6 ms at - 70 mV, 20. 1 ms at - 60 mV, and 15. 1 ms at - 50 mV. Corresponding mean steady-state values of the fitted exponentials were 0. 321, 0. 098, 0. 035, and 0. Closed-state inactivation, in general, should develop either with a delay or as more than one exponential, depending on which <b>closed</b> <b>state(s)</b> directly inactivate. The absence of additional components cannot {{be attributed to a}} rate of exchange between <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> too rapid to detect. The time course is simply accounted for if all <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> directly inactivate and do so with the same rate constant for each <b>closed</b> <b>state,</b> suggesting that those conformational changes constituting the transitions between <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> have little effect on the structural components involved in inactivation. Closed to inactivated rate constants ranged from a mean of 0. 0108 ms- 1 at - 80 mV to 0. 0690 ms- 1 at - 50 mV. This voltage dependency is entirely intrinsic to closed-state inactivation with closed to inactivated rate constants similar for all <b>closed</b> <b>states.</b> Over the potential range studied nearly all the inactivation is from <b>closed</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

40|$|Mechanisms for the Ca 2 +-dependent gating {{of single}} large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ {{channels}} from cultured rat skeletal muscle were developed using two-dimensional analysis of single-channel currents recorded with the patch clamp technique. To extract and display the essential kinetic information, the kinetic structure, from the single channel currents, adjacent open and closed intervals were binned as pairs and plotted as two-dimensional dwell-time distributions, and the excesses and deficits of the interval pairs over that expected for independent pairing were plotted as dependency plots. The basic {{features of the}} kinetic structure were generally the same among single large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels, but channel-specific differences were readily apparent, suggesting heterogeneities in the gating. Simple gating schemes drawn from the Monod- Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model for allosteric proteins could approximate the basic features of the Ca 2 + dependence of the kinetic structure. However, consistent differences between the observed and predicted dependency plots suggested that additional brief lifetime <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> not included in MWC-type models {{were involved in the}} gating. Adding these additional brief <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> to the MWC-type models, either beyond the activation pathway (secondary <b>closed</b> <b>states)</b> or within the activation pathway (intermediate <b>closed</b> <b>states),</b> improved the description of the Ca 2 + dependence of the kinetic structure. Secondary <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> are consistent with the closing of secondary gates or channel block. Intermediate <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> are consistent with mechanisms in which the channel activates by passing through a series of intermediate conformations between the more stable open and <b>closed</b> <b>states.</b> It is the added secondary or intermediate <b>closed</b> <b>states</b> that give rise to the majority of the brief closings (flickers) in the gating...|$|R
