40|$|In recent years, {{substantial}} interest {{has been devoted}} to the conversion of biomass-derived carbohydrates into furanic aldehydes such as furfural, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 5 -halomethylfurfural, because these products are considered as important versatile intermediates that can be further transformed into a wide variety of high performance fuels and high value-added chemicals. However, low yields and high production costs that are due to the special chemical structures and properties of biomass-derived carbohydrates to a large extent have limited the practical production of furanic aldehydes. Recently, various catalytic <b>conversion</b> <b>strategies</b> have been developed to overcome these limitations. In this review, we systematically summarize and discuss catalytic <b>conversion</b> <b>strategies</b> from the perspective of catalysts and reaction solvents as well as formation mechanisms and influencing factors for the production of furanic aldehydes from biomass-derived carbohydrates.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{instances}} when parallel conversion {{can not be}} considered a viable <b>conversion</b> <b>strategy.</b> First consider if the new system contains significant schema changes. Data elements required by one system that are not being populated by the other can lead to at best data inaccuracies and at worst data corruption. Another concern is if the system relies on consumer off the shelf technology (COTS). If a COTS vendor's documentation states that more than one application can not share the same database, then parallel conversion is not an option. An example would be Oracle's Siebel products. Other COTS products may also place restrictions when patches or major upgrades require unique license keys. Once applied they may make database changes that might cause the application to falsely detect a parallel system running against the same database as an attempt at getting around licensing controls and thereby disable the system.|$|E
