5|$|The {{population}} {{has increased from}} around 2,500 in 1801 to over 52,000 in 1971; the most significant growth occurring during the later half of the 20th century. The borough of Basingstoke was merged with other local districts in 1974 to form the borough of Basingstoke and Deane.

5|$|Since {{the second}} half of the 18th century, when Brazil was still a colony, the {{government}} had attempted to gather data regarding the population. However, few captaincies (later called provinces) collected the requested information. After independence the government instituted a commission for statistics in an 1829 decree with a mandate to hold a national census. The commission was a failure and was disbanded in 1834. In the ensuing years, provincial governments were tasked with collecting <b>census</b> <b>information,</b> but their census reports were often incomplete or not submitted at all. In 1851, another attempt at a nationwide census failed when rioting broke out. This was the result of the erroneous belief among Brazilians of mixed-race descent that the survey was a subterfuge designed to enslave anyone having African blood.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{the creation of}} new estimates of ethnic populations and components of change in local authority districts (LADs) in England for years between the 2001 and 2011 <b>Censuses.</b> <b>Information</b> on ethnic populations by age and gender is provided in censuses. In between <b>censuses,</b> <b>information</b> on ethnic population change is scarce. To fill the gap we used data from the two censuses with reconciled total population and component estimates published by the Office of National Statistics. This chapter outlines the sequence of steps used to produce a ten-year time series. These reconciled population and component estimates provide a firmer foundation for ethnic-specific projections than hitherto available. The role of the census in this work is vital...|$|R

25|$|Historical {{references}} of Qaryat Moussa persist {{till the}} end of the 16th century, but the village seems to disappear from the records afterwards. The Ottoman <b>census</b> <b>information</b> cited previously credited Qaryat Moussa with 9 males in 1519, all Christians and only 7 of them married. The second census, in 1571, recorded 12 males. This demographic vitality is somewhat intriguing, especially considering the weakening of Kfarsghab's demography over the same period.|$|E

25|$|Calton Hill, as {{its name}} {{suggests}} is an alleviated suburb on the south-western edge of 'inner' Dunedin. From Forbury Hill lies the spur known as Calton Hill which runs north into the Caversham Valley. Named after Calton Hill in Edinburgh, Scotland, the 'Township of Calton Hill' was gazetted on the 19 November 1910. There is currently no official <b>census</b> <b>information</b> for population of the suburb, but aerial maps suggest approximately 400-500 households. Five roads form its perimeter: Caversham Valley Road motorway to the north; Riselaw Road in the south-west; Corstophine Road in the south-east (until Sidey Street intersection); and Sidey Street/ Burnett Street in the north-east. The suburb contains 2-3 retail business, but is mainly residential. There is farmland on its south-western border, whilst the direct neighbour suburbs are Caversham, Corstophine, Concord and Lookout Point.|$|E
25|$|From {{its early}} years, {{when it was}} contending that the Nairs needed to join {{together}} {{if they were to}} become a political force, it argued that the caste members should cease referring to their traditional subdivisions and instead see themselves as a whole. <b>Census</b> <b>information</b> thereafter appears to have become unreliable on the matter of the subdivisions, in part at least because of the NSS campaign to ensure that respondents did not provide the information requested of them. The NSS also promoted marriage across the various divisions in a further attempt to promote caste cohesion, although in this instance it met with only limited success. Indeed, even in the 1970s it was likely that cross-subdivision marriage was rare generally, and this was certainly the case in the Central Travancore area.|$|E
25|$|The Deputy Commissioner is {{the head}} of the {{administration}} of the district of Bagalkot. The Deputy Commissioners office provides municipal services to the district, collects <b>census</b> <b>information,</b> enforces judicial precedents, administers local elections and collects revenue. Tahalsidars assist the Deputy Commissioner in administrative matters at the taluk level — each taluk has one Tahalsidar. Rural areas of each taluk are administered by a locally elected Zilla Panchayat, headed by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Zilla Panchayat is charged with rural development schemes related to irrigation, water supply, road and infrastructural facilities. Bagalkot district contributes one Member of Parliament (MP) to India's Lok Sabha. The district also contributes seven Members of Legislative Assembly (MLA)s to Karnataka's Vidhan Sabha, one from each taluk. Karnataka is one of only five states in the Indian union with an existing Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council). Bagalkot district contributes four Members of Legislative Council (MLC)s to the Vidhan Parishad.|$|E

The war killed soldiers and civilians directly, caused famines, destroyed livelihoods, disrupted commerce, postponed marriages and childbirth, and forced {{large numbers of people}} to relocate.
