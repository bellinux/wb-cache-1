5|$|The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{call for}} an end to the use of Native American mascots was only for {{non-native}} schools. In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation or stereotyping. Examples include the Fighting Indians of the Haskell Indian Nations University and the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP), which continues to have a substantial number of native students, and <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> to the Lumbee tribe. The UNCP nickname is the Braves, but the mascot is a red-tailed hawk. Pembroke Middle School, which also has <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> to the Lumbee tribe, is nicknamed the Warriors.|$|E

50|$|Haïti {{attempted}} to establish <b>closer</b> <b>ties</b> with the United States during the Jefferson administration, {{but this was}} difficult to do, {{in part because of}} the massacres of French whites in Haïti by Jean-Jacques Dessalines in the 1804 Haiti Massacre. Dessalines sent a letter to Thomas Jefferson calling for <b>closer</b> <b>ties</b> between the two nations but Jefferson ignored the letter.|$|R

5|$|In 677 or 678, Wilfrid and Ecgfrith quarrelled, and Wilfrid was {{expelled}} from his see. Abbess Hilda of Whitby was a leader in a faction of the Northumbrian church that disliked Wilfrid, and her <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> with Theodore helped to undermine Wilfrid's position in Northumbria. Another contributory factor in Wilfrid's expulsion was his encouragement of Æthelthryth's entry into a nunnery; he had personally given her the veil, the ceremony of entering a nunnery, on her retirement to Ely Abbey. Æthelthryth had donated the lands Wilfrid used to found Hexham Abbey, and the historian N. J. Higham argues {{that they had been}} part of the queen's dower lands, which, when Ecgfrith remarried, his new queen wanted to recover. The historian Eric John feels that Wilfrid's <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> with the Mercian kingdom also contributed to his troubles with Egfrith, although John points out that these ties were necessary for Wilfrid's monastic foundations, some of which were in Mercia. Wilfrid not only lost his diocese, he lost control of his monasteries as well.|$|E

5|$|Luigi Pirandello's 1913 novel I vecchi e {{i giovani}} (The Old and the Young) retraces {{the history of}} the failure and {{repression}} of the Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893-94.

5|$|McCain's {{personal}} {{character has}} been a dominant feature of his public image. This image includes the military service of both himself and his family, the circumstances and tensions surrounding {{the end of his}} first marriage and beginning of second, his maverick political persona, his temper, his admitted problem of occasional ill-considered remarks, and his <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> to his children from both his marriages.|$|E
5|$|These events {{threatened}} Serbia, {{which had}} severed ties with Catholicism and {{was once again}} fully Orthodox. The marriage alliance between Vladislav and Ivan Asen II may {{be a result of}} the Hungarian threat to both of the rulers' countries. Some scholars have speculated that Vladislav accepted Bulgarian suzerainty, but this speculation has no evidence to support it, since no contemporary sources say that Vladislav recognized Asen as overlord of Serbia. However, Asen likely had the largest influence on the politics of Vladislav. Vladislav seems to have been left out of Orthodox alliance founded by Asen. Vladislav may have been afraid of <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> with Bulgaria, since his brother Radoslav's <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> with the Despotate of Epirus had caused dissatisfaction among the Serbian nobility. This shows that Vladislav was not too dependent upon Bulgaria, as he was not obliged to join the alliance; if he had recognized the suzerainty of Asen, he likely would have forced to join the alliance.|$|E

These hopes live on, for instance, in the Karjalan Liitto and ProKarelia. However, ambitions for <b>closer</b> <b>ties</b> with East Karelia do not include territorial demands.|$|R
5|$|Ali Abu Nuwar (surname also spelled Abu Nuwwar, Abu Nawar or Abu Nowar; 1925 – 15 August 1991) was a Jordanian army officer, {{serving as}} chief of staff in May 1956 – April 1957. He participated in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War as an {{artillery}} officer in the Jordanian army's predecessor, the Arab Legion, but his vocal opposition to British influence in Jordan led to his virtual exile to Paris as military attaché in 1952. There, he forged <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> with Jordanian crown prince Hussein, who promoted Abu Nuwar after his accession to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Charles Smithson – {{the main}} male character. Though {{born into a}} family with <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> to nobility, Smithson does not possess a title but has a sizable income and {{considerable}} education. Early in the novel he is described both as a casual naturalist and a Darwinist. Though trying to become an enlightened and forward-thinking individual, the narrator often emphasises, through commentary on Smithson's actions and situation, that his identity is strongly rooted in the traditional social system. Moreover, conflicting identification with social forces, such as science and religion, lead Smithson to an existential crisis.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner was {{slated to}} play a major role in the Eisenhower/Nixon {{re-election}} bid. However, he had represented two Atlantic City clothing manufacturers, the Kravitz brothers, who had been fined and barred from further government contracts for fraud, and on April 25, 1956, a subcommittee of the Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations, looking into military procurement, subpoenaed him to appear before it. The senators wanted to inquire why a New Jersey firm which already had six attorneys would hire a California lawyer, especially one with <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> to Vice President Nixon.|$|E

5|$|During the 812–813 {{siege of}} Baghdad, Tahir had {{established}} <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> with the abnaʾ, which now proved useful in smoothing their acceptance of al-Ma'mun. Tahir was further rewarded with the governorship of Khurasan in September 821, {{and when he}} died in October 822, he was succeeded by his son, Talha. For the next fifty years, the Tahirid line would provide the governors of a vast eastern province centred on Khurasan, while also providing the governors of Baghdad, securing the city's loyalty to the caliphal government even after the capital was moved to Samarra.|$|E
5|$|During {{the closing}} stages of World War I, German-trained Finnish Jäger troops {{played a key}} role in the Finnish Civil War, while the German Baltic Sea Division also intervened late in the civil war. Jäger troops were volunteers from German-influenced circles, such as {{university}} students. This participation in the Finnish struggle for independence created <b>close</b> <b>ties</b> with Germany, but after the German defeat in the World War, Scandinavian relations became more important and the main goal of the Finnish foreign policy.|$|E

After Johnson's retirement, Marcus's invitations were among the few the former president and his wife continued to accept.
