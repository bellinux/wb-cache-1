5000|$|The Supreme Court {{dismissed}} the appeal, Lord Mance giving the leading judgment, and holding that England {{was not the}} appropriate forum. Although the High Court had erred in interpreting Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd 1987 AC 460, this did not effect its ultimate conclusion because its error favoured VTB. The High Court wrongly concluded that Russian law governed the alleged torts, but it had considered the position if English law had been applicable and found this not to be favourable. The Court of Appeal also erred in finding Russian law applicable for the torts and did not recognise {{the significance of the}} governing law, but this would not have changed the conclusion. The High Court’s exercise of discretion could not be faulted or set aside. It was unnecessary to resolve whether the court could not pierce the veil but this could not succeed in any case. The allegation would be an extension of existing law, so that there could be piercing if someone controlled a company, {{as if they had been}} a <b>co-contracting</b> partner. A strong justification would be required, and there was an overwhelming case against extension because the law provided redress against the controller in a misrepresentation action. It would be wrong to treat another defendant as party to the contract where none of the actual parties had intended this. The facts did not involve Russagroprom being used as a facade to conceal true facts. The worldwide freezing injunction would be discharged, and it was unsatisfactory given the length of litigation.|$|E

Standing with a backward lean stretches the anterior muscle pair (TA and Q) {{and they must}} be <b>co-contracted</b> to maintain balance. Equally, forward lean stretches the posterior muscle pair (GM and ST) {{and they must be}} <b>co-contracted.</b> We used these conditions of enhanced lean to increase the influence of gamma static motoneurones on muscle spindle afferents, which enhances the background input from these afferents to extrafusal motoneurones. The effects of the conditioning volleys on motoneurone excitability was estimated using the modulation of the on-going rectified EMG and of the H reflex. Stimulation of afferents from TA in the deep peroneal nerve at 1. 5 - 2 x MT (motor threshold) evoked early group I and late group II excitation of Q motoneurones. Stimulation of afferents in the GM nerve at 1. 3 - 1. 8 MT evoked only late group II excitation of ST motoneurones. The late excitation produced by the group II afferents was significantly greater when subjects were standing and leaning than when they voluntarily <b>co-contracted</b> the same muscle pairs at the same levels of activation. The early effect produced by the group I afferents was unchanged. We propose that this increase in excitation by group II afferents reflects a posture-related withdrawal of a tonic inhibition that is exerted by descending noradrenergic control and is specific to the synaptic actions of group II afferents...|$|R

We describe the clinical and neurophysiological features of 21 patients (20 male and one female) with PWT. Mean age at tremor onset was 50. 1 years. A family history of PWT was obtained from seven patients. Ten patients obtained benefit from drug treatment (mainly propranalol or primidone) and seven responded to alcohol. The writing speeds of the patients (mean +/- SEM: 73. 1 +/- 6. 6 letters per minute) when using their preferred hand were significantly reduced (Student's t test: P < 0. 001) compared with those of healthy control subjects (mean +/- SEM: 127. 7 +/- 6. 4). Surface polymyography performed during writing showed 4. 1 - 7. 3 Hz rhythmic activity predominantly in the intrinsic hand and forearm muscles. Alternating, extensor activation alone, skipping from alternating to extensor activation, and <b>co-contracting</b> EMG patterns were recorded from the flexor and extensor muscles of the forearm. There was no evidence for excessive 'overflow' of this rhythmic EMG activity, as similar activity was detected in comparable muscle groups of healthy control subjects. Accelerometry confirmed that the frequency of PWT ranged from 4. 1 - 7. 3 Hz (median 5. 5 Hz) and that normal subjects wrote with a 4. 0 - 7. 7 Hz oscillation (median 4. 6 Hz). Forearm reciprocal inhibition was normal in PWT (n = 13), and thus patients with PWT can be distinguished from those with writer's cramp in whom decreased presynaptic inhibition has been found. Patients were sub-classified as having either type A (n = 11) or B (n = 10) PWT depending on whether tremor appeared during writing (type A: task induced tremor) or whilst writing and adopting the hand position used in writing (type B: positionally sensitive tremor).

40|$|Objectives: To {{present the}} {{outcomes}} of modified lateral rectus Y-splitting combined with either unilateral or bilateral horizontal rectus recession in Duane Retraction Syndrome (DRS) with significant upshoot or downshoot. Materials and Methods: A total of 12 patients including 10 patients with Type I DRS and 2 with Type III DRS underwent modified Y-splitting surgery. Amount of additional recessions varied with the degree of preoperative deviation by intraoperative adjustable suture technique. Preoperatively 3 patients had esotropia (ET), 6 had exotropia (XT), and 3 patients had orthotropia. The mean preoperative deviation was 19. 3 prism diopters (PD) (range, 18 - 20 PD) in ET patients and 19. 2 PD (range, 16 - 20 PD) in XT patients. Results: Postoperatively, all patients had significant correction in horizontal deviation and aligned within 4 PD of orthotropia, and no patients exhibited abnormal head posture. Co-contraction and globe retraction were markedly reduced and abnormal ocular vertical movement disappeared or significantly decreased in all cases.

40|$|Efficient human {{motor control}} is characterised by an {{extensive}} use of joint impedance modulation, which {{to a large extent}} is achieved by <b>co-contracting</b> antagonistic muscle pairs {{in a way that is}} beneficial to the specific task. Studies in single and multi joint limb reaching movements revealed that joint impedance is increased with faster movements [1] as well as with higher positional accuracy demands [2]. A large body of experimental work has investigated the motor learning processes in tasks with changing dynamics conditions (e. g., [3]) and it has been shown that subjects generously make use of impedance control to counteract destabilising external force fields (FF). In the early stage of dynamics learning humans tend to increase co-contraction. As learning progresses in consecutive reaching trials, a reduction in co-contraction with a parallel reduction of the reaching errors made can be observed. While there is much experimental evidence available for the use of impedance control in the CNS, no generally-valid computational model of impedance control derived from first principles have been proposed so far. Many of the proposed computational models have either focused on the biomechanical aspects of impedance control [4] or have proposed simple low level mechanisms to try to account for observed human co-activation patterns [3]. However these models are of a rather descriptive nature and do not provide us with a general and principled theory of impedance control in the nervous system.

40|$|Background: Knee {{osteoarthritis}} patients <b>co-contract</b> in knee-related muscle pairs during walking. The {{determinants of}} this co-contraction remain insufficiently clear. Methods: A heterogeneous group of 14 patients was measured before {{and one year}} after knee arthroplasty, and compared to 12 healthy peers and 15 young subjects, measured once. Participants walked on a treadmill at several imposed speeds. Bilateral activity of six muscles was registered electromyographically, and co-contraction time was calculated as percentage of stride cycle time. Local dynamic stability and variability of sagittal plane knee movements were determined. The surgeon's assessment of alignment was used. Pre-operatively, multivariate regressions on co-contraction time were used to identify determinants of co-contraction. Post-operatively it was assessed if predictor variables had changed {{in the same direction}} as co-contraction time. Findings: Patients <b>co-contracted</b> longer than controls, but post-operatively, differences with the healthy peers were no longer significant. Varus alignment predicted co-contraction time. No patient had post-operative varus alignment. The patients' unaffected legs were more unstable, and instability predicted co-contraction time in both legs. Post-operatively, stability normalised. Longer unaffected side co-contraction time was associated with reduced affected side kinematic variability. Post-operatively, kinematic variability had further decreased. Interpretations: Varus alignment and instability are determinants of co-contraction. The benefits of co-contraction in varus alignment require further study. Co-contraction probably increases local dynamic stability, which does not necessarily decrease the risk of falling. Unaffected side co-contraction contributed to decreasing affected side variability, but other mechanisms than co-contraction may also have played a role in decreasing variability. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated whether the previously described pathological 4 to 7 Hz drive to muscles in cervical dystonia is present in patients with aetiologically different types of dystonia of the upper and lower limbs. To this end, we studied 12 symptomatic and 4 asymptomatic carriers of the DYT 1 gene, 6 patients with symptomatic dystonia due to focal basal ganglia lesions, and 11 patients with fixed dystonia, a condition assumed to be mostly psychogenic in aetiology. We evaluated EMG-EMG coherence in the tibialis anterior (TA) of these and 15 healthy control subjects. Ten of 12 (83 %) of symptomatic DYT 1 patients had an excessive 4 to 7 Hz common drive to TA, evident as an inflated coherence in this band. This drive also involved the gastrocnemius, leading to <b>co-contracting</b> electromyographic bursts. In contrast, asymptomatic DYT 1 carriers, patients with symptomatic dystonia, patients with fixed dystonia, and healthy subjects showed no evidence of such a drive or any other distinguishing electrophysiological feature. Moreover, the pathological 4 to 7 Hz drive in symptomatic DYT 1 patients was much less common in the upper limb, where it was only present in 2 of 6 (33 %) patients with clinical involvement of the arms.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of the (<b>co-contracting)</b> digastric muscles to the rapid decline in bite-force magnitude after unloading of a static bite was investigated by asking participants to perform two different biting tasks with sudden unloading, and correlating the degree of co-contraction of the digastrics (as derived from their electromyograms) with the impact force, the impact velocity (as measured after a travel distance of 5 mm), and the residual force when the jaw system was in static conditions again after the impact. Co-contraction of the digastrics was varied by asking participants to perform the biting task while controlling bite force (force-controlled experiments) or jaw position (position-controlled experiments). In half of the experiments, participants co-contracted their digastrics more strongly in the position-controlled than the force-controlled experiments. However, there was no clear relation between the level of co-contraction and {{the magnitude of the}} impact force, the impact velocity and the residual force. The results imply that co-contraction of the digastric muscles is not sufficient to explain the reduction in bite force and the low impact velocity after an unexpected jaw-closing movement. Two other possible mechanisms that reduce forces in an unloaded jaw system are: (1) force-velocity properties of the activated jaw muscles in conjunction with creep of the aponeurotic sheets of the jaw muscles, resulting in a slow partial recovery of the biting force after impact; (2) force-length properties of jaw-opening muscles, an activity not recorded here.

40|$|Changes in the {{activity}} of hip adductor muscles with increased running speed were investigated in 4 male sprinters (personal best for 100 m: 10. 58 ± 0. 26 s). The subjects were instructed to run at three different speeds (3 - 4 m/s, 6 - 8 m/s and 9 - m/s). The surface electromyograms (EMGs) of 10 muscles around the hip joint were recorded, and whole-body motions were also filmed with a high-speed video camera (150 fps). Regardless of running velocity, the adductor longus (AL) showed activity concomitant with the rectus femoris when the hip joint was in extension. This suggested that the AL functioned as a hip flexor. On the other hand, the adductor magnus (AM) showed activity when the hip joint was flexed, suggesting that the AM assisted hip extensors such as the gluteus maximus. During high-speed sprinting, the AL was also activated when the hip joint was flexed. Similarly, the AM also showed activity when the hip joint was extended, corresponding to {{the latter half of}} the support phase. During the support phase, the AM may serve to stabilize the frontal plane by <b>co-contracting</b> with hip abductors such as the gluteus medius and tensor fasciae latae. Furthermore, the AL and AM showed increased activity while the hip was fully flexed and extended. This remarkable muscle activity around the flexion-extension reversal point during high-speed sprinting may stabilize the hip joint so that it resists dislocative force through the unique anatomical features of the hip adductor muscles, i. e.

OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the pattern of}} organization of common inputs to the motoneuron pools of individual muscles in the masticatory system. METHODS: Six subjects bit on a rubber-coated wooden splint placed between {{the upper and lower}} incisor teeth. We recorded the surface electromyogram (EMG) of <b>co-contracting</b> masseter, temporalis and digastric muscles bilaterally during isometric jaw closing at 5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 40 % of maximal voluntary masseter EMG. RESULTS: The cross-correlograms of the EMGs of homologous muscle pairs indicate that there are common synaptic inputs to the motoneuron pools of the left and right masseter, and left and right digastric muscles, but not to left and right temporalis. The amplitude of the central peak in masseter and digastric correlograms increased with bite force. When the activity of ipsilateral muscle pairs was cross-correlated, central peaks were prominent for masseter-digastric and masseter-temporalis muscle pairs, and the peak amplitudes increased significantly with bite force. In contrast, no significant central peak was observed for temporalis-digastric muscle pairs at any level of voluntary biting. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is synchronous modulation of input bilaterally to the masseter muscles and to the digastric muscles but not to the temporalis muscles. There is synchronous modulation of input to ipsilateral masseter-digastric and masseter-temporalis muscle pairs but not to temporalis and digastric muscles.

40|$|Efficient human {{motor control}} is characterised by an {{extensive}} use of joint impedance modulation, {{which is achieved by}} <b>co-contracting</b> antagonistic muscle pairs {{in a way that is}} beneficial to the specific task. While there is much experimental evidence available that the Central Nervous System (CNS) employs such an impedance control strategy only few com-putational models of impedance control have been proposed so far. In this paper, we study the computational aspects of the generation of joint impedance control in human arm reach-ing tasks and we develop a new model of joint impedance control for antagonistic systems. We formulate an actor’s goal of arm reaching by optimising a cost function that accounts for maximal positional accuracy and minimal energy expenditure. To account for shortcomings of previously presented optimal control models, that fail to model impedance control, we employ the concept of learned internal dynamics models in conjunction with a stochastic arm simulation model, that exhibits realistic signal dependent noise-impedance characteris-tics. When using this stochastic arm model for dynamics learning with a locally weighted learning algorithm, the produced noise or kinematic variability reflects the prediction un-certainty on the level of the internal model. Introducing this information into the stochastic Optimal Feedback Control (OFC) theory reveals that impedance control naturally emerges from an optimisation process that minimises for model prediction uncertainties, along with energy and accuracy demands. We evaluate our method in single-joint simulations under static reaching conditions as well as in adaptation scenarios. The results show that our model is able to explain many well-known impedance control patterns from the literature, which supports our impedance control model as a viable approach of how the CNS could modulate joint impedance. ...|$|E
40|$|Virtually all {{movements}} {{involve the}} recruitment of motor units from multiple muscles. Given the functional diversity of motor units (motoneurons and the muscle fibers they supply), the effective production of specific movements undoubtedly depends upon some principle(s) to organize the ensemble of active motor units. The principle acting to organize {{the recruitment of}} motor units within muscles is the size principle, whereby the first motor units to be recruited have the smallest values for axonal conduction velocity and contractile force, and are the slowest to contract and fatigue. Here we {{consider the possibility that}} the size principle applies in the recruitment of motor units across muscles, i. e., that regardless of their muscles of origin, active motor units are recruited in rank order, for example, from low to high conduction velocity. The benefits of orderly recruitment across muscles could be similar to the acknowledged advantages of orderly recruitment within muscles. One benefit is that the neural process involved in organizing active motor units would be simplified. In a muscle-based scheme, the size principle would organize only those motor units within individual muscles, leaving the nervous system with the additional task of coordinating the relative activities of motor units from different muscles. By contrast, in an ensemble-based scheme, orderly recruitment of all motor units according to the size principle would automatically coordinate motor units both within and across motor nuclei. Another potential benefit is the provision for movements with smooth trajectory, the result of interleaving the divergent torque contributions made by motor units from muscles that differ in their orientations about joints. Otherwise, if order were restricted within muscles, the torque trajectory of a joint would change unevenly as participating muscles begin contracting at different times and grade activity at different rates. These considerations support speculation that motor units recruited from <b>co-contracting</b> muscles are collectively recruited according to the size principle...|$|E

Data analysis was based on the timing and amount of muscular activities of bilateral corresponding muscles. High synchronous activities occurred in both sides of the trunk muscle of hemiplegic patients. However, there were great variations in the amount of IEMG (integrated EMG).

Stiffness was estimated as the weighted summation of rectified EMG signals through the index of muscle co-contraction around the joint (IMCJ) proposed by Osu et al. (2002).

At heel contact the knee extensor and flexor muscles <b>co-contract</b> to provide stability for the knee joint since it is almost maximally extended {{at that point in}} time. Shortly after, as the foot becomes flat on the ground, the knee gradually flexes approximately 10-15 degrees reaching the maximum at about 15% of the gait cycle. This small amount of knee flexion is controlled eccentrically by the knee extensor muscles which serve the purpose of cushioning the rate of loading on the lower-limb and preventing excessive knee flexion. Following through to mid-and terminal stance, the knee gradually extends with concentric activity of the knee extensor muscles and approaches near full extension as heel off occurs (30-40% of gait cycle). At this point the knee flexor muscles concentrically flex the knee again for swing phase. The maximum knee flexion that occurs during swing is about 60 degrees.|$|R
40|$|The {{hamstring}} muscles {{have the}} potential to counteract anterior shear forces at the knee joint by <b>co-contracting</b> during knee extension efforts. Such a muscle recruitment pattern might protect the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) by reducing its strain. In this study we investigated to what extent co-activation of the knee flexors during extension efforts is compatible with the hypothesis that this co-activation serves to counteract anterior tibial shear forces during isometric knee extension efforts in healthy subjects. To this aim, it is investigated whether co-activation varies with the required knee extension moment, with the knee joint angle, and with the position of the external flexing force relative to the knee joint. With unaltered moment and muscle activation, distal positioning of the flexing force on the tibia causes higher resultant (muscular plus external) forward shear forces at the knee as compared to proximal positioning. In ten subjects, knee flexor and extensor EMG was measured during a quasi-isometric positioning task for a range (5 - 50 degrees) of knee flexion angles. It was found that the co-activation of the knee flexors increased with the extension moment, but this increase was less than proportional (p< 0. 001). The extension moment increased 2. 7 to 3. 4 times, whereas the activation of Biceps Femoris and Semitendinosus increased only a factor 1. 3 to 2. 0 (joint angle dependent). Furthermore, a strong increase in co-activation was seen near full extension of the knee joint. The position of the external extension load on the tibia did not affect the level of co-contraction. It is argued that these results do not suggest a recruitment pattern that is directed at reduction of anterior shear forces in the knee joint during sub-maximal isometric knee extension efforts in healthy subjects. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Hand {{positional}} variability {{during a}} task confounds many {{activities of daily}} living, such as inserting a key into a lock, pouring hot water into a cup, and eating with a spoon. Current dogma suggests that older adults use increased co-contraction to attenuate hand positional variability; however, {{this has not been}} proven. This thesis proposes that elbow muscle co-contraction significantly affects elbow angle positional variability (PV), which affects hand positional variability, and that older adults can reduce their PV by decreasing their co-contraction level. Variable muscle stiffness was incorporated into the Signal Dependent Noise Theory to model the effect of elbow muscle co-contraction on predicted PV during a quasistatic elbow flexion task. The results demonstrated an optimal level of co-contraction that minimized the positional variability for both variable and constant loading paradigms. The first experiment tested the effect of greater than natural elbow muscle co-contraction levels on PV. Fourteen younger and 14 older healthy adults resisted both constant and variable external elbow extension moments while <b>co-contracting</b> at different levels. Increasing co-contraction was found to increase positional variability for both younger and older adults (p < 0. 005). Older adults naturally co-contracted at higher levels and had lower positional variability than younger adults (p < 0. 005). The second experiment tested the effect of below-natural elbow muscle co-contraction levels on PV in 14 younger and 14 older healthy adults. The effect of age was not significant in predicting positional variability at the lowered co-contraction level. In the third experiment, 12 younger and 14 older healthy adults poured water through different sized container openings. Older subjects co-contracted at higher levels and had lower PV than younger adults. While co-contraction increased with decreasing target size, increased co-contraction within a pouring target size increased PV (p < 0. 05) and decreased pouring accuracy (p < 0. 001). We conclude that increasing elbow muscle co-contraction increases PV and hinders the performance of tasks, such as pouring, that require low positional variability. This counters the current belief that high co-contraction levels are beneficial for task performance, and suggests that people who struggle with these tasks may benefit from reduced co-contraction...|$|E
40|$|Dizziness is {{a common}} problem and it often co-exists with anxiety. Level of anxiety is the best {{predictor}} of handicap for dizzy patients. There is diagnostic controversy and few treatment programs for such patients. These patients can be labeled as panic disorder with agoraphobia or by the concept of Phobic Postural Vertigo which is characterized by dizziness or imbalance in standing or walking despite normal clinical balance tests and avoidance behaviours. This thesis aimed to investigate the benefits and shortcomings of the concept of Phobic Postural Vertigo and to develop treatment methods. We compared posturography results of patients with Phobic Postural Vertigo with healthy subjects. Patients with Phobic Postural Vertigo had more sway in frequencies above 0. 1 Hz. Vibratory proprioceptive stimulation increased differences between populations. Patients were less able to use vision to compensate for vibratory stimulation. We compared results in questionnaires for patients with Phobic Postural Vertigo with unselected patients with dizziness. Patients with Phobic Postural Vertigo, and especially women, experienced higher degree of handicap, anxiety and dizziness severity. During cognitive behavioural therapy for those patients it was found that a fear of falling was provoked by standing and by misinterpretation of spontaneous body sway. Patients restricted their body sway area by <b>co-contracting</b> postural muscles. It is hypothesized that this behaviour leads to muscular fatigue, pain problems and distorted proprioception. There are however also other factors behind patients dizziness. Treatment methods were developed, mainly targeting the misinterpretaton of spontaneous body sway, fear of falling and fear regulating postural responses including exposure to standing in specific situations. One group of patients with Phobic Postural Vertigo had Cognitive Behavioural Therapy while another group underwent a self treatment procedure. Patients who had the additional Cognitive Behavioural Therapy fared considerably better in degree of handicap, anxiety and depression. In a one year follow up, treatment results deteriorated to pre-treatment levels. Men seemed to benefit more from the treatment. Phobic Postural Vertigo is a relevant concept to describe the fear of falling and subsequent postural behaviours. As treatment results were not maintained future approaches might also includ physiotherapy and pharmacological treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Human {{hand control}} {{mechanisms}} are extremely complex and currently {{there is no}} solution to restore full function to a paralyzed hand. The optimal solution is to use either cortical signals or desired joint angles/torques to stimulate existing muscles. One of the limiting factors in achieving this goal is a poor {{understanding of the relationship}} between the input (i. e. neural signals to muscles) and the output (i. e. joint movements) in the system (i. e. hand). There are infinitely many sets of muscle forces that generate any given set of joint torques because of redundancy and the ability to <b>co-contract</b> antagonist muscles. In this paper, we describe a methodology to estimate and compare biological and robotic solutions for the muscle forces for a given set of dynamic joint movements. Our preliminary results indicate that the robotic solution obtained by finding the minimum forces resembles the biological solution. This methodology may allow us to identify the neuromuscular control strategies used during dynamic finger movements. Keywords—Dynamic movements, EMG, Force, Hand, Neural contro...|$|R
40|$|The trunk muscle {{transversus abdominis}} (TrA) {{is thought to}} be {{controlled}} independently of the global trunk muscles. Methodological issues in the 1990 s research such as unilateral electromyography and a limited range of arm movements justify a re-examination of this theory. The hypothesis tested is that TrA bilateral co-contraction is a typical muscle synergy during arm movement. The activity of 6 pairs of trunk and lower limb muscles was recorded using bilateral electromyography during anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) associated with the arm movements. The integrated APA electromyographical signals were analyzed for muscle synergy using Principle Component Analysis. TrA does not typically bilaterally <b>co-contract</b> during arm movements (1 out of 6 participants did). APA muscle activity of all muscles during asymmetrical arm movements typically reflected a direction specific diagonal pattern incorporating a twisting motion to transfer energy from the ground up. This finding is not consistent with the hypothesis that TrA plays a unique role providing bilateral, feedforward, multidirectional stiffening of the spine. This has significant implications to the theories underlying the role of TrA in back pain and in the training of isolated bilateral co-contraction of TrA in the prophylaxis of back pain...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of the trunk muscles to spinal stability is well established. There is convincing evidence {{for the role of}} multifidus in spinal stability. Recently, emphasis has shifted to the deep fibres of this muscle (DM) and five key clinical beliefs have arisen: (i) that DM stabilizes the lumbar spine whereas the superficial fibres of lumbar multifidus (SM) and the erector spinae (ES) extend and/or rotate the lumbar spine, (ii) that DM has a greater percentage of type I (slow twitch) muscle fibres than SM and ES, (iii) that DM is tonically active during movements of the trunk and gait, whereas SM and ES are phasically active, (iv) that DM and the transversus abdominis (TrA) <b>co-contract</b> during function, and (v) that changes in the lumbar paraspinal muscles associated with LBP affect DM more than SM or ES. This paper reviews the biomechanical, electromyographic, histochemical and morphological data that underpin these beliefs. Although there is support for the importance of the lumbar multifidus and the specific {{contribution of}} this muscle to intervertebral control, several of the clinical beliefs have little or no support and require further evaluation. These findings have implications for clinical practice. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R
