We show that pICln, a component of the PRMT 5 complex, induces the formation of an otherwise unstable higher-order Sm protein unit. In this state, the Sm proteins are kinetically trapped, preventing their association with snRNA. The SMN complex subsequently binds to these Sm protein units, dissociates pICln, and catalyzes ring closure on snRNA. Our data identify pICln as an assembly chaperone and the SMN complex as a catalyst of spliceosomal snRNP formation.

Recognition of the degradation tag of protein substrates requires ATP binding to one set of sites and ATP or ADP binding to a second set of sites, suggesting a mechanism that allows repeated unfolding attempts without substrate release over multiple ATPase cycles. Our results rule out concerted hydrolysis models involving ClpX 6 •ATP 6 or ClpX 6 •ADP 6 and highlight structures of hexameric AAA+ machines with three or four nucleotides as likely functional states.

Surprisingly, DnaC’s AAA+ fold is dispensable for ring remodeling because the DnaC isolated helicase-binding domain can both load DnaB onto DNA and increase the efficiency by which the helicase acts on substrates in vitro.

This seven-subunit Ctf 18 -RFC complex consists of the four small subunits of RFC, together with Ctf 18, Dcc 1, and Ctf 8. Ctf 18 -RFC was also a weak loader of PCNA onto naked template-primer DNA. However, when the single-stranded DNA template was coated by the yeast single-stranded DNA binding protein replication protein A (RPA) but not by a mutant form of RPA or a heterologous single-stranded DNA binding protein, both binding of Ctf 18 -RFC to substrate DNA and loading of PCNA were strongly inhibited, and unloading predominated.

Surprisingly, chl 1, scc 1 - 73, orscc 2 - 4 mutants defective in sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) did not increase instability, suggesting that Ctf 18 -RFC protects triplet repeats independently of SCC. Instead, three results suggest novel roles for Ctf 18 -RFC in facilitating genomic stability. First, genetic instability in mutants of Ctf 18 -RFC was exacerbated by simultaneous deletion of the fork stabilizer Mrc 1, but suppressed by deletion of the repair protein Rad 52. Second, single-cell analysis showed that mutants in Ctf 18 -RFC had a slowed S phase and a striking G 2 /M accumulation, often with an abnormal multi-budded morphology. Third, ctf 18 cells exhibit increased Rad 52 foci in S phase, often persisting into G 2, indicative of high levels of DNA damage.

In eukaryotes, sliding clamps are loaded onto DNA by the replication factor C (RFC) complex, {{which consists of}} five distinct subunits (A-E), each of which contains an AAA+ module composed of a RecA-like alpha/beta ATPase domain followed by a helical domain. AAA+ ATPases mediate chaperone-like protein remodeling. Despite remarkable progress {{in our understanding of}} <b>clamp</b> <b>loaders,</b> it is still unclear how recognition of primed DNA by RFC triggers ATP hydrolysis and how hydrolysis leads to conformational changes that can load the clamp onto DNA. While these questions can, of course, only be resolved experimentally, the design of such experiments is itself non-trivial and requires that one first formulate the right hypotheses based on preliminary observations. The functional constraints imposed on protein sequences during evolution are potential sources of information in this regard, inasmuch as these presumably are due to and thus reflect underlying mechanisms. Here, rigorous statistical procedures are used to measure and compare the constraints imposed on various RFC clamp-loader subunits, each of which performs a related but somewhat different, specialized function. Visualization of these constraints, {{within the context of the}} RFC structure, provides clues regarding clamp-loader mechanisms [...] suggesting, for example, that RFC-A possesses a triggering component for DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis. It also suggests that, starting with RFC-A, four RFC subunits (A-D) are sequentially activated through a propagated switching mechanism in which a conserved arginine swings away from a position that disrupts the catalytic Walker B region and into contact with DNA thread through the center of the RFC/clamp complex. Strong constraints near regions of interaction between subunits and with the clamp likewise provide clues regarding possible coupling of hydrolysis-driven conformational changes to the clamp's release and loading onto DNA...|$|R

An overall 1. 56 -fold increase in mutation frequencies was produced by adding single or multiple accessory proteins and was driven mainly by increased Ttemplate•Gprimer mispairs.

Once bound to the clamp, the <b>clamp</b> <b>loader</b> complex binds to a primer-template junction, in the process threading the DNA through the open interface of the clamp. Binding to the primer-template junction induces a conformational change in the <b>clamp</b> <b>loader</b> that acts as a switch, activating the ATPase activity of the AAA+ subunits and resulting in release of the clamp and DNA by the <b>clamp</b> <b>loader.</b> The structural mechanisms by which clamp loaders recognize primer-template junctions and hydrolyze ATP in response to DNA binding are not well understood. In this dissertation, I report the crystal structure of the E. coli <b>clamp</b> <b>loader,</b> &# 947; complex, bound to primer-template DNA. The structure reveals that, when bound to DNA, the AAA+ domains of the <b>clamp</b> <b>loader</b> subunits adopt a highly symmetric spiral conformation that interacts with the helical DNA duplex, with the N-terminal domains of the subunits tracking the template strand of the primer-template junction. In this conformation, the ATP binding sites, which are formed at subunit-subunit interfaces within the AAA+ spiral, are all in the same ATPase activated conformation, suggesting a mechanism by which DNA binding promotes this conformation and thereby leads to ATP hydrolysis. An unexpected feature of this structure is that primer-template recognition is restricted primarily to the template strand, with virtually no contacts made with the primer strand. As a consequence of this mode of DNA binding in which contacts are restricted to the template strand, models for the recognition of RNA-DNA primer-template junctions, as well as the recognition of reverse polarity primer-templates, are proposed. A related structure which I also present, that of the E. coli <b>clamp</b> <b>loader</b> bound to DNA as well as a peptide derived from the N-terminal tail of the &# 968; protein, a <b>clamp</b> <b>loader</b> binding partner, suggests a mechanism whereby the binding of the &# 968; protein promotes the clamp and DNA binding activities of the <b>clamp</b> <b>loader.</b> Binding of this peptide promotes a conformational change within the collar domains of the <b>clamp</b> <b>loader</b> that is necessary for the <b>clamp</b> <b>loader</b> to adopt the highly symmetric spiral conformation of the AAA+ domains when bound to DNA...|$|E
