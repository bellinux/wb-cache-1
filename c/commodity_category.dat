40|$|Planned {{shopping}} malls usually {{have one or}} more department stores (anchor stores) and multiple specialized retail stores in each <b>commodity</b> <b>category.</b> This paper presents a model of {{shopping malls}} in which {{these two types of}} stores sell noncomplementary commodities. If anchor stores sell standard (riskless yet low-value) commodities and retail stores sell specialized (high variance yet high expected value) commodities, then each type of store may benefit from collocating with the other, even though the stores sell substitutable products. The underlying intuition is that the presence of each type of retailer enhances consumer traffic at the shopping mall, which benefits the retailer or retailers of the other type. Under some parametric restrictions, the value of this increased traffic more than offsets the loss in markups due to competition from additional sellers at the mall. In this case, it is in a land developer's interest to rent retail space in the mall to both types of retailers. A Tiebout-like argument explains the striking similarity in the composition of stores in planned shopping malls...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{economic}} {{market approach}} to urban system modelling is described, where all interactions are characterized as exchanges in a market. This {{leads to a}} natural partition of an integrated urban model into submodels based on the category of good or service being supplied or demanded, the type of agent making the demand or supply, and {{the time and place}} of interaction. Actors communicate through 6 defined operations on markets, decoupling the algorithms representing different behaviour. Agent based approaches to simulation are a natural extension of the market approach, allowing a transaction based simulation of heterogeneous spatial markets with individual agents making specific offers in specific places at specific times, and other agents accepting those offers at future specific times. Incorporating many existing modelling methods into such a framework requires a set of average prices by segmenting markets by <b>commodity</b> <b>category,</b> space and time, and wrapping the modules in interfaces that recast the inputs and ouputs into market operations. The paradigm is applied to two existing modelling frameworks: the Sacramento MEPLAN model and the Oregon statewide TLUMIP model...|$|E

Dallas Smythe reminds us of the importance of engagement with Marx’s works for studying the media in capitalism critically. Both Critical Theory and Critical Political Economy of the Media and Communication have been criticized for being one-sided. Such interpretations are mainly based on selective readings. They ignore that in both approaches there has been with different weightings a focus on aspects of media commodification, audiences, ideology and alternatives. Critical Theory and Critical Political Economy are complementary and should be combined in Critical Media and Communication Studies today.

40|$|The paper prepares new {{estimates}} for the elasticity of US trade flows using bilateral, commodity-detailed trade data for 31 countries, using measures of expenditure and trade prices matched to commodity groups, and including a commodity-andcountry specific proxy for global supply-cum-variety. Using the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) we construct bilateral trade flows for 31 countries in four categories of goods based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s “end-use ” classification system—autos, industrial supplies and materials–excluding energy, consumer goods, and capital goods. We find that using expenditure matched to <b>commodity</b> <b>category</b> yields more plausible values for the demand elasticities than does using GDP as the measure of demand that drives trade flows. Controlling for country and commodity fixed effects, we find that industrial and developing countries have demand elasticities that are statistically significant and that generally differ between development groups and across product categories. Relative prices for the industrial countries have plausible parameter values, are statistically significant and differ across product groups, but the relative prices for developing countries are poorly estimated. We find that variety is an important variable for the behavior of capital goods trade. Because the commodity composition of trade and of trading partners has changed dramatically, particularly for imports, {{we find that the}} demand elasticity for imports is not constant.

The Air Force currently spends about one-third of its annual budget on purchased goods and services. This offers the Air Force a large target in which to seek cost savings. Commercial firms have moved toward a commodity-council approach for purchasing in recent years, and the cost reductions realized have been impressive. Findings have shown that the increased leverage from commodity councils will optimize buying power for the Air Force, reduce duplication of effort, improve customer support, and minimize supply-chain costs through integration and collaboration. ?Commodity Council? is a term used to describe a cross-functional sourcing team designed to create a centralized purchasing strategy and establish centralized contracts for enterprise-wide requirements. The commodity council drives commonality and standardization and ensures the leveraging of purchasing volume. The key to this approach is to rely on market experts in the specific <b>commodity</b> <b>category</b> to make well informed, market-savvy decisions that fully meet all enterprise-wide requirements for a commodity.

Numeric code, company name, city, state, region, and local postal ZIP code are included in the database. Capacity estimates are given for each of 12 principal categories of paper or paperboard commodities as well as different categories of market pulp. Capacity data at each mill location are further differentiated by process type within each category of paper or paperboard; for example, capacity based on recycled fiber is differentiated from capacity based on wood pulp. Estimates of mill capacity by process were derived from industry directories, corporate reports, trade journal articles, and other sources. This report provides documentation of the capacity database and a summary of capacity trends by <b>commodity</b> <b>category,</b> process, and region.

The findings support the view that Indonesia's poor export performance in the post-crisis era is largely supply driven.

It is true that historically estimated elasticities could be of some guidance, even if they did not allow for the impact of QRs, provided that we knew the direction of their bias. In this respect conventional wisdom would suggest that price responsiveness of imports should increase following the liberalization measures.

Drawing on the work of Neary and Roberts (1980), we analyse the demand for imports where quantity restrictions cover only a subset of a given <b>commodity</b> <b>category.</b> The model is then estimated on data from Morocco.

40|$|A {{discussion}} of exchange-traded funds and notes with quantitative analyses of commodity ETNs/ETFs on NYSE Arca. The unleveraged, non-inverse commodity ETP trackers analyzed in the thesis generally have low tracking errors. There are some exception {{in the case}} of the ETFs United States Oil Fund (OIL) and United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) which not have been reliably trackers for parts of the research period, at least not when front month futures spot prices are utilized as their respective benchmarks. When ETNs and ETFs that are tracking the same commodities are compared the results indicate that ETNs may not be gaining much in terms of returns or tracking error ability over the ETFs. The retail investor that is trading ETPs can probably just as well choose the physical ETF over the ETN, not least due to counterparty default risk of ETNs. Derivative based mutual funds and ETPs in the broad <b>commodity</b> <b>category</b> seem to be quite similar in terms of returns even when mutual fund frontloads are accounted for. ETFs in the precious metal selection and derivative based ETPs in the energy selections seem to be a preferred choice over generally more equity based mutual funds and ETPs in terms of bringing diversification gains to a broad market portfolio. In the choice of the mutual fund versus the ETN that is relating to DJ-UBS CI TR, the mutual fund is higher ranked by some of the risk adjusted measures. This is contrary to the findings for the S&P GSCI TR related securities, where the ETPs seem to be a preferred choice compared to the respective mutual fund of that index. Deutsche Bank’s optimal yield technology ETFs that optimizes effects of roll yield in futures markets might have a slight comparative advantage over comparable ETFs in the broad commodity and energy markets. For the precious metal markets the physical depot ETFs are probably preferable over Deutsche Bank’s ETFs when comparing returns for single precious metal ETFs. The quantitative results which I have calculated with traditional return/risk measures may not appropriately take into account the risk inherent in some of the ETP structures, e. g. the uncollateralized ETN. An option strategy for management of ETN counterparty default is suggested. Risks of busts due to bubble-like tendencies in some of the commodity markets, and the effects potential busts might have on the functioning of ETPs, is also challenging to include with traditional risk calculations based on historical data. However, the unleveraged, non-inverse commodity ETP trackers analyzed in this thesis subsequent to chapter 1 seem to generally have performed quite well in obtaining low tracking errors during the financial crisis a period which started off with high commodity prices similarly to what has been seen in commodity markets from 2009 onwards...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho procura expor por que existe uma inversÃo dos conceitos de abstrato e concreto entre a Economia PolÃtica ClÃssica, especificamente Adam Smith e David Ricardo, e Karl Marx, na explicaÃÃo sobre a teoria do valor da mercadoria, e por que Marx avanÃa mais que os economistas. Procura esclarecer por que o que os economistas consideram concreto para Marx nÃo passa de mera abstraÃÃo, demonstrando que isso ocorre devido aos diferentes olhares entre eles. Deste modo, debate sobre o modo de exposiÃÃo de ambos, ou seja, tanto dos economistas quanto de Marx, sobre a temÃtica do valor da mercadoria. Assim, a diferenciaÃÃo entre os mÃtodos de expor o pensamento fica clara, onde os economistas utilizam o mÃtodo empÃrico e Marx, o dialÃtico. E Ã justamente essa diferenciaÃÃo do mÃtodo que inverte os conceitos. Marx utiliza-se do mÃtodo proposto por Hegel como forma de expor o pensamento; deste modo, fez-se necessÃrio uma breve exposiÃÃo sobre o mÃtodo dialÃtico hegeliano. Ao final do texto, tem-se uma demonstraÃÃo passo a passo da relaÃÃo entre a exposiÃÃo de Marx na categoria mercadoria e o mÃtodo dialÃtico hegeliano; pode-se entÃo observar as semelhanÃas e diferenÃas entre Marx e Hegel, e sobre como Marx segue em sua exposiÃÃo as orientaÃÃes de Hegel, no que diz respeito Ã exteriorizaÃÃo da ideia. Em Hegel e Marx, o movimento do pensamento vai do abstrato ao concreto e se processa por escalas progressivas de concretizaÃÃo. Entre o mais abstrato e o mais concreto hÃ uma sÃrie de conceitos mais ou menos abstratos ligando os dois pontos extremos; sÃo as mediaÃÃes. O abstrato tem como pressuposto o concreto, sendo a essÃncia o fundante e a forma, o fundado; isto Ã, o conteÃdo {{material}} (concreto) possibilita a criaÃÃo da forma, aparÃncia (abstrato) que acaba por negar a prÃpria essÃncia (concreto) a partir da percepÃÃo que se dÃ de forma invertida, ou seja, o homem comum acredita que o que percebe, a aparÃncia, Ã a essÃncia; o conteÃdo, a realidade, o concreto. Marx procura demonstrar o processo do conhecimento da realidade que caminha do abstrato ao concreto. A dialÃtica Ã usada enquanto modo de exposiÃÃo e significa o retorno sintÃtico do analÃtico ou a reconstruÃÃo concreta do universal. O abstrato e o concreto nÃo existem em separado; fazem parte de uma totalidade, de uma unidade. O mÃtodo de abstraÃÃo permite entender as categorias da realidade de forma mais detalhada e profunda, para depois mentalmente reconstruir o todo complexo. Desta forma, o concreto Ã dado pelo pensamento, Ã o concreto pensado, e o abstrato Ã a percepÃÃo empÃrica e enganosa da sociedade capitalista. This work aims {{to explain}} why there is an inversion of the concrete and abstract concepts between the Classical Political Economy, specifically Adam Smith and David Ricardo, and Karl Marx, in the explanation {{of the theory of}} value, and why Marx goes further than the economists. It tries to clarify why, what the economists consider concrete to Marx, is no more than mere abstraction, showing that it is due to their different regards. This work debates on the explation way of them both â the economistsâ and Marxâs -, {{on the subject of the}} value of goods. The differentiation between the two methods os explaining the thoughts gets clear â the economist use the empriric method and Marx, the dialectic. It is this differentiation of the methods that invert the concepts. Marx uses the method proposed by Hegel as a way to expose the thought; as a consequence, it was necessary to a brief explanation on the hegelian dialectic method. At the end of the text, there is an explanation, step by step, of the relationship between Marxâs exposition on the <b>commodity</b> <b>category</b> and the hegelian dialectic method. It is possible then to observe the similarities and differences between Marx and Hegel, and how Marx follow Hegelâs orientations in his exposition, in relation of the exteriorization of the idea. In Hegel and Marx, the thought movement goes from the abstract to the concrete and is processed by progressive scales of concretization. Between the most abstract and the most concrete, there is a range of more or less abstract concepts linking the two extreme points; they are the mediations. The abstract has the concrete as a presupposition; the essence is the founder, and the shape is the founded, which means the material contents (concrete) make possible the criation of shape, appearance (abstract), which ends up denying its own essence (concrete) based on the perception that happens in a inverted way â the common man believes that what he perceives, the appearance, is the essence; the contents are the reality, the concrete. Marx tries to demonstrate the process of knowing the reality, that goes from the abstract to the concrete. Dialectic is used as a mean of exposition and means the synthetic return of the analytical or the concrete reconstruction of the universal. Abstract and concret do not exist apart; they are part of a totality, of a unity. The abstraction method makes it possible to understand the categories of reality in a more detailed and deeper way, in order to mentally reconstruct the complex whole. In this way, the concrete happens due to the thought, it is the thought concrete, and the abstract is the empiric and deceptive perception of the capitalist society...|$|E

It is found that only very few areas would clearly benefit from enhanced regional control over export earnings, mainly by obtaining a higher share of resource rents. Furthermore, in the present environment of distorted prices and balance of payments constraints, decentralization could lead to substantial windfall gains for established exporters at the expense of areas that happen to supply mainly the domestic market. The speedy introduction of a price structure reflecting genuine scarcities would therefore help not only to eliminate allocative inefficiency, but also to minimize interregional distributional conflicts. ...|$|R

Meanwhile, greater trade is expected to {{play a key role}} in recovery, and in sustaining growth afterwards. The crisis offers an excellent opportunity to make progress on facilitating intra-Asian trade and boosting the region's contribution to global economic recovery. This paper examines the status of, and challenges to, trade facilitation among the Asian Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation members, and the roles of hard and soft infrastructure (including logistics) in improving that performance. Analysis with a computable general equilibrium framework indicates that even a relatively modest reduction in trade costs can yield significant gains. Gross domestic product in the region expands and countries move into a more diversified trading pattern. Of particular relevance for policy considerations is that the results vary considerably across bilateral trade routes and <b>commodity</b> <b>categories.</b> asian apec members infrastructure; regional integration; trade facilitation...|$|R

These scenarios were compared to a base scenario of no trade liberalisation except for the Closer Economic Relations (CER) agreement between Australia and New Zealand. All trade agreements were compared under three scenarios regarding growth in New ZealandÕs roundwood supply. The projections were made with the Global Forest Products Model from 1998 to 2015. The Global Forest Products Model is a spatial equilibrium model, which gives projections of production, consumption, and trade for each of 180 countries and 14 forest <b>commodity</b> <b>categories.</b> Results suggested the regional trade agreements (P 5 and AFTA-CER) would have a limited effect on New Zealand production of forest products under all supply scenarios.

It raises the questions {{of the types of}} cargos in which SNM could be hidden, and their impact on detected signatures. Since the definition of a set of ''typical'' or standard cargos has proven to be difficult, we analyzed shipping manifests for US imports shipped through North American ports collected on 14 days distributed over 12 months. From these data, we generated several distribution functions such as <b>commodity</b> <b>categories,</b> average densities, and packaging types that could be of interest to the cargo scanning community. One of the cargo scanning techniques currently under development at LLNL is based on neutron active interrogation, and relies on the unique signature of beta-delayed gammas emitted by fission products in the 3 to 7 MeV energy range. {sup 19 }F(n,a) {sup 16 }N, has been identified as the main potential interference for 7 and 9 MeV neutron beams.

40|$|Expenditure {{patterns}} among {{a sample}} of 99 rural households in two communal districts in KwaZulu-Natal were investigated to determine {{the potential impact of}} a widespread income shock on household expenditure. The results showed expenditure elasticities of close to unity for food. Low elasticities were found for staple foods. Elasticities for meat, meat products and poultry were close to unity, while horticultural products showed the greatest potential for demand growth within the food category. Of the statistically significant <b>commodity</b> <b>categories,</b> expenditure elasticities for durables, housing and transport were more than double those estimated for the aggregate food category. For consumer items, the district expenditure elasticities were estimated to be 0, 76 and 0, 71, while expenditure on social obligations would not increase with rural incomes. Wealthier households (the top expenditure decile) have a greater propensity for increased expenditure on transport, while poorer households show a greater propensity for increased expenditure on housing and durables. Although agriculture has the potential to generate widespread growth in rural incomes, the preference for manufactured goods casts some doubt on the strength of consumption multipliers for locally produced farm and non-farm goods in rural KwaZulu-Natal. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{results of}} the National Bureau of Economic Research's (NBER) research project on exchange control, liberalization and economic development from 1970 - 1973. Initial adoption of exchange controls was generally an ad hoc response to external events. The optimal resource allocation dictum [...] that the marginal cost of earning foreign exchange should be equated with the marginal cost of saving foreign exchange [...] was generally abandoned in favor of saving foreign exchange at all costs. An export-oriented development strategy generally entails relatively greater use of indirect, rather than direct, interventions. There is considerable evidence from the individual country studies that direct intervention may be considerably more costly than is generally recognized. Export rebates, tariffs, surcharges, import entitlement schemes, {{and a host of}} other devices are generally employed under quantitative restrictions regimes, and they lead to a wide dispersion in effective exchange rates by <b>commodity</b> <b>categories.</b> The effect of liberalization is often to induce a recessionary tendency rather than the traditionally feared inflationary impact. Even when there is a single domestic price for the imported good, the method of license allocation makes an important difference to resource allocation and income distribution...|$|R
