500|$|As {{the final}} verse {{of the song}} begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a {{stalking}} cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's <b>cat,</b> <b>walks</b> towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it {{over her shoulder and}} it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was and looks up at both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, [...] "Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind".|$|E

50|$|Rose {{has gone}} upstairs {{and knocked on}} the door, but there is no response. She hears the sounds of a clock ticking, and then a part of the door opens and the <b>cat</b> <b>walks</b> out. The eyes change from green to red, it hisses at Rose, and beams of {{electric}} red light come out of the eyes and scorch the wall where Rose had been. The cat leaps at her with its claws out, but Rose instinctively grabs it about the neck as tight as she can and holds it at arm's length. She realizes it cannot be a real cat, and smashes it against the wall until it is 'dead.' She runs back down the stairs, and doesn't see another cat come through the door.|$|E

She asks the kids how their day was, and tells them that she just saw a cat in a hat [...] "going {{down the street with}} a moss-covered three-handled family gredunza". The exact identity of the item has never been revealed, but this indicates that the gredunza was never really lost, and the Cat simply wanted an excuse to have more fun.

City officials have imposed several plans to attract the urban users and the nature lovers to Beirut's squares and spaces. One of the plans is a [...] "temporary uses" [...] policy focused on a rambla pedestrian spine that links the existing city center and Beirut Souks northwards to the terraced corniche and promenade.

He plays on, despite not being able to read the music, and it turns out to be a disaster. The cat is truly embarrassed, and {{audience}} members walk out of the Hall while calling the performance [...] "ridiculous", [...] "insulting", and [...] "preposterous," [...] and the Joneses narrowly escape out the stage entrance.
