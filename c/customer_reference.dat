40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} how <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> of new ventures contribute to initiation of customer relationships. In particular {{the relationship between the}} new venture and its initial <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> will be investigated. This relationship will be investigated within a network approach and {{from the perspective of the}} new venture. The idea that <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> play an important part in business marketing is generally taken for granted; yet there is limited reported academic research on the phenomenon. Prior research has focused on their use, effectiveness and reference activities (Salminen and Moller, 2006); internal learning from <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> (Ruokolainen, 2004; Ruokolainen, 2005; Ruokolainen and Mäkelä, 2007; Ruokolainen, 2008) and contextual factors that influence the benefits of the <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> (Aarikka-Stenroos and Makkonen, 2014). Limited research however has been devoted to how the nature of the relationship between the new venture and the <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> influence further initiation processes. This thesis will contribute to this gap by investigating the nature of the <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> relationships with the new ventures, to understand how these <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> contribute in initiation processes and to understand how the initial <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> relationship is connected with the further customer relationship pattern of new ventures. Three research questions are designed to contribute to the purpose of the master thesis. The first research question examines the nature relationship between the new venture and the <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> with the aim of understanding understands how this initial <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> has contributed to further customer relationships. The second research question aims to understand how <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> contribute to the initiation of customer relationships. This research question incorporate aspects such as actor and industry characteristics, as well as the nature of the product. The final research is concerned with the new venture s customer relationship pattern and how the initial <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> influences this. Combined, these research questions will contrite to understanding how <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> of new ventures contribute to initiation of customer relationships. The thesis is carried out by two different sets of data. The first set is the literature review developed and presented by Husefest (2015), which presents relevant theory as well as a conceptual framework that capture the relevant phenomenon. The second set is the empirical data collection gathered through semi-structured interviews. The interviews were held in Spring 2016 by the author of this thesis. The interviewees were representatives from the new ventures, either through the role as the CEO or the Sales Director. The case interviews were selected based on four criteria. The results of the analysis provide a foundation for understanding the factors that influence the <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> and the customer development of new ventures. The thesis has found that the initial <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> often are established within the new ventures network, based on either professional or social ties. The nature of the relationship is closely connected to the whether the relationship is initiated based on social or professional relations as well as the nature of the product. Relationships based on social ties are found to include products with low risks connected to implementation, and there is a larger degree of a personal layer to the relation. Relationships with are higher risks connected to implementation of the product view the personal relations as less important. These are still characterized by a high degree of commitment and trust due to interdependence and the need to being long-term customers. The contribution of the <b>reference</b> <b>customers</b> are closely connected to the industry of which they operate and the nature of the product, and the potential customers are concerned with elements due to these aspects. The thesis has also found a strong connection to the initial <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> and further customer relationships. New venture recreates a <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> strategy based on the experiences from the entry market when entering a new market. Thee experiences are strongly connected with their initial <b>reference</b> <b>customer.</b> In conclusion, the initial <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> relationship is important for both acquiring a potential new customer, but just as much for the strategic customer acquisition strategy of the new venture. The thesis provides several implications for the new ventures. The main implication lies in the new venture s initial network, whether they are connected with actors with potential opportunities for the new venture. It is suggested that new ventures devote time to develop their social as well as professional network in order to easier recognize opportunities. New ventures are also suggested to devote energy to learn as much as possible about sales processes and industry knowledge, as well as internal capabilities such as sales arguments and customer needs within the initial <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> relationship. The study does however show that there is room for improvements within the theoretical area of the phenomenon, and recommend that further research continue to add to the research on <b>reference</b> <b>customers.</b> Particularly the author recommends that the research is investigated through the perspective on the <b>reference</b> <b>customer</b> and/or the next potential customers in addition to the new venture, in order to understand their perspective and perception on the phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{phenomenon}} of <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> marketing in a business tobusiness (B to B) context. Although customer references are generally considered an important marketing and sales tool, the academic literature has paid surprisingly {{little attention to the}} phenomenon. The study suggests that customer references could be viewed as important marketing assets for industrial suppliers, and the ability to build, manage and leverage <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> portfolios systematically constitutes a relevant marketing capability. The role of customer references is examined {{in the context of the}} industrial suppliers' shift towards a solution and project orientation and in the light of the on going changes in the project business. Suppliers in several industry sectors are undergoing a change from traditional equipment manufacturing towards project and solution oriented business. It is argued in this thesis that the high complexity, the project oriented nature and the intangible service elements that characterise many contemporary B to B offerings further increase the role of customer references. The study proposes three mechanisms of <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> marketing: status transfer, validation through testimonials and the demonstration of experience and prior performance. The study was conducted in the context of Finnish B to B process technology and information technology companies. The empirical data comprises 38 interviews with managers of four case companies, 165 <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> descriptions gathered from six case companies' Web sites, as well as company internal material. The findings from the case studies show that customer references have various external and internal functions that contribute to the growth and performance of B to B firms. Externally, customer references bring status transfer effects from reputable customers, concretise and demonstrate complex solutions, and provide indirect evidence of experience, previous performance, technological functionality and delivered customer value. They can also be leveraged internally to facilitate organisational learning and training, advance offering development, and motivate personnel. Major reference projects create new business opportunities and can be used as a vehicle for strategic change. The findings of the study shed light on the on going changing orientations in the project business environment, increase understanding of the variety of ways in which customer references can be deployed as marketing assets, and provide a framework of the relevant tasks and activities related to building, managing and leveraging a firm's <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> portfolio. The findings contribute to the industrial marketing research, to the literature on marketing assets and capabilities and to the literature on projects and solutions. The proposed functions and mechanisms of <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> marketing bring a more thorough and structured understanding about the essence and characteristics of the phenomenon and give a wide ranging view of the role of customer references as marketing assets for B to B firms. The study suggests several managerial implications for industrial suppliers in order to systematise <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> marketing efforts...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Start-up {{technology}} companies producing complex products often {{have problems with}} market entry due to several reasons. The technology market seems to be volatile and technology entrepreneurs tend to concentrate on technological issues. In addition, small companies face severe problems in marketing including designing the content of promotional media, selecting media and conducting market research. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to support the market entry of start-up {{technology companies}} by creating a construction for producing marketing materials based on a <b>customer</b> <b>reference.</b> This study describes the related content to be used in building the relationship with the next potential customers. Methodology: This study applies a constructive research approach in order to contribute both scientific and practical knowledge. The construction has been created with the help of a literature review and tested by two <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> cases: one with a company producing a web-based solution for a government organization, and the other is a company producing accounting software for a computer reseller. Findings: In start-up technology companies the creation of a market message based on customer references could take a qualitative approach, the intention being to increase understanding, instead of a quantitative approach, where the intention is to rely on statistical evidence. The latter is used mainly by large companies who have several customer references. Originality: This is one of the first papers to discuss a solution on how a start-up technology company should use a <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> for creating marketing materials...|$|E

40|$|Marketing {{and sales}} have {{generally}} been recognized as typical bottlenecks for start-up technology companies which produce complex products for corporate customers. Start-up technology companies often need a <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> to support their efforts in entering the market. Without a real-world assessment that the first <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> represents, {{it is difficult to}} convince the next potential customer to buy. The first <b>customer</b> <b>reference,</b> the topic of this study, has not been widely considered in the literature. Therefore, in order to close this research gap, a conceptual sub-study is conducted by employing a domain modeling technique to identify several closely related concepts. The identified concepts are investigated further by means of a literature study. New concepts are defined and based on these a descriptive model is created to increase the understanding of the problem domain. This also assists in early detection of factors for further sub-studies. This study conducts a multiple case sub-study, a survey sub-study with statistical analyses and a single longitudinal case sub-study including a triangulation sub-study of the previous three empirical sub-studies. Both method triangulation and theory triangulation are used. Field data was collected by means of semi-structured interviews and a survey. In total, 36 Thai software companies were interviewed in order to collect information relating to their first <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> cases. The data was analyzed by using an inductive multiple case study method supported with a survey method including statistical analyses and a single longitudinal case study method. The inductive multiple case study method was used to identify the key variables and to create a basic descriptive framework. The statistical analyses were conducted to study the importance of each variable and to test how well the variables explain the growth of the companies. The single longitudinal case study method was intended to anchor the results of the previous studies to a real business case. Finally, based on the analyses, a predictive model is proposed. A secondary sample from a different business landscape was employed to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} phenomena and to explore how broadly the results from the primary sample could be generalized. The results of this study increase the understanding of how start-up companies which produce complex products for corporate customers can capitalize on the market potential with the aid of a first <b>customer</b> <b>reference.</b> Based on the analyses the five variables contributing to the successful market entry of start-up technology companies were identified. Accordingly (1) a start-up technology company shares the costs of the first implementation with the first reference customer; (2) it uses the first <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> for learning experimental knowledge in order to formulate the sales and marketing arguments and (3) it does not use the first <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> for learning the correct technology; (4) its first reference customer operates in a key industrial sector of the country; and (5) in addition, the educational background of the entrepreneur is an important contributor to successful market entry. The single longitudinal case sub-study, including three embedded customer cases, illustrates how the variables form the pre-predicates and post-predicates for an iterative market entry. This study reports that only in a few cases the start-up technology companies had employed a <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> to support their sales effort. Thus, a constructive sub-study was conducted in order to create a construction of how a <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> could be used to produce marketing material. The construction was created based on the results of this study and on the literature review. Finally, the construction was tested with empirical data. Because of the encouraging outcome of the sub-study, further constructive studies are proposed in order to support the market entries of start-up technology companies in practice. This study is not the only study in the discipline of high technology and entrepreneurship in Thailand, but it is probably among the largest studies with multiple sub-studies and methods, although the sample size of the study was limited. This study has opened the doors for larger studies in the discipline in question, at least in Thailand, but likely also in other Southeast Asian countries. A major part of present entrepreneurship studies has been done either in the USA or Europe but relatively scantly in Southeast Asia. In the published articles related to this study and accordingly in this study, several research methods have been applied, which have not been used or have been used scarcely in the present research discipline. The research methods are the domain modeling, which is used for conceptual modeling in knowledge engineering; theory triangulation of the studies, which is used for increasing internal validity of results; and the constructive research approach, which is used for bringing research results into practice. Therefore, this study is a pioneer study in developing and in adopting methods used mainly by the other research disciplines. The phenomenon studied by the present author has previously been scantly investigated, thus making this study unique. The results and methods are available through this research report and also through published articles for scholars, practitioners and a larger audience...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{was written}} to expand <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> {{literature}} by studying how organisational buyers utilise customer references {{and what kind}} of aspects affect the reference utilisation process. The objective was to fill the theoretical gap of researches about the utilisation of references from the buyers' side. Through an extensive literature review the relevant existing literature was found, combining the previous findings about the suppliers' reference utilisation and buyers information search practices. A theoretical framework was created from existing theories, which was then utilised during the empirical part. To achieve the objectives, a qualitative approach was chosen. The empiric research was made in the context of purchasing digital solutions. In-depth interviews were held for organisational buyers and analysis was done based on the transcribed interviews. Findings highlight the complex nature of the reference utilisation process, including different actors, affecting aspects, objectives and process phases. References are utilised to validate purchase decisions by building trust, decreasing risks, validating expertise, concretising offerings and increasing internal motivation. In the end, long-terms objectives for reference utilisation derive from organisational, strategic goals. The buyers utilise references not only during the purchase process, but also prior and post it. References are utilised as a source of inspiration, tool for sourcing suppliers, source of reliable information, tool for evaluating suppliers, and concretising offerings during the projects.

A survey instrument containing an 2 ̆ 2 in-basket 2 ̆ 2 test was sent out to approximately 1400 subjects and was completed by 102 industrial users of twin screw extruders used in the production of plastic compounds. The subjects were all American-based companies and were drawn from a national sample. The hypothesis testing was based on the within-subjects results of a repeated measures analysis of variance technique. While the small sample size and low response rate limit the generalizibility of the results, the research reveals that a country-of-origin bias does exist in purchasers of capital equipment. A significant difference in levels of perceived risk is found in buyers considering purchasing Chinese, German and American machinery. Various risk reduction strategies are tested, including the use of <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> lists, warranty 2 ̆ 6 performance guarantees, trial performance runs and trade show participation. Three risk reducers are found to cause a significant reduction in perceived risk, namely, the use of a <b>customer</b> <b>reference</b> list, the offer of warranty 2 ̆ 6 performance guarantees and offer of trial performance runs. Risk reduction strategies are tested for significant effects individually and as a group. Country-of-origin effects are modified by risk reduction strategies, but even after all are used, a significant country of origin effect remains.

We introduce a method of improving model performance by utilizing a concept of human behavior that has never been incorporated into the models of sales-service relationships. This concept, called the loss aversion property, claims that customers (shippers) react more strongly when they experience service performance below their reference point (expectation) than when they experience service performance above their reference point. Using this concept, we posit that a one unit decrease in service quality from the <b>customer's</b> <b>reference</b> point would decrease a carrier's sales more than an equivalent-sized increase in service quality would increase sales. To incorporate an asymmetric pattern of the sales-service relationship, we develop a model that makes a key distinction between sales response to service increase and to service decrease. The model is demonstrated using hypothetical data. The discussion addresses multiple service quality measures as well as data implementation issues.
