5|$|E. Midy {{proved a}} general result about such fractions, now called Midy's theorem, in 1836. The {{publication}} was obscure, {{and it is}} unclear if his proof directly involved 0.999..., {{but at least one}} modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that a decimal of the form 0.b1b2b3... is a positive integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem. Investigations in this direction can motivate such <b>concepts</b> <b>as</b> greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, Fermat primes, order of group elements, and quadratic reciprocity.|$|E
5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} the {{technologies}} necessary to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic <b>concepts</b> <b>as</b> NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{developed}} by Grasshopper Manufacture. The game was conceived by studio founder Goichi Suda, beginning development in 1999 after completion of the studio's debut title The Silver Case. The staff number for The Silver Case was under ten people and thus they had to adjust their development goals based on that. For Flower, Sun, and Rain five or six more people were involved and thus the scope was increased, such as including exploration and action elements. According to Suda, Flower, Sun, and Rain {{was part of the}} studio's transition towards more action-oriented titles. While The Silver Case was published on the original PlayStation, that console was nearing the end of its viable life cycle, so Flower, Sun, and Rain {{was developed}} for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). Flower, Sun, and Rain moved away from the purely text-driven structure of The Silver Case, but it still carried over many of the previous game's themes and <b>concepts.</b> <b>As</b> with The Silver Case, Suda wanted to include puzzles, but felt that he had gone too far with the variety and challenge of puzzles within The Silver Case. Instead, Suda created a single puzzle system revolving around numerical combinations, which both simplified puzzles and tied in with Mondo's character.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with recommendations {{made by the}} California's Department of Education, Rocklin Unified School District students are taught using a standards-based curriculum; each student much fulfill a set of essential skills before {{they are allowed to}} pass the class. The program is initially implemented in district elementary schools. For some classes, like English, essential skills may be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade on assigned essays or tests. In classes like mathematics, Essential Skills must be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade in specific skills on cumulative tests. In addition, WHS policy does not allow F or D grades. Any grade below a grade of C is considered a No Mark (NM) or a No Credit (NC); the class must then be repeated to get a passing grade. This plan attempts to prepare students for the California High School Exit Exam, or CAHSEE test, which they are expected to pass prior to graduation; CAHSEE is provided to students during their second year. The test covers grade 6–10 language arts <b>concepts,</b> <b>as</b> well as pre-algebraic and Algebra I mathematics.|$|E

25|$|Ethologists {{expressed}} concern about the adequacy of some of the research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalisation to humans from animal studies.

Tomforde {{had been working on}} the Mercedes City Car (coincidentally abbreviated MCC) project at Daimler-Benz since 1990, which produced the eco-sprinter and eco-speedster <b>concepts</b> <b>as</b> well as the Vision-A concept, which eventually became the Mercedes-Benz A-Class.|$|E
25|$|Newton {{considered}} {{time and}} space to be absolute. This allowed him to consider <b>concepts</b> <b>as</b> true position and true velocity. Newton also recognized that weight {{as measured by the}} action of weighing was affected by environmental factors such as buoyancy. He considered this a false weight induced by imperfect measurement conditions, for which he introduced the term apparent weight as compared to the true weight defined by gravity.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other games developed by Blizzard, Hearthstone was an experimental game {{developed by a}} smaller team based on the appreciation of collectible card games at the company. The game was designed to avoid pitfalls of other digital collectible card games by eliminating any possible plays from an opponent during a player's turn and by replicating {{the feel of a}} physical card game within the game's user interface. Many of the <b>concepts</b> <b>as</b> well as art assets were based on those previously published in the physical World of Warcraft Trading Card Game.|$|E

25|$|A {{distinct}} criticism {{concerns the}} possible sloppiness of the logic and scientific {{basis of the}} three <b>concepts.</b> <b>As</b> Leo Spitzer has written, the actual science of the idea, which is vaguely Darwinian, is rather tenuous, and shortly after Taine's work was published a number of objections were made on scientific grounds. Spitzer also points out, again citing period sources, {{that the relationship between}} the three terms themselves was never well understood, and {{that it is possible to}} argue that moment is an unnecessary addition implied by the other two.|$|E
25|$|Lubbock {{had been}} {{as much of an}} ethnologist as an archaeologist. The founders of {{cultural}} anthropology, such as Tylor and Morgan, were to follow his lead on that. Lubbock created such <b>concepts</b> <b>as</b> savages and barbarians based on the customs of then modern tribesmen and made the presumption that the terms can be applied without serious inaccuracy to the men of the Paleolithic and the Neolithic. Childe broke with this view:The assumption that any savage tribe today is primitive, in the sense that its culture faithfully reflects that of much more ancient men is gratuitous.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Catholic Churches have {{as their}} theological, spiritual, and liturgical {{patrimony}} {{the traditions of}} Eastern Christianity. Thus, {{there are differences in}} emphasis, tone, and articulation of various aspects of Catholic theology between the Eastern and Latin churches. The primary patristic theologian of the Western Church, Augustine of Hippo whose influence advance such theological <b>concepts</b> <b>as</b> original sin and ex opere operato has had little influence on the Christian East, making for differences in baptismal theology, Mariology, and sacramental theology. Likewise, medieval Western scholasticism, that of Thomas Aquinas in particular, which was largely based on Augustine, also had little reception in the East.|$|E
