40|$|Abstract—Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) {{applications}} {{are complex and}} incur significant costs and effort during version upgrades, which are further exacerbated by any <b>customizations.</b> Our temporal meta-data framework for EIS applications avoids or minimizes these upgrade issues by standardizing all update procedures as an updated set or stream of individual meta-data changes. Each change is applied sequentially for all changes between the previous and current meta-data models. Meta-data changes include the core application functionality plus meta-data changes for any local or unique <b>customizations.</b> The automated update process removes the need from developers to produce version specific update programs, and simplifies the end user’s meta-data EIS application update processes. Collision detection with third party <b>customizations,</b> known as Variant Logic, can precisely identify any potential conflict in advance, avoiding or reducing compatibility rework effort for <b>customizations.</b> Index Terms—meta-model, automated update, variant, logic...|$|R
