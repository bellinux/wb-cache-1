50|$|This novel {{approach}} is for instance {{employed in the}} Florida Strait where electromagnetic induction in submerged telephone cable is used to estimate the through-flow through the gateway and the <b>complete</b> <b>setup</b> {{can be seen as}} one huge current meter. The physics behind: Charged particles (the ions in seawater) are moving with the ocean currents in the magnetic field of the Earth which is perpendicular to the movement. Using Faraday's law of induction (the third of Maxwell's equations), it is possible to evaluate the variability of the averaged horizontal flow by measuring the induced electric currents. The method has a minor vertical weighting effect due to small conductivity changes at different depths.|$|E

50|$|Other {{features}} of the tank were also quite radical. The rifled gun, a Bofors 105 mm L74 with a barrel length of 62 calibres, {{was able to use}} the same ammunition as the British Royal Ordnance L7, and would be equipped with an autoloader allowing a rate of fire of one round every third second, also allowing the crew to be reduced to two; a gunner/driver and the commander (most designs of the era used a crew of four), with a single person being able to handle all functions of the tank from his ordinary position due to duplicate controls. This would of course only be used in emergencies, as the workload would be overwhelming, but apart from providing redundancy it also allowed the crew to shift tasks between them as situation required. The concept went through practical tests, that quickly revealed that a two-man crew would not be self-sufficient when considering the many tasks not directly related to handling the tank: in particular, routine maintenance, bivouacking, track-changes and reloading in field. While the last issue could have been solved by adding staff to the ammunition crews, it was decided that a third crew-member was needed. To enhance combat effectiveness, the third man was to be assigned as a rear driver/radio operator, facing the rear of the tank and equipped with a <b>complete</b> <b>setup</b> for driving. This allowed the tank to be driven backwards at the same speed as forwards, keeping its frontal armour pointed at the enemy, while relieving the commander of routine radio duty. The commander and gunner/driver both had the same set of sights and controls to fire the gun and drive the tank.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{optimization}} {{proposed in}} this work uses a linear programming technique to maximize the quantity of job orders processed on the machines at each constant job-mix stage. Priority factors guide the sequential allocation of partial and <b>complete</b> <b>setups</b> by ranking job/machine combinations in order of processing performance and capacity to meet due dates. The job allocation is governed by an algorithm which constitutes {{the backbone of the}} dispatching software that was developed and used to solve the examples presented in this thesis. Priority factors offer an effective mean of guiding the selection of setups by ranking job/machine combinations by processing speed and capacity to meet due times. The necessity for priority factors becomes more important as setup times increase in relation with quantities to be manufactured and the processing times. Priority factors also guide the allocation of partial setups on the machines to speed up job completion. The job allocation system has a substantial potential for providing shorter makespan than the Shortest Operating Time methodology by increasing machine utilization...|$|R

40|$|Universally {{composable}} (UC) protocols {{retain their}} security properties even when run concurrently alongside arbitrary other protocols. Unfortunately, {{it is known}} that UC multi-party computation (for general functionalities, and without assuming honest majority) is impossible without some form of setup. To circumvent this impossibility, various types of setup assumptions have been proposed. With only a few notable exceptions, past work has viewed these setup assumptions as being implemented by some ideal, incorruptible entity. Any such entity is thus a single point of failure, and security fails catastrophically in case the setup entity is subverted by an adversary. We propose here a clean, general, and generic approach for distributing trust among m arbitrary setups, by model-ing potential corruption of setups within the UC framework, where such corruption might be fail-stop, passive, or arbi-trary and is in addition to possible corruption of the parties themselves. We show several feasibility and impossibility results in this model, for different specifications of the cor-ruptible sets. For example, we show that given m <b>complete</b> <b>setups,</b> up to t of which might be actively corrupted in an adaptive manner, general multiparty computation with no honest majority is possible if and only if t < m/ 2...|$|R
