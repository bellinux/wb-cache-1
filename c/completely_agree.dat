2500|$|I. C. Frimu {{was among}} the last PSDR figures of his age to be {{respected}} by both the Reformist socialists and their communist adversaries. The moderate Constantin Titel Petrescu praised Frimu as [...] "that admirable human example of honesty, goodness and kindliness". Rakovsky [...] who had since affiliated with Leninism and had taken refuge in Bolshevist Russia [...] was himself distressed by the news; in spring 1919, his wife Ileana Pralea wrote to Rozalia Frimu a letter of condolence, in which she said [...] "I am {{in a position to}} add that one of my companion's greatest hopes has extinguished with Frimu." [...] As the Socialist Party was split into the moderate groups and the newly formed Romanian Communist Party, Frimu's legacy became the topic of dispute [...] Moscovici, who sided with the former, claimed that Frimu disapproved of the October Revolution (" [...] Frimu, who had seen the Russian Revolution [...] {{a year and a half}} of its activity, never did <b>completely</b> <b>agree</b> with its methods"), and, making reference to the communist activist Alecu Constantinescu, argued that Frimu [...] "could not stand" [...] the latter's [...] "demagogy".|$|E
2500|$|The {{selection}} of Jones to the U.S. 2014 Winter Olympics bobsled team was criticized by some American bobsledders as happening {{due to her}} fame. Curt Tomasevicz said, [...] "It's {{hard for me to}} name one or two athletes that would <b>completely</b> <b>agree</b> with that decision." [...] Emily Azevedo, who was competing with Katie Eberling and Jones for a spot on the team, said: [...] "I should have been working harder on gaining Twitter followers than gaining muscle mass." [...] Neither Eberling or Azevedo blamed Jones for her selection. United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation CEO Darrin Steele defended the selection: [...] "I haven't heard anyone making the argument about Lolo not being a better athlete right now, a better brakeman for the team. I don't think I've come across that one time. I've heard a lot about history and all that's nice. But who's going to provide the best results for the U.S. team in Sochi? That's the bottom line. And I'll have that debate with anyone who wants to have it.". The team, ended up in 11th place. Bobsledder Elana Meyers also defended the {{selection of}} Jones.|$|E

Knowing what he did of his wife, or thinking that he knew what he did, he did not conceive it possible that a worse messenger should be chosen. He had known himself to be a very bad one, but he did honestly believe her to be even less fitted for the task than he himself. But he said nothing,--simply wishing that he had not left his whist for such a purpose as this.|$|E
60|$|With such censures I cannot profess that I <b>completely</b> <b>agree.</b> The nolo episcopari, {{though still}} in use, is so {{directly}} {{at variance with}} the tendency of all human wishes, that it cannot be thought to express the true aspirations of rising priests in the Church of England. A lawyer does not sin in seeking to be a judge, or in compassing his wishes by all honest means. A young diplomat entertains a fair ambition when he looks forward to be the lord of a first-rate embassy; and a poor novelist, when he attempts to rival Dickens or rise above Fitzjeames, commits no fault, though he may be foolish. Sydney Smith truly said that in these recreant days we cannot expect to find the majesty of St. Paul beneath the cassock of a curate. If we look to our clergymen {{to be more than}} men, we shall probably teach ourselves to think that they are less, and can hardly hope to raise the character of the pastor by denying to him the right to entertain the aspirations of a man.|$|E

"Just {{explain to}} her that any young lady who talks {{so much to the}} same young gentleman will {{certainly}} be observed--that people will accuse her of setting her cap at Lord Lufton. Not that I suspect her--I give her credit for too much proper feeling: I know her education has been good, and her principles are upright. But people will talk of her. You must understand that, Fanny, as well as I do." [...] Fanny could not help meditating whether proper feeling, education, and upright principles did forbid Lucy Robarts {{to fall in love with}} Lord Lufton; but her doubts on this subject, if she held any, were not communicated to her ladyship. It had never entered into her mind that a match was possible between Lord Lufton and Lucy Robarts, nor had she the slightest wish to encourage it now that the idea was suggested to her. On such a matter she could sympathize with Lady Lufton, though she did not <b>completely</b> <b>agree</b> with her as to the expediency of any interference.
