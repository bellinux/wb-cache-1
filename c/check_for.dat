We prove that both qualitative and quantitative model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> this class of properties and pPDA is decidable. Then we show that model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> the qualitative fragment of the logic PCTL and pPDA is also decidable. Moreover, we develop an error-tolerant model <b>checking</b> algorithm <b>for</b> PCTL and the subclass of stateless pPDA. Finally, we {{consider the}} class of ω-regular properties and show that both qualitative and quantitative model <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> pPDA is decidable. 1...|$|R
