40|$|The {{development}} of auxospores and initial {{cells of the}} freshwater chain-forming diatom Ellerbeckia arenaria forma arenaria was studied using light and electron microscopy. Whether the auxospore mother cell is formed vegetatively (parthenogenesis) or through autogamy, is still a matter of speculation. Because no signs of spermiogenesis could be detected in our material, we exclude oogamy. Further development involves retraction of the protoplast from the epivalve {{and the formation of}} a featureless siliceous cap with a central opening on its free surface. The homology and function of this cap remains uncertain. At {{the other end of the}} cell the protoplast remains tightly attached to the hypovalve throughout its further development. This hypovalve always has a <b>concave</b> <b>valve</b> face. An organic wall bearing many layers of overlapping, small silica scales begins formation while the cell is still enclosed within the mother cell wall, and allows the auxospore to swell, thus breaking the siliceous cap and girdle bands. External and internal surfaces of scales can be distinguished morphologically. Initial valves are formed internal to the scales at an oblique angle to the parent chain. The initial epivalve always faces the hypotheca of the auxospore mother cell, and the initial valves already show elements of the heterovalvy manifest in the vegetative cells. The significance of the observations in terms of ecology and phylogeny is discussed. The combinations Ellerbeckia arenaria (Moore ex Ralfs) R. M. Crawford, and E. arenaria forma teres (Brun ex Schmidt) R. M. Crawford are validated...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{morphological}} {{investigations of}} {{the hearts of the}} prawn and the sea louse with the recognitions of its: location, cell number, and innervation; together with the observations of inner structures such as: ostia, arterial valves, and other appendages were carried-out. Hearts were extirpated from intact or formalin-fixed specimens, then prepared for binocular and histological examinations. In the prawn, a paired aorta diverges forward from the anterior of the heart. Pericardium occurs on the base of this aorta, and envelops it completely. Posteriorly, an aorta runs backward, leaving the heart, and branches off another aorta which descends near its proximal area. Ventrally, the heart provides a paired arteria hepatica. In such aortae and arteriae there exist valvular systems at their proximal lumens. As for ostia, four on the ventral surface and six on the dorsal surface of the heart exist. The cardiac ganglion is situated within a nerve trunk that lies on the midline of inner surface of the dorsal wall of the heart. It contains nine cells, irregularly arranged. A cardiac nerve connects with the former after penetrating into dorsal wall at the middle point of the heart. In the sea louse, the posterior end of a tubular heart is blinded, and its anterior lengthens to become an anterior aorta. Near the proximal end of this aorta, a paired arteria lateralis anterior derives from the cardiac wall. In addition, three pairs of arteriae are provided along each side of the heart ventro-laterally. Each of their proximal lumens has a thin <b>concave</b> <b>valve.</b> Two paired ostia are distributed possessing distinct thick borders {{in the latter half of}} the heart along each of its lateral surfaces. The nerve trunk, containing the cardiac ganglion, runs along the midline of the inner surface of the dorsal wall of the heart. Cells of the ganglion are six in number, arranging regularly along the length of the trunk...|$|E

5000|$|In the Gooch {{valve gear}} (invented by Daniel Gooch in 1843) the {{reversing}} and cut-off functions were achieved by raising or lowering a radius rod which connected the valve-rod to a [...] "stationary" [...] link pivoting around a fixed point. The advantages sought were reduced height for the gear and lighter action as the reversing lever was only required {{to lift the}} weight of the radius rod. This meant that the link was convex (in relation to the eccentrics) instead of <b>concave.</b> Gooch <b>valve</b> gear had the disadvantage of angularity between the valve spindle and the eccentric rod in full gear, whereas the best forms of the Stephenson gear, the thrust was in a straight line.

40|$|International audienceCoral sands off Réunion Island and Rodrigues (Mascarene archipelago, Western Indian Ocean) support diverse diatom communities, {{particularly}} rich in Monoraphidineae. Recent {{surveys of}} reef environments (June 2005 and June 2007) permitted {{the recognition of}} several taxa belonging to the diatom genus Cocconeis, among which are two new, relatively small taxa, epipsammic on coral sand. Cocconeis coronata Riaux-Gobin et Romero sp. nov. is similar to C. scutellum but has its own distinctive features. In external view, the <b>concave</b> raphe <b>valve</b> possesses uniseriate striae and a subsident hyaline marginal rim, while the strongly convex sternum valve has a submarginal, generally continuous crest, a hexagonal pattern of areolation, short, rounded spines that are often regularly arranged around valve face areolae, a complex areola hymen and small marginal chambers. Some morphometric differences were noted between the populations of C. coronata at Réunion and Rodrigues. Cocconeis margaritata Riaux-Gobin et Al-Handal, sp. nov. is smaller, possesses a sternum valve like that of C. placentula and C. neothumensis, but has denser striation and small pearl-like concretions around the areola aperture on the sternum valve. Several other taxa that resemble, or may be varieties of, C. margaritata require further study before being formally described. Cocconeis margaritata and C. coronata are small and relatively rare, so their study requires scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|The winged pearl oyster, Pteria penguin, is cultured {{primarily}} to produce half-pearls (mabe). The mabe quality {{is influenced by}} culture techniques, but there is limited information in this field. P. penguin with mean (+/- SE) dorso-ventral height of 250 +/- 6. 5 mm were used to investigate the influence of culture period and nucleus position on mabe quality. Oysters were relaxed using 1 -propylene phenoxetol, and five nuclei were glued at different positions to the inner surfaces of the oyster shells; three on the more <b>concave</b> left <b>valve</b> and two on the right valve. Nucleated oysters were then cultured for 10 months under commercial pearl farming conditions at Savusavu in Fiji. Nacre deposited at the base and top of the nuclei was measured monthly, from the 6 th to the 10 th months of culture and the different qualities of mabe produced at different positions were scrutinized. Nacre thicknesses at the base and top of the resulting mabe were significantly different at different months (P< 0. 05) {{and the rate of}} nacre deposition was highest during the warmer months. The different positions of nuclei on the valve greatly affected the quality of mabe formed. After a 10 -month culture period, around 1 mm of nacre covered the nuclei although the best quality mabe were obtained after 9 months...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the risk of}} outlet strut fracture (OSF) in Björk-Shiley convexo <b>concave</b> (BSCC) <b>valves</b> in relation to patients' clinical and valve characteristics.  DESIGN—A cohort of 2977  patients with 3325  valves with a follow up of 18  years.  SETTING— 38 cardiac implantation centres in the UK.  RESULTS— 56 OSF events were reported with 43  occurring in mitral and 13  in aortic valves. The overall OSF rate was 0. 17 %/year. No dominant clinical factor of risk was found, but multiple regression analysis identified age, body surface area, valve size, shop order fracture rate, and manufacturing period as risk factors for OSF. A 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 2 % to 6 %) decrease {{in the risk of}} OSF was observed for each advancing year of age and a fivefold (95 % CI 2  to 13) increase in risk for a 0. 5  m 2 increase in body surface area. The association between the risk of OSF and valve size was not constant over time. Excess risks among 31  mm and 33  mm sizes (mainly mitral valves) decreased over time while that for 23  mm (almost all aortic valves) increased. The risk of OSF increased by 40 % (95 % CI 20 % to 50 %) for a unit increase in the fracture rate of other valves in the same batch. For valves manufactured during 1981  to 1984  the risk of OSF was 4  (95 % CI 2  to 12) times greater than for valves manufactured before 1981.  CONCLUSIONS—The OSF rates for 60 ° BSCC valves observed in the UK are the highest among all monitored populations. The changing patterns of mitral and aortic valve OSF rates over time observed in this study have not been identified previously and highlight the need for continued monitoring of patients with the BSCC valve.    Keywords: cohort studies; heart valves; outlet strut fractur...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Identification of {{predictors}} of outlet strut fracture {{is important for}} recipients of large (≥ 29 mm) 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo-concave mitral valves {{when it comes to}} decision making on prophylactic explantation. An association between the manufacturing process of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves and the risk of fracture has been suggested. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine which items from the manufacturing records, in addition to known risk factors, were predictive of fracture of large 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo-concave mitral valves. Methods: All Dutch recipients (n = 2264) of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves were followed up until fracture, death, reoperation, or end of the study (July 1, 1996). Information was abstracted from the manufacturing records of large 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo- <b>concave</b> mitral <b>valves</b> (n = 655) in Dutch recipients and included items that described the manufacturing process and items for which an association with strut fracture had been suggested. Manufacturing records were available for 637 valves (97 %), including 25 fractured valves. Results: Multivariate analysis identified age at implantation (hazard ratio 0. 95, 95 % confidence interval 0. 93 - 0. 97), lot size (< 175 valves versus ≥ 175 valves; hazard ratio 6. 6, 95 % confidence interval 2. 2 - 20. 1), number of hook deflection tests performed (0 or 1 versus ≥ 2; hazard ratio 4. 7, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4 - 16. 2), number of disks that were used (1 versus ≥ 2; hazard ratio 5. 9, 95 % confidence interval 1. 9 - 18. 5), and lot fracture percentage (hazard ratio 1. 6, 95 % confidence interval 1. 4 - 1. 8) as independent {{predictors of}} fracture. Although the added predictive value of a model with these 5 variables was sizable compared with a model containing age only, it was only slightly better than a model with age, lot size, and lot fracture percentage. Conclusion: If the serial number of a large 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo-concave mitral valve is known, manufacturing information can add significantly to the prediction of fracture. Information on lot size and lot fracture percentage should be made available to clinicians for risk assessment of prophylactic explantation. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 117 : 766 - 75...|$|R
40|$|Background—The dynamic {{changes of}} {{anterior}} mitral leaflet (AML) curvature are of primary importance for optimal left ventricular filling and emptying but are incompletely characterized. Methods and Results—Sixteen radiopaque markers were sutured to the AML in 11 sheep, and 4 -dimensional marker coordinates were acquired with biplane videofluoroscopy. A surface subdivision algorithm {{was applied to}} compute the curvature across the AML at midsystole and at maximal valve opening. Septal-lateral (SL) and commissure-commissure (CC) curvature profiles were calculated along the SL AML meridian (MSL) and CC AML meridian (MCC), respectively, with positive curvature being concave toward the left atrium. At midsystole, the MSL was concave near the mitral annulus, turned from concave to convex across the belly, and was convex along the free edge. At maximal valve opening, the MSL was flat near the annulus, turned from slightly concave to convex across the belly, and flattened toward the free edge. In contrast, the MCC was concave near both commissures and convex at the belly at midsystole but convex near both commissures and concave at the belly at maximal valve opening. Conclusions—While the SL curvature of the AML along the MSL is similar across the belly region at midsystole and early diastole, the CC curvature of the AML along the MCC flips, with the belly being convex to the left atrium at midsystole and <b>concave</b> at maximal <b>valve</b> opening. These curvature orientations suggest optimal left ventricular inflow and outflow shapes of the AML and should be preserved during catheter or surgical interventions.
