50|$|Beer can {{chicken is}} a barbecued chicken dish and method of {{indirect}} grilling, {{in which an}} open can of beer or other <b>canned</b> <b>beverage</b> is inserted into the cavity of a chicken and then used to hold the chicken vertically while it cooks on a grill or in an oven. During the cooking process the beer in the can may steam, which can add moisture in the cavity of the bird, and some believe that the beer vapor serves to add flavor to the dish. Per the chicken being in an upright position, the fat in the bird drains away and the skin is evenly cooked.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} a reliable, cost-effective, fast and simple method to quantify simultaneously both bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol B (BPB) in liquid food matrixes such as <b>canned</b> <b>beverages</b> (soft drinks and beers) and powdered infant formulae using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) with in situ derivatization coupled with heart-cutting gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For the optimization of the DLLME procedure different amounts of various extractive and dispersive solvents as well as different amounts of the derivative reagent were compared for their effects on extraction efficiency and yields. The optimised procedure consisted in the injection of a mixture containing tetrachloroethylene (extractant), acetonitrile (dispersant) and acetic anhydride (derivatizing reagent) directly into an aliquot of beverage samples or into an aqueous extract of powdered milk samples obtained after a pretreatment of the samples. Given the compatibility of the solvents used, and the low volumes involved, the procedure was easily associated with GC-MS end-point determination, which was accomplished by means of an accurate GC dual column (heart-cutting) technique. Careful optimization of heart-cutting GC-MS conditions, namely pressure of front and auxiliary inlets, have resulted in a good analytical performance. The linearity of the matrix-matched calibration curves was acceptable, with coefficients of determination (R 2) always higher than 0. 99. Average recoveries of the BPA and BPB spiked at two concentration levels into beverages and powdered infant formulae ranged from 68 % to 114 % and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was < 15 %. The limits of detection (LOD) in <b>canned</b> <b>beverages</b> were 5. 0 and 2. 0 ng L- 1 for BPA and BPB, respectively, whereas LOD in powdered infant formulae were 60. 0 and 30. 0 ng L- 1, respectively. The limits of quantification (LOQ) in <b>canned</b> <b>beverages</b> were 10. 0 and 7. 0 ng L- 1 for BPA and BPB, respectively, whereas LOQ in powdered infant formulae were 200. 0 and 100. 0 ng L- 1, respectively. BPA was detected in 21 of 30 <b>canned</b> <b>beverages</b> (ranging from 0. 03 to 4. 70 µg L- 1) and in 2 of 7 powdered infant formulae samples (0. 23 and 0. 40 µg L- 1) collected in Portugal. BPB was only detected in <b>canned</b> <b>beverages</b> being positive in 15 of 30 samples analysed (ranging from 0. 06 to 0. 17 µg L- 1). This is the first report about the presence of BPA and BPB in <b>canned</b> <b>beverages</b> and powdered infant formulae in the Portuguese market...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{described}} environmental exposure of humans to heavy metals in African populations. Little {{is known about}} the exposure to heavy metal toxins from processed or unprocessed foods consumed in Africa, and no data exists on the food concentrations of arsenic and chromium, which are potential carcinogens and systemic toxicants. This study determined the concentrations of arsenic and chromium in beverages and fruit drinks commonly sold in Nigeria. Fifty samples of commonly consumed <b>canned</b> and non-canned <b>beverages</b> (imported and locally manufactured) purchased in Nigeria were digested in nitric acid and analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). 33. 3 % of the <b>canned</b> <b>beverages</b> had arsenic levels that exceeded the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 0. 01 mg/L set by U. S. EPA while 55. 2 % of non-canned beverages had their arsenic levels exceeding the MCL. The arsenic concentrations ranged from 0. 003 to 0. 161 mg/L for the canned and 0. 002 to 0. 261 mg/l for the non-canned beverages. Whereas 68. 9 % of the non-canned beverages showed chromium levels that exceeded the US EPAÃ¢Â€Â™s MCL of 0. 10 mg/L, 76. 2 % of the <b>canned</b> <b>beverages</b> had chromium levels that were greater than the MCL. The concentration range of total chromium in the <b>canned</b> <b>beverages</b> was 0. 04 to 0. 59 mg/L and 0. 01 to 0. 55 mg/L for the non-canned beverages. The sources of arsenic and chromium in the commercially available beverages are unclear and merit further investigation. This preliminary study highlights the need to study the toxicological implications of chronic low-level exposure to heavy metals from African markets...|$|R

5000|$|In 1959, Ermal Fraze {{devised a}} can-opening method {{that would come}} to {{dominate}} the <b>canned</b> <b>beverage</b> market. His invention was the [...] "pull-tab". This eliminated {{the need for a}} separate opener tool by attaching an aluminum pull-ring lever with a rivet to a pre-scored wedge-shaped tab section of the can top. The ring was riveted {{to the center of the}} top, which created an elongated opening large enough that one hole simultaneously served to let the beverage flow out while air flowed in. In 1959, while on a family picnic, Mr. Fraze had forgotten to bring a can opener and was forced to use a car bumper to open a can of beer. Thinking there must be an easier way, he later stayed up all night until he came up with the pull tab. [...] Pull-tab cans, or the discarded tabs from them, were also called [...] "pop-tops" [...] colloquially. In Australia these were colloquially known as [...] "ring-pull". Into the 1970s, the pull-tab was widely popular, but its popularity came with a significant problem, as people would frequently discard the pull-tabs on the ground as litter, or drop them into the can and risk choking on them.These problems were both addressed by the invention of the [...] "push-tab". Used primarily on Coors Beer cans in the mid-1970s, the push-tab was a raised circular scored area used in place of the pull-tab. It needed no ring to pull up. Instead, the raised aluminum blister was pushed down into the can, with a small unscored piece that kept the tab connected after being pushed inside. Push-tabs never gained wide popularity because while they had solved the litter problem of the pull-tab, they created a safety hazard where the person's finger upon pushing the tab into the can was immediately exposed to the sharp edges of the opening. An unusual feature of the push-tab Coors Beer cans was that they had a second, smaller, push-tab at the top as an airflow vent — a convenience that was lost with the switch from can opener to pull-tab. The [...] "push-tab" [...] was introduced into Australia in the early 1980s and was locally known as [...] "pop-tops".|$|E
