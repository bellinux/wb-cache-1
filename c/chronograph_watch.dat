5000|$|White's 20-minute space walk was the mission's highlight, with McDivitt's {{photographs}} {{being published}} worldwide. These also showed White wearing an Omega 'Speedmaster' <b>chronograph</b> <b>watch</b> on his spacesuit sleeve, {{one of two}} makes which had been approved by NASA for space use following extensive tests. Omega were unaware of these tests {{or the fact that}} their product was going to be used in space, until they saw McDivitt's photos. The model worn during the spacewalk is now known as the [...] "Ed White" [...] by watch collectors.|$|E

The watch also features chamfered square and oblong hours markers (dials with [...] "waffle" [...] type cross-hatched markers are later reproductions).

50|$|Despite the {{significance}} of the calibre 28.9 wrist chronograph it was produced in relatively small numbers over the eleven-year period. Technological developments and the introduction of the larger calibre 33.3 movement, which was larger and more reliable, resulted in the demise of the calibre 28.9. Nonetheless it marked the first production wrist chronograph manufactured by Omega and {{paved the way for the}} company to become one of the most successful manufacturers of <b>chronographs</b> <b>watches</b> in the world.|$|R
5000|$|The Hanhart Chronograph was a one-button watch made by Swiss-German {{manufacturer}} Hanhart. The one-button {{version was}} a simplified design that {{first appeared in}} 1942 and was the version worn by the Luftwaffe's aces like Major Erich Hartmann. The watch is a 17-jewel mechanical movement and only 2500 units were produced. The Tutima Flieger <b>Chronograph</b> <b>watch</b> was a high quality chronograph wrist watch that was developed in 1939. However {{it was not until}} 1941 that the watch was available for sale either individually to pilots or to the German Air Ministry, and then supplied to the German Luftwaffe. The Lange und Söhne Luftwaffe Observers’ Watch was used in aircraft which required a highly reliable and easily readable timepiece. From approximately 1941, a standardised design was manufactured. These watches were very large even by today’s standard. A large navigation mechanical watch, the Laco Aviator for German Pilots was used in military Luftwaffe Pilots. The hours markers and watch hands are fluorescent. The Reichs Air Ministry recognized the need for an efficient observer watch - [...] "Beobachtungsuhr" [...] in german - to be used by the aircraft navigator, assisting crews of long range bombing missions. Observers’ Watches were also worn by the pilots who needed wrist watches that could be accurately and instantly read when both hands were used to pilot the aircraft. This design was given the Reichsluftfahrtministerium classification number FL 23883. This number appeared on all Luftwaffe watches of this design. Laco also produced a compass which would have been worn by the pilot on his other arm.|$|E

50|$|The Omega 28.9 {{chronograph}} {{paved the}} way for the introduction of the calibre 33.3 a more accurate and larger wrist chronograph, this in turn evolved into the calibre 27 CHRO and later the calibre 321 and then 861. The calibre 321 and 861 are undoubtedly Omega's most famous <b>chronograph</b> <b>watches</b> and have been incorporated into a range of wrist chronographs including being the only watch certified for EVA use by NASA and still issued to this day to their astronauts.|$|R

5000|$|On 12 April 1961, Yuri Gagarin wore a Shturmanskie (a {{transliteration}} of Штурманские {{which actually}} means [...] "navigator's") wristwatch during his historic first flight into space. The Shturmanskie was manufactured at the First Moscow Factory. Since 1964, the watches of the First Moscow Factory have {{been marked by}} the trademark [...] "Полёт", transliterated as [...] "POLJOT", which means [...] "flight" [...] in Russian and {{is a tribute to}} the many space trips its watches have accomplished. In the late 1970s, Poljot launched a new chrono movement, the 3133. With a 23 jewel movement and manual winding (43 hours), it was a modified Russian version of the Swiss Valjoux 7734 of the early 1970s. Poljot 3133 were taken into space by astronauts from Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine. On the arm of Valeriy Polyakov, a Poljot 3133 <b>chronograph</b> movement-based <b>watch</b> set a space record for the longest space flight in history.|$|R
50|$|The similar-sounding terms {{chronograph}} and chronometer {{are often}} confused, although they mean altogether different things. A <b>chronograph</b> is a <b>watch</b> with an added duration timer, often a stopwatch complication (as explained above), while a chronometer watch is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer {{is a high}} quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the COSC (Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "waterproof" [...] Clamshell filled such a {{critical}} void {{in the area}} of military, industrial, and sports related timekeeping that its popularity helped Gallet's overall sales of wrist-worn watches and hand-held timers exceed 100,000 units per year for over 15 years. Gallet also supplied privately labeled versions of its Clamshell <b>chronograph</b> to other <b>watch</b> companies, as well as retailers that included C. Bucherer of Lucerne, Türler in Zurich, Tiffany & Co. of New York, and T. Eaton of Canada. In spite of the Clamshell's effectiveness at preventing water intrusion to a submerged depth of over 100 meters, it was eventually replaced by more easily serviceable versions with full screw-on case backs and readily available generic crystals.|$|R
50|$|Launched in 2009, the Marin 1 {{features}} Speake-Marin's first in-house movement, a grade 5 titanium case, flame-blued hands, two-piece oven-fired enamel dial and {{stainless steel}} Piccadilly case. Its three concentric rings for the minutes were inspired by early pocket <b>watch</b> <b>chronographs.</b> Marin 1 Mk I was the first Speake-Marin model to feature the SM2 calibre, an in-house calibre, designed and manufactured by Speake-Marin. It took three years to develop. The SM2 Calibre {{has been described as}} a “watchmaker’s movement” The balance wheel is large (weight of balance is 0118gr inertia 25 mg.cm2) and oscillates at 21,600 vph. The plates and bridges are made in untreated German silver. All bridges, levers and the mainplate are finished by hand (circling, spotting and polished).

5000|$|Throughout its existence, Nelsonic {{produced}} pop-culture-themed wrist-watches {{for children}} and young adults. The <b>chronograph</b> digital <b>watches,</b> typically made of molded plastic, invariably featured an alarm and utilized LCD screens to display the time for their wearers. In time the company began manufacturing multi-purpose units that used the LCD screen to combine time display functions with simple video game functions. These simple video games were variations {{on the theme of}} the Calculator watch, and the patent covering the Game Watch line is in fact classified as an [...] "electronic calculator watch structure." [...] Becoming the first electronics manufacturer in the United States to produce game-watches, Nelsonic earned a large share in this specialized market and was able to earn the attention of large video game companies at events such as the Consumer Electronics Show. Having caught the popular attention and with goodwill at a high-point, Nelsonic was able to obtain licensing from several big-name video game companies such as Sega, Nintendo, Midway Games, and Mylstar Electronics. With roots in the toy market, Nelsonic was also able to obtain similar licenses to produce LCD versions of popular electronic toys like Milton Bradley's Simon as well as to produce original LCD games for non-game toy franchises like Barbie, G.I. Joe, and Power Rangers and even for film and TV franchises such as Ghostbusters. So well-known became the Nelsonic brand that it was even able to license its own original games (such as the Nelsonic version of the public-domain blackjack which was licensed to Caesars Palace).|$|R

In order to make it readable while driving, the face of the watch has been placed in a vertical position on the case's front. The first Bugatti watch was given to car enthusiast Ralph Lauren. Only one hundred fifty of the watches will be made each year, fifty of each of the three dial colors available. The watch will cost USD$200,000. In 2009, Parmigiani Fleurier and Pershing, the Italian Yacht Company announced that they will be offering the first ever line of Pershing Aquatic sport watches.
