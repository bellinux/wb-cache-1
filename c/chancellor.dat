5|$|Although a 12th-century monastic chronicler at Worcester called Leofric Edward's <b>chancellor,</b> {{this is not}} correct, as Edward had no <b>chancellor</b> at this time. Historians {{are divided}} {{on whether or not}} Edward ever had an {{official}} that could be called a <b>chancellor,</b> but they are agreed that Leofric did not hold such an office.|$|E
5|$|As Shadow <b>Chancellor,</b> Brown as Chancellor-in-waiting {{was seen}} as a good choice by {{business}} and the middle class. While he was <b>Chancellor</b> inflation sometimes exceeded the 2% target causing the Governor of the Bank of England to write several letters to the <b>Chancellor,</b> each time inflation exceeded three per cent.|$|E
5|$|During Western Han, the <b>Chancellor</b> was {{the chief}} civil official. The duties of the {{chancellery}} were divided between a Right <b>Chancellor</b> (右丞相) and Left <b>Chancellor</b> (左丞相) between 196 and 180 BC. After 180 BC, the Left Chancellor's post was merely titular and its incumbent had no real authority. The Western Han <b>Chancellor</b> oversaw state finances, logistics for military campaigns, registers for land and population, maps of the empire's territories, annual provincial reports, high-profile lawsuits, and drafted the government budget. The <b>Chancellor</b> could directly appoint officials who were ranked 600-dan or below, while he was also able to recommend nominees to the emperor for recruitment to the senior roles in central government. The <b>Chancellor</b> was {{held responsible for the}} actions of officials he recommended and appointed, yet he could also punish inadequate officials without the emperor's consent.|$|E

50|$|The Permanent Secretary to the Lord <b>Chancellor's</b> Department was {{the most}} senior civil servant in the Lord <b>Chancellor's</b> Department and {{a senior member of}} Her Majesty's Civil Service. Officially titled Her Majesty's Permanent Under-Secretary of State to the Lord <b>Chancellor's</b> Department (although the full title was rarely used) the Permanent Secretary oversaw the day-to-day running of the Department. The {{position}} ceased to exist in 2003 when the Lord <b>Chancellor's</b> Department was subsumed into the newly created Department for Constitutional Affairs, which became the Ministry of Justice in 2007. Despite existing for 118 years the position was held by only nine individuals, most notably Claud Schuster who served as Permanent Secretary for 29 years under 10 different Lord <b>Chancellors.</b>|$|R

25|$|This list {{includes}} the <b>chancellors</b> during the Zhou Dynasty of Wu Zetian, {{even though the}} propriety of considering {{it as part of}} the Tang Dynasty is disputed. The list does not include people who served as regional governors who were given the titles as honorific titles. The <b>chancellors</b> under the pretenders Li Yun and Li Yu are listed, but not the <b>chancellors</b> under the pretender Li Chenghong because, while Li Chenghong was described to have multiple <b>chancellors,</b> only two (Yu Kefeng (于可封) and Huo Huan (霍環)) was named in historical accounts, and Yu and Huo's actual titles were not given in those accounts.|$|R
5|$|Edward Wynn (1618–1669) was rector {{here from}} 1658; he later became <b>Chancellor</b> of Bangor Cathedral, and is buried at the church.

5|$|For {{much of its}} {{existence}} the Court was formally led by the Lord <b>Chancellor,</b> assisted by the judges of the common law courts. The staff of the court included {{a large number of}} clerks, led by the Master of the Rolls, who regularly heard cases on his own. In 1813 a Vice-Chancellor was appointed to deal with the Chancery's increasing backlogs, and two more were appointed in 1841. Offices of the Chancery were sold by the Lord <b>Chancellor</b> for much of its history, raising large amounts of money. Many of the clerks and other officials were sinecures who, in lieu of wages, charged increasingly exorbitant fees to process cases, {{one of the main reasons}} why the cost of bringing a case to the Chancery was so high. The 19th century saw the abolition of many sinecure offices and the institution of a wage and pension for the Lord <b>Chancellor</b> to curb the sale of offices, and later the right to appoint officials was transferred from the <b>Chancellor</b> to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|Green, however, had {{the support}} of Bernard G.

50|$|By 927, two {{holdover}} <b>chancellors</b> from Li Cunxu's reign, Doulu Ge and Wei Shuo, {{had been}} removed. There were thus talks that more <b>chancellors</b> were needed. An's close associate Kong Xun was formerly a Later Liang official {{and did not}} want to see more <b>chancellors</b> from former Jin territory, and therefore recommended fellow Later Liang official Cui Xie. Ren recommended Li Qi who, while also formerly a Later Liang official, was disliked by both Zheng and Kong. Kong told An that Li Qi was corrupt, and therefore An recommended Cui, leading to further dispute between An and Ren. Eventually, Li Siyuan decided to commission Cui and Feng Dao as <b>chancellors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>chancellors</b> {{initially}} discussed executing Li Qi's cousins. The official Jiang Ai (蔣乂) {{pointed out}} that Li Qi's cousins were all Li Shentong's descendants and should not suffer this kind of fate. When the <b>chancellors</b> discussed alternatively that Li Qi's brothers be executed, Jiang further pointed out how Li Guozhen had died in imperial service, and that his descendants {{should be allowed to}} survive. The <b>chancellors</b> agreed and only exiled Li Qi's cousins.|$|R
5|$|In 1847, Albert {{was elected}} <b>Chancellor</b> of the University of Cambridge after a close contest with the Earl of Powis.

5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, was close to retirement. The current Lord <b>Chancellor</b> Lord Haldane {{believed}} that the duties of a Lord <b>Chancellor</b> were too much for one man, and should be divided between a Lord <b>Chancellor</b> and a Minister of Justice. As such he looked for a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord <b>Chancellor</b> {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, the Madras University Act {{was passed}} after its {{introduction}} by Education Minister A. P. Patro.

5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire, {{the young}} Matilda's court {{included}} knights, chaplains and ladies-in-waiting, although, unlike some queens of the period, {{she did not}} have her own personal <b>chancellor</b> to run her household, instead using the imperial <b>chancellor.</b> When acting as regent in Italy, she found the local rulers were prepared to accept a female ruler. Her Italian administration included the Italian <b>chancellor,</b> backed by experienced administrators.
