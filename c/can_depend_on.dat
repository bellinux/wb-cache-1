5|$|Shaktas {{approach}} the Devi in many forms; however, {{they are all}} considered to be but diverse aspects of the one supreme goddess. The primary Devi form worshiped by a Shakta devotee is his or her ishta-devi, that is a personally selected Devi. The selection of this deity <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> many factors, such as family tradition, regional practice, guru lineage and personal resonance.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation occurs {{through the}} gradual {{modification}} of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation {{may have different}} functions in related organisms. This {{is the result of}} a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor. However, since all living organisms are related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.|$|E
5|$|Late LTP is {{induced by}} changes in gene {{expression}} and protein synthesis {{brought about by the}} persistent activation of protein kinases activated during E-LTP, such as MAPK. In fact, MAPK—specifically the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of MAPKs—may be the molecular link between E-LTP and L-LTP, since many signaling cascades involved in E-LTP, including CaMKII and PKC, can converge on ERK. Recent research has shown that the induction of L-LTP <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> coincident molecular events, namely PKA activation and calcium influx, that converge on CRTC1 (TORC1), a potent transcriptional coactivator for cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). This requirement for a molecular coincidence accounts perfectly for the associative nature of LTP, and, presumably, for that of learning.|$|E
30|$|Just {{like the}} {{distinction}} between actors and users, the identification of specific registers of argumentation {{is based on the}} hypothesis that some categories of actors <b>can,</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> the conflictual situation, use specific arguments.

25|$|For a {{wide variety}} of {{materials}} and conditions, V and I are directly proportional to each other, and therefore R and G are constant (although they <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> other factors like temperature or strain). This proportionality is called Ohm's law, and materials that satisfy it are called ohmic materials.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{permittivity}} {{is not a}} constant, as it {{can vary}} with the position in the medium, {{the frequency of the}} field applied, humidity, temperature, and other parameters. In a nonlinear medium, the permittivity <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the strength of the electric field. Permittivity as a function of frequency can take on real or complex values.|$|E
25|$|Remarkably modern even {{to readers}} today, Montaigne's attempt {{to examine the}} world through the lens of the only thing he <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> implicitly—his own judgment—makes him more {{accessible}} to modern readers than any other author of the Renaissance. Much of modern literary non-fiction has found inspiration in Montaigne and writers of all kinds continue to read him for his masterful balance of intellectual knowledge and personal storytelling.|$|E
25|$|Pronouns {{are also}} marked as prefixes on {{transitive}} and intransitive verbs, with different prefixes for different transitive pronoun combination. For instance, a first-person singular subject and a third-person singular object would be {{marked by the}} prefix ŋa-, but a third-person singular subject and a first-person singular object would cause the marking ŋara-. Furthermore, the form of these prefixes <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the environment, as a few prefixes have different forms depending on whether they precede a vowel, a nasal, or a non-nasal consonant.|$|E

25|$|The general {{incubation}} period {{is found to}} be five days, but it can occasionally be as long as seven days due to cannibalism, scavenging or replacement. The larval period <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).|$|E
25|$|Two-ring PAHs, and to {{a lesser}} extent three-ring PAHs, {{dissolve}} in water, making them more available for biological uptake and degradation. Further, two- to four-ring PAHs volatilize sufficiently to appear in the atmosphere predominantly in gaseous form, although the physical state of four-ring PAHs <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> temperature. In contrast, compounds with five or more rings have low solubility in water and low volatility; they are therefore predominantly in solid state, bound to particulate air pollution, soils, or sediments. In solid state, these compounds are less accessible for biological uptake or degradation, increasing their persistence in the environment.|$|E
25|$|A flow {{that is not}} a {{function}} of time is called steady flow. Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time. Time dependent flow is known as unsteady (also called transient). Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady, <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a sphere is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is unsteady.|$|E

50|$|While a {{sequential}} {{manual transmission}} <b>can</b> (<b>depending</b> <b>on</b> the model) offer faster shift speeds and thus faster race times, many road-car-driving enthusiasts prefer a standard manual transmission, which—with a clutch pedal {{and the ability}} to skip gears—allows more driver input and a more traditional driving experience.|$|R
25|$|The {{selection}} of which pitch to use <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> {{a wide variety}} of situations such as; the type of hitter that is being faced, whether there are any base runners, how many outs {{have been made in the}} inning, or the current score, among others. The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch was traditionally made by the catcher. However, current form is to have the manager or a coach relay the pitch selection to the catcher, via secret hand signals to prevent the opposing team from having the advantage of knowing what the next pitch will be.|$|E
25|$|By 1980, a {{restoration}} programme {{was put in}} place that has now been running for over 20 years. This programme has aimed to reconnect the marshes by returning tidal flow along with the ecological functions and characteristics of the marshes back to their original state. In the case of Barn Island, declines in the invasive species have initiated, re-establishing the tidal-marsh vegetation along with animal species such as fish and insects. This example highlights that considerable time and effort is needed to effectively restore salt marsh systems. Times in marsh recovery <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the development stage of the marsh; type and extent of the disturbance; geographical location; and the environmental and physiological stress factors to the marsh-associated flora and fauna.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{traditional}} Chinese characters versus simplified Chinese characters varies greatly, and <b>can</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> both the local customs and the medium. Before the official reform, character simplifications were not officially sanctioned and generally adopted vulgar variants and idiosyncratic substitutions. Orthodox variants were mandatory in printed works, while the (unofficial) simplified characters {{would be used}} in everyday writing or quick notes. Since the 1950s, and especially {{with the publication of}} the 1964 list, the People's Republic of China has officially adopted simplified Chinese characters for use in mainland China, while Hong Kong, Macau, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) were not affected by the reform. There is no absolute rule for using either system, and often it is determined by what the target audience understands, as well as the upbringing of the writer.|$|E
