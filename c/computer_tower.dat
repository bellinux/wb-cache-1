50|$|Originally, the Rivers of America {{required}} draining every 5 {{years in}} order to clean up sunken debris, scrub algae forests away, and maintain upkeep of the Mark Twain and Columbia Sailing ship guidance track. In January 2010 when the river was drained after 7 years of continual operation, items found in the river were numbered in hundreds of cellphones, pagers, walk-e talkies, a <b>computer</b> <b>tower,</b> a prosthetic leg and half of a Davy Crockett Explorer canoe. To prevent the Jungle Cruise and other waters from draining as well, the underground tubes were plugged with air bladders. Any fish and wildlife found in the river were placed (alive) back into the remaining waters of the park. Any Koi fish found, were donated along with the Koi once kept at the Disneyland Hotel, to the Huntington Library. When the Rivers of America were refilled, the wildlife migrated back into the river. With its most recent refurbishment {{and the addition of}} a specialized pumping and cleaning system that would not disrupt the aquatic life, the Rivers of America would not need to be drained for another 20 years.|$|E

Commercially available optical profilometers and inspection systems are relatively large, {{about the size of}} a desktop <b>computer</b> <b>tower,</b> and require a stable platform to inspect the test object. Also, many devices currently available are designed for a laboratory or controlled environments requiring external computer control. This paper presents an approach using a highly developed optical interferometer to inspect the windows from inside the space station itself using a self- contained hand held device. The interferometer would be capable as a minimum of detecting damage as small as one ten thousands of an inch in diameter and depth while interrogating a relatively large area. The current developmental state of this device is still in the proof of concept stage. The background section of this paper will discuss the current state of the art of profilometers as well as the desired configuration of the self-contained, hand held device. Then, a discussion of the developments and findings that will allow the configuration change with suggested approaches appearing in the proof of concept section...|$|E

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of bass amps in the 2010s can be powered solely by AC mains power, obtained by plugging the amp into a wall socket. Inexpensive practice amps may have the AC mains plug hardwired into the unit. Middle-priced to high-priced amplifiers typically have a removable cable and plug, as used with PC <b>computer</b> <b>towers.</b> The benefits of having a removable cable and plug {{is that if the}} cable becomes worn or damaged, a new cable can easily be replaced by a layperson. If a hardwired AC mains cable and plug becomes worn or damaged, a qualified technician or electrician will typically be required to replace the cable and plug. Most amps are designed to work for a single voltage. A small number of expensive bass amps designed for touring professionals have user-selectable voltage, which enables a bassist to play with same amp in North America and Europe. A small number of small combo amps can run on both AC mains power and battery power. This enables bassists to play outside where there is no access to power (e.g., for busking on the street). Amps that are battery powered may have a 12 volt input, enabling the unit to be connected to a car battery with alligator clips.|$|R

40|$|The {{figure of}} the pirate and acts of piracy {{themselves}} are most frequently defined by their opposition and exception to the legal framework of copyright law. However, the term 'pirate', used to describe {{those who have been}} seen breaching the such legal framework, does not just evoke images of rows of <b>computer</b> <b>towers</b> in a back room, adjacent to a pile of blank discs ready for commercial reproduction and distribution, or the ubiquitous footage of the youthful and impressionable 'movie downloader' found on the beginning of DVDs. It also carries a deeper cultural resonance, reminding us of bands of renegades, hijacking European ships returning from colonial outposts, or in the contemporary era, of the two most evocative pirate imaginaries which exist co-currently: The machine-gun wielding Somalian pirate [...] -a martyr-rebel and a refugee of globalization [...] -or more humorously, Johnny Depp's, Keith Richards inspired, Captain Jack Sparrow, the debonair star of the successful Walt Disney franchise Pirates of the Caribbean. While Captain Sparrow originally appears as a scheming pirate, in subsequent films he slowly reveals an ethical side, which belies his rough exterior. This character’s development becomes even more interesting, considering the franchise owner Walt Disney has exhibited a fierce determination to protect their intellectual property rights from pirates (and also the entirely legal public domain) over the years. The Walt Disney Company seems to refuse the possibility of a piracy, which good-hearted unless that piracy involves Jack Sparrow or another such fictional pirate, and so can contribute to their extensive intellectual property holdings and profits. However, this writer is much more hopeful, and the following chapter will reveal how 'the pirate' has been structured discursively and materially by intellectual property law itself, as well as the interested parties surrounding this discussion, and will go some way to explaining how piracy manages to operate productively through and beyond these constraints...|$|R
