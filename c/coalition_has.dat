In 2008, the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113, of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue <b>coalition</b> <b>has</b> been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue has been seen as giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.|$|E

25|$|Although the Coalition {{fared better}} in polls of voting intention, the Liberals and Nationals {{consistently}} trailed Labor. According to Newspoll, the <b>Coalition</b> <b>has</b> not led the ALP since early 2006. Pollster Roy Morgan says that Labor has consistently led the Coalition since Iemma became premier. The most recent Roy Morgan figure showed Labor well ahead, 60.5% to 39.5%, on a two-party-preferred basis.|$|E
25|$|Parts {{designed}} specifically for R-410A must be used as R-410A operates at higher pressures than other refrigerants. Thus R-410A systems require service personnel to use different tools, equipment, safety standards and techniques. Equipment manufacturers are aware of these changes and require the certification of professionals installing R-410A systems. In addition the AC Safety <b>Coalition</b> <b>has</b> been created to help educate professionals about R-410-A system.|$|E

25|$|The Conservative Democratic {{movement}} {{received a}} recent, but short, rebirth in party structure. During the 2006 midterm elections, the Democratic Party ran moderates {{and even a}} few conservative Democrats for at-risk Republican seats. The Blue Dog Democrats gained nine seats during the election. The New Democrats had support from 27 of the 40 Democratic candidates running for at-risk Republican seats. In 2010, the Blue Dog Coalition lost more than half its members. As of 2015, the Blue Dog <b>Coalition</b> <b>has</b> 14 members.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1930s, a {{critical}} component of the Democratic Party <b>coalition</b> <b>has</b> been organized labor. Labor unions supply {{a great deal of the}} money, grass roots political organization, and voting base of support for the party. Democrats are far more likely to be represented by unions, although union membership has declined, in general, during the last few decades. This trend is depicted in the following graph from the book, Democrats and Republicans—Rhetoric and Reality. It is based on surveys conducted by the National Election Studies (NES).|$|E
25|$|Malaysia's {{predominant}} political party, the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), {{has held}} {{power in the}} coalition known as the Barisan Nasional (formerly the Alliance) with other parties since Malaya's independence in 1957. In 1973, an alliance of communally based parties was replaced with a broader coalition– the Barisan Nasional— composed of fourteen parties. Today the Barisan Nasional <b>coalition</b> <b>has</b> three prominent members– the UMNO, MCA (Malaysian Chinese Association) and MIC (Malaysian Indian Congress). The Prime Minister of Malaysia has always been from the UMNO.|$|E

25|$|The {{conservative}} <b>Coalition</b> <b>has</b> mixed {{views on}} LGBT rights, but its senior partner the Liberal Party of Australia has fielded {{an increasing number}} of LGBTI candidates in federal elections, including the first openly gay man elected to the House of Representatives, Trent Zimmerman. After the 2016 Australian federal election he was joined by fellow gay Liberals Tim Wilson and Trevor Evans, with gay Senator Dean Smith representing Western Australia for the Liberals in the Senate. Each differs in their level of activism on LGBT issues, considering themselves members of the Liberal Party first and foremost.|$|E

Subsequently, a number of prominent party members all across defected from the party and stated that they intend to form a list in the forthcoming parliamentary election with Tadić as its leader. So far, <b>coalition</b> <b>has</b> been agreed with the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina.

25|$|Coalition of Secular and Democratic Syrians: {{nucleus of}} a Syrian secular and {{democratic}} opposition that {{appeared during the}} Syrian civil war. It came about through the union of a dozen Muslim and Christian, Arab and Kurd parties, who called the minorities of Syria to support {{the fight against the}} government of Bashar al-Assad. The <b>Coalition</b> <b>has</b> also called for military intervention in Syria, under the form of a no-fly zone similar to that of Kosovo, with a safe zone and cities.

25|$|One of Malaysia's states, Kelantan, {{is governed}} by PAS which is a {{conservative}} Islamic political party, with a proclaimed goal of establishing an Islamic state. Terengganu was briefly ruled by PAS from 1999 to 2004, but the ruling Barisan Nasional <b>coalition</b> <b>has</b> since won back the state. To counter the falling credibility of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO)'s Islamic credentials vis-à-vis PAS, {{the head of the}} Barisan Nasional, Datuk Seri Abdullah Badawi, proposed Islam Hadhari. In the 1990s, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS)-led state governments passed Islamic hudud laws in Terengganu, but was struck down by the secular federal government.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{between the}} Greens and the Liberal-National Coalition are {{generally}} {{poor and the}} Greens usually direct voters to preference the Labor Party ahead of the Liberals or Nationals in Australian elections. The <b>Coalition</b> <b>has</b> however directed strategic preferences to the Greens over Labor in the past, as in the Division of Melbourne, where Adam Bandt was elected at the 2010 Australian Federal Election with Liberal Preferences. In addition, the Tasmanian Liberal Party under Tony Rundle managed to form a minority government through an informal alliance with the Tasmanian Greens between 1996 and 1998, enacting some progressive reforms in favour of forest conservation and LGBT rights during its term. At the 2010 Victorian State Election, the Liberals put their preference for the Greens below the Labor Party.|$|E
25|$|Solidarity to the Palestinians was {{expressed}} through the Lebanese Sunni Muslims {{but with the}} aim to change the political system from one of consensus amongst different sects, towards one where their power share would increase. Certain groups in the Lebanese National Movement wished {{to bring about a}} more secular and democratic order, but as this group increasingly included Islamist groups, encouraged to join by the PLO, the more progressive demands of the initial agenda was dropped by January 1976. Islamists did not support a secular order in Lebanon and wished to bring about rule by Muslim clerics. Yezid Sayigh documents these events, especially the role of Fatah and the Tripoli Islamist movement known as Tawhid, in changing the agenda being pursued by many groups, including Communists. This ragtag <b>coalition</b> <b>has</b> often been referred to as left-wing, but many participants were actually very conservative religious elements that did not share any broader ideological agenda; rather, they were brought together by the short-term goal of overthrowing the established political order, each motivated by their own grievances.|$|E

The restriction cooperated and angled votes in favor of each other to reinforce their energy. Furthermore, PKR has exited from the shadow of Anwar while Anwar demonstrated his charm that effectively transformed the gathering into an ordinary political gathering and another constrain. Malaysia would have another face after the political tidal wave. The energy of BN <b>coalition</b> <b>has</b> declined {{and it needs to}} depend on Sabah, Sarawak and Southern Malaysia to keep up its decision control. There will be real authority changes in UMNO, MCA, MIC and Gerakan. What's more, the belief systems of BN coalition's segment parties must be balanced. Relinquishing racial segment would be an exit plan. With respect to the resistance, they won't not have the capacity to deal with to sudden triumph in the decisions, particularly for DAP and Keadilan who won control of states and extended their impacts in the Parliament ought to.|$|E

The <b>coalition</b> <b>has</b> asserted that [...] "it would be far preferable to join with other countries to penetrate a smaller and more isolated lake before re-examining whether penetration of Lake Vostok is environmentally defensible. If we are wise, the Lake {{will be allowed to}} reveal its secrets in due course." ...|$|E
500|$|Adult {{males are}} {{typically}} gregarious despite their territoriality, and may group together {{for life and}} form [...] "coalitions". These groups collectively defend their territories. In most cases, a coalition will comprise brothers born in the same litter who stayed together after weaning. However, if a cub is the only male in the litter, then two or three lone males may form a small group, or a lone male may join an existing group. Males in coalitions establish territories that ensure maximum access to females. Solitary males {{may or may not}} be territorial. Some males alternate between solitude and coalitions, whichever ensures encounters with a greater number of females. Although a coalition, due to its larger membership, demands a greater amount of resources than do the solitary males or their groups, the <b>coalition</b> <b>has</b> a greater chance of encountering and acquiring females for mating.|$|E
