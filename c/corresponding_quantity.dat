50|$|Sterilized {{intervention}} {{is a policy}} that attempts to influence the exchange rate without changing the monetary base. The procedure {{is a combination of}} two transactions. First, the central bank conducts a nonsterilized intervention by buying (selling) foreign currency bonds using domestic currency that it issues. Then the central bank “sterilizes” the effects on the monetary base by selling (buying) a <b>corresponding</b> <b>quantity</b> of domestic-currency-denominated bonds to soak up the initial increase (decrease) of the domestic currency. The net effect of the two operations is the same as a swap of domestic-currency bonds for foreign-currency bonds with no change in the money supply.

Lenin claims that socialism will not be perfect since, as Marx said, it has emerged from the womb of capitalism and which is in every respect stamped with the birthmarks of the old society. This society, socialism, will be unable to provide people with total equality, precisely because it is still marked by capitalism. He also explains the difference between the old society and the new as: [...] The means of production are no longer the private property of individuals. The means of production belong to the whole of society. Every member of society, performing a certain part of the socially-necessary work, receives a certificate from society to the effect that he has done a certain amount of work. And with this certificate he receives from the public store of consumer goods a <b>corresponding</b> <b>quantity</b> of products. After a deduction is made of the amount of labor which goes to the public fund, every worker, therefore, receives from society as much as he has given to it.|$|E

40|$|The {{spreading}} of {{the quantum}} probability density for the highlyexcited states of a single-particle system with an exponential-type potential {{on the positive}} semiaxis is quantitatively determined in both position and momentum spaces {{by means of the}} Boltzmann-Shannon information entropy. This problem boils down to the calculation of the asymptotics of the entropy-like integrals of the modified Bessel function of the second kind (also called Mcdonald function or Basset function). The dependence of the two physical entropies on the large quantum number n is given in detail. It is shown that the semiclassical (WKB) position-space entropy grows slower than the <b>corresponding</b> <b>quantity</b> of not only the harmonic oscillator but also the single-particle systems with any power-type potential of the form V (x) = x and k N.
