25|$|In 1837 Vives {{purchased}} a corn mill, a coffee depulper, a cotton gin, and a rice husking machine, all animal-powered, to process its agricultural goods.

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{argument of}} this thesis is that, contemporary international criminal <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> have, to varying degrees, exerted significant impacts on judicial, legislative, and executive, thoughts, processes, and actions within conflict, post-conflict and non-conflict {{states in the}} Commonwealth. This thesis analyzes evidence of these impacts by examining states in the Commonwealth, where contemporary international criminal <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> have operational and jurisdictional relevance. It does this by categorizing such states into four groups of states, conflict, post-conflict, non-conflict states and states where contemporary international criminal <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> have made marginal impacts. The thesis evaluates the impacts of contemporary international criminal <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> in these states by analyzing evidence, garnered from a study of judicial, legislative and executive actions and processes influenced directly or indirectly by contemporary international criminal <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> with operational and jurisdictional relevance in the Commonwealth. The thesis also undertakes {{an assessment of the}} overall impact of contemporary international criminal <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> in the Commonwealth on judicial, legislative and executive thoughts, actions and processes. In assessing the impact, the thesis is framed by two overarching arguments which {{set the tone for the}} discussions and analysis undertaken here. The first is that, certain factors such as engagement by the different <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> with states, the role of states actors and institutions; have helped contemporary international criminal <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> exert marginal to major influences on judicial, legislative and executive thoughts, processes and actions within the Commonwealth. The second overarching argument made in the thesis in assessing the impact of these contemporary international criminal <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> is that, certain factors such as the poor visibility of international criminal <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> within Commonwealth States, conflicting visions of justice that these <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> ought to dispense by relevant stakeholders and the non-transposition of the norms of international criminal law and international humanitarian law within Commonwealth States; have inhibited the impact of these <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> on judicial, legislative and executive thoughts, processes and actions within the Commonwealth. It concludes by noting that international criminal <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> have had different levels of impacts on states across the Commonwealth due to the coalescence of the foregoing factors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{international}} <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals,</b> {{although they have}} not always been successful in that endeavor, are very instrumental in developing meaningful law-ascertainment criteria necessary to distinguish law from non-law. Indeed, if one espouses a Hartian conception of international law, international <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals,</b> in their capacity as law-applying bodies, generate the social practice necessary to give a meaning to the rule of recognition of the international legal system. Yet, this paper simultaneously shows that this role of the international <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> is not exclusive in that international <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunal</b> cannot be deemed to have a monopoly on the elaboration of law-ascertainment vocabulary. Nowadays, a new string of actors also participate in the emergence of the necessary semantics to distinguish law from non-law. International court and tribunals’ contribution to the clarification of the rules of recognition of the international legal system is supplemented by the social practice of other international actors. It is submitted, however, that this role of international <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals,</b> although being not exclusive, should be preserved and remain central. This nonetheless requires a greater awareness by international <b>courts</b> and <b>tribunals</b> of the necessity of a consistent use of those formal indicators allowing the distinction between law and non-law...|$|R
