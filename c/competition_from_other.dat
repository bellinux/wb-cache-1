In 1933 the CLR was taken into public ownership along with the UERL.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{proposed}} for a launch in 2020, the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) was a joint NASA/ESA proposal for exploration of Jupiter's moons. In February 2009 {{it was announced}} that ESA/NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. ESA's contribution still faced funding <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> ESA projects. EJSM consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Jupiter Europa Orbiter led by NASA and the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter {{led by the}} ESA were {{proposed}} together as an Outer Planet Flagship Mission to Jupiter's icy moons called Europa Jupiter System Mission, with a planned launch in 2020. In 2009 it was given priority over Titan Saturn System Mission. At that time, there was <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> proposals. Japan proposed Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter.|$|E
5|$|McCarty {{played a}} limited role in 2012, both due to {{injuries}} and <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> backs, including Cory Boyd, Hugh Charles, and Jerome Messam. McCarty missed six games {{due to a}} high ankle sprain suffered during the Labour Day Rematch. Playing in the other 12 games but starting in none, McCarty rushed only 12 times and made five receptions with a lone rushing touchdown. He added four special-teams tackles.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{development}} of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four swivelling nozzles, in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of plenum chamber burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation's Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason of}} setting up this {{position}} {{is due to the}} vast <b>competitions</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> news programmes in CCTV. Focus(焦點訪談) provides detailed and universal description for different news events while 'Oriental Horizon'(東方時空) is good at rousing audiences' emotion during news reporting. Besides, the broadcasting time of News Probe is beyond all these news programs. Therefore, what News Probe can do is to provide innovative reporting methods so as to raise audiences' interests. As a result, an investigative reporting style was developed.|$|R
5000|$|More importantly, {{producers}} {{were constantly}} adjusting their commercial behaviour {{to the emerging}} economic reality (the [...] "state of the market"), {{as far as they}} could. And that adjustment followed a specific pattern; Marx argued it created a specific trajectory for capitalist development, guided by the quest for realizing extra surplus value. There is, he argues, a permanent imperative to increase productivity, and producers aim to utilize every possibility for gaining competitive advantage (which includes blocking <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>others</b> in some way).|$|R
5|$|Despite <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> {{shopping}} centres such as Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre, Oxford Street {{remains in}} high demand as a retail location, with several chains hosting their flagship stores on the street, and {{has a number of}} listed buildings. The annual switching on of Christmas lights by a celebrity has been a popular event since 1959. However, the combination of a very popular retail area and a main thoroughfare for London buses and taxis has caused significant problems with traffic congestion, safety and pollution. Various traffic management schemes have been proposed by Transport for London, including a ban on private vehicles during daytime hours on weekdays and Saturdays, and improved pedestrian crossings.|$|E
5|$|Food {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The {{proportions}} of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae {{are important in}} Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the Dutch brick {{industry}} has attracted unwelcome attention from the European Union (EU) competition authorities. In the early 1990s the industry had excess capacity due to technological advances, <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> materials and an economic slowdown. Producers with combined market share of 90% agreed to reduce capacity, shutting down the older and inefficient plants. The producers compensated those who closed plants. However, the agreement also included fixing production quotas and fining members who produced more than their quota. The members of what was in effect a cartel were forced to drop the quota agreement by the EU.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow the times of {{year in which the}} distributors concentrate films they expect to be the biggest critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|E
5|$|The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) was a joint NASA/ESA {{proposal}} for exploration of Jupiter and its moons.

The proposal included a launch date of around 2020 and consists of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter. ESA's contribution had encountered funding <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> ESA projects. However, the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), NASA's contribution, was considered by the Planetary Decadal Survey to be too expensive. The survey supported a cheaper alternative to JEO.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Douglas {{argues that}} Jardine liked {{to make his}} runs when his side was in {{difficulty}} and enjoyed being tested; his approach would often lead his team to recovery from an unfavourable situation. Douglas comments that Jardine held {{his place in the}} England side despite strong <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> batsmen. His defensive technique rescued England from weak positions in around a dozen innings and only played in two losses with England (which were his two least successful games with the bat). He also excelled in the main Gentlemen v Players fixture at Lord's, making a good score in each of his appearances in this match. Jack Hobbs classed him as a great batsman and believed that he was under-rated by his contemporaries.|$|E

Hart's psychic assault awakens Tanner's own latent psychic powers, and Tanner kills Hart instead. Tanner realizes {{that he was the}} superhuman uncovered by Hallson's tests, and that Hart was trying to eliminate any <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>others</b> like himself.|$|R
5000|$|Subanon (also spelled Subanen or Subanun) is a tribe {{indigenous}} to the Zamboanga peninsula area, particularly {{living in the}} mountainous areas of Zamboanga del Sur and Misamis Occidental, Mindanao Island, Philippines. The Subanon people speak the Subanon language. The name means [...] "a person or people of the river." [...] These people originally lived in the lowlying areas. However due to disturbances and <b>competitions</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> settlers like the Muslims, and migrations of Cebuano speakers to the coastal areas attracted by the inviting Land Tenure Laws, further pushed the Subanen into the interior.|$|R

5|$|Despite <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> materials, copper {{remains the}} {{preferred}} electrical conductor {{in nearly all}} categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{grows in}} open, non-forested habitat with wet, often calcium-rich soils. These include bogs, marl fens, quaking bogs, cobble shores, and other {{calcareous}} habitats. This tolerance of calcium is relatively {{rare in the}} rest of the genus. D. anglica is often associated with various sphagnum mosses, and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living, dead, or decomposed sphagnum. The sphagnum wicks moisture to the surface while simultaneously acidifying it. What soil nutrients are not seeped away by the constant moisture are often used up by the sphagnum or made unavailable by the low soil pH. Since nutrient availability is low, <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> plants is diminished, allowing the carnivorous English sundew to flourish.|$|E
5|$|Fantasia 2000, {{a sequel}} to the 1940 film {{that had been a}} pet-project of Roy E. Disney's since 1990, was {{released}} on January 1, 2000. Produced in pieces when artists were available between productions, Fantasia 2000 was the first animated feature produced for and released in IMAX format. A standard theatrical release followed in June, but the film's $90 million worldwide box office total against its $90 million production cost resulted in it losing $100 million for the studio. Peter Schneider left his post as president of Walt Disney Feature Animation in 1999 to become president of The Walt Disney Studios under Joe Roth. Thomas Schumacher, who had been Schneider's vice president of animation for several years, became the new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation. By this time, <b>competition</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> studios had driven animators' incomes to all-time highs, making traditionally animated features even more costly to produce. Schumacher was tasked with cutting costs, and massive layoffs began to cut salaries and bring the studio's staff– which peaked at 2,200 people in 1999– down to approximately 1,200 employees.|$|E
