5|$|In court Denning {{preferred}} to let counsel talk on {{for as long}} as they wanted to so that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> grasp of the situation without wading through irrelevant court papers; to prevent them going on too long he sat quietly and allowed them to wind down at their own pace.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the game's {{mechanisms}} for contacting players grew more complex. Players were sent messages via email, called on their cell phones, and travelled to arranged meetings between players and characters. The game culminated by inviting {{players of the}} game to visit one of four cinemas where they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to play Halo 2 before its release and collect a commemorative DVD.|$|E
5|$|The leading exponents of 1.d4 {{started to}} look for {{reliable}} antidotes. Alexander Alekhine showed how White <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> strong attack with 4.e4 in his games against Ilya Rabinovich (Baden-Baden 1925) and Adolf Seitz (Hastings 1925–26). But {{a few weeks later}} a theme tournament on the Budapest Gambit was held, in Budapest, and the result was 14½–21½ in Black's favor. Another tournament in Semmering the same year saw Alekhine losing to Karl Gilg in his pet line with White against the gambit, so that the e4-line had a mixed reputation. Meanwhile, more positional plans were also developed for White. Rubinstein showed how White <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> small positional advantage with 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2, an assessment still valid today. The possibility 6.Nc3 was also considered attractive, as structural weaknesses were not valued as much as a material advantage of one pawn in those days. By the end of the 1920s, despite the invention of the highly original Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 in 1928, the Budapest Gambit was considered theoretically dubious.|$|E

5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E
5|$|Bryant and Milam {{were indicted}} for murder. The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not {{confident}} that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> conviction {{in a case of}} white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E

25|$|Two {{weeks before}} the war started, Yasser Arafat visited the castle, sat down with its {{defenders}} and assured them that in thirty-six hours of fighting, the PLO <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> ceasefire.

25|$|In 1964, Davis was {{starring}} in Golden Boy {{at night and}} shooting his own New York-based afternoon talk show during the day. When he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> day off from the theater, he recorded songs in the studio, performed at charity events in Chicago, Miami, or Las Vegas, or appeared on television variety specials in Los Angeles. Davis felt he was cheating his family of his company, {{but he said he}} was incapable of standing still.|$|E
25|$|WCW {{claimed that}} {{attempts}} were made to save the storyline though Warrior has claimed in interviews and convention appearances that the only reason he was brought back was so Hogan <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> win over Warrior in return for Hogan's WrestleMania job. Warrior's last appearance in WCW was on the November 9, 1998 episode of Monday Nitro, {{when he came to the}} rescue of The Disciple who was being attacked by members of The nWo. Warrior retired from wrestling that year.|$|E
25|$|In September 1941, {{he asked}} John Ryle, {{the brother of}} the philosopher Gilbert Ryle, if he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> manual job at Guy's Hospital in London. John Ryle was {{professor}} of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for the Blitz. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, meaning that he delivered drugs from the pharmacy to the wards—where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.|$|E
50|$|Because of the mestnichestvo, {{otherwise}} qualified {{people who}} could not boast of sufficiently extended ancestry had no hope of <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> important state post.

25|$|The {{traditional}} constraints {{gave way}} to more liberal conditions for women. Patriarchy faded as an ideal; young people had more freedom to choose their spouses and more often used birth control to regulate {{the size of their}} families. Society emphasized the role of mothers in child rearing, especially the patriotic goal of raising republican children rather than those locked into aristocratic value systems. There was more permissiveness in child-rearing. Patriot women married to Loyalists who left the state <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> divorce and obtain control of the ex-husband's property.|$|E
25|$|City {{municipalities}} of Novi Sad were formally established in 2002, {{for the sole}} reason that Novi Sad <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> city status. In 2007, after the update {{of the law of}} local government, the requirement for multiple municipalities for city status was lifted (and 20 additional cities were proclaimed). However, the renewed 2008 city statute also foresaw formation of two separate municipalities, but as of 2009 none of them de facto exist, and the whole city is run solely by the city administration. Petrovaradin municipality does not yet have its own offices, and the town is administered only by local community office.|$|E
25|$|The American Dream is {{the belief}} that through hard work and determination, any United States {{immigrant}} can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice. According to historians, the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that anybody <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work hard. This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.|$|E

25|$|On June 7, 2012, 16-year-old Yasser Lopez made {{national}} news when he successfully underwent a delicate 3-hour neurosurgical operation {{to remove a}} spear that a speargun had fired into his skull when it was accidentally discharged during a fishing trip; 3 feet of the spear protruded from the wound above his eye socket, and that part had to be specially cut off so he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> brain CT scan. Miraculously, no major blood vessels were harmed and the only impairments thus far are amnesia for the period during and around the event, which is somewhat normal, and some sluggishness in a hand.|$|E
25|$|During the {{economic}} panic of 1893, Straus used his milk stations to sell coal {{at the very}} low price of 5 cents for 25 pounds to those who could pay. Those who could not received coal free. He also opened lodging houses for 64,000 people, who <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> bed and breakfast for 5 cents, and he funded 50,000 meals for one cent each. He also gave away thousands of turkeys anonymously. At Abraham & Straus he noticed that two of his employees were starving themselves to save their wages to feed their families, so he established {{what may have been}} the first subsidized company cafeteria.|$|E
25|$|During this time, {{while still}} in Sacramento, the {{gigantic}} engine {{was used as an}} advertising tool by the railroad, to spectacular effect. According to author Guy L. Dunscomb, the engine was kept under steam near the Central Pacific's passenger depot, where it would await the arrival of passenger trains coming in from the east. As the train arrived, El Gobernador would steam past the depot dragging a long line of empty freight cars behind it and causing quite a stir in the process. The engine would then be uncoupled and placed on adjacent trackage, where the passengers <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good look at the monster up close.|$|E
