40|$|Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy {{is a rare}} inherited heart-muscle {{disease that}} is a cause of sudden death in young people and athletes. Causative mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins have been identified and the disease is nowadays regarded as a genetically determined myocardial dystrophy.

Studies based on international cohorts show that if left untreated the prognosis of LQTS is poor. 1 – 3 β-blockers are the standard ther-apy for LQTS and are associated with a significant reduction in cardiac events. 4 – 9 Preventive measures, such as avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs, electrolyte disturbances, and adrenergic stimuli, are essential and apply to all LQTS patients. 10 The number of detected asymptomatic mutation carriers is increasing because of <b>cascade</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>screening</b> of LQTS family members.

40|$|Background: Familial {{hypercholesterolemia}} (FH) is {{a serious}} genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in every 300 to 500 individuals and is characterised by excessively high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, substantially increased risk of early-onset coronary heart disease (CHD) and premature mortality. If FH is untreated, it leads to a greater than 50 % risk of CHD in men {{by the age of}} 50 and at least 30 % in women by the age of 60. FH can be diagnosed through <b>genetic</b> <b>screening</b> and effectively managed through pharmacological treatment and lifestyle changes. Purpose: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic health condition that increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although FH can be effectively managed with appropriate pharmacological and dietary interventions, FH detection rate through <b>genetic</b> <b>screening</b> remains low. The present study explored perceptions and experiences of FH patients (N = 18) involved in a <b>genetic</b> <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> programme. Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess patients’ knowledge and understanding of FH, explore factors linked to adherence to health-protective behaviours and examine perceptions of <b>genetic</b> <b>screening.</b> Results: Thematic analysis of interviews revealed four themes: disease knowledge, severity of FH, lifestyle behavioural change and barriers to cascade screening and treatment. Participants recognised FH as a permanent, genetic condition that increased their risk of CHD and premature mortality. Many participants dismissed the seriousness of FH and the importance of lifestyle changes because they perceived it to be effectively managed through medication. Despite positive attitudes toward screening, many participants reported that relatives were reluctant to attend screening due to their relatives’ ‘fatalistic’ outlook or low motivation. Participants believed that they had insufficient authority or control to persuade family members to attend screening and welcomed greater hospital assistance for contact with relatives. Conclusions: Findings support the adoption of direct methods of recruitment to cascade screening led by medical professionals, who were perceived as having greater authority. Other implications included the need for clinicians to provide clear information, particularly to those who are asymptomatic, related to the seriousness of FH and the necessity for adherence to medication and lifestyle changes.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{whether the}} severity of the familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) phenotype, i. e. increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, decreases in more distantly related patients within one family. We included heterozygous FH patients identified by <b>genetic</b> <b>cascade</b> <b>screening</b> in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2014. A cascade starts with identification of a genetically proven FH patient ("index patient") followed by testing in first degree relatives. If a mutation carrier is identified, their first degree relatives are tested as well, and so on. The associations between distance-to-index (expressed as family relationship) and both LDL-C levels and CVD risk, were evaluated using multivariable linear and Cox regression models. Distance-to-index could be determined in 13, 374 patients. Mean (± standard error) levels of LDL-C did not differ significantly in 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, and 4 th or more family members: 5. 46 (1. 42), 5. 17 (1. 42), 4. 89 (1. 37), and 4. 58 (1. 27) mmol/L, respectively (adjusted p-for-trend: 0. 104).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{premature}} cardiovascular disease {{in patients with}} familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) can be profoundly reduced by cholesterol-lowering therapy, and current guidelines for FH advocate ambitious low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. In the present study, we determined whether these goals are reflected in current clinical practice once FH has been diagnosed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In 2008, we sent questionnaires to all subjects (aged 18 - 65 years) who were molecularly diagnosed with FH in the year 2006 through the screening program in The Netherlands. Of these 1062 subjects, 781 completed the questionnaire (46 % males; mean age: 42 +/- 12 years; mean LDL-C at molecular diagnosis (baseline) : 4. 1 +/- 1. 3 mmol/L). The number of persons that used cholesterol-lowering therapy increased from 397 (51 %) at baseline to 636 (81 %) after diagnosis. Mean treated LDL-C levels decreased significantly to 3. 2 +/- 1. 1 mmol/L two years after diagnosis. Only 22 % achieved the LDL-C target level of < or = 2. 5 mmol/L. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The proportion of patients using cholesterol-lowering medication was significantly increased after FH diagnosis through <b>genetic</b> <b>cascade</b> <b>screening.</b> The attained LDL-C levels were lower than those reported in previous surveys on medication use in FH, which could reflect the effect of more stringent lipid target levels.

Multivariate analyses with adjustment for age, sex, and specific family ties were performed. Methods and Results-Significant variation of LDL levels was observed among 399 patients with FH with different mutations. Null alleles were associated with more severely elevated LDL cholesterol, whereas the frequent N 543 H/ 2393 del 9 mutation led to less elevated LDL cholesterol. The type of mutation did not influence HDL cholesterol levels. Patients with FH had CVD 8. 5 times more often compared with their unaffected relatives (RR, 8. 54; 95 % CI, 5. 29 to 13. 80). The N 543 H/ 2393 del 9 mutation was associated with a smaller increase of risk compared with other mutations (P < 0. 0001).
