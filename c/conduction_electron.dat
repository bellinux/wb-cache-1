2500|$|In {{solid-state}} physics, a band gap, {{also called}} an energy gap or bandgap, is an energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist. In graphs {{of the electronic}} band structure of solids, the band gap generally refers to the energy difference (in electron volts) between {{the top of the}} valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in insulators and semiconductors. [...] It is the energy required to promote a valence electron bound to an atom to become a <b>conduction</b> <b>electron,</b> which is free to move within the crystal lattice and serve as a charge carrier to conduct electric current. [...] It is closely related to the HOMO/LUMO gap in chemistry. If the valence band is completely full and the conduction band is completely empty, then electrons cannot move in the solid; however, if some electrons transfer from the valence to the conduction band, then current can flow (see carrier generation and recombination). Therefore, the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid. Substances with large band gaps are generally insulators, those with smaller band gaps are semiconductors, while conductors either have very small band gaps or none, because the valence and conduction bands overlap.|$|E

40|$|Analyzing the {{exchange}} energy of two <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> in a crystal at a many-body approach we find, that {{the exchange}} energy may be negative and, thus, the singlet state may be favorable. A full overlap {{in the real}} space of the wave functions of two <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> leads to a deeper exchange energy. Thus the Pauli Exclusion Principle and the exchange interaction cause a bond between two <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> in the real space. The singlet bond is possible because the singlet electrons are in average closer to positive ions than single electrons. The superconductivity in a metallic crystal occurs only if <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons,</b> before the pairing, are put closely on the Fermi surface in the momentum space. The motion of <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> in the crystal may prevent the formation of Cooper pairs, because the kinetic energy of the motion is usually larger than the binding energy in the pair. The <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> as standing waves have zero momenta, hence their momenta are synchronous; therefore the formation of Cooper pairs is more probable than in case of nonzero momenta. The approach of standing waves explains the inverse isotope effect and many other facts about superconductor...|$|R

5000|$|The RKKY {{interaction}} was originally proposed by M. A. Ruderman and Charles Kittel of the University of California, Berkeley, {{as a means}} of explaining unusually broad nuclear spin resonance lines that had been observed in natural metallic silver. The theory uses second-order perturbation theory to describe an indirect exchange coupling whereby the nuclear spin of one atom interacts with a <b>conduction</b> <b>electron</b> through the hyperfine interaction, and this <b>conduction</b> <b>electron</b> then interacts with another nuclear spin, thus creating a correlation energy between the two nuclear spins. (Alternatively, instead of nuclear spins coupling to conduction spins through the hyperfine interaction, another scenario is for inner electron spins to couple to conduction spins through the exchange interaction.) The theory is based on Bloch wavefunctions and is therefore only applicable to crystalline systems. The derived exchange interaction takes the following form: ...|$|E

The strength of the electron-phonon interaction is expressed by a dimensionless coupling constant α introduced by Fröhlich. In Table 1 the Fröhlich coupling constant is given for a few solids.

50|$|The Fermi {{energy is}} below the {{conduction}} band causing the state density to be asymmetric around the Fermi energy. Therefore, the average electron energy of the conduction band {{is higher than the}} Fermi energy, making the system conducive for charge motion into a lower energy state. By contrast, the Fermi energy lies in the conduction band in metals. This makes the state density symmetric about the Fermi energy so that the average <b>conduction</b> <b>electron</b> energy is close to the Fermi energy, reducing the forces pushing for charge transport. Therefore, semiconductors are ideal thermoelectric materials. Due to the small Seebeck coefficient metals have a very limited performance and the main materials of interest are Semiconductors.|$|E

50|$|Impurities play an {{important}} role in the nucleation of other phase transitions. For example, the presence of foreign elements may have important effects on the mechanical and magnetic properties of metal alloys. Iron atoms in copper cause the renowned Kondo effect where the <b>conduction</b> <b>electron</b> spins form a magnetic bound state with the impurity atom. Magnetic impurities in superconductors can serve as generation sites for vortex defects. Point defects can nucleate reversed domains in ferromagnets and dramatically affect their coercivity. In general impurities are able to serve as initiation points for phase transitions because the energetic cost of creating a finite-size domain of a new phase is lower at a point defect. In order for the nucleus of a new phase to be stable, it must reach a critical size. This threshold size is often lower at an impurity site.|$|E

The lecture proves less comprehensible than he had hoped and he drifts off to sleep and enters a dream {{world in which the}} speed of light is a mere 10 mph. This becomes apparent to him through the fact that passing cyclists are subject to a noticeable Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction. Mr Tompkins becomes acquainted with the Professor delivering the lectures and ultimately marries the Professor's daughter, Maud. Later chapters in the books deal with atomic structure (Mr Tompkins spends time as a <b>conduction</b> <b>electron,</b> returning to consciousness when he is annihilated in an encounter with a positron) and thermodynamics (the Professor expounds an analogy between the second law of thermodynamics and the bias towards the casino in gambling before being confounded by a local reversal of the second law through the intervention of Maxwell's demon who has introduced himself to Maud in one of her dreams). Mr Tompkins initials are 'C.G.H.' which stand for c (the speed of light), G (the constant of gravitation) and h (Plank's constant). Following their marriage Maud refers to him as 'Cyril'.|$|E

40|$|We microscopically analyze thermal spin pumping {{mediated}} by magnons, at {{the interface between}} a ferromagnetic insulator and a non-magnetic metal, in the semiclassical regime. The generation of a spin current is discussed by calculating the thermal spin transfer torque, which breaks the spin conservation law for <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> and operates the coherent magnon state. Inhomogeneous thermal fluctuations between <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> and magnons induce a net spin current, which is pumped into the adjacent non-magnetic metal.

Consequently thermal spin pumping does not cost any kind of applied magnetic fields...|$|R
40|$|In {{frustrated}} magnets when {{magnetic ordering}} is suppressed down to low temperature, {{the formation of}} a quantum spin liquid becomes a possibility. How such a spin liquid manifests in the presence of <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> is a question with potentially rich physical consequences, particularly when both the localized spins and <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> reside on frustrated lattices. We propose a novel mechanism for symmetry breaking in systems where <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> hybridize with a quantum spin liquid through Kondo couplings.

He formally retired in 1996 [...] He was deputed twice by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Vienna, Austria, as an Expert to set up the Magnetic Resonance Laboratory at the Atomic Energy Centre, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. He was awarded an Indian National Science Academy Senior Scientist position from 1996 to 2001, during which he worked at SAMEER, Mumbai, in collaboration with TIFR. In the 1950s, he constructed a crossed circle wide line NMR spectrometer which could detect deuterium and oxygen-17 isotopes in their natural abundance. Using oxygen-17 as a probe, he demonstrated chemical shifts in organic liquids due to electronic bonding. He subsequently developed an interdisciplinary group which used NMR and susceptibility measurements in metals to show that susceptibility and the hyperfine field at the nucleus were related and could be modified by alloying. The oscillatory nature of the <b>conduction</b> <b>electron</b> polarisation was established in rare earth alloys. The findings from experiments performed in bulk samples of transition metals, rare earths, Heusler alloys and spin glass were related to results obtained from microscopic techniques such as NMR, Mossbauer and neutron diffraction.

He and his collaborators, are credited with the discovery of superconductivity in borocarbides with magnetic elements (under the leadership of R. Nagarajan and L. C.
