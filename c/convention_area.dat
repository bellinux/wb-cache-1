25|$|The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) was {{established}} by the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean. On 11 February 1992, the Convention was signed by Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America, and took effect on 16 February 1993. The Republic of Korea later acceded to the Convention on 27 May 2003. As indicated in the Convention, the main objective of the NPAFC is to promote the conservation of anadromous stocks in the North Pacific Ocean. The NPAFC provides a framework for international cooperation on the scientific research of anadromous species and enforcement of fisheries regulations in the <b>Convention</b> <b>Area.</b> The Convention prohibits directed catch of anadromous fish in the <b>Convention</b> <b>Area,</b> but allows for some fishing of these species for scientific purposes under national and joint research programs with prior approval of the NPAFC. The Convention also includes measures to reduce incidental catch of anadromous fish in other high seas fisheries and prohibits the retention of these species on board fishing vessels in the <b>Convention</b> <b>Area.</b>|$|E

The largest apprehension of salmon occurred in 1997 during a joint Japanese-American enforcement operation where one hundred and twenty tons of salmon were confiscated from the vessel Nanao 55008.|$|E

25|$|The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) is an international, inter-governmental {{organization}} dedicated to the conservation of anadromous fish stocks in international waters of the North Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas. It was established on 11 February 1992 by the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean and originally consisted of four member nations: Canada, Japan, Russian Federation, and United States of America. On 27 May 2003, the Republic of Korea acceded to the Convention bringing the current number of Commission members to five. The primary objective of the Commission {{is to provide a}} mechanism for international cooperation promoting the conservation of anadromous stocks in the NPAFC <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> of the North Pacific Ocean.|$|E
25|$|An OSPF network may be structured, or subdivided, into routing {{areas to}} simplify {{administration}} and optimize traffic and resource utilization. Areas are identified by 32-bit numbers, expressed either simply in decimal, or {{often in the}} same octet-based dot-decimal notation used for IPv4 addresses. By <b>convention,</b> <b>area</b> 0 (zero), or 0.0.0.0, represents the core or backbone area of an OSPF network. While the identifications of other areas may be chosen at will, administrators often select the IP address of a main router in an area as the area identifier. Each additional area must have {{a connection to the}} OSPF backbone area. Such connections are maintained by an interconnecting router, known as an area border router (ABR). An ABR maintains separate link-state databases for each area it serves and maintains summarized routes for all areas in the network.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{represents}} a preliminary otolith shape analysis of pelagic redfish (Sebastes mentella) in the Irminger Sea, comparing NAFO and NEAFC <b>convention</b> <b>areas</b> and depth layers (shallower and deeper than 500 m). Elliptical Fourier Analysis (EFA) {{was applied to}} describe digitised otolith outlines. The resulting Fourier descriptors were {{used as the basis}} for discriminant analysis to investigate separation success between area/depth groups. In general, differences in univariate measurements (otolith length, breadth and weight) and otolith shapes between area/depth groups were marginal and subject to high variation. Discriminant analysis indicated poor separation between area/depth groups. Differences in average shapes between the area/depth groups were relatively low. Based on this morphometric study, the existence of separate s tocks of S. mentella in the Irminger Sea seems to be unlikely, neither on a vertical (depth) nor horizontal scale (NAFO/NEAFC areas) ...|$|R
