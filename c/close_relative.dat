5|$|In 1997 Briggs and Nedin {{reported}} from South Australia a new specimen of Myoscolex {{that was much}} better preserved than previous specimens, leading them to conclude {{that it was a}} <b>close</b> <b>relative</b> of Opabinia—although this interpretation was later questioned by Dzik, who instead concluded that Myoscolex was an annelid worm.|$|E
5|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{occurs in}} the great tit (Parus major) when the offspring produced {{as a result of}} a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. In natural populations of Parus major, inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a <b>close</b> <b>relative.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{analysis}} {{examines the}} use of non-target native plants in Hawai'i resulting from biological control projects on target weeds with <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> compared with projects on target weeds that lack <b>close</b> <b>relatives.</b> Target weeds with <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> are riskier targets for biological control than are weeds without <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> in Hawai'i. The two projects conducted against weeds with <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> resulted in non-target use of native species; {{four of the five}} insect species established in these projects now use native plant species as hosts. Only one of 18 (5. 0 %) projects against Hawaiian weeds that lack <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> has produced native plant use. Overall, 53 of 54 agents established for weed control exhibit predictable and highly stable host ranges. This pattern of non-target plant use indicates that the risk to the native flora can be judged reliably before introduction. The degree of risk {{is directly related to the}} relative relatedness of the targeted weeds and the natlve flora and the speclnclty of the natural enemies employed...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: The use of self-report {{measurements}} may {{be problematic}} {{in patients with}} limitations that interfere with reliable self-assessment like cognitive impairment, as {{may be the case}} in multiple sclerosis (MS). In these situations proxy respondents, such as <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> or healthcare providers, may provide valuable information. To examine the accuracy and value of healthcare providers and <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> to assess disease impact of MS. Methods: MS patients, <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> and healthcare providers completed the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS- 29) before and after a rehabilitation program. Agreement between outcomes was assessed by calculating mean absolute and directional differences and intraclass correlation coefficients. Results: Comparison of ratings between patients and proxy respondents revealed low levels of agreement. <b>Close</b> <b>relatives</b> appeared to significantly overestimate the disease impact of MS whereas healthcare providers tended to underestimate the disease impact of MS. Conclusion: Caution is advised when incorporating <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> and healthcare providers as proxy respondents in a rehabilitation setting. However, when <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> are consulted, one should expect a certain level of overestimation of disease impact. When consulting healthcare providers, one should expect a certain level of underestimation of disease impact. © 2008 The Author(s) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} licentiate thesis was to {{describe}} <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> of critically ill persons within intensive and critical care {{from the perspective of}} <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> and of critical care nurses. The data were collected by means of qualitaive research interviews with seven partners of persons who had been critically ill and cared for in an intensive care unit, and with focus groups discussions with 24 critical care nurses. The data were then analysed using a qualitative thematic content analysis. This study shows it was a frightening experience to see the person critically ill in an unknown environment. It was important {{to be able to be}} present; nothing else mattered. Showing respect, confirming the integrity and dignity of the ill person were also essential. recieving support from family and friends was important, as were understanding what had happened, obtaining information and the way in which this was given. The uncertainty concerning the outcome of the ill person was hard to cope with. <b>Close</b> <b>relatives</b> wanted to feel hope, even though the prognosis was poor. The presence of <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> was taken for granted by critical care nurses and ut was frustrating if the ill person did not have any. Information from <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> made it possible for critical care nurses to create personal care for the critically ill person. Critical care nurses supported clsoe relatives by giving them information, being near and trying to establish good relationships with them. <b>Close</b> <b>relatives</b> were described as an important and demanding part of the critical care nurses' work something that took time and enegy to deal with, and the critical care nurses missed forums for discussions about the care given.

40|$|Pediatric {{palliative care}} has {{recently}} become {{a priority in}} the healthcare field and is implemented {{at the time of}} diagnosis rather than days or weeks before the child 2 ̆ 7 s death. Social constructivism theory in which humans generate meaning from their experiences was utilized as a general framework to determine the impact of pediatric palliative care on <b>close</b> <b>relatives.</b> The purpose of this grounded theory study was to generate a substantive theory that explains how <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> such as grandparents, aunts, and uncles of a child with cancer experience palliative care. The participants of the study included <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> of children in palliative care. Semi-structured interviews and journaling were used to collect data. Initial, focused, and selective coding procedures were used to manage the data and a content analysis of the textual data was performed. Findings from the data suggested a process of surrendering to the journey in which <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> learn to let go of what they cannot control while holding on to what they can control. Social change implications of this study may include improving healthcare programming for <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> utilizing supportive-expressive measures. This programming may promote mental health of the <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> who will learn to deal with their adjustment difficulties and improve their coping skills...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} thesis was to describe the experiences of <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> within intensive care, {{from the perspective of}} <b>close</b> <b>relatives,</b> formerly critically ill people and critical care nurses. Data were collected by means of qualitative research interviews with <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> of people who had been critically ill and cared for in an intensive care unit (ICU) and with the people themselves. Data were also collected by means of focus-group discussions with critical care nurses. Collected data were analysed using qualitative thematic content analysis and phenomenological hermeneutic interpretation. This thesis reveals that it was a frightening experience for <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> to see the person critically ill in an unknown environment. It was important {{to be able to be}} near the ill person. Showing respect for and confirming the dignity of the ill person were essential. The uncertainty concerning the outcome for the ill person was hard to manage. <b>Close</b> <b>relatives</b> wanted to feel hope, even though the prognosis was poor. The presence of <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> was taken for granted by critical care nurses. Information from <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> made it possible for critical care nurses to provide personal care for the critically ill person. Critical care nurses supported <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> by giving them information and being near. <b>Close</b> <b>relatives</b> were described as an important but demanding part of the critical care nurses' work. People who had been critically ill had felt their close relatives' presence. Through the help of <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> they felt they were understood and safe. <b>Close</b> <b>relatives</b> made it possible for them to do various things, which were appreciated, but they also engendered feelings of guilt. They realized their own, and the close relatives' significance, which gave them the power to continue the struggle. The possibility for people who had been critically ill, and their <b>close</b> <b>relatives,</b> to return together to the ICU for a follow-up visit after discharge and talk about what happened during and after their stay in the ICU was appreciated. Receiving explanations and being able to discuss one's experience were valuable. Meeting the ICU staff again enabled them to express their gratitude for their work, to give opinions about the care and to suggest improvements. This thesis shows that the critically ill person is the focus of close relatives' existence. The uncertainty of the time causes close relatives' suffering and they felt vulnerable. To be able to be close to the critically ill person, to be allowed to participate in and receive explanations about what was happening and why, to be met by dignity and to be able to keep hope alive are all prerequisites for enduring a radically changed everyday life which <b>close</b> <b>relatives</b> experience when someone they love is, or has been, critically ill. The crucial challenge is how these needs can be met by the staff of the ICU. Godkänd; 2008; 20080201 (andbra...|$|R
