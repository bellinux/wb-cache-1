25|$|The Schengen Agreement {{was signed}} {{independently}} of the European Union, in part owing {{to the lack of}} consensus amongst EU member states over whether or not the EU had the jurisdiction to abolish border controls, and in part because those ready to implement the idea did not wish to wait for others (at this time there was no enhanced co-operation mechanism).

25|$|The strange list above was {{explained}} by Simons's proof of Berger's theorem. A simple and geometric proof of Berger's theorem {{was given by}} Carlos E. Olmos in 2005. One first shows that if a Riemannian manifold is not a locally symmetric space and the reduced holonomy acts irreducibly on the tangent space, then it acts transitively on the unit sphere. The Lie groups acting transitively on spheres are known: they consist of the list above, together with 2 extra cases: the group Spin(9) acting on R16, and the group T · Sp(m) acting on R4m. Finally one <b>checks</b> <b>that</b> {{the first of these}} two extra cases only occurs as a holonomy group for locally symmetric spaces (that are locally isomorphic to the Cayley projective plane), and the second does not occur at all as a holonomy group.|$|E

On March 30, 1995, Selena and Chris met with Saldivar at a motel to recover missing financial papers for tax purposes. When Selena arrived home she found that Saldivar did not give her the correct documents. She phoned Saldivar, who tried to convince Selena to return to her motel room alone. Chris insisted that it was too late, and he did not want Selena driving alone at night. Selena then agreed to meet with Saldivar the next morning.|$|E

500|$|The ICAO {{released}} {{their report}} December 2, 1983, which {{concluded that the}} violation of Soviet airspace was accidental: One of two explanations for the aircraft's deviation was that the autopilot had remained in HEADING hold instead of INS mode after departing Anchorage. They postulated that this inflight navigational error was caused by either the crew's failure to select INS mode, or the inertial navigation's not activating when selected, because the aircraft was already too far off track. It was determined that the crew did not notice this error or subsequently perform navigational <b>checks,</b> <b>that</b> would have revealed that the aircraft was diverging further and further from its assigned route.

500|$|The {{developers}} {{knew that}} for the story they wanted to [...] "throw the player right in the action, with things {{he had to do}} without explanation" [...] in addition to creating a sense of urgency and mystery for the player. They developed an initial draft of the game's plot and gave it to script writer Sachie Hirano and scenario event planner Yukari Ishida to expand on. The returned version was very close to the initial vision for the game's story. However, there were still difficulties in filling out the story, only achieving some smooth development about halfway through the process, and even then, there were still changes made just prior to creating the master image for the game. Several inconsistencies with the game's story were found in the final quality <b>checks</b> <b>that</b> had to be resolved. The Square Enix localization team, while translating most of the dialog and interface items into English and other European languages, preserved many Japanese elements to avoid losing the culture of the game.

500|$|Caesar held {{both the}} Dictatorship and the Plebeian Tribunate, but alternated between the Consulship and the Proconsulship. His powers {{within the state}} seem to have rested upon these magistracies. The Dictatorship of Caesar was {{fundamentally}} different from the Dictatorship of the early and middle republic, as he held the office for life, rather than for six months, and he also held certain judicial powers which the ordinary Dictators had not held. In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers, which made his person sacrosanct, allowed him to veto the Roman Senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. Since Tribunes were always elected by the Plebeian Council, Caesar had hoped to prevent the election of Tribunes who might oppose him. In 46 BC, Caesar gave himself the title of [...] "Prefect of the Morals" [...] (praefectura morum), which was an office that was new only in name, as its powers were identical {{to those of the}} Censors. Thus, he could hold Censorial powers, while technically not subjecting himself to the same <b>checks</b> <b>that</b> the ordinary Censors were subject to, and he used these powers to fill the senate with his own partisans. He also set the precedent, which his imperial successors followed, of requiring the senate to bestow various titles and honors upon him. Coins bore his likeness, and he was given the right to speak first during senate meetings.|$|E
500|$|The Court further {{stated that}} {{although}} congress allowed the resale and gifting {{of a gun}} by an individual, without requiring form or background <b>checks,</b> <b>that</b> is not proof that congress did not care about straw buyers. [...] "Yes, Congress decided to regulate dealers’ sales, while leaving the secondary market for guns largely untouched.... And yes, that choice (like pretty much everything Congress does) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw arrangements are {{not a part of}} the secondary market, separate and apart from the dealer’s sale." [...] The Court also rejected Abramski's claim that since Alvarez was able to buy the gun legally on his own the misrepresentation is not material, stating: [...] "Abramski’s false statement was material because had he revealed that he was purchasing the gun on Alvarez’s behalf, the sale could not have proceeded under the law—even though Alvarez turned out to be an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter, would not have complied with §922(c)’s restrictions on absentee purchases." [...] The court held that Abramski's case is analogous to a situation where a person that can buy a gun legally buys a gun under an alias. Such misrepresentation is material regardless of the fact that the buyer may purchase a gun legally, and the theory of [...] "no harm, no foul" [...] should not apply. Finally, the Court rejected Abramski's claim that the misrepresentation is not in violation of §924, because it is not part of what the dealer is statutorily required to maintain on his record. The Court held that §924 requires the dealer to maintain information [...] "required by this chapter", and that ATF Form 4473 is required by this chapter.|$|E
