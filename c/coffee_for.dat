25|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, coffee {{production}} in India {{has grown by}} over 15 percent.

This was further amended in 1994 when the Free Sale Quota (FSQ) permitted large and small scale growers to sell between 70% and 100% of their coffee either domestically or internationally. A final amendment in September 1996 saw the liberalisation of <b>coffee</b> <b>for</b> all growers in the country and a freedom to sell their produce wherever they wished.|$|E

This meant that script editor Douglas Adams, aided by Graham Williams, had to perform a complete rewrite of the story {{over the course of a}} weekend. According to Adams, Graham Williams [...] "took me back to his place, locked me in his study and hosed me down with whisky and black <b>coffee</b> <b>for</b> a few days, and there was the script".
