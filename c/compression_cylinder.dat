500|$|Despite an {{incomplete}} {{understanding of the}} principles behind them, in some ways Evans's thinking {{about the potential for}} steam engines was once again far ahead of its time. In the postscript of the Steam Engineer's Guide, Evans noted that drawing a vacuum on water reduces its boiling point and cools it. He further observed that a vacuum would have the same effect upon ether, and the resulting cooling should be sufficient to produce ice. He went on to describe a piston vacuum pump apparatus to produce this effect, and also showed that a <b>compression</b> <b>cylinder,</b> or the compression stroke of the vacuum pump, should produce heat in a condenser. Thus Evans had produced the first detailed and theoretically coherent design for a vapor-compression refrigerator, identifying all the major components (expander, cooling coil, compressor and condenser) of a refrigeration cycle, leaving some to credit him as the 'grandfather of refrigeration'. [...] Although Evans never developed a working model of his designs, and {{there is no evidence that}} he ever attempted to, Evans in his later life worked and associated extensively with fellow inventor Jacob Perkins on steam engines and the potential for refrigeration. Perkins would later develop and build a refrigeration device for which he received patents in 1834–1835, employing much the same principles originally put forward by Evans.|$|E

5000|$|The Baikal IZH-46M is {{the current}} {{production}} run of the original Baikal IZH-46.

50|$|In a {{conventional}} Otto cycle engine, each cylinder performs four strokes per cycle: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. This means that two revolutions of the crankshaft {{are required for}} each power stroke. The split-cycle engine divides these four strokes between two paired cylinders: one for intake and compression, and another for power and exhaust. Compressed air is transferred from the <b>compression</b> <b>cylinder</b> to the power cylinder through a crossover passage. Fuel is then injected and fired to produce the power stroke.|$|E

50|$|As can be seen, this engine {{requires}} an extra valve per pair of cylinders {{compared to an}} Otto engine, but only when in air hybrid configuration. In the standard configuration conforming to the schematic above it could use actually one less valve per cylinder pair than an Otto engine. It also has the same power density (power strokes per cylinder per revolution), even though the power cylinder fires on every rotation, because of the extra <b>compression</b> <b>cylinder.</b> While its fuel efficiency and other advantages may make this a useful modern design, the extra complexity would historically have favored the Otto design, when precision machining was more expensive than fuel savings over the engine's lifetime.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{comparison}} of exergetic models between two hot air engines (a Gamma type Stirling prototype having a maximum output mechanical power of 500 W and an Ericsson hot air engine with a maximum power of 300 W) is made. Referring to previous energetic analyses, exergetic models are set up in order to quantify the exergy destruction and efficiencies in each type of engine. The repartition of the exergy fluxes in {{each part of the}} two engines are determined and represented in Sankey diagrams, using dimensionless exergy fluxes. The results show a similar proportion in both engines of destroyed exergy compared to the exergy flux from the hot source. The <b>compression</b> <b>cylinders</b> generate the highest exergy destruction, whereas the expansion cylinders generate the lowest one. The regenerator of the Stirling engine increases the exergy resource at the inlet of the expansion cylinder, which might be also set up in the Ericsson engine, using a preheater between the exhaust air and the compressed air transferred to the hot heat exchanger...|$|R

50|$|The MK1 Transit (1965 to 1978), {{with its}} flat front and short bonnet, was {{designed}} to use this engine. The bore on each engine was the same at 93.67 mm but strokes of 60.35 and 72.42 mm gave the different capacities {{as a result the}} pistons and crankshafts are different on the two engines. Both engines were available in low compression ratio form (7.7:1) and high 9.1:1 for the smaller unit and 8.9:1 for the larger. Power output varied from 73 bhp (Low compression 1.7) to 93 bhp on high compression 2.0 litre and torque from 100 lb/ft to 123.5, hence the Essex V4 and V6 engine's Heron cylinder head design.
