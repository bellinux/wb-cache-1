To understand the struc-tural organization of cis-acting elements present on Ty 1 genomic RNA from the GAG region that <b>control</b> <b>reverse</b> transcription, we applied chemoenzymatic probing to RNA/tRNA complexes assembled in vitro and to the RNA in virus-like particles. By comparing different RNA states, our analyses provide a comprehensive structure of the primer-binding site, a novel pseudoknot adjacent to the primer-binding sites, three regions containing palin-dromic sequences that may be involved in RNA dimerization or packaging and candidate protein interaction sites. In addition, we determined the impact of a novel form of transposon control based on Ty 1 antisense transcripts that associate with virus-like particles. Our results support the idea that antisense RNAs inhibit retrotransposition by targeting Ty 1 protein function rather than anneal-ing with the RNA genome...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effectiveness of}} water level control using fuzzy logic. The water level in the tank is sensed using transistor switching principle. The level sensed is fed to the PIC 16 microcontroller. The user provides the set point to the microcontroller through serial communication using the COM development port software, Terminal. It computes the error as {{the difference between the}} set point and the process variable. The fuzzy logic programmed in the microcontroller is applied which controls the water level in the tank using the drain and the feed pumps. Once the set point has been reached, the message along with the present level is sent back through serial communication to the user interface on a PC. Thus, the water level in the tank is controlled according to the set point given by the user.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} in analyzing the reverse link capacity performance of cellular CDMA systems employing successive interference cancellation (SIC). Due to the controlled power disparity present in such systems previous methods cannot precisely model their inter-cell interference. We first introduce a novel model which allows the accurate analysis and evaluation of the inter-cell interference of cellular CDMA systems with controlled power disparity. Its validity is verified by means of theoretical analysis and computer simulations. Secondly, by using this new inter-cell interference model, a theoretical analysis of the CDMA reverse link capacity is presented. In terms of evaluation results, {{we focus on the}} performance improvements SIC offers as compared to single user detection (SUD). Analytical results complemented by equivalent computer simulated performance evaluation results have shown that SIC significantly increases the reverse link capacity of cellular CDMA systems operating in realistic controlled power disparity environments.

40|$|Measurement {{systems and}} data {{analysis}} provide quantitative geometrical information for quality assurance, manufacturing and assembly <b>control,</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering etc. Measurement and analysis systems must provide reliable performance {{at a level}} suited to the application. Good performance is better than poor performance, but the need for reliability must temper the aspiration for high performance. To achieve this balance we must model and manage our severely deficient information about, and understanding of, the processes we confront. The central idea in this talk is that: Performance must be traded-off against robustness to uncertainty. This is relevant both for measurement system design and for data evaluation: • A measurement system {{which is designed to}} achieve optimal performance will be extremely sensitive to deficiencies in the knowledge upon which the design is based. Immunity to information-gaps is enhanced only by decreasing performance requirements. • An estimation algorithm which is constructed to provide high fidelity to measure-ments will be extremely sensitive to imperfections in the knowledge underlying the algorithm. Robustness to info-gaps is enhanced only by reducing the fidelity requirement...|$|E

40|$|The {{cerebral}} {{deposition of}} amyloid beta protein (A beta P) {{is an early}} pathogenetic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest both neurotoxic and neurotrophic effects of A beta P in vitro. Because progressive A beta P deposition and surrounding neuritic dystrophy occur spontaneously in primates, we evaluated the in vivo effects of synthetic A beta P in monkey cortex. Experimental and <b>control</b> (<b>reverse</b> or substituted) peptides were stereotactically injected into multiple neocortical sites of adult rhesus monkeys in a vehicle of either artificial cerebrospinal fluid or acetonitrile. After 2 weeks, all injection sites were identified and characterized. A beta P antibodies specifically detected the injected A beta P 1 - 40 peptide. Serial sections stained with silver and antineurofilament protein demonstrated comparable degrees of degenerating neurons, dystrophic neurites, and axonal spheroids associated with both experimental and control peptide injections. Alz 50 staining was sparse or absent in all sites. Similar results were obtained in an animal killed 3 months after injection. We conclude that specific cellular changes closely resembling the pathology of Alzheimer's disease were not detected in these acute experiments, and that control and experimental A beta P peptides produced indistinguishable effects...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify and target alternative angiogenic pathways that are upregulated in ovarian xenografts during treatment with bevacizumab. For this, angiogenesis-focused gene expression arrays were used to measure gene expression levels in SKOV 3 and A 2780 serous ovarian xenografts treated with bevacizumab or <b>control.</b> <b>Reverse</b> transcription-PCR was used for results validation. The insulin growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) was found upregulated in tumor and stromal cells in the two ovarian xenograft models treated with bevacizumab. Cixutumumab was used to block IGF- 1 signaling in vivo. Dual anti-VEGF and IGF blockade with bevacizumab and cixutumumab resulted in increased inhibition of tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry measured multivessel density, Akt activation, and cell proliferation, whereas terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay measured apoptosis in ovarian cancer xenografts. Bevacizumab and cixutumumab combination increased tumor cell apoptosis in vivo compared with therapy targeting either individual pathway. The combination blocked angiogenesis and cell proliferation but not more significantly than each antibody alone. In summary, IGF- 1 activation represents an important mechanism of adaptive escape during anti-VEGF therapy in ovarian cancer.

40|$|Reverse {{transcription}} of the genomic RNA by {{reverse transcriptase}} occurs soon after HIV- 1 infection of target cells. The viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein chaperones this process via its nucleic acid annealing activities and its {{interactions with the}} reverse transcriptase enzyme. To function, NC needs its two conserved zinc fingers and flanking basic residues. We recently reported a new role for NC, whereby it negatively <b>controls</b> <b>reverse</b> transcription {{in the course of}} virus formation. Indeed, deleting its zinc fingers causes reverse transcription activation in virus producer cells. To investigate this new NC function, we used viruses with subtle mutations in the conserved zinc fingers and its flanking domains. We monitored by quantitative PCR the HIV- 1 DNA content in producer cells and in produced virions. Results showed that the two intact zinc-finger structures are required for the temporal <b>control</b> of <b>reverse</b> transcription by NC throughout the virus replication cycle. The N-terminal basic residues also contributed to this new role of NC, while Pro- 31 residue between the zinc fingers and Lys- 59 in the C-terminal region did not.

40|$|Implicit egotism—in particular, {{positive}} unconscious {{associations that}} individuals have {{with others who}} share their names or first initials—is a mainstay of modern psychology textbooks, but the interpretation of prior field studies has recently come under criticism for lack of adequate <b>control,</b> <b>reverse</b> causality, and ethnic heterogeneity. Using unique data from the New Orleans District Attorney’s Office on 48, 988 defendants that {{were randomly assigned to}} judges from 1988 - 1999, we identify the causal effect of matching first initials. In contrast to positive affect, we find that judges assign 8 % longer sentences on average (about two-three months) when they match on first initials. The effect is robust to controls and removal of outliers. No effect is found for second-letter matches, last-letter matches, or randomly reassigned names. The effects are somewhat larger for defendants categorized as Negroes by the New Orleans District Attorney’s Office, which could be due to sampling variation or due to behavioral biases playing a stronger role in evaluations when decision makers are nearly indifferent. The effects are also somewhat larger for judges categorized as Whites. The negative effect of sharing first initials explains 0. 03 % of variation. Finally, we interpret the negative behavioral effect as threatened egotism, in which individuals motivated to manage self-image (implicit egoism) create social distance from negatively- valenced targets perceived {{to be associated with the}} self...|$|E
40|$|It {{is assumed}} that the {{combined}} effects of multiple common genetic variants explain {{a large part of}} variation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) plasma levels, but little evidence exists to corroborate this assumption. It was our objective to study the contribution of multiple common genetic variants of HDL-C-related genes to variation of HDL-C plasma levels. A well-characterized cohort of 546 Caucasian men with documented coronary artery disease was genotyped for common functional variants in genes that <b>control</b> <b>reverse</b> cholesterol transport: ATP-binding cassette transporter A 1, apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein-E, cholesteryl ester transfer protein, hepatic lipase, lecithin : cholesterol-acyl transferase, lipoprotein lipase, and scavenger receptor class B type 1. Multivariate linear regression showed that these variants, in conjunction, explain 12. 4 % (95 % confidence interval: 6. 9 - 17. 9 %) of variation in HDL-C plasma levels. When the covariates smoking and body mass index were taken into account, the explained variation increased to 15. 3 % (9. 4 - 21. 2 %), and when 10 two-way interactions were incorporated, this percentage rose to 25. 2 % (18. 9 - 31. 5 %). This study supports the hypothesis that multiple, mildly penetrant, but highly prevalent genetic variants explain part of the variation of HDL-C plasma levels, albeit to a very modest extent.

40|$|Several {{data have}} shown that the neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule (NCAM) is necessary for long-term memory formation and might {{play a role in the}} structural reorganization of synapses. The NCAM, encoded by a single gene, is represented by several isoforms that differ with regard to their content of α- 2, 8 -linked sialic acid residues (PSA) on their extracellular domain. The carbohydrate PSA is known to promote plasticity, and PSA-NCAM isoforms remain expressed in the CA 3 region of the adult hippocampus. In the present study, we investigated the effect on spatial memory consolidation of a PSA gain of function by injecting a PSA mimetic peptide (termed pr 2) into the dorsal hippocampus. Mice were subjected to massed training in the spatial version of the water maze. Five hours after the last training session, experimental mice received an injection of pr 2, whereas control mice received PBS or reverse peptide injections in the hippocampal CA 3 region. Memory retention was tested at different time intervals: 24 h, 1 wk, and 4 wk. The results showed that the post-training infusion of pr 2 peptide significantly increases spatial performance whenever it was assessed after the training phase. By contrast, administration of the <b>control</b> <b>reverse</b> peptide did not affect retention performance. These findings provide evidence that (1) PSA-NCAM is involved in memory consolidation processes in the CA 3 hippocampal region, and (2) PSA mimetic peptides can facilitate the formation of long-term spatial memory when injected during the memory consolidation phase...|$|E
