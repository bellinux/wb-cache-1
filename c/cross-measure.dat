50|$|Two shafts were sunk {{through the}} Mynyddislwyn seam, {{down to the}} Rhas Las (English - Black Vein) and thence, by a <b>cross-measure,</b> to the lowest coal seam then known in the Caerphilly area, the Hard Vein, known later as the Lower Black Vein. The two shafts (North and South) were 768 and 802 yards deep {{respectively}} (more than twice the height from ground {{to the roof of}} the Empire State Building), both with a diameter of 21 ft. Due to its depth, Bedwas {{was one of the first}} collieries in South Wales to employ double-deck winding to improve efficiency.|$|E
50|$|At {{about this}} time, <b>cross-measure</b> drifts were also being driven {{down to the}} {{underlying}} Piper seam {{to the south of}} the pit-bottom and a new face was headed out. This face advanced below the earlier workings in the Deep Hard until it had reached a position beyond their final working point. Near to the pit-bottom, the Piper seam was separated from the Deep Hard by about 10yds but as the face moved out, the distance decreased until they were separated by only a short distance. At this point short drifts were driven up into the Deep Hard and new faces were then opened out back in this seam and within a short distance they were working a combined thickness of coal of about 2 - 2.5 m. Two other faces had been opened out closer to the pit-bottom in the Piper, but no further development took place in that seam except for a parallel one running back towards the pit-bottom.|$|E
50|$|Wilson Wood Colliery SD682721The first shafts were sunk in 1854 just as {{the railway}} came to Ingleton. The shafts passed through the Four Foot seam and below it the Six Foot seam at 130 yards. The seam dipped to the north at a slope of 1 in 4. A 135m <b>cross-measure</b> drift was dug {{horizontally}} {{to connect with the}} Four Foot seam in 1858. Both seams were worked. Wilsons Wood was troubled by water ingress. A serious flood in December 1865 was followed by closure in October 1866. The only other employment in Ingleton was at the cotton mill which had burnt down two years earlier and reopened after the Cotton Famine in 1867. Men from Wilsons Wood sought work in Barnsley. After a change of ownership, extra steam engines were bought. One from Coates Old Mill in Barnoldswick. Pumping out took seven months and 58 million gallons of water was removed while 480 gallon per second continued to flow in. The mine was reopened.|$|E
50|$|Following {{inspection}} of the deeper seams, {{it was decided to}} only work the Deep Hard coal at that point. A 1 in 2 <b>cross-measures</b> drift was driven from the Top Hard seam for ventilation purposes and the opening-out began. Three longwall faces in the 3 ft thick seam were commenced, but the ensuing recession appears to have made it uneconomic and production ceased in 1927, all output then being concentrated back in the Top Hard seam, the workings of which were now becoming quite extensive. By this time, most of the coal {{to the north of the}} river Meden had been worked out and production had shifted to the reserves to the south. By the late 1930s, however, these reserves were diminishing rapidly, and exploratory working began in the two underlying seams, the Dunsil and 1st Waterloo.|$|R

The rights passed to the New Ingleton Collieries Company which mined it as Old Pit. They sunk a new 22 yard deep 6 feet diameter shaft at Dolands to the Six Foot seam. In 1911 the company worked the Six Foot seam westward to a north-south fault. A <b>cross-measures</b> drift was dug northwards to intersect the Three Foot and Four Foot coals and between 1911 and 1914, 45 acres was worked.

30|$|Based on the {{simulation}} results, {{it is recommended}} that several goaf drainage methods, i.e. gas drainage with buried pipes in goaf, surface goaf gas drainage, and <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes, should be implemented to ensure the safe mining of the panel 1111 (1).|$|E
30|$|A roof roadway {{was driven}} {{outside of the}} mining panel to provide three interrelated gas control {{features}} and one ancillary feature. First, to improve the drainage from <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes, the roof roadway acted as an air return pathway for Y-type ventilation air from the working face. Second, the roof roadway allowed the construction of <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes to extract stress relief gas from the overlying 13 - 1 coal seam. Third, large-diameter horizontal boreholes could be drilled from the roadway to the gas-enrichment zone above the gob roof to drain gas from the gob area and control gas in the upper corner of the working face.

40|$|Initial {{cracking}} pressure and locations are important parameters in conducting <b>cross-measure</b> hydraulic fracturing to enhance coal seam permeability in underground coalmines, which are significantly influenced by in-situ stress and occurrence of coal seam. In this study, stress state around <b>cross-measure</b> fracturing boreholes was analyzed using in-situ stress coordinate transformation, then {{a mathematical model}} was developed to evaluate initial cracking parameters of borehole assuming the maximum tensile stress criterion. Subsequently, the influences of in-situ stress and occurrence of coal seams on initial {{cracking pressure}} and locations in underground coalmines were analyzed using the proposed model. Finally, the proposed model was verified with field test data. The {{results suggest that the}} initial cracking pressure increases with the depth cover and coal seam dip angle. However, it decreases with the increase in azimuth of major principle stress. The results also indicate that the initial cracking locations concentrated in the second and fourth quadrant in polar coordinate, and shifted direction to the strike of coal seam as coal seam dip angle and azimuth of maximum principle stress increase. Field investigation revealed consistent rule with the developed model that the initial cracking pressure increases with the coal seam dip angle. Therefore, the proposed mathematical model provides theoretical insight to analyze the initial cracking parameters during <b>cross-measure</b> hydraulic fracturing for underground coalmines...|$|E
30|$|To {{improve the}} {{drainage}} provided by <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes, a roof roadway was constructed {{outside of the}} panel. As shown in Fig.  4, the roadway was driven 20  m above the 11 - 2 coal seam and 35  m horizontally from the retained roadway. This roof roadway has three functions and one additional benefit. The functions are: (1) {{to serve as an}} air return path for Y-type ventilation from the working face; (2) to provide stations from which to drill <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes to extract stress relief gas from the 13 - 1 coal seam; and (3) to allow large-diameter horizontal boreholes to be drilled to the gas-enrichment zone above the gob roof to drain gas from the gob area and to control upper corner gas. The roadway has a fourth benefit in that the roof roadway can be reused as a high-level drainage roadway for the next phase of 11 - 2 coal seam panel mining.|$|E
30|$|The gas {{drainage}} rate reached 106.7  m 3 /min and averaged 59.5  m 3 /min {{with an average}} {{gas drainage}} ratio of 84.8  %. Surface wells drained 40.1  % of {{the total amount of}} gas, roof roadway boreholes drained 37.9  %, and the buried pipes accounted for the remaining 22.0  %. The effect of the <b>cross-measure</b> and horizontal boreholes was equivalent to that of surface wells, and holes drilled from the roof roadway could be an effective supplement for gas remediation.|$|E
40|$|When {{drilling}} coal-bearing sequences {{to enhance}} coal seam permeability by hydraulic fracturing (HF), the location where fractures are initiated is important. To date, most research on fracture initiation {{has studied the}} problem in two dimensions. In this study, a three-dimensional model to assess initiation location is developed. The model analyzes the stress state of both the borehole wall and the coal-rock interface and the model shows that the fracture initiation location is affected by in situ stress, the dip of the coal seam, and the angle between the borehole and the coal seam. How the initiation location changes near different types of geological faults is calculated by assuming typical in situ stresses for the faults. Following these calculations, physical experiments were carried out to emulate <b>cross-measure</b> hydraulic fracturing under stress conditions equivalent {{to those in the}} Chongqing Tonghua coal mine, China. Fracture initiation during the experiments was monitored by an acoustic emission system. The experimental results were consistent with the theoretical calculations. This implies that the three-dimensional model for assessing the locations of fracture initiation can be applied to forecast the initiation location of fractures generated by <b>cross-measure</b> drilling. The assessment model provides reference values for this type of drilling in underground mines...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cross-measure</b> {{borehole}} {{technique has}} been shown by the Bureau of Mines {{to be an effective}} method of controlling methane liberated by fracturing the roof strata in longwall gobs where overburden is less than 750 ft (229 m). Boreholes are drilled into roof strata before mining operations affect the roof strata. Longwall mining fractures the roof strata and releases methane from source beds. Surface exhausters or vacuum pumps are used to draw the gas to the surface through an underground pipeline and vertical exhaust hole. The captured methane is thus prevented from entering the mine's ventilation system. About 71 pct of the methane produced by longwall mining in the Lower Kittanning Coalbed was captured by the <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes. Borehole spacing is an important factor affecting the performance of the technique. Interference tests and measurements of methane flows in return air indicate borehole spacing in the Lower Kittanning Coalbed should be limited to about 200 ft (61 m) except on the first 600 ft (183 m) of the longwall, where spacing should be reduced to about 100 ft (30 m) to capture the large quantities of methane released when the first large roof fall occurs. Comparisons between measured and calculated gas pressure differentials on boreholes indicate borehole length can be reduced from 280 to 140 ft (85 to 43 m), which reduces drilling costs significantly. Additional experimentation is necessary to verify the calculations...|$|E
40|$|In China, the {{practice}} of multi-seam mining with high gas emission rates is common, and many coal mines are suffering from major gas management issues. To deal with these problems, empirical formulas for gas emission prediction and gas control methods suitable for site-specific conditions are developed.

In addition to ventilation, various gas control methods, including <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes, directional long-holes, dedicated roadways and surface goaf wells are used for gas drainage. Techniques for integrated extraction of coal and coal seam gas have been developed in these coal mines, resulting in significant economic and environmental benefits.

In the case {{that there is only one}} seam or no protective seam is available, a roadway needs to be special excavation in the roof of the seam and a large number of <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes need to be drilled from the roadway into the seam for gas drainage to ensure that the seam is extracted in the condition of low seam gas content.|$|E

Based on the simulation test, gas control measures were developed to manage gas issues in panel 1111 (1). These measures included mainly goaf gas drainage with buried pipes in the goaf, surface vertical wells, and <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes. The return air volume was 2290 – 2700  m 3 /min during gas drainage period. Gas concentration in return air was less than 0.6  %. Gas extraction rate in the working face was more than 60  %. The average gas extraction rate was 70  %. With these gas control measures, panel 1111 (1) was mined without encountering any gas-related safety issues. With stress relief mining of No. 11 - 2 coal seam, the protected area of No. 13 coal seam was extensively de-stressed and de-gassed.

40|$|CFD {{models have}} been {{developed}} to investigate the longwall goaf gas flow patterns under different mining and geological control conditions. The longwall goaf was treated as porous regions and gas flow was modelled as a momentum sink added to the momentum equation.

These CFD models were developed according to specific longwall layouts and calibrated against field monitoring data. Two case studies were presented demonstrating the application of CFD modelling of goaf gas flow characteristics for improved goaf gas capture and the reduction of oxygen ingress into the goaf areas for self-heating prevention. Results from the case studies indicate that the optimum goaf drainage strategy would be a combination of shallow (near the face) and deep holes to improve the overall drainage efficiency and gas purity.

30|$|In {{multiple}} seams mining, {{the seam}} with relatively low gas content (protective seam) is often extracted prior to mining its overlying and/or underlying seams of high gas content and low permeability {{to minimize the}} risk of high gas emission and outbursts of coal and gas. A key to success with this mining sequence is to gain a detailed understanding of the movement and fracture evolution of the overlying and underlying strata after the protective seam in extracted. In Zhuji mine, the No. 11 - 2 seam is extracted as a protective seam with the pillarless mining method by retaining goaf-side roadways prior to its overlying No. 13 - 1 seam. An investigation has been undertaken in the panel 1111 (1) of Zhuji mine to physically simulate the movement and fracture evolution of the overlying strata after the No. 11 - 2 seam is extracted. In the physical simulation, the displacement, strain, and deformation and failure process of the model for simulation were acquired with various means such as grating displacement meter, strain gauges, and digital photography. The simulation result shows that: (1) Initial caving interval of the immediate roof was 21.6  m, the first weighting interval was 23.5 – 37.3  m with the average interval of 33.5  m, and the periodic weighting interval of the main roof was in a range of 8.2 – 20.55  m and averaged at 15.2  m. (2) The maximum height of the caving zone after the extraction of No. 11 - 2 seam was 8.0  m, which was 4 times of the seam mining height and the internal strata of the caving zone collapsed irregularly. The mining-induced fractures developed 8 – 30  m above the mined No. 11 - 2 seam, which was 7.525 times of the seam mining height, the fracture zone was about 65 ° upward from the seam open-off cut toward the goaf, the height of longitudinal joint growth was 4 – 20 times of the mining seam height, and the height of lateral joint growth was 20 – 25 times of the mining seam height. (3) The “arch-in-arch” mechanical structure of the internal goaf was bounded by an expansion angle of broken strata in the lateral direction of the retained goaf-side roadway. The spatial and temporal evolution regularities of overburden’s displacement field and stress field, dynamic development process and distribution of fracture field were analyzed. Based on the simulation results, it is recommended that several goaf drainage methods, i.e. gas drainage with buried pipes in goaf, surface goaf gas drainage, and <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes, should be implemented to ensure the safe mining of the panel 1111 (1).|$|E
40|$|The {{regional}} {{variation of}} chemical and isotopic composition of coal gases has been investigated in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB), Czech Republic, and the Paraná Basin, Brazil. The field studies were complemented by laboratory experiments on selected samples to elucidate the effects of sorption/desorption processes on the chemical and isotopic composition of coal gases. Non-isothermal open system pyrolysis (Py-GC) {{was used to assess}} the gas generation potential and kinetics for the reconstruction of gas generation history in the study areas. The experimental results were integrated into a conceptual dynamic model of gas generation and storage in coal seams during structural and thermal basin evolution. Coal gases {{in the southern part of}} the USCB have a thermogenic isotope signature, while gases in the northern part have isotope signatures typical for microbial CO 2 reduction and mixed thermogenic/microbial origin. Chemical and isotopic compositions of gas samples from canister desorption of coal cores showed larger variations, but were generally in agreement with those of samples taken from <b>cross-measure</b> boreholes. Canister desorption did not cause any systematic isotope fractionation effects. Trends in geochemical composition of thermogenic gases suggest a contribution of gas from deeper parts underlying the Carpathian overthrust. Coals from the two principal coal-bearing sequences of the USCB (paralic Ostrava Fm. and limnic Karviná Fm.) are vitrinite-rich, of high- to low-volatile bituminous rank and have mostly reached the stage of gas generation and expulsion. Using mass balance calculations the volumes of gas generated up to this coalification stage were estimated at 201 m³ per ton of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) for methane and 138 m³/t TOC for carbon dioxide. Cumulative pyrolytic methane yields ranged between 52 and 79 m³/t TOC. Based on the reaction-kinetic parameters obtained from these tests thermogenic gas generation at a geologic heating rate of 10 - 11 K/min was predicted to reach a maximum between 208 and 246 °C. A 1 D basin model of the subsidence and thermal history of the study area indicated that major gas generation occurred at maximum burial between 319 and 285 Ma b. p. and that no significant methane generation was associated with reburial in the Miocene. Excess sorption isotherms (up to 27 MPa) for methane and carbon dioxide under different experimental conditions showed that gas sorption capacity is mainly controlled by pressure, moisture content and temperature, whereas organic matter content and maturity have a lesser impact. The average methane sorption capacity of USCB coals of 15 m³/t was significantly higher than the present-day gas contents in the study area (< 2 - 10 m³/t). Correlations between sorption capacity, coal rank and temperature were derived from sorption experiments and used in combination with geological pressure and temperature data. A static model assuming present-day pressure and temperature gradients predicts an increase in sorption capacity with increasing depth towards a maximum value between 600 and 1000 m, followed by a decrease due to increasing temperature. Results from 1 D burial history and temperature history modeling were integrated with experimental results to reconstruct the dynamic evolution of sorption capacity during basin history in relation to thermal gas generation. These computations revealed that the sorption capacity of the coals at maximum burial depth was significantly lower than estimated based on present-day pressure and temperature gradients. At the time of maximum gas generation, the amount of generated gas exceeded the sorption capacity of coals and the excess gas was expelled. Uplift started at the Carboniferous/Permian transition and the concomitant temperature decrease resulted in the presently observed under-saturation of the coal seams. From the end of the Permian uplift phase until present, coal seams of the Karviná formation were at temperatures below 80 °C and thus amenable to microbial methane generation. In contrast, temperatures of coal seams of the Ostrava formation were significantly higher in the post-uplift phase and microbial methane generation from these coals was unlikely. Coal from the Santa Terezinha coalfield in the southern Paraná Basin, Brazil had a significantly lower residual gas generation potential than USCB coals. Gas contents and average gas sorption capacities were also lower. Methane and carbon dioxide sorption capacities of coals and shales correlated with the TOC. For CO 2 the linear regression showed a non-zero intercept, indicating a significant sorption capacity of the mineral matter. The present-day gas content of coals from the Santa Terezinha coalfield amounts to 13 - 38 % of the methane sorption capacity. Assuming sorption capacities at reservoir conditions theoretically an amount of up to 15. 4 Gt CO 2 could be stored in the Santa Terezinha coal seams, if all methane were produced prior to CO 2 injection...|$|E
