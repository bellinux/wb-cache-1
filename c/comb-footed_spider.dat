5000|$|Anelosimus studiosus {{is part of}} the <b>comb-footed</b> <b>spider</b> family, Theridiidae, and can {{be found}} {{throughout}} much of North and South America, as it is a tropical and temperate spider. [...] A. studiosus exhibit social Polymorphism with two behavioral phenotypes; social spiders that live communally, and asocial solitary spiders. [...] Social spiders not only share the same living space, but also share in the duties of brood care and capturing of prey, [...] while asocial spiders live completely alone and will attack other female spiders that encroach its nesting territory. [...] Populations displaying the social phenotype, generally are not found below 30˚ latitude, and the social phenotype becomes increasingly common moving north. Studies suggest that the correlation between a higher frequency of social phenotypes and colder temperatures is due to decreased survival rates amongst mothers and delayed juvenile development in colder temperatures. [...] In other words, it is believed that sociality developed in A. studiosus in order to mitigate fitness costs for offspring should their mother die before the brood is ready to disperse and survive on their own. [...] Despite drastic differences in behavioral phenotypes, both social and asocial spiders readily interbreed and produce viable offspring. Research on the relatedness of the socially polymorphic spider, shows that social spiders in any given nest are more closely related genetically than asocial spiders. These findings suggest that social spiders have a lower dispersal distance than asocial spiders. Spiders that are more closely related genetically and display the social phenotype incur a fitness advantage by staying close to the nest and cooperating with their relatives [...] Although the emergence of a social phenotype may increase survival rates of offspring in the short term, research suggests it may cause long-term fitness consequences. Development of a social phenotype ultimately leads to a loss of aggression; meaning social spiders are less likely to fight off predators than their asocial counterparts. Social spiders can produce more young in a shorter period of time than asocial spiders, but when predators are introduced, nests of social spiders suffer high predation. This has been suggested to potentially lead to the extinction of large populations of A. studiosus.|$|E

50|$|Members of this genus {{resemble}} the <b>comb-footed</b> <b>spiders,</b> Theridiidae, {{due to their}} globular abdomen which is higher than it is long. The upper side of this bears one or two pairs of conical tubercles and some curved bristle-like hairs. The anterior medial eyes project on small tubercles. Leg 1 is nearly {{twice as long as}} leg 4. The egg sacks are very characteristic being elongated globes about four millimetres in diameter, suspended on a silken thread from vegetation. They are made from an inner layer of yellowish brown silk and an outer layer of dark coloured, loosely woven silk which gives the sack a woolly appearance. The sacks are not guarded by the female and when the juveniles hatch, so they have to fend for themselves. Since Ero species are nocturnal, the adults are not often seen and the egg sacks often reveal their presence before specimens are found.|$|R
5|$|Although the 'kātĕpo' was {{reported}} to the Linnean Society as early as 1855, the spider was formally described as Latrodectus katipo by L. Powell in 1870. Spiders of the genus Latrodectus have a worldwide distribution and include all of the commonly known widow spiders: the North American black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans), the brown widow (Latrodectus geometricus), and the European black widow (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus). The katipo's closest relative is the Australian redback spider (Latrodectus hasseltii) Latrodectus katipo and L. atritus (black katipo) were previously thought to be two separate species, but {{research has shown that}} they are a single species, L. katipo, with colour variation that is clinal over latitude and correlated with mean annual temperature. The katipo is so closely related to the redback that it was at one stage thought to be a subspecies, with the proposed name Latrodectus hasseltii katipo. Further research has shown that the katipo is distinct from the redback, having slight structural differences and striking differences in habitat preference, and it remains its own species. The katipo's family Theridiidae has a large number of species both in New Zealand and worldwide and are commonly known as tangle-web spiders, cobweb <b>spiders</b> or <b>comb-footed</b> <b>spiders.</b>|$|R
40|$|Understanding the web {{construction}} behaviour of theridiid (<b>comb-footed)</b> <b>spiders</b> {{is fundamental}} to formulating specific evolutionary hypotheses and predictions regarding the reduction of orb-webs. We describe {{for the first time}} in detail the web construction behaviour of Achaearanea tepidariorum, Latrodectus geometricus, Theridion sisyphium and T varians as well as webs of a range of other theridiids. In our survey we distinguish four major web types. Among webs with gumfooted lines, we distinguish between webs with a central retreat (Achaearanea-type) and those with a peripheral retreat (Latrodectus-type). Among webs without gumfooted lines, we distinguish between those which contain viscid silk (Theridion-type) and those with a sheet-like structure, which do not (Coleosoma-type). Theridiid gumfoot-webs consist of frame lines that anchor them to surroundings and support threads which possess viscid silk. Building of gumfooted lines constitutes a unique stereotyped behaviour and is most probably homologous for Nesticidae and Theridiidae. Webs remained in place for extended periods and were expanded and repaired, but no regular pattern of replacement was observed. We suggest that the cost of producing and maintaining viscid silk might have led to web reduction, at least in theridiids. (C) 2003 The Linnean Society of London...|$|R
