5|$|On February 10, 1798, Garrard's son William, still {{serving in}} the state senate, {{introduced}} a bill to hold another vote on <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> constitutional convention. In May 1798, 9,188 of the 16,388 votes {{were in favor of}} <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> convention. Again, almost 5,000 of the ballots contained no vote either way. On November 21, 1798, the House of Representatives voted 3615 in favor of a convention, and the Senate provided its requisite two-thirds majority days later. No official tally of the Senate's vote was published. The Assembly's vote rendered moot any doubts about the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} {{decided to let}} Newfoundlanders deliberate and choose their own future by <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> National Convention in 1946. Chaired by Judge Cyril J. Fox, it consisted of 45 elected members {{one of whom was}} the future first premier of Newfoundland, Joey Smallwood.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} title game was a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for Chris Webber <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> time-out that Michigan didn't have with seconds left. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77-71, giving Smith his second national championship {{due to an}} unforced error by the opposing team.|$|E

5000|$|Of his {{professional}} career in newspapers, LeDuff states: [...] "I’m not a journalist, I’m a reporter. The {{difference between a}} reporter and a journalist is that a journalist can type without looking. The problem with journalism is its self-importance. Like in the New York Times, there’s style guides; you can’t <b>call</b> <b>a</b> doctor a physician, you got to <b>call</b> him <b>a</b> doctor- too high falutin’. You can’t <b>call</b> <b>an</b> undertaker a mortician- too high falutin’; you got to <b>call</b> him <b>an</b> undertaker. You can’t <b>call</b> <b>a</b> lawyer an attorney, you have to <b>call</b> him <b>a</b> lawyer. But somehow, since we control it, and we’re very self-important people, you can <b>call</b> <b>a</b> reporter a journalist." ...|$|R
5|$|By <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> federal referendum, a {{group of}} {{citizens}} may challenge a law passed by parliament, if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law. Any 8 cantons together can also call a constitutional referendum on a federal law.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calling</b> <b>a</b> correct letter earns {{the value}} before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. <b>Calling</b> <b>a</b> correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} that he was {{prepared}} to follow the Lord's <b>calling.</b> <b>A</b> plan was drawn up in which Viret would be appointed to take temporary charge in Geneva for six months while Bucer and Calvin would visit the city to determine the next steps. The city council pressed for the immediate appointment of Calvin in Geneva. By mid-1541, Strasbourg decided to lend Calvin to Geneva for six months. Calvin returned on 13 September 1541 with an official escort and a wagon for his family.|$|E

5|$|Madison {{argued that}} a state, after declaring a federal law unconstitutional, could take action by {{communicating}} with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> constitutional convention. Madison did not assert that the states could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable. By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried {{to make clear that}} the Democratic-Republicans were not moving toward disunion.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's {{leadership}} of the Liberal Party was beset by poor opinion poll numbers. There was speculation that Turnbull would challenge Nelson for the leadership in late 2008; however, Nelson caught Turnbull by surprise by <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> snap spill of the party's leadership positions while Turnbull was returning from an overseas holiday. The spill was moved on 16 September 2008. Turnbull defeated Nelson by four votes, becoming {{the leader of the}} Liberal Party and of the Opposition Coalition between the Liberals and the National Party. Nelson later resigned from the House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|The war {{also caused}} a {{split in the}} British suffragette movement, with the mainstream, {{represented}} by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel's Women's Social and Political Union, <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> 'ceasefire' in their campaign {{for the duration of}} the war. In contrast, more radical suffragettes, like the Women's Suffrage Federation run by Emmeline's other daughter, Sylvia, continued their (at times violent) struggle. Women were also allowed to join the armed forces in a non-combatant role and by the end of the War 80,000 women had joined the armed forces in auxiliary roles such as nursing and cooking.|$|E

50|$|In Yorubaland, Nigeria the wrapper is common, <b>called</b> <b>an</b> iro in the Yoruba language, {{pronounced}} i-roh. The wrapper {{is usually}} worn {{with a matching}} headscarf or head tie that is <b>called</b> <b>a</b> gele in Yoruba, pronounced geh-leh. A full wrapper ensemble consists of three garments, <b>a</b> blouse, <b>called</b> <b>a</b> buba, pronounced boo-bah the iro and <b>a</b> headscarf <b>called</b> <b>a</b> head tie in English and a gele in Yoruba. Traditional male attire is <b>called</b> <b>a</b> agbada. A wrapper takes metres of quality fabric. White wrapper sets are worn during wedding ceremonies.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, Britain had around 30 million {{international}} <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> year, with 38 {{million by}} 1971. By 1975 {{when it was}} planned to open, Britain was expected to have around 70 million international <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> year. Mondial House on opening could connect around 23 million <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> year, and 200,000 <b>calls</b> <b>an</b> hour on 20,000 international lines. The exchange opened in 1980.|$|R
5|$|When the {{legislative}} session ended on March 28, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky and addressed {{the state legislature}} on April 2, 1861. He urged the General Assembly to push for federal adoption of the Crittenden Compromise and advocated <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> border states convention, which would draft a compromise proposal and submit it to the Northern and Southern states for adoption. Asserting that the states were coequal and free {{to choose their own}} course, he maintained that, if the border states convention failed, Kentucky should call a sovereignty convention and join the Confederacy as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|A NAC {{meeting was}} held outside Blantyre on 25 January. It was {{alleged that the}} meeting {{discussed}} in detail {{a plan for the}} overthrow of the territorial government and the massacre of the territory's whites and any blacks who collaborated with them. (although a subsequent Royal Commission found there was insufficient evidence to make such a claim). Welensky obtained the meeting's proceedings in early February and decided to act, <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> meeting of the federal and territorial governments. Federal troops were deployed to Nyasaland on 21 February, the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency on 3 March and the nationalist leaders were arrested and flown to jails in Southern Rhodesia. In the subsequent fortnight, riots broke out and troops used force to end the violence. Almost 50 people died in the unrest.|$|E
5|$|Boyle {{sponsored}} a motion of non-confidence against the government. Despite enjoying {{the support of}} twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence did not show {{a conflict of interest}} on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier. A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge was {{appointed}} as the state's attorney general soon after arriving. In November 1797, he resigned and {{was elected to}} the Kentucky House of Representatives the next month. As a legislator, he secured passage of a more humane criminal code that abolished the death penalty for all offenses except first-degree murder. On a 1798 trip to Virginia, an intermediary gave him Thomas Jefferson's Kentucky Resolutions, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts. At Jefferson's request, Breckinridge assumed credit for the modified resolutions he shepherded through the Kentucky General Assembly; Jefferson's authorship was not discovered until after Breckinridge's death. He opposed <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> state constitutional convention in 1799 but was elected as a delegate. Due to his influence, the state's government remained comparatively aristocratic, maintaining protections for slavery and limiting the power of the electorate. Called the father of the resultant constitution, he emerged from the convention as the acknowledged leader of the state's Democratic-Republican Party and was selected Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1799 and 1800.|$|E
5|$|<b>Calling</b> <b>a</b> {{constitutional}} convention {{required the}} approval {{of a majority of}} voters in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of the General Assembly. In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt {{in the minds of many}} legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. When all of the irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{were around}} 2,000, {{as the men}} were {{subjected}} to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from the beach was possible only via five heavily defended gullies, and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started {{to run out of}} ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the gullies of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by D+3.|$|E

5|$|Chandler feared Laffoon, who {{controlled}} the State Democratic Central Committee, {{would attempt to}} hand-select the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> nominating convention instead of holding a primary election, and he used a bold move to circumvent Laffoon's ability to carry out such an action. Under the Kentucky Constitution, Chandler became acting governor any time Laffoon left the state. When Laffoon traveled to meet with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, D. C. on February 6, 1935, Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill requiring that each party's gubernatorial candidates be chosen by a primary rather than a nominating convention. Laffoon returned to the state {{the next day and}} challenged Chandler's authority to make the call, but Chandler's actions were validated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on February 26.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{followed}} up her {{success in the}} 1985 special session with a push for more higher education funding in the 1986 legislative session. Lawmakers obliged by approving an additional $100million for {{higher education in the}} biennial budget. They also approved implementation of a pilot preschool program and the purchase of new reading textbooks, but failed to act on Collins' request for an additional $3.9million to improve the state's vocational education system. Legislators approved <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> referendum on a constitutional amendment– supported by Collins– to make the state superintendent of education an appointive, rather than elective, office. The amendment was defeated by the state's voters in November 1986, despite a Collins-led campaign in favor of it. The increased corporate tax intended {{to cover the cost of}} the increased education budget was, however, inadequate. In 1987, a plan to increase revenue through changes in the state income tax was abandoned when Wallace Wilkinson, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who would go on to succeed Collins, announced his opposition to it.|$|E
5|$|Government {{meetings}} are public; however, {{the government may}} decide to close any part of its sessions (or entire sessions) to the public. The prime minister may authorise any deputy to represent the PM and otherwise take over any particular task assigned to the PM. The quorum for government sessions is a majority of government members. Most decisions are reached by a simple majority vote; a two-thirds majority vote is required for decisions about changes to the Croatian Constitution, uniting with other states or transferring any part of Croatian sovereignty to supranational organisations, changes to Croatian borders, dissolution of the parliament, or <b>calling</b> <b>a</b> referendum.|$|E
