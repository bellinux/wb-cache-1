40|$|Background: In June 2010 the Australian Health Practitioner Agency unified the {{national}} registration of health professionals in Australia and introduced a separate register for midwives. Standard registration renewal requirements aimed to provide safe, competent practitioners. These new conditions created {{the impetus for}} practitioners to consider how they meet the re-registration standards for either their nurse or midwifery register/s. Question: How are midwives responding to the changed re-registration <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> renewal? Methods: Longitudinal case study design. A purposive sample of 24 midwives from five states was recruited. 20 took part in individual interviews over two re-registration periods. 4 midwives were interviewed in a focus group to verify the findings. Findings: Three themes captured issues and tensions about registration and midwifery practice. They are Rotation, Restriction and Extension. Conclusion:This paper has shown how the re-registration conditions and standards post 2010 have generated discourse around registration renewal. The simultaneous introduction of regulatory and legislative changes {{has resulted in the}} construction of categories within contemporary midwifery practice that do not necessarily align with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) requirements for re-registration. Further research is recommended to examine the continuing influence and impact of the changes on the Australian midwifery workforce...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{maritime}} norm, the {{nationality of ship}} is authorized with the registration of ship by the state concerned, and the ship registered is allowed to fly {{the flag of the}} state. The Japanese legislation for the registration of ship requires that the nationality of the ship shall be genuinely linked with the nationality of owner(s) of the ship, and does not allow a bareboat chartered-out vessel to the foreign state to temporarily terminate the registration of the ship in Japan. Under the regime of EEZ, many Japanese far seas fishing vessels(FSFVs) were decommissioned or forced to transfer of ownership to the coastal state if they wanted continuation of fishing operation in the EEZ of coastal states concerned, which led drastic reduction of Japanese FSFVs. The UN Convention of the Law of the Sea(1982) which stipulates the status of ships in Article 92 does not regulate the linkage between nationality and ownership of ship, and the United Nations Convention on <b>Conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>Registration</b> of Ships(1986), while not in force, clearly recognizes the case of registration of the bareboat chartered-in ship. Some States(Canada, New Zealand, England, etc.) allow the bareboat chartered-in vessel to register it with their registration of ship. As the shortterm bareboat chartered-out would be one of breakthroughs for the plight of Japanese FSFVs loosing opportunity in the high seas, it is keenly requested that Japanese policy of ship registration allows temporary termination of the registration of Japanese ship for bareboat chartered-out...|$|E
40|$|For {{electrophotographic}} printers, periodic clustered screens are preferable due {{to their}} homogeneous halftone texture, robustness to dot gain, and increased dot stability. In traditional periodic clustered-dot color halftoning, to avoid the complete dot-on-dot printing, each color plane is independently rendered with a different screen at a different angle. However, depending on the screen angle and frequency, the final halftone may have strong visible moire due to {{the interaction of the}} periodic structure. Additionally, the slight displacement between each color plane may cause significant color shifts in the final halftone. This thesis addresses issues on finding optimal color screen sets which produce the minimal visible moire and are also robust to registration errors. To achieve these goals, this thesis proposes new techniques including common periodicity, halftone microtexture spectrum, and registration sensitivity analysis. The common periodicity of two different periodic screens characterizes the structural patterns of the mixed colors. In particular, large common periodic patterns are found to inherently produce dot-on-dot patterns with good robustness against registration errors. The halftone microtexture spectrum method is shown to predict the visible moire more accurately than the conventional moire-free conditions. In our registration sensitivity analysis, three propositions are established using the periodicity of periodic screens. From the established propositions, we derive the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> insensitivity. Our results demonstrate significant improvements of clustered-dot screens in terms of the resilience against registration errors and minimizing the visible moire over the conventional periodic screens. ...|$|E

40|$|Corn {{depredation}} by red·winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) {{has been}} an agricultural problem in southwestern Ontario for many years. Large marsh areas along the shoreline of Lakes Erie and St. Clair provide ideal habitat for breeding and roosting. Concurrently, the vast monocultural field corn acreages in Kent and Essex Counties have over the years been the centers for blackbird depredation in the province. The expansion of corn production into other areas of Ontario has, however, resulted in a province·wide distribution of damage, and substantial crop losses for specific individual farmers (Tyler and Kannenberg, 1980). The Ontario Ministry of the Environment (OME) provided funding for a four·year research program on the importance, ecology and control of blackbirds in 1976 following mounting concern by Ontario corn producers. Dyer (1968) completed a major study on red-winged blackbirds in Dover Township, Kent County during the period 1964 - 68; however, the evaluation of 4 -AP efficacy was a minor component of the project (Dyer, 1976). Thus, the OME required efficacy data on 4 -AP for current Ontario <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> purposes, regardless of the 1972 registration in the U. S. A. Methiocarb (3, 5 -dimethyl- 4 (methylthio) phenol methylcarbamate) (Mesurol®, Mobay Chemical Corp.) was also a candidate compound because of the known taste aversion properties (Rcigers, 1974; Crase and Dehaven, 1976). Again, the OME required data on the efficacy of methiocarb as a bird repellent in ripening field corn. Research on the potential for lethal roost control was an initial objective; however, this component of chemical control was not pursued. Conversely, lethal control at foraging sites was not an initial objective, however, ecological studies completed (Somers et aI., 1981 b) suggested {{that the use of}} toxicants in a corn field may have potential. Pilot studies using Starlicide® (Ralston-Purina Co.) and a-chloralose at foraging sites were completed to evaluate this hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|In a {{recently}} published official Report from the Swedish Government (SOU 2010 : 73) a leg- islative proposal has been introduced. Its main {{purpose is to}} prevent parallel registrations of ships that are bareboat chartered to other countries. The legislative proposal claims that by preventing parallel registration of ships the Swedish Maritime Code will better corre- spond with the UN convention {{on the law of}} the sea. The UN convention on {{the law of the sea}} clearly states that ships are forbidden to fly two flags. There is however no restriction concerning parallel registration, simultaneously, in two registers. A ship that is bareboat chartered out from Sweden does not fulfil criteria re- quired in order to be deregistered, according to the Swedish maritime code. In matter of fact ownership remains unchanged in a bareboat procedure. The situation leads to parallel registration, and uncertainty can arise regarding which country has full state control over the ship. This may cause problems, and should be dealt with. There are however more ap- propriate ways of dealing with the issue rather than prohibiting parallel registration, and that are compatible with the UN convention on the law of the sea. By allowing bareboat registration according to the UN convention on conditions for regis- tration of ships, the issue of which country has full state control over the ship is resolved, and assures that the ship sails under only on states flag. Sweden has held a passive position regarding the issue of parallel registration of ships and a legislative change is necessary, mainly because parallel registration, as it is currently con- ducted in Sweden today, is in conflict with the UN convention on the law of the sea, but also because it leads to uncertainty concerning which country has full state control over the ship. However, a prohibition against parallel registration is not compatible with the rest of EU, where the majority has chosen to permit parallel registration. Bareboat registration ac- cording to the UN convention on <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> of ships is not in conflict with the UN convention on the law of the sea and should therefore be permitted in Sweden...|$|E
40|$|Sustainability {{has become}} a {{pervasive}} influence and seemingly ubiquitous presence within higher education programmes. The scale of anthropogenic impacts on the Earth’s life systems, the compelling evidence of a rapidly changing climate, international directives concerning the pursuit of sustainable development, and stringent legislative requirements, have all contributed to the acknowledgement that education at both preand post-professional levels has a significant {{role to play in}} addressing these challenges. As a key contributor to global emissions and wider environmental issues, it is widely recognised that architecture and other built environment disciplines must act appropriately and decisively. In response, educators, students, and practitioners have understandably been charged with significant responsibility to engage fully with the sustainability agenda, although there are numerous pedagogical, regulatory, and professional barriers that must be overcome. This white paper on “Criteria for Professional Qualification” represents a comprehensive synthesis of the activities performed by the EDUCATE (Environmental Design in University Curricula and Architectural Training in Europe) project from 2009 to 2012. In so doing, it draws largely from key previously published documents that include the following:  State of the Art of Environmental Sustainability in Academic Curricula and <b>Conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>Registration</b> (2010)  State of the Art of Environmental Sustainability in Professional Practice (2010)  Benchmarking of Professional Needs (2011)  Framework for Curriculum Development (2011)  Results of Course and Curriculum Development (2012) These documents are all available for download from [URL] The paper presented here proposes principles and strategies - illustrated in terms of requirements of the building market, models of progression towards professional qualification, regulatory framework, and priorities for sustainable design practice - to measure and verify the knowledge, skill and competence of sustainable environmental design that is expected of graduates and practitioners at every level of their academic education and professional training and within the practice of architecture and urban design. Founded on the 11 principles of Article 46 - Training of Architects of the European Directive 2005 / 36 on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications in Europe, this paper takes a propositive approach to current legislation and initiatives promoted by professional and regulatory bodies with the aim of defining strategies to promote consistency in the requirements for qualification at an international level and moving closer to the goal of embracing environmental sustainability within the design of the built environment...|$|E

Methods: Ethical approval was provided for a longitudinal case study of midwives across the two initial annual registration renewal cycles following the changes. Data were collected in 2, individual interviews conducted with a purposive sample of twenty midwives drawn from four Australian states. A focus group of four midwives from a fifth state was used to corroborate the preliminary findings which were generated using a thematic analysis procedure. Findings: Findings revealed constructions of a dichotomy of identities between practice roles. These identities exemplified specific practice activities, places and roles to illustrate how competence <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> renewal could be validated. The picture of complexities around practice, roles, and midwifery professional identity influenced midwives’ decision-making around registration renewal processes. Implications: The midwives’ decisions following the changes have had potential significance for individual practitioners, the midwifery profession and maternity services in Australia more generally. The revealed perceptions of identity pose potential implications on the future workforce and direction of maternity services in Australia...|$|R

The knowledge, gained from direct experience in the environment, is extended and deepened in the classroom. In this thesis we compare education between school systems in Slovenia and African Uganda. We compare their education, curriculum, learning about the environment through the usage of practical experience, learning and observation in the classroom. We try to find the fields/points of Slovenian and Ugandan education systems that are similar (even the same), we explore what their schooling conditions are, what are their rights in choosing types of education, how they organize lessons and study groups. What is more, we want to know in what kind of school district children are growing up and how the lessons are adapted for children with special and different needs. Numerous children travel around the world with their parents and are sent to study in foreign local schools. Usually, their stay in a new environment lasts no longer than one or two years. Teaching techniques are impacted by a culture in everyday environment, material conditions, methods of work with children, urbanity of the environment and ultimately even religious beliefs. This thesis tries to give us useful information which has helped us to analyze and compare the education between Slovenian and Ugandan school system. Information was collected during the author’s attendance at lectures as an occasional student, leadership workshops, teaching small groups and working with teachers. Our findings shows us that the main differences between the systems are in teaching, formation of the classes, payment of the school fees, in the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> in schools as well as the fact that the school year in Uganda starts in February. We can find some similarities and differences in the curriculum. Slovenian curriculum specifies the amount of hours for the specific subject. Ugandan curriculum has only a fixed lower limit of amount of hours per week or year. We have found the similarities in the contents of the curriculum; the themes are the same, the only difference {{is the name of the}} school subject in Uganda and in Slovenia. We could say that the usage of Slovenian methods in Ugandan educational system would be possible only in classes with fewer pupils. The successful implementation of lessons that took place in a support group of pupils with learning difficulties inspired a teacher and motivated him for creative work outside the classroom walls. In conclusion, some students need much more than just two months of learning to use the skills and methods, which they have learned, in the classroom. We could say that some progress would be possible if the number of students in classes was lower. This is, due to the problem of overpopulation in Uganda, impossible. The aim of our techniques was achieving autonomy and independence of the students. The additional goal was the students’ ability to transfer the acquired knowledge from one subject to another. ...|$|E
40|$|Social {{sciences}} {{should always}} aim {{to reach the}} highest possible level of exactness, {{as much as they}} can when one has in mind their topic of research. In the case of research about political parties, we believe that it is possible - with relatively exract indicators - to establish their successfulness and quantify it by using two measuring instruments: the ten-member graphic scale of successfulness of political parties and the index of successfulness of political parties. Political parties are political organizations of ideological-political like(similar) -minded persons who create associations lasting relatively long period of time to promote specific programme standpoints with the basic goal to win, that is stay in power or participate in power. Through power, they realize and confirm the interests, values and goals of those social groups which they tend to represent, as a rule trying to present these interests, values and goals as general, that is as global as possible. This definition of the notion of political party clearly indicates that its basic goal is winning, that is staying or at least participating in power. Therefore, to measure the successfulness of political parties means to determine the degree a party succeeded in realizing that basic goal of any party. Since the political power is implemented through the parliament and the government is a product of the power relations in it, one could assume that successful political parties are only those which have a parliamentary status. How much one of them would be successful depends on the position it can ensure for itself in a concrete constellation of political relations. Among the successful ones the least successful is the political party which has a parliamentary status but it is in the opposition and not leading this opposition - so it has no influence on the government (the position 6 on the scale); the most successful party is the one which has enough power to form the government alone (position 10). From the standpoint of any party - winning, staying or participating in power, the nonparliamentary parties are unsuccessful political parties. Amnog them, the most unsuccessful is the party which just satisfied the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration,</b> whose leaders meet twice a year and which formed at least 5 local leadership bodies (the position 1 on the scale); the least unsuccessful political party is the party which won more than 3 % of the votes of those who voted at the parliamentary elections, but is below the census proposed for entering the parliament or which managed to nominate at least 10 % of the total number of the candidates for the representatives in the assemblies of the local communities at the municipal rank (position 5). While calculating the index of successfulness, each party is given a number of points for every year - these points reflect the position of that party on the scale of successfulness for that year (for example, the party X has the position 5 in 1993 and it gets 5 points). Since the index of successfulness is calculated for the period of 10 years, the sum of points acquired for these 10 years is divided by the number 10 to get the index of successfulness of political parties...|$|E
40|$|In {{the market}} today, {{there is a}} great need of {{trademark}} protection for packaging, since design is important and valuable for manufacturers to distinguish their goods. It is, however, not easy to obtain such trademark protection. The purpose behind my master thesis is to examine how a packaging should be designed to obtain trademark registration in Sweden and in the EC. My starting point is SCA Hygiene’s egg-shaped plastic packaging for panty liners (the egg). The egg was refused registration by PRV due to lack of distinctiveness but was allowed registration as an EC trademark by OHIM. The question I have asked myself is why the assessment of distinctiveness differs between Sweden and the EC although Sweden has changed its law after the EC directive on harmonisation of the member states´ trademark law. To answer the question, in my thesis I have examined the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> stated in the EC directive {{as well as in the}} Swedish law and how courts and authorities have interpreted them. My intention is that the thesis shall be suitable for using as guidance for companies wanting to protect packaging with the help of intellectual property laws and especially the Trademark Act. The guidelines can be used both when wanting to design a packaging, to make it possible to register it as trademark as well as to assess whether an already existing packaging is possible to register. To decide whether a packaging is possible to register the first step is to determine whether it is possible to reproduce graphically. The next step is to decide whether it is distinctive. The authorities and courts assess distinctiveness first in relation to the goods for which registration has been requested and secondly in the relation to the perception of the public. Therefore the relevant market for the goods must be analysed as well as what competitors’ packaging look like. It is also necessary to consider who the product is directed towards. Finally the packaging itself must be studied to assess whether it is only an ordinary fundamental form or if it has any special elements and the total impression of it. The packaging cannot be banal to obtain protection. The last thing to examine before an application for trademark registration is whether the exceptions in CTMR Article 7 (1) (e) are applicable. However, I have not found any cases where trademark applications have been refused because of these exceptions. I have noticed a tendency that it is easier to obtain trademark protection for packaging in the EC. However, the examiners both in PRV and in OHIM use almost the same principles and follow the case law from ECJ and CFI. The differences in assessing distinctiveness are probably because the examiners are different persons with different opinions and experience. I have reached the purpose behind my thesis through studying literature; books and articles as well as studying case law from PRV, PBR, RegR, OHIM, the Court of First Instance and the ECJ. To obtain a practical view and see whether my conclusions are true in practice, I have made two interviews...|$|E

40|$|In the {{cervical}} cancer cases registered at the Cancer Hospital at Barshi, India during 1988 - 90, 99 of the 105 cases were clinically staged (Total {{number of cases}} registered: 136). The annual number of cases were too few for a comparison of stage distribution between the registry years. However, comparison of the proportions of early cases (FIGO Ib, IIa & IIb) in each year, with the corresponding proportion in a large series at the Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) in Bombay in 1988, showed that the proportions of early cases in 1988 & 1989 (0. 31 and 0. 35 respectively) were similar to that (0. 30) in TMH but in 1990, it (0. 50) was significantly higher (P < 0. 01). The shift to early stages observed {{three years after the}} inception of the Registry is most likely due to the registry activity which involved inter-personal contact with the community and motivation of the symptomatics to undergo a medical investigation. These activities were designed to overcome the adverse <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> cancer <b>registration</b> prevailing in the rural population. It is suggested that to achieve early diagnosis similar activities be incorporated in the initial phase of a {{cervical cancer}} control programme in the country, where cervical cancer is not only the predominant cancer in women but also the cases generally present themselves in advanced stages...|$|R

40|$|The establishments of {{the digital}} {{cadastral}} register and cadastral map are completed. The importance {{of the use of}} the cadastre to support land management has steadily increased over the last 20 years. Today the cadastral identification has become an important component for managing a number of environmental and financial acts. Furthermore, it is accepted that when cadastral information is part of integrated information systems, it can improve the efficiency of the land transfer process as well the overall land management process. To support the overall land management process, the cadastre is extended with a number of restrictions pertaining to public law. The advantages of having restrictions pertaining to public law in the cadastre have been recognized as the most safe and simple way to register when many properties are involved. Three new restrictions pertaining to public law are in the process being included in the cadastre, namely coastal zoning, windfall and soil contamination. These restrictions are described with regard to <b>conditions</b> and objectives <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> in the cadastre. The advantages of having the restrictions in the cadastre as well as the procedures for data capturing are addressed in this paper. CONTAC...|$|R
