40|$|In a {{pilot study}} for the Environmental Inspectorate of the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM), the RIVM {{investigated}} the usefulness {{and the necessity of}} a mobile laboratory as a facility to be located at different locations in the Netherlands for enforcing the national and international legislation on the transport of waste products. The main target for the Inspectorate and other co-operating supervising authorities during monitoring actions is to study the type of (suspected) waste product and the chemical composition of this product. This study was carried out in co-operation with the National Forensic Institute and the <b>Customs</b> <b>Laboratory</b> from 1 June 2001 to 30 April 2002. The RIVM co-operated with these institutes in four projects, i. e. TC 2001, SWITCH, ZOM and TC 2002.

40|$|The {{latest version}} of liquid {{chromatography}} is ultra-high performance (or pressure) chromatography (UHPLC). In the technique, short and narrow-bore columns with particle sizes below 3 µm are used. The extremely high pressure used results in very short analysis times, excellent separation, and good resolution. This makes UHPLC {{a good choice for}} steroidal analysis. Steroids are a highly interesting area of study; they can be recognized as biomarkers for several diseases and are a relevant topic in doping testing. In this thesis articles on the topic ‘steroid analysis with UHPLC’, published prior to April 2017, are reviewed. UHPLC is always combined with mass spectrometry (MS) for steroid analysis. The MS utilized is usually of multi-dimension: quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) or triple quadrupole (QqQ). The instrumentation is suitable for both untargeted and targeted analysis. In untargeted studies, the study of changes in the human metabolome has been especially interesting. The articles on targeted studies are usually focused on doping control and quantification of identified biomarkers. The analysis with UHPLC-MS/MS usually provide reliable results with fast analysis time, without complicated sample preparation. Typically, the sample preparation processes can include only protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction. UHPLC is also a valuable tool in simple and routine analysis. The separation efficiency is increased by the small plate height and the analysis time can thus be reduced. In this thesis work the technique was utilized for the analysis of food additives. For validation of an UHPLC method the repeatability, trueness, bias, measurement uncertainty and other factors need to be assessed. The experimental part of the thesis is dedicated to describe the development and validation of a method for analysis of five food additives and caffeine. The developed method was partly validated, with the aim to fulfil the needs of the Finnish <b>Customs</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> The optimized method comprised of an injection volume of 2 µL and a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min. The buffer was a phosphate buffer at pH of 4. 0 and the gradient elution program was from 6 % to 30 % of acetonitrile in 1. 6 minutes, then 1. 6 - 1. 7 minutes with 6 % acetonitrile. The total run time was only 1. 7 minutes. The limit of detection values was between 0. 02 µg/mL and 1. 73 µg/mL. The limit of quantitation values was between 0. 054 µg/mL to 5. 78 µg/mL, which should be sufficient for the Customs needs in the sense of checking if a product is over a certain limit.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the ACAP working group (composed of JRC, TAXUD and 11 Member States <b>Custom</b> <b>Laboratories)</b> was to provide {{scientific}} support for {{the resolution of the}} issue of divergent classifications of alcoholic beverages for excise duties, whether by providing objective criteria for classification, or providing sound scientific information for revision of legislation. In particular, {{there is a need for}} analytical methods allowing for the differentiation between "fermented" and "distilled" ("non-fermented") beverages and for the detection of ethanol addition. At present there is no commonly agreed solution of these problems which has resulted in the <b>Customs</b> <b>Laboratories</b> of the Member States developing their own particular approaches to deal with these issues. This can lead to divergent classification between Member States and consequent problems both for administrations and the trade. Two complementary pathways of investigation have been examined in this study: NMR fingerprinting and "classical analysis", both handled by multivariate data analysis. It is the findings of this study that it is likely to be extremely difficult or even impossible to create workable ¿general¿ models based on analytical methods. Unfortunately, the difficulties are the greatest precisely with those categories that are the most problematic for excise classification purposes. Even if an analytical model was eventually developed it is likely to need to be an extremely complex mechanism in order to take account of the broad range of beverages, and diverse chemical characteristics, of products that fall within the problem categories ("other fermented beverages" etc.). On the issue of 'added alcohol' the findings reinforce that is not plausible to ascertain the amounts by a scientific study of the finished product only. The case-to-case approach to classification applied by Member States remains therefore the only possible approach in the context of the current legislation. JRC.

40|$|A <b>custom</b> <b>laboratory</b> {{electronic}} timer circuit measures the durations of successive cycles of nominally highly stable input clock signals {{in as many}} as eight channels, for the purpose of statistically quantifying the small instabilities of these signals. The measurement data generated by this timer are sent to a personal computer running software that integrates the measurements to form a phase residual for each channel and uses the phase residuals to compute Allan variances for each channel. (The Allan variance is a standard statistical measure of instability of a clock signal.) Like other laboratory clock-cycle-measuring circuits, this timer utilizes an externally generated reference clock signal having a known frequency (100 MHz) much higher than the frequencies of the input clock signals (between 100 and 120 Hz). It counts the number of reference-clock cycles that occur between successive rising edges of each input clock signal of interest, thereby affording a measurement of the input clock-signal period to within the duration (10 ns) of one reference clock cycle. Unlike typical prior laboratory clock-cycle-measuring circuits, this timer does not skip some cycles of the input clock signals. The non-cycle-skipping feature is an important advantage because in applications that involve integration of measurements over long times for characterizing nominally highly stable clock signals, skipping cycles can degrade accuracy. The timer includes a field-programmable gate array that functions as a 20 -bit counter running at the reference clock rate of 100 MHz. The timer also includes eight 20 -bit latching circuits - one for each channel - at the output terminals of the counter. Each transition of an input signal from low to high causes the corresponding latching circuit to latch the count at that instant. Each such transition also sets a status flip-flop circuit to indicate the presence of the latched count. A microcontroller reads the values of all eight status flipflops and then reads the latched count for each channel for which the flip-flop indicates the presence of a count. Reading the count for each channel automatically causes the flipflop of that channel to be reset. The microcontroller places the counts in time order, identifies the channel number for each count, and transmits these data to the personal computer...|$|R
40|$|The International Measurement Evaluation Programme (IMEP®) is an Interlaboratory Comparison {{scheme in}} support of EU {{policies}} (e. g.

It is founded, owned and co-ordinated by the IRMM, the European Commission¿s Joint Research Centre for Reference Materials and Measurements. The aim of this interlaboratory comparison programme is to picture objectively the degree of equivalence {{and the quality of}} chemical measurements. Contrary to most other external quality assessment schemes, participating laboratories in IMEP® can compare their measurement results and uncertainty statements with external certified reference values, obtained completely independent from the participants¿ result. These reference values are required to demonstrate traceability and they should have a demonstrated and adequately small uncertainty, as evaluated according to international guidelines. Participants in IMEP® use their routine analytical procedures to measure the IMEP-certified test sample (CTS). Therefore they can assess the quality of their results on an international forum by comparing their values to the IMEP-reference values.

These approaches have been tested in the laboratory of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the efficiency of the proposed approach has been successfully demonstrated on several study cases. The report gives an overview of the analytical strategies and modern laboratory techniques needed to perform a fast unambiguous identification and characterisation of unknown organic chemical substances such as New Psychoactive Substances (NPS).

40|$|We present in-line coating {{thickness}} measurements acquired simultaneously using two independent sensing modalities: terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI) and {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT). Both techniques are sufficiently fast to resolve the {{coating thickness}} of individual pharmaceutical tablets in-situ during the film coating operation and both techniques are direct structural imaging techniques {{that do not require}} multivariate calibration. The TPI sensor is suitable to measure coatings greater than 50 μm and can penetrate through thick coatings even in the presence of pigments over a wide range of excipients. Due to the long wavelength, terahertz radiation is not affected by scattering from dust within the coater. In contrast, OCT can resolve coating layers as thin as 20 μm and is capable of measuring the intra-tablet coating uniformity as well as the inter-tablet coating thickness distribution within the coating pan. ¬-However, the OCT technique is less robust {{when it comes to the}} compatibility with excipients, dust and potentially the maximum coating thickness that can be resolved. Using a <b>custom</b> built <b>laboratory</b> scale coating unit, the coating thickness measurements were acquired independently by the TPI and OCT sensors throughout a film coating operation. Results of the in-line TPI and OCT measurements were compared against one another and validated with off-line TPI and weight gain measurements. Compared to other process analytical technology (PAT) sensors, such as near-infrared and Raman spectroscopy, the TPI/OCT sensors can resolve the inter-tablet thickness distribution based on sampling a significant fraction of the tablet populations in the process. By combining two complementary sensing modalities it was possible to seamlessly monitor the coating process over the range of film thickness from 20 μm to greater than 250 μm.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the studies on the Cooperative Teleoperation Systems. The {{literature}} on cooperative teleoperation did {{not take into account}} control architectures composed of pairs of wave-based bilateral teleoperators operating in a shared environment. In this work The author two cooperative control schemes based on wave variables by considering two pairs of single-master/single-slave devices collaborating to carry out operations in a shared remote environment are proposed. Such architectures have been validated both with simulations and experimental tests. Ch. 2 introduces a description of the two control architectures proposed and presents some simulation results where the cooperative teleoperation systems evolve in free space and in contact with a stiff wall. In the Ch. 3 some experimental results which confirm the positive results of the control schemes are illustred. Such results have been achieved by using a prototype <b>custom</b> built at <b>Laboratory</b> of Automaiton and Robotics of University of Bologna, which is also illustrated in this chapter. In Ch. 4 the problem of defining proper tools and procedures for an analysis, and possibly a comparison, of the performances of cooperative teleoperation systems is addressed. In particular, a novel generalization of criteria adopted for classical (i. e. one master-one slave) teleoperators is presented and illustrated {{on the basis of the}} force-position and the position-position cooperative control schemes proposed in Ch. 2, both from a transparency and stability point of view, and by assuming a null time delay in the communication channel. ...|$|R
40|$|Two field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} using a <b>custom</b> built flow-through <b>laboratory</b> to test the effect of elevated pH on dreissenid musselsas a potential control method. Both experiments tested the ability of dreissenid pediveligers to settle under conditions of elevated pH and thelong-term survival of adult dreissenids under the same conditions. The two experimental sites had different water quality and differentspecies of dreissenids present. The settlement of quagga mussel pediveligers at the lower Colorado River was inhibited with increasing pH. At the maximum achieved pH of 9. 1, there was approximately 90 % reduction compared to the maximum settlement observed in the controls. Since the settlement was almost as low in pH 8. 9 as at pH 9. 1, the inhibition in settlement {{may have been due}} to the presence of a precipitateformed under high pH conditions rather than the increase in background pH. No mortality of quagga mussel adults was observed in theexperimental pH levels at the lower Colorado River. At San Justo Reservoir, zebra mussel settlement decreased with increasing pH. Newsettlement was almost entirely absent at the highest pH tested (pH 9. 6). The observed mortality of adult zebra mussels was low, but did tendto increase with increasing pH. We also tested the response of adult zebra mussels to short-term exposure to very high pH levels (i. e. pH 10, 11, and 12). Adult mussels in poor physical condition experienced 90 % mortality after 12 hours at pH 12. For unstressed adult zebra mussels, 90 % mortality was reached after 120 hours at pH 12. Significant mortalities were also observed both at pH 10 and pH 11. From this study,we conclude that pH elevation could be used both as a preventative treatment to eliminate settlement by dreissenid mussels and as an end ofseason treatment to eliminate adults. The high pH treatment would have to be tailored to the site water quality to prevent formation ofprecipitate during treatment and to minimize corrosive action on materials of construction...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic eruptions {{produce a}} range of hazards which can impact society. The most {{widespread}} of these hazards is volcanic ash fall which can impact {{a range of}} critical infrastructure. Power systems are particularly vulnerable to ash fall hazards and the resulting impacts may lead to power supply disruption. This can lead to cascading disruption of dependent systems, such as hospitals, water and wastewater treatment plants, telecommunications and emergency services. Typically, large emergency power generator sets are used to provide emergency power supply for essential services during electrical power outages. There has been little study of what impact ash fall exposure will have on generator performance. International experience suggests large generators can experience rapid performance reduction when exposed to high concentrations of suspended or falling ash due to obstruction of air filters and radiators, causing overheating of the engine and shut down of the generator system. However, {{it is not clear}} at what ash fall thresholds generators are likely to be disrupted. This research uses <b>custom</b> designed empirical <b>laboratory</b> experiments to investigate the performance of large generators subjected to a range of volcanic ash fall types and intensities, simulating both proximal and distal ash fall exposure from a range of eruptive styles. It also investigates the application of temporary external filters to minimise the ingestion of volcanic ash into generator housings. The results are used to inform recommendations on the likely impacts of ash to generators and the most effective type of mitigation, which maximises filtration whilst maintaining generator performance. Control tests recorded high particle concentrations (~ 0. 006 mg/m 3) which indicate substantial ash contamination is possible. Multiple factors were considered to determine the best mitigation measure including the lowest particle concentration, highest air speed and the ease with which the measure could be fitted. The study found material filtration to be the most effective measure; however as the quality of filtration increased, the air speed was reduced and thus so was the volume of air available to the generator engine. Therefore, the type of filtration required is dependent the ash fall intensity. The study also found that a deflection hood is an effective mitigation measure; maintaining airspeed while reducing particle concentrations within the generator. This research informs risk management strategies for critical infrastructure organisations {{to reduce the risk of}} generator disruption during volcanic ash falls...|$|R
