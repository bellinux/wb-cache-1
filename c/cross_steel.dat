His companion, who carried at his saddle-bow a shield blazoned with heraldic devices in scarlet and gold, was of still greater height, and very slight; his large keen eyes, hair and moustache, black as jet; and his complexion dark brown, with a well-formed aquiline nose, and a perfect and very white set of teeth.|$|E

[...] "What of Lancelot?""A renegade Gallo-Roman who has made an art of throat-cutting. He varies reading Petronius with plotting and intriguing. Gawaine is a pure-blooded Briton like Arthur, but he has Romanish leanings. You'd laugh to see him aping Lancelot — but he fights like a blood-hungry devil. Without those two, Arthur would have been no more than a bandit chief. He can neither read nor write.""What of that?" [...] rumbled the Dane. [...] "Neither can I. ..." ...|$|E

The bridge <b>crossed</b> <b>Steel,</b> Roberts and Wood Islands. Construction of the bridge was started in 1817. [...] The bridge was constructed by Theodore Burr, who had just completed work on four Susquehanna bridges in Pennsylvania. The bridge design used his Burr arch truss. [...] "This ultimate achievement of Burr's on the Susquehanna, having in all eighteen 200-foot trussed arch wooden spans, eight between the west shore and a first island, two between that and a second island, and eight more between that and the east shore, and a total length of 4,170 feet, was to be performed in two years. For the years between 1812 and 1818 Burr's trussed arch had been an increasing triumph.". The bridge opened in 1818.|$|R

40|$|The {{sound level}} of a train <b>crossing</b> a <b>steel</b> railway bridge is usually about 10 dB higher than on plain track. In the Netherlands there are many such bridges which, for {{practical}} reasons, cannot be replaced by more intrinsically quiet concrete bridges. A computational model is described for the estimation of noise levels due to a train <b>crossing</b> a <b>steel</b> bridge. Despite the complexity and diversity of bridge structures, a highly simplified model of the bridge structure is used. An estimate of the noise emitted by wheel and rail is also incorporated. Comparisons with measurements {{on a number of}} typical bridges shows very good agreement. It is found that the increase in noise at a bridge is caused not only by the noise emission from the bridge structure itself, but also by increased noise radiation by the rail and a modified sound transmission from bridge to receiver. It is possible, in close collaboration with designers, to use the model in optimizing bridge structures. The model is also intended to complement the Dutch statutory prediction schemes for railway noise...|$|R
