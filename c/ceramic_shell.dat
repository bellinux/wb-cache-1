50|$|Burnout. The ceramic shell-coated {{piece is}} placed cup-down in a kiln, whose heat hardens the silica {{coatings}} into a shell, and the wax melts and runs out.

50|$|Mushikamados are versatile. They {{are used}} for {{grilling}} and smoking, flat-bread such as pizza can be cooked on a flat ceramic or stone tray (pizza stone) and bread can also be baked. This is {{by virtue of the}} heat retention properties of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>shell</b> with temperatures up to 750 °F (400 °C). Precise control of airflow (and thus temperature) afforded by the vent system means Kamado-style cookers are much like wood-fired ovens and can be used to roast and bake.

50|$|Slurry. A sprued wax copy is {{dipped into}} a slurry of silica, then into a sand-like stucco, or dry {{crystalline}} silica of a controlled grain size. The slurry and grit combination is called <b>ceramic</b> <b>shell</b> mould material, {{although it is}} not literally made of ceramic. This shell is allowed to dry, and the process is repeated until at least a half-inch coating covers the entire piece. The bigger the piece, the thicker the shell needs to be.

5000|$|The mantle is {{a roughly}} pear-shaped fabric bag, made from silk, ramie-based {{artificial}} silk, or rayon. The fibers are impregnated with rare-earth metallic salts; when the mantle is heated in a flame, the fibers burn {{away and the}} metallic salts convert to solid oxides, forming a brittle <b>ceramic</b> <b>shell</b> {{in the shape of}} the original fabric. A mantle will glow brightly in the visible spectrum while emitting little infrared radiation. The rare earth oxides (cerium) and actinide (thorium) in the mantle have a low emissivity in the infrared (in comparison with an ideal black body) but have high emissivity in the visible spectrum. There is also some evidence that the emission is enhanced by candoluminescence, the emission of light from the combustion products before they reach thermal equilibrium. [...] The combination of these properties yields a mantle that, when heated by a kerosene or liquified petroleum gas flame, emits intense radiation that is mostly visible light, with relatively little energy in the unwanted infrared, increasing the luminous efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{prototyping}} {{has been}} used to create master models for investment casting for several years, accelerating the process of making a complicated lost wax model. However the time-saving potential is not fully exploited, since the investment casting shell is made the traditional way, most of the time comsuming about two weeks before either prototype can be cast.

50|$|Once a {{production}} mould is obtained, a wax (hollow for larger sculptures) is then cast from the mould. For a hollow sculpture, a core is then cast into the void, and is retained in its proper location (after wax melting) by pins {{of the same}} metal used for casting. One or more wax sprues are added to conduct the molten metal into the sculptures - typically directing the liquid metal from a pouring cup {{to the bottom of}} the sculpture, which is then filled from the bottom up in order to avoid splashing and turbulence. Additional sprues may be directed upward at intermediate positions, and various vents may also be added where gases could be trapped. (Vents are not needed for <b>ceramic</b> <b>shell</b> casting, allowing the sprue to be simple and direct). The complete wax structure (and core, if previously added) is then invested in another kind of mould or shell, which is heated in a kiln until the wax runs out and all free moisture is removed. The investment is then soon filled with molten bronze. The removal of all wax and moisture prevents the liquid metal from being explosively ejected from the mould by steam and vapour.|$|E
50|$|Mushikamado, or movable Kamado-style cookers are {{now made}} {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including high fire ceramics, refractory materials, double wall insulated steel, traditional terra cotta, and a mix of Portland cement and crushed lava rock. Outer surfaces also vary from a high gloss ceramic glaze, paint, a textured stucco-like surface and ceramic tiles. Modern ceramic and refractory materials decrease cracking - a common fault in the original Japanese design. Portland cement is still associated with cracking problems. In addition to the outer <b>ceramic</b> <b>shell</b> there is also a ceramic or stainless steel bowl inside the unit to hold charcoal. There is a draft opening in the lower side of the unit to provide air to the charcoal, as well as a controllable vent {{in the top of the}} dome lid for air to exit the cooker. Temperature is controlled by adjusting these two vents. One or more grids are suspended over the fire to provide the cooking surface(s) for the food. Finally, most Kamado-style cookers have a hole drilled in the lid to allow the insertion of the stem of a dial-type thermometer for monitoring the cooking temperature of the cooker. The high end kamados have layers of insulation which create low-airflow cooking conditions and are self-opening. Digital temperature control devices can be installed using a small blower to regulate airflow.|$|E

40|$|To {{provide insight}} into the factors causing {{recrystallisation}} of nickel-based single crystal superalloys, analysis of the thermal-mechanical deformation caused by investment casting of these components is presented. Three-dimensional thermal-mechanical finite element analysis is first used to demonstrate that the reaction of the casting and mould-at least in the aerofoil section-can be approximated as one-dimensional. One-dimensional models are then built based upon static equilibrium for plasticity on the microscale caused by differential thermal contraction of metal, mould and core, using temperature dependent material properties. The models take various forms to study the mechanical response under different situations relevant to practical applications. The results indicate that the plastic strain causing recrystallisation is likely to be induced during cooling at temperatures above 1000 °C. The relative importance of thicker and stiffer <b>ceramic</b> <b>shells</b> is studied.

40|$|A novel shaping {{technique}} for advanced ceramic components is presented which allows manufacturing of complex ceramic components with enclosed cavities by using ice moulds or ice cores. Different suspensions of alumina and zirconia powders {{have been developed}} for this special freeze casting technique. The suspensions must meet following requirements: high solid content, the capability of flow, a freezing point between - 10 and - 2 °C, and a casting temperature below 0 °C. After the casting process the moulds and cores could be easily removed by sublimation. The suspension liquid was removed in the frozen state simultaneously. In this way very complicated hollow or filled structures such as metallic or ceramic components encapsulated in <b>ceramic</b> <b>shells</b> could be produced. No de-moulding was necessary, no solid core must be removed, and no liquid phase appeared as known from other lost-mould techniques. Ice mould casting is a very environmental-friendly shaping technique.

40|$|In recent years, <b>ceramic</b> <b>shell</b> mould for {{investment}} casting process is often associated to defects {{due to its}} brittle properties.

40|$|Basically, {{permeability}} of <b>ceramic</b> <b>shell</b> mould system play {{an important}} role in minimizing the casting defects in most investment casting shell. The mould has to be sufficiently permeable to obtain complete mould filling during casting process. Mould fill can be improved by increasing the open porosity that definitely will increase permeability <b>ceramic</b> <b>shell</b> mould. The elimination of rice husk volatile elements has contributed to the increment of pore structure that provides a great deal of connected pathways through the <b>ceramic</b> <b>shell</b> which directly will increase the permeability of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>shell</b> mould during casting process.
