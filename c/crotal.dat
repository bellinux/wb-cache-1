From the former {{the island of}} Taransay, where the BBC Television series Castaway 2000 was recorded, is seen most clearly from Harris. At Scarista the beach is a venue for surfing and kite buggying. Nearby the Harris Golf Club offers well kept greens and views of the hills, {{but there is no}} play on Sundays. Scarista is the birthplace of the author Finlay J. MacDonald, who wrote about growing up on Harris in the 1930s. His books: Crowdie and Cream, <b>Crotal</b> and White and The Corncrake and the Lysander paint a vivid and humorous picture of Hebridean life.|$|E
2500|$|Four rungs on {{the side}} of the masks, above and below each ear, let the masks hang in {{suspension}} and indicate that the masks were suspended from a cord, though experts have disagreed on how they were worn. British Museum art historian William Fagg concluded that unlike the small brass pendant masks worn at the waist by modern kings, the ivory mask was likely worn around the neck. An 1830s drawing of a similar mask worn at the breast by a neighboring ruler confirms Fagg's theory. Based on the position of the rungs, Metropolitan curator Alisa LaGamma also affirmed the theory. Benin specialist and anthropologist Paula Ben-Amos, however, wrote that the masks were worn on the waist as pendants during the Ugie Iyoba and Emobo ceremonies. The hollow masks likely served as amuletic containers. [...] Below the mask's collars, the ring of small loops are attachment points for <b>crotal</b> bells.|$|E

50|$|The Dowris Hoard {{dating from}} the Late Bronze Age {{was found in a}} bog at Dowris, Whigsborough near Birr. It is the largest {{collection}} of Bronze Age objects ever found in Ireland. It includes more than 200 items of which roughly 190 are extant, 111 in the National Museum of Ireland and 79 in the British Museum. Forty four spearheads were found, forty-three axes, twenty-four trumpets, and forty-four <b>crotals</b> (a kind of bell or chime instrument, unique to Ireland). A bronze bucket was also found, it was constructed of sheets of bronze riveted together, this item is considered to be an imported item, two other buckets were also found and these are presumed to be native copies.|$|R

50|$|<b>Crotal</b> bells (Greek 'crotalon' - {{castanet}} or rattle) {{are various}} types of small bells or rattles. They were produced in various Pre-Columbian cultures. In Europe they were made from probably before the early Middle Ages and though many founders cast bells of this type, the Robert Wells bell foundry of Aldbourne, Wiltshire produced the largest range. The first medieval designs came in two separate halves into which a metal pea was introduced and the two halves were then soldered or crimped together. Somewhere around 1400 they were cast in a single piece with a ball of metal inside.|$|E

50|$|<b>Crotal</b> bells, {{also known}} as rumble bells, were used on horse-drawn {{vehicles}} before motorised vehicles were common. They were often made of bronze with a slot cut down the side. These bells were used to warn other horse-drawn vehicle users (mostly on country roads) that another vehicle was approaching. They came in many sizes, from a small 1-inch version to bells that were many inches across - the older ones were forged while others were cast. They were either hung on a small leather-and-iron harness bracket above the horse's collar on smaller vehicles. On larger vehicles, such as delivery wagons, they were driven into the wooden frame of the wagon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hemorrhagic toxin g (HT-g) was {{isolated}} from Crotalus atrox (western dia mondback rattlesnake) venom using a five-step purification procedure to obtain @ 5. 9 mg ofpurifled HT-g from 2. 0 g ofcrudc venom. The purified toxin was homogeneous by disc electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel at pH 8. 3 and 4. 3, and by isoelectric focusing. HT-g possessed lethal, hemorrhagic and proteolytic activities. These activities of toxin were inhibited by ethylcnediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1, 10 -phenanthrolinc or ethylene glycol (fl-amino-ethyl) N,N,N',N'-tctracetic acid (EGTA), {{but not by}} cysteinc or soybean trypsin inhibitor(SBTI). Its molecular weight was approximately 60, 000 and the isoelectric point was 6. 8. The toxin contains 5 16 amino acid residues. HT-g did not coagulate fibrin ogen to fibrin; however, the toxin hydrolysed the Aa-chain or B@ 3 -chainoffibrinogen without cleaving the â€˜y-chain. HT-g produced only local hemorrhage in internal organs such as the intestine, heart and liver. Hemorrhage is a symptom associated with lo cal tissue damage in snake poisoning by <b>Crotal</b> idac, and is quite common after rattlesnake bites. Several investigators have reported purification of hemorrhagic principles from the venoms of Agkistrodon halys blomhoffii, â€T̃rimeresurus flavoviridis 23 and Trimeresurus us 4 More recent investigations with purified hem orrhagic toxins isolated from the venoms of Deinagkistrodon acutus, @ Crotalus atrox'Â ° and Crotalus horridus horridus ' 1 - 12 indicate that these hemorrhagic toxins contain protcolytic activity. In this paperwe report the isolation and chemical and biological properties of a new toxin, hem orrhagic toxin g (HT-g) from the venom of Cro talus atrox.
