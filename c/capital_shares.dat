25|$|Corporate finance {{concerns}} the two money raising options for limited companies. Equity finance involves the traditional method of issuing shares {{to build up}} a company's <b>capital.</b> <b>Shares</b> can contain any rights the company and purchaser wish to contract for, but generally grant the right to participate in dividends after a company earns profits and the right to vote in company affairs. A purchaser of shares is helped to make an informed decision directly by prospectus requirements of full disclosure, and indirectly through restrictions on financial assistance by companies for purchase of their own shares. Debt finance means getting loans, usually {{for the price of a}} fixed annual interest repayment. Sophisticated lenders, such as banks typically contract for a security interest over the assets of a company, so that in the event of default on loan repayments they may seize the company's property directly to satisfy debts. Creditors are also, to some extent, protected by courts' power to set aside unfair transactions before a company goes under, or recoup money from negligent directors engaged in wrongful trading. If a company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, UK insolvency law requires an administrator to attempt a rescue of the company (if the company itself has the assets to pay for this). If rescue proves impossible, a company's life ends when its assets are liquidated, distributed to creditors and the company is struck off the register. If a company becomes insolvent with no assets it can be wound up by a creditor, for a fee (not that common), or more commonly by the tax creditor (HMRC).|$|E
25|$|Companies {{limited by}} shares also acquire finance through ‘equity’ (a synonym for the share <b>capital).</b> <b>Shares</b> differ from debt in that {{shareholders}} rank last in insolvency. The main justification for shareholders’ residual claim is that, unlike many creditors (though not large banks) {{they are capable}} of diversifying their portfolio. Taxation of profits on shares can also be treated differently with a different tax rate (under the Income Tax Act 2007) to capital gains tax on debt (which falls under the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). This makes the distinction between shares and debt important. In principle, all forms of debt and equity arise from contractual arrangements with a company, and the rights which attach are a question of construction. For instance, in Scottish Insurance Corp Ltd v Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd the House of Lords held that when the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 was passed, preferential shareholders were entitled to no extra, special share of assets upon winding up: construction of the terms of the shares entitled them to extra dividends, but without special words to the contrary, shareholders were presumed equal otherwise. For anyone to become a member of a company under the Companies Act 2006 section 33, the contract for shares must simply manifest the intention to do so. However, beyond this, the dividing line between shares and debt is more a matter of standard practice than law. It is legally possible to {{become a member of the}} company without being a shareholder, simply by being accepted and registered on the members’ register. It is also possible to be a shareholder without being a member immediately. It is standard practice that shareholders have one vote per share, but occasionally shareholders (particularly those with preferential dividend rights) do not have votes, and debt holders and others may have votes without having shares. It is even possible for creditors to contract to be subordinated behind shareholders in insolvency – it is just unlikely, and strongly discouraged by the regulatory framework. Shares are also presumed to be transferable to other people, although like other rights, the right to trade is subject to the company’s constitution.|$|E
500|$|A {{committee}} was appointed in 1870 {{to consider the}} railway, and was followed by on-site investigations to determine the railway's route. Similar investigations were carried out in Sweden. For the Norwegian side, costs were estimated to be at 4.7 million Norwegian kroner. for the Meråker route. Surveys along the Verdal route deemed the route unsuitable. This presumed a narrow gauge (...) railway, common in Norway at the time. Operating profits were estimated to give a 4.5 percent return on <b>capital.</b> <b>Shares</b> in the railway company were offered for sale in 1871; the largest purchaser was Trondheim Municipality, who bought shares for 1.2 million kroner. In Trondheim alone, private investors bought an additional 3.6 million kroner in shares.|$|E

50|$|The {{preferred}} and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> of {{the split}} corporation are issued in some fixed ratio. Often the preferred and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> are issued in precisely equal numbers. In such a case, {{each pair of}} preferred and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> is sometimes called a unit. However, the proportion of preferred and <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> does not necessarily have to be one-to-one. Reducing the ratio of issued preferred shares to <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> (e.g., one preferred share for every two <b>capital</b> <b>shares)</b> would reduce the risk and safely support higher yield for the preferred shares {{at the cost of}} making the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> less attractive to investors due to increased risk, lower sustainable yield payout and smaller capital gain leverage.|$|E

40|$|So far, {{comparative}} studies of <b>capital</b> (or labour) <b>share</b> have opposed European to Anglo-Saxon countries. They {{have shown that}} <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> presents sharp movements and a positive trend in European countries, while it is stable in Anglo-Saxon countries. These stylised facts are often explained by the rigidities affecting the European countries and {{the flexibility of the}} so-called ?Anglo-Saxon? model. Based on new <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> indicators, this comparative analysis aims at questioning these stylised facts. It concludes that, instead of separating European from Anglo-Saxon countries, it is much more relevant to oppose oil producing countries to non producing countries.

50|$|The <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> of a {{split share}} {{corporation}} {{are intended to}} be a more aggressive investment vehicle, one that can provide both high income and the promise of amplified capital gains compared to the capital gains of the underlying basket of shares. In effect, the holders of <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> are borrowing money from the holders of the preferred shares at the dividend rate of the preferred shares, and investing that money in a greater number of shares in the underlying basket of shares. Capital gains (or losses) are amplified in the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> because the value of the preferred shares is held relatively constant, and the resulting increased volatility of the equity in the underlying basket of shares is borne mostly by the <b>capital</b> <b>shares.</b> Holders of the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> take on their obligation to guarantee dividend payments to the holders of the preferred shares in exchange for amplified returns. In addition, the income from the <b>capital</b> <b>shares</b> can be structured to be treatable, for tax purposes, as mostly or even entirely capital gain. In many jurisdictions, such as Canada, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than either dividend income or interest income.|$|E

50|$|Often the <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> {{and labor}} share {{are assumed to}} sum to 100%, so that each can be deduced from the other.

40|$|Value and {{momentum}} strategies earn persistently large return premia yet are negatively correlated. Why? We {{show that a}} quantitatively large fraction of the negative correlation is explained by strong opposite signed exposure of value {{and momentum}} portfolios to a single aggregate risk factor based on low frequency uctuations in the national <b>capital</b> <b>share.</b> Moreover, this negatively correlated component is priced. Models with <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> risk explain up to 85 % {{of the variation in}} average returns on size-book/market portfolios and up to 95 % of momentum returns and the pricing errors on both sets of portfolios are lower than those of the Fama-French three- and four-factor models, the intermediary SDF model of Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2014), and models based on low frequency exposure to aggregate consumption risk. None of the betas for these factors survive in a horse race where a long-horizon <b>capital</b> <b>share</b> beta is included.
