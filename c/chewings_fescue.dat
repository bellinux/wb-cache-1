40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Hard Fescue (Festuca longifolia Thuill.) has {{potential}} for in creased turf use {{but does not}} respond well to normal seed production management practices in Oregon. Field burning (the normal residue management practice) results in reduced seed yields in commercial hard fescue seed production fields but stimulates seed production in <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca rubra L. subsp. commutata Gaud.) and other species. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe differences in tillering patterns in hard fescue and <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> in response to various post harvest residue management treatments. Burn and crewcut (clip and vacuum) post harvest residue management treatments were applied on two different dates. Information on number and type of tiller units and tillers produced, dry weights, leaf number and length, tiller fertility and components of yield was collected through one seed production season. Differences in hard and <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> were indicated by cultivar x management interactions in many of the components measured. <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> has the ability to recover from all but the most severe (late burn) management by November while tiller numbers were reduced in all but the least severe (early crewcut) management in hard fescue on that date. Differences were also observed in the type of tiller produced. Hard fescue produced a higher percentage of aerial tillers than did the <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue.</b> These aerial tillers did not survive beyond February and made no apparent contribution to yield. No differences were observed in the number of early season basal tillers.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the twenty amino acids that are universally found as building blocks of proteins, nonprotein amino acids are also present in numerous plant species. One such nonprotein amino acid, meta -tyrosine, is abundant in the root exudates of <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca rubra L. ssp. commutata). Consistent with the phytotoxic effects of mtyrosine, prior studies showed that <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> has superior weed-suppressive capacity in field trials involving dozens of turf grass varieties. Further research with m-tyrosine demonstrates that this compound is stored in a different compartment than the protein amino acids, and can be easily washed off fescue roots with aqueous solutions. <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> roots have enzymatic activity, likely from a cytochrome P 450, for synthesizing m-tyrosine from phenylalanine. An EST library was constructed from roots of <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> and four candidate cytochrome P 450 genes are identified and cloned. When added to A. thaliana growth medium, m-tyrosine can be misincorporated into A. thaliana proteins. Several protein amino acids, in particular phenylalanine, partially rescue the toxicity of m-tyrosine. Correspondingly, a screen for m-tyrosine resistance in A. thaliana identified a mutant that over-accumulates free phenylalanine. Map-based cloning showed that the genetic basis of this phenotype is a dt 2 - 1 D, a mutant allele of ADT 2, which encodes arogenate dehydratase, the final enzyme of the phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway. Characterization of ADT 2 and its mutant form revealed feed-back regulation of phenylalanine biosynthesis, which depends on a critical motif of the ADT 2 protein. Overexpression of the feedback-insensitive a dt 2 - 1 D produces even higher levels of free phenylalanine and has pleiotropic physiological consequences, including abnormal leaf development, resistance to 5 methyltryptophan, reduced growth of the generalist lepidopteran herbivore Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper), and increased salt tolerance. Finally, several hypotheses for m-tyrosine modes of action were tested and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Experiments were {{conducted}} under field and greenhouse conditions {{to investigate the}} effects of chlorpropham (isopropyl mchlorocarbanilate) on vegetative and reproductive development in <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca rubra L. subsp. commutata Gaud.) and to determine the time of induction and initiation under natural conditions. <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> {{was found to be}} very susceptible to chlorpropham treatment and the use of this herbicide for weed control in <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> caused seed yield reduction. Time of chlorpropham application in relation to environmental factors of temperature and photoperiod was more important than the actual toxicity of the herbicide. Chlorpropham used at the recommended rate of 2 lbs/A was lethal to all tillers that were exposed to the herbicide irrespective of time of application. Seed production from treated plants depended on development of new tillers from axillary buds and on prevalence of environmental conditions conducive to induction and initiation. Extent of chlorpropham injury was dependent on type and maturity of tissue, state of activity of the organ, soil temperature, and length of time after treatment. Apical meristems of the shoot were little affected during the initial stages of injury to the shoots and remained intact even after necrosis of surrounding tissues. When plants were grown at low and high temperature levels and treated with varying herbicide concentrations, tiller production proved to be a more sensitive measure of herbicide-temperature effects than dry matter production. High temperatures favored tiller production and enhanced herbicide toxicity. Time of induction and initiation under natural conditions were determined. Induction was found to occur late in the fall (December) and initiation takes place in February. Plants taken to the field as late as February were induced but seedhead production was reduced because environmental conditions were inhibitory to initiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} of using various molecular methods of genetic fingerprinting for species, sub-species and cultivar identification of fine fescues, a cool-season turfgrass, was investigated because currently used morphological markers do not easily distinguish among them. The fine fescues included: Festuca rubra ssp. rubra (creeping red fescue), F. rubra ssp. commutata (<b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue),</b> F. ovina ssp. ovina (sheep fescue) and F. ovina ssp duriuscula (hard fescue). Fingerprinting methodologies tested include RAPD technology, RFLP fingerprinting with minisatellite probes {{such as an}} M 13 bacteriophage probe, two human VNTR (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) probes (33. 6 and 33. 15) and microsatellite probe (GATA) n. RAPD based markers proved to be superior to minisatellite markers in identifying species and subspecies RAPD analysis was less successful in distinguishing varieties within a species. Human probes yielded nonspecific hybridization patterns which prevented the identification of useful fingerprinting markers. The M 13 probe gave rise to specific hybridizations, {{in contrast to the}} human probes, but was unable to distinguish between plants even at the species level. The microsatellite (GATA) n proved to be the most versatile probe, since it could distinguish between varieties as well as between germplasm accessions, thus proving its potential use in genetic and other fingerprinting studies. ^ We used RAPD-based molecular markers to study the inheritance of endophytic Acremonium association with turfgrass, an important turf trait.

40|$|Winter {{injuries}} on golf greens cause big {{economic losses}} in Scandinavia. Dehardening resistance and rehardening capacity are important traits for survival of low freezing temperatures following warm spells during winter and early spring. Our {{objective was to}} determine plant hardiness {{at the start of}} winter and dehardening resistance of six cool-season turfgrass species/subspecies commonly used on golf greens. Plant material was collected on an experimental green at Bioforsk Landvik, SE Norway in late November 2011 and 2012 and subjected to six or twelve days of dehardening at 10 °C in a growth chamber. The ranking order for freezing tolerance (measured as lethal temperature for 50 % plants (LT 50)) of turfgrasses taken from the field in late November was: annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) (− 13 to − 14 °C) < colonial bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.) (− 18 to − 20 °C) ≤ slender creeping fescue (Festuca rubra trichophylla L.) (− 19 °C) ≤ <b>chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> (Festuca rubra commutate L.) (− 21 °C) < velvet bentgrass (Agrostis canina L.) (− 23 to − 27 °C) ≤ creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) (<− 30 °C). The main dehardening occurred during the first 6 days at 10 °C and dehardening rates increased in the order: slender creeping fescue < <b>chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> < colonial bentgrass < annual bluegrass < creeping bentgrass. The dehardening rate of velvet bentgrass was inconsistent in the two years. An additional rehardening treatment at 2 °C for 23 days was included in 2012. None of the species were able to reharden to their original freezing tolerance after 12 -d dehardening at 10 °C. Low overall freezing resistance and less capacity to reharden in annual bluegrass than in the other species was associated with more leaf growth during both hardening and dehardening. The results indicate that hardening ability and dehardening resistance are not necessarily positively correlated and that the turfgrasses studied have developed different strategies to survive the winter...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> [Festuca rubra L. subsp. fallax (Thuill.) Nyman] is {{a desired}} turfgrass with dense sod forming {{capabilities}} and superior shade tolerance. Thermal residue management (open-field burning) {{has traditionally been}} used to remove post-harvest residue and maintain seed yield {{over the life of}} the stand. However, alternative non-thermal residue management practices have been observed to produce adequate seed yields dependent upon cultivar. Strong creeping red fescue (F. rubra L. subsp. rubra) is desired for its prolific tillering capacity and creeping rhizomatous growth habit. In contrast to <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue,</b> maintenance of seed yield in strong creeping red fescue has only been profitably produced under thermal residue management. Slender creeping red fescue [F. rubra L. var. littoralis (Vasey) ] is a desired turfgrass with a compact, less rhizomatous growth habit, similar to <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> in desirable turf attributes. However, little is known about the effects of post-harvest residue management in slender creeping red fescue. The objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate seed yield and yield components among different cultivars to thermal (open-burning), and non-thermal (flail low and flail high) post-harvest residue management; 2) to evaluate harvest index and percent cleanout to thermal and non-thermal residue management in different cultivars; and 3) and to provide an economic analysis of thermal and non-thermal residue management in all cultivars based on partial budgeting. Three post-harvest residue management treatments (burn, flail low and flail high) were applied over the course of two years. Seed yield components measured included: total dry weight, fertile tiller number, spikelets per panicle, florets per spikelet, and panicle length. Final seed yield in each cultivar and residue management treatment method was determined after seed harvest and conditioning. Seed yield component analysis was conducted over three production seasons. <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue,</b> strong creeping red fescue, and slender creeping red fescue cultivars responded differently to residue management as indicated by a residue management by cultivar interaction. In 2003 and 2004, residue management by cultivar interactions were evident in seed number, seed weight, fertile tiller number, percent cleanout, harvest index, and seed yield. Residue management by cultivar interactions occurred in spikelets per panicle in 2003, whereas in 2004 a residue management by cultivar interaction occurred in panicle length and florets per spikelet. In 2004, non-thermal flail low, and thermal residue management resulted in significantly greater spikelets per panicle in all cultivars. Thermal residue management resulted in the greatest number of spikelets per panicle. Results indicate that thermal residue management best maintained seed yield in most subspecies and cultivars across both years. However, in 2003, non-thermal flail low residue management produced profitable seed yield in only Marker slender creeping red fescue. In contrast, thermal residue management resulted in poor seed yields in Marker slender creeping red fescue and enhanced yields in Seabreeze slender creeping red fescue in 2003. However, following the second year of thermal treatment in 2004, Marker and Seabreeze both had lower seed yields, thus exhibiting the only negative impact of thermal management among the cultivars tested in this study. Moreover, upon review of an economic analysis, Marker slender red fescue was the only cultivar that produced a positive net return of 78 and 4 ha⁻¹ under non-thermal residue management in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Furthermore, in 2003, thermal residue management net return increases ranged from 104 ha⁻¹ to - 996 ha⁻¹ in Barnica and Shademark, respectively. In 2004, thermal residue management net return increases ranged from 115 ha⁻¹ and 1, 332 ha⁻¹ in Seabreeze and Shademark, respectively. Poor seed yields were observed in all strong creeping red fescue cultivars under non-thermal residue management across both years of the study. This may be attributed to an observed reduction in fertile tiller number and seed yield. In addition, percent seed cleanout was increased with non-thermal residue management. In 2004, as stand age increased, thermal residue management resulted in greater seed yields in all cultivars and species, except both cultivars of slender creeping red fescue. Thus, this study provided substantial evidence that thermal residue management has the potential to maintain or increase fine fescue seed yield as stands age as well as to maintain stand profitability...|$|E

40|$|Mutualistic fungal endophytes infect many grass {{species and}} often confer {{benefits}} to the hosts such as reduced herbivory by insects and animals. The physiological interactions between the endophytes and their hosts have not been well characterized. Fungal-secreted proteins {{are likely to be}} important components of the interaction. In the interaction between Poa ampla and the endophyte Neotyphodium sp., a fungal β- 1, 6 -glucanase is secreted into the apoplast, and activity of the enzyme is detectable in endophyte-infected plants. Sequence analysis indicates the β- 1, 6 -glucanase is homologous to enzymes secreted by the mycoparasitic fungi Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma virens. DNA gel-blot analysis indicated the β- 1, 6 -glucanase was encoded by a single gene. As a secreted protein, the β- 1, 6 -glucanase may have a nutritional role for the fungus. In culture, β- 1, 6 -glucanase activity was induced in the presence of β- 1, 6 -glucans.

Research was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} over-seeding fine-leaved fescue (Festuca spp.) in buffalo grass turf on turf grass color and quality and the effects of species, seeding rate and date, and core cultivation on fine-leaved fescue establishment in buffalo grass turf. Hard fescue (F. longifolia Thuill.), blue fescue (F. ovina L. var. glauca Lam.), and <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> (F. rubra L. ssp. commutata Gaud.); seeding rates (10, 20, and 30 g m- 2); seeding dates (fall, spring, or split fall–spring); and core cultivation (single or double pass) were evaluated for species composition, turf grass quality, color, and green cover at the John Seaton Anderson Turf grass Research Facility located near Mead, NE. Buffalo grass turf overseeded with blue fescue in fall had the highest turfgrass quality, color, and green cover ratings. Fall overseeding resulted in the highest shoot density values. Spring overseedings were below acceptable levels. Botanical composition of the mixtures overseeded in fall reached 75 to 80 % fescue and 20 to 25 % buffalo grass after 2 yr.

Therefore, a project was designed to identify F. valesiaca accessions that possess horticultural potential when grown under semi-arid growing conditions and to characterize their relatedness to other Festuca species. In 2008, 12 F. valesiaca accessions originating from Kyrgyzstan and eight US. Festuca and one Lolium cultivar were transplanted as replicated, spaced plants to a field nursery at Blue Creek, Utah. Relative vigor, height, width, total biomass (aboveground dry matter yield), seed weight, and seed number were evaluated between 2009 and 2011. Plant height, width, and total biomass of the F. valesiaca accessions examined were approximately equal to the commercial control, ‘Cascade’ (F. rubra L. subsp. commutata Gaudin; 6 x; <b>chewings</b> <b>fescue).</b> Plant vigor and seed weight of F. valesiaca accessions PI 659923, PI 659932, W 6 30575, and W 6 30588 under semi-arid conditions (300 mm annual precipitation) were significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) greater than ‘Cascade’. Moreover, principal component analysis based on all traits as loading factors indicated that these 12 F. valesiaca accessions were distinct from {{a majority of the}} other Festuca accessions examined. These F. valesiaca accessions produced abundant amounts of small seed, and this seed yield was significantly correlated with total aboveground biomass (dry weight; r 2 = 0. 84, P 3 ̆c 0. 001), plant height (r 2 = 0. 58, P 3 ̆c 0. 05), and plant vigor (r 2 = 0. 83, P 3 ̆c 0. 001).

We were particularly interested in their winter hardiness, and ability to rapidly establish a dense stand and suppress annual and perennial weeds under minimal maintenance, simulating conditions encountered in low maintenance production sites. Grasses were seeded on September 10, 2005 at 4 lbs/ 1000 sq ft on a well-drained Hudson silt loam soil in Ithaca NY, at the Bluegrass Lane Turf and Landscape Research Center. Plots were evaluated in April 2006 for winter hardiness and survival, and later in May, June and July 2006 {{for their ability to}} produce cover or above-ground biomass, and also to suppress the establishment of weeds. Plots received no fertilization and no irrigation after seeding, and minimal monthly mowing with a large commercial rotary mower. Grasses which performed exceptionally well in terms of weed suppression and biomass production included crested wheatgrass, creeping meadowgrass, no-mow fescue, Rebel Exceda tall fescue, Tar Hill II tall fescue, and Russian winter rye. Columbra and Intrigue <b>chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> and Palmer perennial ryegrass were also good performers. These cultivars generally produced greater than 80 to 90 % stands of cover with minimal weed infestation by July 10, 2006 and continued to perform well into the fall of 2006. Grasses which performed poorly as evaluated by formation of less than 60 % stands and supported large weed infestations included redtop, and Arizona fescue. Grasses will be further evaluated for their ability to withstand environmental stress and perform under low maintenance conditions both in Ithaca and Riverhead NY locations. In additional studies performed at Marcus Nurseries in Allegheny County, several groundcovers proved to be exceptional performers in nursery settings, 2 years after establishment. These groundcovers established and overwintered effectively, and were significantly weed suppressive.

Significant irrigation input differences were observed between mowing height treatments but not among nitrogen fertility treatments. Tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, creeping bentgrass and velvet bentgrass were all lower water users under both high and low heights of cut in this trial. The higher water use species, annual bluegrass and red fescues, all required more water in the low mown plots than the high mown plots. A lower crop coefficient for irrigation could be utilized for most species in the Pacific Northwest. Stress detection glasses were able to detect water stress in all turfgrass species tested by a minimum of 1. 2 days on average and a maximum of 2. 4 days in advance of the unaided visual assessment. The glasses were evaluated across a broad range of species and were effective regardless of the different turf canopies and variation in color present in the different species. The early detection of stress would enable turf managers to schedule irrigation in advance while conserving water. For most species the TDR could reliably measure the percent Volumetric Water Content (VWC) at which irrigation was required to maintain a functional turf surface. At the typical recommended mowing height of most species, if maturity was achieved, this was at approximately 30 % VWC. The TDR could be used to more accurately guide irrigation scheduling and reduce water use...|$|E

In the cool-season {{region of the}} United States, golf courses traditionally grow high-input grasses like creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera, L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis, L.), annual bluegrass (Poa annua, L.), and/or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne, L.) on fairways. Grass species exist that are more sustainable than those currently being used for golf course fairway turf. Low-input fine fescue species could be able to withstand the pressure from typical turfgrass disease and stresses while producing acceptable turf and excellent playing quality with fewer overall inputs of pesticides, water, and fertilizer. Little {{research has been conducted}} on these species in a fairway setting, so golf course managers have been hesitant to use fine fescues. This project conducted research to overcome these barriers and thus begin using low-input fine fescues for fairways on golf courses throughout the northern United States. The objective of the first experiment was to evaluate fine fescue species’ performance as fairway turfgrass under an acute drought. Field trials were conducted at two locations under a rainout shelter. Mixtures that contained large proportions (> 33 %) of <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> [Festuca rubra ssp. commutata (Thuill.) Nyman] had the greatest green cover {{at the end of the}} drought period. The marginal effects summary revealed no significant differences among species success after drought. Overall, this study found that fine fescues can provide acceptable turf quality and playability on golf course fairways resulting in lower irrigation inputs. The objectives of the second project were to determine the effect of the plant growth regulator trinexapac-ethyl on the performance of fine fescue mixtures when managed as a golf course fairway and identify fine fescue mixtures that perform well under traffic stress. The marginal effects summaries showed hard fescue [Festuca trachyphylla (Hack.) Krajina], slender creeping red fescue [Festuca rubra ssp. litoralis (G. F. W. Meyer) Auquier. ], strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra ssp. rubra Gaudin), and sheep fescue (Festuca ovina, L.) had the greatest component effect on visual turfgrass quality, and were all statistically similar. Strong creeping red fescue was more susceptible to dollar spot disease (caused by Sclerotinia homoeocarpa F. T. Bennett) than the other species. The third experiment evaluated fine fescue species and mixtures for snow mold resistance on three golf courses in Minnesota. In the spring of 2013, 2014, and 2015, there was no damage from snow mold. These grasses may be resistant to the pathogens; however, our observations in higher cut fine fescue suggest that snow mold and snow scald diseases can be a problem in these grasses. Although the objective to determine if fine fescue fairways require fungicides at currently-recommended application rates to survive winter snow mold pressure was not accomplished, turf quality data taken over 2 years was analyzed. Mixtures maintained significantly better turfgrass quality than any of the five species alone...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable grape {{production}} {{entails the}} implementation of management practices that control weeds, maintain grapevine performance, and conserve soil quality. Conventional weed management practices include herbicide application and/or cultivation. These practices compromise soil quality by limiting additions of organic matter and exposing the soil surface, thereby leaving it prone to degradative processes. With the expansion of continental climate viticulture in areas with rain-fed agriculture, {{such as in the}} Midwest, {{there is a need for}} sustainable weed management practices that optimize production while conserving soil quality. The primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate weed management practices in an established midwestern vineyard. Sub-objectives of the investigation addressed within individual experiments include: 1) comparing conventional and alternative weed management practices on weed control, grapevine performance, and soil quality, and 2) evaluating the influence of irrigation on grapevine growth and development, grown with and without a living mulch, on mitigation of water competition. An additional objective of this investigation was to survey Iowa fruit growers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes and awareness of weed management practices that conserve soil resources. In the first experiment, two conventional and two alternative weed management strategies were compared in an established Iowan vineyard with `Marychal Foch 2 ̆ 7 grapevines (Vitis rupestris Scheele yvinifera L.). Treatments were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design and included: 1) cultivation, 2) herbicide application, 3) straw mulch, and 4) a living mulch of creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L. `Pennlawn 2 ̆ 7). Straw and living mulches controlled weed populations and grapevine yield did not differ among the treatments. Dormant cane pruning weights and fruit quality were lowest in cultivated and straw mulch plots, respectively. Mulched plots had greater water-filled pore space and water content, as well as faster infiltration rates. No differences in chemical soil quality attributes were observed. Although earthworm populations were greater in straw mulch plots, no differences in soil enzymatic activity were found. Results from the experiment demonstrate straw and living mulches reduce weed populations, maintain grapevine productivity, and improve several indicators of soil quality. The effects of living mulches, with and without irrigation, on grapevine growth and development were measured in the second experiment. Data were collected from an established vineyard in Iowa with `Reliance 2 ̆ 7 and `Swenson Red 2 ̆ 7 grapevines (Vitus labrusca L.) planted in a randomized complete block design. Treatments were replicated eight times and included: 1) herbicide application without irrigation, 2) herbicide application with irrigation, 3) living mulch without irrigation, and 4) living mulch with irrigation. The living mulch treatment was a mixture of shade-tolerant creeping red and <b>Chewings</b> <b>fescue</b> [Festuca rubra L. `Foxy 2 ̆ 7 and F. rubra var. fallax (Thuill.) Hack. `Ambrose, 2 ̆ 7 respectively]. Supplemental irrigation was provided via drip irrigation and scheduling regimes were based on fescue evapotranspiration. Living mulches and irrigation had no consistent effect on grapevine growth and development, suggesting little-to-no competition existed between the grapevines and living mulches during the period in which the study was conducted. When compared to both herbicide-treated plots, living mulches reduced weed populations and promoted several indicators of soil quality. Results from both experiments demonstrate the alternative practices of straw and living mulches control weeds, maintain grapevine performance, and may be viable alternatives to vineyard weed management that promotes soil quality within the Midwest. While results from the experiments suggest alternative weed management practices may contribute to the sustainability of a weed management system, grower receptiveness to alternative practices is important when planning future extension-education programs and advancing soil-quality awareness. Within a survey of twenty-two Iowa fruit growers, all survey participants were aware of soil quality and considered the quality of their soils when making land management decisions. Most were aware of alternative weed management practices, yet were uncertain about the outcome of implementing alternative practices within their own production systems. To further advance the awareness and adoption of soil-quality concepts and alternative weed management practices, respectively, future extension programs should focus on educating growers how weed management decisions can impact both crop productivity and soil quality...|$|E
