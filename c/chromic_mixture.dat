40|$|Thin electro-conductive CuxS {{films were}} {{deposited}} on plastic substrate from solutions containing copper chloride, thiourea (TU), sodium hydroxide, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as surfactant. On {{the surface of}} CuxS film a layer of nickel was electrochemically deposited. The influence of etching treatment in acetone: water solutions and <b>chromic</b> <b>mixture</b> respectively on the electrical resistance of the obtained films was studied, {{as well as the}} influence of nickel deposition. After the deposition of nickel the electrical resistance of obtained multilayered composites decreased more than 5 times. The technique of deposition of an intermediate layer of copper sulphide in order to obtained a conducting plastic is preferable to classical technology, since the number of stages is reduced, and the necessity of using noble metals (Ag or Pd) is eliminated...|$|E

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to separate chromium from waste <b>chromic</b> acid <b>mixture</b> in order 	to prevent environmental pollution. When the waste solution is neutralized so 	large quantity of heat of reaction due to high acidity is generated that it is 	desirable to be cooled by any means. 	Four properties of the solution relating to heat transfer for varying degree of 	neutralization were measured. Nusselt numbers at cooling coi 1 tube put in a 	mixing vessel of given geometry were calculated for various compositions and 	temperatures.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made in this work to improve the {{abrasion}} resistance of the coloured film by cathodic treatment in a suitable oxidising solution at different current densities and temperatures. The cathodic polarisation of the coloured film is studied in <b>chromic</b> acid/sulphuric acid <b>mixture</b> at constant current density and the potential-time behaviour is reporte...|$|R
40|$|The {{volumetric}} method recommended for {{the estimation of}} <b>chromic</b> aciddichromate <b>mixture</b> in a plating solution involves titration of the diluted test solution apainst standard NaOH usina bromocresol preen as indicator. This method {{in the absence of}} any sharp end point gives inwnsisteniresults. A newmethod has been worked out in which the free chromic acid is volumetrically estimated by titrating the solution against standard NaOH with the addition of barium acetate and phenolphthalein as indicator. During this titration, the chromate and dichromate present in solution is removed as the insoluble barium chromate. Total hexavalent chromium is separately determined by titration with ferrous ammonium sulphate with nphenyl anthranilic acid. Suitable methods of calculation were found to give reproducible values in regard to free chromic acid and dichromate in a mixture...|$|R
40|$|During {{the early}} phases of tissue {{sectioning}} for electron microscopy, {{virtually all of}} the standard cytological fixatives were tried. Of these, osmium tetroxide appeared to give the best preservation, and this was further improved by buffering the fixative solution at a slightly alkaline pH (Palade (1)). A variant developed by Dalton (2) contains Os 04 in a chromate-dichromate system. Formalin has been used for special purposes for electron microscopy, and a fixative without OsO 4 has been described by Low (3), consisting of a <b>chromic</b> acid-formaldehyde <b>mixture.</b> Potassium permanganate, or more specifically the permanganate ion, has occasionally been used as a fixative or stain in light microscopy (4). It provides remarkable preservation of many cell components at the electron microscope level, as the following plates illustrate. The tissue fine structure looks similar to that following osmium treatment, thus rendering less likely the criticism that electron microscopists are merely seeing artifacts of osmium fixation. Besides preserving fine structure, permanganate fixation enhances tissue densit...|$|R
50|$|Techniques for {{metallization}} {{started as}} early as mirror making. In 1835, Justus von Liebig discovered the process of coating a glass surface with metallic silver, making the glass mirror {{one of the earliest}} items being metallized. Plating other non-metallic objects grew rapidly with introduction of ABS plastic. Because a non-metallic object tends to be a poor electrical conductor, the object's surface must be made conductive before plating can be performed. The plastic part is first etched chemically by a suitable process, such as dipping in a hot <b>chromic</b> acid-sulfuric acid <b>mixture.</b> The etched surface is sensitised and activated by first dipping in tin(II) chloride solution, then palladium chloride solution. The processed surface is then coated with electroless copper or nickel before further plating. This process gives useful (about 1 to 6 kgf/cm or 10 to 60 N/cm or 5 to 35 lbf/in) adhesion force, but is much weaker than actual metal-to-metal adhesion strength.|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods used}} for the {{electron}} microscopic detection of glycoproteins were applied {{to a variety of}} cell types in the rat; one involved successive treatment of sections with periodic acid, chromic acid, and silver methenamine; and the other, a brief treatment with a <b>chromic</b> acid-phosphotungstic acid <b>mixture.</b> The results obtained with the two methods were identical and, whenever the comparison was possible, similar to those obtained with the periodic acid-Schiff technique of light microscopy. In secretory as well as in nonsecretory cells, parts of the Golgi apparatus are stained. The last saccule on one side of each Golgi stack is strongly reactive (mature face), and the last saccule on the other side shows little or no reactivity (immature face); a gradient of reactivity occurs in between these saccules. The more likely explanation of the increase in staining intensity is that carbohydrate is synthesized and accumulates in saccules as they migrate toward the mature face. In many secretory cells, the mature face is associated with strongly stained secretory granules. Other structures stained are: (1) small vesicles, dense and multivesicular bodies, at least some of which are presumed to be lysosomal in nature; (2) cell coat; and (3) basement membrane. The evidence suggests that the Golgi saccules provide glycoproteins not only for secretion, but also for the needs of the lysosomal system as well as for incorporation into the cell coat and perhaps basement membrane...|$|R
