50|$|Industrial fishing {{also makes}} an {{important}} contribution to the economy of the region and small-scale artisanal fisheries provide a living for thousands of Angolans and South Africans. In Namibia, more than 20 species are fished commercially and approximately 90% of the catch is exported. The fishing industry employs 13,700 people (2003 figures). There are very few small-scale/artisanal fishers in Namibia, but recreational fishing is a popular sport and a major attraction for coastal tourists. In Angola, at least 25,000 coastal people work as artisanal fishers, while an estimated 80,000 people - mostly women - prepare and sell the artisanal catch and are therefore dependent on fishing for their livelihoods. The South African fishing industry is very diverse. The country’s fishing fleet ranges in size from small rock lobster dinghies, to highly sophisticated freezer trawlers. The small pelagic fishery for sardine and anchovy is the largest fishery by volume, while the deep-sea trawling industry is the largest by value. This fishery targets the <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes.</b> Artisanal fishers operate along the entire South African coast, harvesting a wide variety of species including linefish, mussels, oysters, ascidians and common periwinkles. Various species of seaweed form the basis of a small industry that produces alginate products and feed for aquaculture operations.|$|E

Species which may prove important {{as a result of}} further research are Lolliguncula mercatoris, Ommastrephes bartramii, Todarodes filippovae, Histioteuthis miranda and Abraliopsis gilchristi.

Use of the latter criterion indicates that Sepia australis, Todaropsis eblanae and Lycoteuthis ?diadema are sufficiently abundant to be exploited by fisheries.

Such feeding is opportunistic and is not believed to threaten the fish stocks. Predators of cephalopods are mostly opportunistic, switching to other prey when cephalopods are not available.

The {{aim of this}} study was to elucidate the nutritional condition and feeding preferences of their larvae. Hake eggs and larvae were sampled in austral spring of two consecutive years, 2007 and 2008, off the west coast of South Africa. They were identified to species using genetics, and total lipid content and fatty acid (FA) composition were analysed for each individual egg and larva to compare the condition of different early life stages of both hake species. Higher abundances of M. paradoxus eggs and larvae were consistently found compared to M. capensis. In both species, eggs contained wax esters (WE) and had significantly higher lipid content per dry mass than larvae. Lipid content as well as FA composition changed with the developmental stage of larvae. Quantities of essential fatty acid (EFA) increased with feeding of larvae due to dietary lipid incorporation. In 2007, yolk-sac larvae contained significantly lower total lipids than in 2008. It is argued that this was due to reduced lipid transfer by the spawning females to the eggs. These findings indicate that maternal effects {{are important}} in determining condition of hake larvae and that this may have an effect on their survival and subsequent recruitment...|$|E
40|$|In {{the marine}} environment, an {{increasing}} number of studies have documented introgression and hybridization using genetic markers. Hybridization appears to occur preferentially between sister-species, with the probability of introgression decreasing with an increase in evolutionary divergence. Exceptions to this pattern were reported for the <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes</b> (Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus), two distantly related Merluciidae species that diverged 3 – 4. 2 million years ago. Yet, it is expected that contemporary hybridization between such divergent species would result in reduced hybrid fitness. We analysed 1, 137 hake individuals using nine microsatellite markers and control region mtDNA data to assess the validity of the described hybridization event. To distinguish between interbreeding, ancestral polymorphism and homplasy we sequenced the flanking region of the most divergent microsatellite marker. Simulation and empirical analyses showed that hybrid identification significantly varied with the number of markers, model and approach used. Phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the flanking region of Mmerhk- 3 b, combined with the absence of mito-nuclear discordance, suggest that previously reported hybridization between M. paradoxus and M. capensis cannot be substantiated. Our findings highlight the need to conduct a priori simulation studies to establish the suitability of a particular set of microsatellite loci for detecting multiple hybridization events. In our example, the identification of hybrids was severely influenced by the number of loci and their variability, as well as the different models employed. More importantly, we provide quantifiable evidence showing that homoplasy mimics the effects of heterospecific crossings which can lead to the incorrect identification of hybridization...|$|E

Since 1948, annual catches have exceeded 50 000 tons {{and the current}} total allowable catch (TAC) is about 150 000 tons, a quantity informed by assessments of the hake resource. Current assessments on which management is based use single-stock models that ignore food-web effects. Usually including such interactions in assessments is problematic because {{of the complexity of}} food webs. In the case of <b>Cape</b> <b>hake,</b> however, cannibalism and inter-species predation form a very large component of hake mortality and food consumption, thus making a multi-species model not only more feasible but also likely more reliable. A comprehensive multi-species model incorporating these interactions was last investigated in 1995. Since then, substantially more data have become available, and hake single-species assessments have developed considerably, inter alia now including the ability to take careful account of species differentiation. Additionally, with increased computer processing power, more sophisticated modelling can now be attempted than was possible 20 years ago, rendering an update and refinement of the 1995 analyses timeous. The thesis uses mathematical methods to model hake-on-hake predation and cannibalism in hake populations explicitly by incorporating an additional mortality term to account for these interactions. Information from stomach samples obtained on hake research surveys on predator and prey lengths, {{as well as on the}} proportion of hake in the diet of hake predators, is then included when fitting the model to data.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability of the egg and larval abundance of Merluccius spp. in the Benguela Jet Current was analysed. The <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes,</b> occurring in waters off South Africa, are important for the commercial fisheries in the southern Benguela system, but information on their early life-history strategy is sparse. Data and samples, for this study, were collected during bimonthly cruises of the South African Sardine and Anchovy Recruitment Project (SARP) from August 1995 to July 2003. Samples were collected with a mini-bongo net (300  µm mesh) on a transect crossing the Benguela Current off the Cape Peninsula at 34. 15 °S, 18. 29 °E extending 58  nm offshore. Eggs and larvae were commonly found in currents with north-westerly flow, suggesting that the Benguela Jet Current transports eggs and larvae of Merluccius spp. to the northern nursery areas. Spawning grounds of Merluccius spp. appeared {{to be on the}} western Agulhas Bank during August 1996 to July 1998. Two possible spawning grounds in different water depths were identified, suggesting spawning by both Cape hake species, M. capensis and M. paradoxus. Peak abundances of eggs and larvae of Merluccius spp. were found from June to October, a time of reduced offshore transport. Abundances of eggs and larvae were low in austral summer and autumn. Spawning intensity was higher during times of reduced upwelling as shown by correlations of abundances of early life stages with the upwelling index.

40|$|The {{demersal}} fishery off {{the west}} coast of South Africa experiences decreased catches per unit effort of hake, Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, following the onset of strong south easterly winds. Research has demonstrated that, during daylight hours, <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes</b> migrate vertically in the water column in response to strong south easterly winds, decreasing their availability to the bottom trawl. Hydroacoustic, trawl and environmental data were collected off the West Coast during both calm and wind-swept periods in an attempt to understand the forces that initiate this behaviour, its spatial variability and the implications for demersal trawl estimates of abundance. Near-bottom currents appear to be the primary factor influencing the vertical distribution of the demersal fish community, of which hake constitutes a large proportion, during daylight hours. Correlation between wind and near-bottom currents suggest that the poleward component of the currents increase in velocity within eight hours following the onset of south easterly winds. The fish avoid boundary layers where currents change direction and speed dramatically, and seem to concentrate in waters with relatively stable current regimes. This result questions the assumption of CPUE-based assessment models that hake availability to the bottom trawl is constant or varies randomly. The incorporation of acoustic assessment techniques to demersal surveys has potential, but may be most valuable by supplementing swept-area estimates of abundance, since the sampling efficiency of these methods varies within the water column. The incorporation of wind indices and gear performance data to Cape hake assessment models have been identified as useful considerations for the future. _______________________________________________________...|$|E

The {{two species}} of Cape hake, Merluccius capensis (shallow-water hake) and M paradoxus (deepwater hake), fomi the {{mainstay}} of the bottom trawl industry off South Africa and constitute the country's most valuable fishery. It is therefore important that the status of this resource be assessed regularly to ensure that exploitation is at a sustainable level. The two Cape hake species are morphologically similar and no distinction is made between them in commercial catch statistics. Consequently, for assessment purposes, the <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes</b> are treated as a single species. It is assumed that two stocks of Cape hake exist, one off the West Coast and another off the South Coast of South Africa. Central to the assessments of these stocks are the catch per unit effort (CPUE) data because it assumed that CPUE is proportional to abundance. The nominal CPUE (hake catch divided by actual time trawled) for both the West and South Coast stocks has shown a steady growth over the period 1978 - 1994, increasing {{at a rate of}} 3. 8 % per annum on the West Coast and 4. 2 % per annum on the South Coast. The bulk of this thesis is concerned with determining whether these increases in CPUE are the result of an increasing biomass, or are rather, in part, the result of improved vessel efficiency due to technological advancement or of changes in fishing strategy. The existing CPUE time series had previously been standardised by means of applying power factors which were crudely estimated in the early 1970 s and which are likely inappropriate for the current fishing fleets. These CPUE series have therefore been re-standardised by applying the internationally accepted approach of General Linear Modelling (GLM) ...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 168 - 180. This thesis adopts an {{holistic}} approach to evaluation of the "seal problem", which encompasses the operational and biological interactions between the South African fur seal and fisheries in the Benguela Ecosystem. The operational interactions are examined using a qualitative assessment, and speculative, single-species simulation models are developed to improve understanding of seal population dynamics, present options for seal management and explore seal-fishery interactions. The models show that {{the probability of a}} seal living longer than 20 years is 14 %; that the population has increased at a rate of 5. 1 % p. a. since the last major census in 1983; that in 1988 there were an estimated 1. 5 million seals that consumed over 2 million tons of fish; that although seal population size is usually estimated by multiplying the number of pups by a factor of 4, this factor is very variable and under different culling regimes is usually greater than 4; that historically, the mean population : pup ratio is 4. 55. The most effective means of reducing the population is to cull both pups and bulls (the population decrease resulting mainly from reduced pup production caused by disturbance during bull culling). Culling pups is the least effective means of population control. Culling cows alters the population sex ratio drastically and is considered undesirable. To achieve a small or negative population growth rate, more bulls and pups need to be culled than have been taken historically. Each of the fisheries is found to be subject to operational interactions with seals, this being most severe for the purse-seine fishery. The per capita consumption of fish by seals is similar under any management regime so it is not justified to adopt a particular culling strategy to reduce overall consumption. When either seal predation or fishing mortality is reduced, the model simulates an increase in fishery yield of <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes.</b> But there is inadequate understanding of hake population dynamics at present, and depending on the interactions between species, decreased predation may result in increased or decreased fishery yields. This study shows that operational interactions are a real problem and this biases the opinion of fishermen towards seals as competitors for fish resources...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Spawning {{times and}} {{spawning}} intensity {{during the life}} cycles of some fish species found off South Africa and Norway were synthesized using data collected from the literature. The comparison of temporal patterns in spawning of South African fish species showed variable spawning times and intensity depending on the environmental conditions within that spawning habitat. Their spawning migration durations were suggested to be short since they inhabit a dynamic coastal upwelling ecosystem with intra-seasonal differences caused by changes in upwelling strength enhanced by south-easterly winds, nutrient-limited waters on the spawning grounds and stable thermal conditions. This contrasts with Norwegian fish species, which showed patterns of spawning times and durations that are restricted and confined to spring (February – May), probably due to strong, consistent seasonality, depending on primary production. This explains the inter-annual differences observed in their spawning periods, where strong south-westerly winds (downwelling), light intensity and salinity stratification could influence long spawning migrations. For <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes,</b> environmental variability influencing recruitment was further investigated {{on the west coast}} nursery grounds of the southern Benguela, particularly for deep-water Cape hake (Merluccius paradoxus). Biophysical characteristics of the west coast nursery grounds were assessed in relation to distribution of deep-water Cape hake juveniles (< 15 cm) using physical data (CTD, alongshore wind speed anomalies) and biological data (abundance/density of hake juveniles, recruitment estimates). Distinct spatial patterns of hake distribution were evident in relation to near-bottom environmental factors (temperature, salinity and oxygen). Nansen surveys conducted from 2003 – 2013 during summer (January – February) showed greater abundance of hake juveniles over the Orange Banks than in other nursery areas. The hake juveniles occurred in mid-shelf waters with oxygen depletion (2 – 3 mL O₂. L⁻¹) and hypoxic conditions (< 2 mL O₂. L⁻¹) and temperature ranges of 7 – 11 ⁰C. Salinity appeared to have less influence on hake juveniles' distribution. During spring surveys, hake catches were reduced on all nursery grounds except near Cape Columbine. There was a strong positive correlation between deep-water Cape hake recruitment indices and summer wind speed anomalies for the same year (Lag = 0 year) and with autumn wind speed anomalies of the previous year (Lag = 1 year). The relationship between winds and near-bottom oxygen concentrations on the Orange Banks is unclear and needs to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{offshore}} demersal hake trawl is {{the largest}} sector of the South African hake fishery, which targets shallow-water (Merluccius capensis) and deep-water (M. paradoxus) <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes.</b> Economically, {{it is the most}} important fishery in South Africa, generating ZAR ~ 5 billion in revenue, mainly from exports, and it supports an estimated 30 000 jobs. Whereas {{there are a number of}} single-species and ecosystem models that assess hake stock dynamics and examine the food web dynamics of the southern Benguela ecosystem, the human social hake fishery system is less understood. In order to address this need, this study's aims are to i) analyse the structure and dynamics of the economics of the South African offshore demersal hake trawl fishery from empirical data and stakeholder interviews, and ii) produce a prototype economic simulation model of this fishery to better understand the dynamics of the industry and the relative importance of its internal and external drivers, e. g. industrial organization, environmental uncertainty, exchange rate and fuel price. The empirical analyses confirm that the offshore hake trawl fishery is an economically mature and highly vertically integrated industry. That is, most companies control much of the value-chain, catching, processing, marketing and distributing their fish products, with access to economies of scope and scale. Nine company clusters, formed through consolidation of fishing rights and a variety of catch-share agreements, have been identified. Based on their size and operations they have been categorized as small, medium, large and super-cluster types. Fishing vessel numbers have declined since 1978 to streamline operations, with current effort optimising restrictions based on vessel engine power and the ability to catch the full quota. During the observation period (2005 - 2012), high-value export markets have bought 60 - 70 % of the South African hake total allowable catch (TAC), comprising nine major markets and a number of smaller ones. The lower-value domestic market takes ca. 30 % plus imports equivalent to another ca. 15 % of TAC. Hake export volumes have shifted from fresh to frozen and increasingly to value-added products, especially after the 2008 banking crisis. This corresponds to an industry-confirmed price-convergence between fresh and frozen hake products. This product displacement trend is largely due to changes in the largest export market, Spain, and is mirrored by an increased reliance on freezer trawling in the industry...|$|E

An age-structured production model was used as the operating model to simulate hypothetical fish resource population dynamics for which management quantities could be determined by the assessment models. Different stocks were simulated with various harvest rate histories. These harvest rates produced Downhill trip data, where harvest rates increase over time until the resource is close to collapse, and Good contrast data, where the harvest rate increases over time until the resource is at less than half of it’s exploitable biomass, and then it decreases allowing the resource to rebuild. The accuracy of the assessment models were determined when data were drawn from the operating model with various combinations of error. The age-structured production model was more accurate at estimating maximum sustainable yield, maximum sustainable yield level and the maximum sustainable yield ratio. The Schaefer model gave more accurate estimates of Depletion and Total Allowable Catch. While the assessment models were able to estimate management quantities using Downhill trip data, the estimates improved significantly when the models were tuned with Good contrast data. When autocorrelation in the spawner-recruit curve was not accounted for by the deterministic assessment model, inaccuracy in parameter estimates were high. The assessment model management quantities were not greatly affected by multinomial ageing error in the catch-at-age matrices at a sample size of 5000 otoliths. Assessment model estimates were closer to their true values when log-normal error were assumed in the catch-at-age matrix, even when the true underlying error were multinomial. However, the multinomial had smaller coefficients of variation at all sample sizes, between 1000 and 10000, of otoliths aged. It was recommended that the assessment model is chosen based on the management quantity of interest. When the underlying error is multinomial, the weighted log-normal likelihood function should be used in the catch-at-age matrix to obtain accurate parameter estimates. However, the multinomial likelihood should be used to minimise the coefficient of variation. Investigation into correcting for autocorrelation in the stock-recruitment relationship should be carried out, as it had a large effect on the accuracy of management quantities. ...|$|E
40|$|The South African {{demersal}} longline {{experiment is}} assessed {{with emphasis on}} the target species, kingklip Genypterus capensis. The hypothesis that kingklip on the South African coast comprise a unit stock is tested. Recommendations {{for the management of}} the fishery are made. Longlining was found to be commercially viable. Techniques have been developed to target on either kingklip or the <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes,</b> Herluccius capensis and H. paradoxus. Longline fishermen exploit the kingklip spawner stock from August to No v ember by taking advantage of prespawning aggregations on the South-East Coast. Effort switches to the West Coast in late summer and early winter where kingklip are less abundant and a larger proportion of hake is caught. Catch rates of kingklip on the South Coast have declined sharply and the resource there has been exploited at a rate greater than that required to retain 50 % of the unexploited biomass. There is a 17, 6 % probability that the spawner biomass on the South Coast has already been depleted below its pristine level. On the West Coast the catch rates of kingklip are lower than on the South Coast and have not changed significantly, although within the 95 % confidence limits {{there is a possibility that}} the resource there has also been depleted below 50 % of its pristine level. Genypterus capensis on the South African coast comprise a unit stock. Comparison of kingklip morphology using multivariate and discriminant function analysis and of otolith morphology using univariate statistics shows that there are no significant differences between the fish on the West and South Coasts. They are a slow growing species and were aged up to 25 years. Kingklip on the West Coast are smaller and have a lower L~ than those on the South Coast, but this is not a characteristic of discrete stocks. Kingklip on the South Coast mature earlier than those on the West Coast and aggregate to spawn on the South - East Coast in spring. There is no obvious spawning period on the West Coast. It is hypothesized that kingklip spawning on the South-East Coast is in response to favourable environmental conditions that enhances the survival of their eggs and larvae. It is recommended that demersal longlining be established as a permanent kingklip-directed fishery but that effort should not be allowed to increase. The West and South Coasts should be managed. separately. A TAC of 5 OOOt for kingklip should be introduced for 1989 of which 2 OOOt should be allocated to the West Coast and 3 OOOt to the South Coast. A closed season for kingklip from 1 August to 30 September on the South-East Coast is recommended. Hake-directed longlining should not be allowed as its effect on the hake spawner stocks are unknown and could be a potential threat to the stability of the demersal trawl fishery...|$|E

5000|$|According to the Worldwide Fund, {{the only}} Hake species not {{currently}} over-fished is <b>Cape</b> <b>hake,</b> found in Namibia. [...] Namibia {{is the only}} country that has increased its hake quota, from 130,000 tonnes in 2009 to 145,000 tonnes in 2010. Furthermore, the Local Ministry of Fisheries adheres to very strict rules regarding the catch of hake. For example, the closed seasons for hake lasts approximately two months, September and October, depending on the level of stock. This rule has been applied to ensure the regrowth of the hake population. Supplemental restrictions include forbidding trawling for Hake in less than 200 m depth (to avoid damaging non-target species habitat)and minimizing by-catch.|$|R
40|$|Sewage {{effluents}} disposed {{into the}} marine environment from De Beers Marine Namibia diamond mining vessels {{have the potential to}} cause endocrine disruptive effects in marine organisms. Endocrine disruption refers to the alteration of the normal functioning of the endocrine system and various chemicals have the ability to mimic hormones, effecting endogenous hormone synthesis, transport, receptor interaction and intracellular signaling. The potential endocrine disruptive effects, caused by the release of different types of sewage effluents into the ocean, on fish species is a concern due to the commercial importance of fish species found in the mining area e. g. hake, sole, horse mackerel. Increased awareness of marine environmental degradation due to the presence of chemical contaminants has resulted in research being done on early warning systems, in the form of biomarkers. Cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase 1 A (CYP 1 A) and vitellogenin (vtg) are important proteins found in fish liver and blood, that have been used as biomarkers for the detection of pollutants in fish. CYP 1 A is a subfamily of the P 450 superfamily of enzymes and catalyzes the oxidation, hydrolysis and reduction of exogenous and endogenous compounds (phase I reactions) and thus has the capacity to regulate the metabolism of several organic contaminants. CYP 1 A expression is altered by exposure to planar xenobiotic compounds e. g. polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Vtg is an important precursor for egg yolk proteins and plays a role in the growth and development of an oocyte. Expression of this protein is altered upon exposure to estrogenic compounds. The aim of this project was to isolate CYP 1 A from fish liver by differential centrifugation and optimize conditions for the CYP 1 A-mediated ethoxyresorufin-Odeethylase (EROD) assay and western blot analysis (to assess CYP 1 A expression). Another aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potential effects of biologically disruptive chemicals from sewage effluents, discharged into {{the marine environment}}, on the expression of CYP 1 A in two species of hake, Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus (<b>Cape</b> <b>hake).</b> CYP 1 A in <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> is approximately a 60 kDa protein and the highest EROD activity was detected in the microsomal fraction after differential centrifugation. Optimal EROD assay conditions were observed at pH 7. 5, a temperature of 25 °C, 10 μl of sample and a reaction time of 30 seconds. Enzyme stability assays indicated a drastic decrease in enzyme activity after 30 seconds. The EROD assay was not NADPH dependent but was limited by NADPH supply, with an increase of 300 % in EROD activity being observed with the addition of 0. 1 M exogenous NADPH. The addition of dicumarol (40 μM), a phase II enzyme inhibitor, showed a 232 % increase in EROD activity. This is because dicumarol inhibited enzymes with the capacity to metabolize the product (resorufin) of the EROD reaction. With regard to western blot analysis, the optimal primary (rabbit antifish CYP 1 A peptide) and secondary (anti-mouse/rabbit antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (POD)) antibody dilutions were determined to be 1 : 1000 and 1 : 5000, respectively. The comparison of CYP 1 A expression in <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> samples from De Beers Marine mining area and reference sites showed higher EROD activity (16. 29 ± 0. 91 pmol/min) in fish samples from the mining area in comparison to the reference site (10. 42 ± 2. 65 pmol/min). Western blot analysis was in agreement with the EROD assay results and a higher CYP 1 A expression was observed in fish from the mining sites. The increased CYP 1 A expression observed in fish from the mining area is not definitively an indication of a pollutant effect in the environment, as several environmental and biological factors (e. g. photoperiod and age) must also be considered before reaching this conclusion. Another aim of this study was to purify vtg from <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> blood samples. <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> vtg was purified from fish plasma by selective precipitation with MgCl 2 and EDTA. Precipitated sample was subjected to anion exchange chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Vtg eluted as two broad peaks and had a molecular weight above 200 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis also resolved smaller molecular weight proteins below 70 kDa, which were thought to be vitellogenin cleavage proteins, lipovitellin and phosphovitins. Western blot analysis was performed; however, it did not produce any conclusive results. The purification of vtg enables further studies in characterizing this protein and developing assay aimed at detecting estrogenic pollutants in the marine environmen...|$|R
