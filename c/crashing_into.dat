5|$|On 28 April 2015, the Augsburger Allgemeine, a German {{regional}} daily newspaper, {{published an}} article stating that according to Erich Bäcker, Lützow attempted an emergency landing at Donaumünster/Erlingshofen and crashed into the Danube. Bäcker made his claim based on reports made by eye-witnesses who saw a low flying Me262 <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the Danube that day.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, 1954, a D train {{relaying}} east of {{the station}} overshot the bumper blocks {{at the end of}} the track, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the wall {{at the end of the}} line. The train motorman was trapped in the tunnel for seven hours, and when he was freed, his left foot had to be amputated.|$|E

50|$|The car chase between Cobretti and the Night Slasher was {{originally}} longer and ended differently. In the theatrical version Nightslasher shoots at Cobretti's car and causes him to <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> the boat. In {{the original version}} Night Slasher and his driver are the first ones who <b>crash</b> <b>into</b> the boat; Cobretti fails to stop his car in time and <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> them. Shots of Night Slasher's car turning around and him breathing in relief after Cobra crashes his car were taken from an earlier part of the chase and the shot of Cobretti seeing the boat before he <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> it was actually taken from Nightslasher's car crash. In the theatrical version, Night Slasher's crashed car is still visible in scene where Cobretti <b>crashes</b> <b>into</b> the boat.|$|R
5|$|The {{storm surge}} {{significantly}} {{damaged or destroyed}} many homes along the James River, particularly in the towns of Claremont and Burwells Bay, Virginia. The surges in several tidal rivers caught some residents by surprise, both in height and severity. A man in Henrico County drowned after <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> a flooded creek.|$|E
5|$|During an {{inspection}} by Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner lures Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph and Nelson into a utility basement {{with the promise}} of free mountain bikes and locks the door. Bart escapes through a ventilation shaft and takes Groundskeeper Willie's tractor for a joyride, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> Superintendent Chalmers. Rather than giving him detention, Principal Skinner instead expels Bart. After Bart is quickly expelled from a new private Christian school, Marge decides to homeschool Bart.|$|E
5|$|Jules Naudet, a French cameraman, and Pavel Hlava, a Czech immigrant, videotaped the crash. A webcam {{set up by}} Wolfgang Staehle at an art {{exhibit in}} Brooklyn to take images of Lower Manhattan every four seconds also {{captured}} images of Flight11 <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the North Tower. A WNYW newscamera left rolling on the ground also captured audio of the crash and video of the immediate aftermath.|$|E

5|$|Sonny Siaki {{accompanied}} {{the team of}} Apolo and Lance Hoyt for their match with Kip James and Monty Brown next. Kip attempted to kick Apolo with a charging big boot, but accidentally hit Brown. This allowed Apolo to kick Kip {{in the face and}} cover for a near-fall. Brown then gained the win for his team after <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> Apolo with his signature Pounce maneuver at 9 minutes and 58 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Stewie {{discovers the}} Keebler Elves after <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the tree, {{who plan to}} kill their competition: Snap, Crackle and Pop, {{with the help of}} Judd Hirsch's nuclear weapon, which Peter views while peeking through a ball return at the bowling alley. Later on in the bar, Crackle and Pop are seen {{discussing}} an attack by the Keebler Elves which apparently resulted in Snap's death.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} risks, a massive testing program was started. By mid-1954, the first production drawings were issued and wind tunnel work began, along with extensive computer simulation studies carried out both in Canada and the United States using sophisticated computer programs. In a related program, nine instrumented free-flight models were mounted on solid fuel Nike rocket boosters and launched from Point Petre over Lake Ontario while two additional models were launched from the NACA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, over the Atlantic Ocean. These models were for aerodynamic drag and stability testing, flown {{to a maximum}} speed of Mach 1.7+ before intentionally <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the water.|$|E

5|$|In the village, the Expendables find several armed female villagers {{guarding}} {{their children}} from Vilain's forces. The local inhabitants are taken and put to work as slaves in the mine, never returning, and the women ask for the Expendables' help. The Sangs arrive for more villagers, but are ambushed by the Expendables and killed. After locating Vilain and the mine, the team assaults the area with their plane before deliberately <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the mine. The team saves the enslaved miners from execution, but Vilain and Hector escape with the plutonium. Vilain remotely detonates explosive charges in the mine; it collapses, trapping the miners and the Expendables.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, 2010, in a {{game against}} the Ottawa Senators, Phaneuf {{sustained}} an injury in the leg by having it cut open with a skate from Peter Regin while <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the boards. He was carried off the ice immediately and had surgery done the same night. Phaneuf was said to be off the ice for four-to-six weeks, and made a return to the Leafs' line-up on December 9, 2010, a home ice game against the Philadelphia Flyers, which Philadelphia won 4–1, though he had one assist on the lone Toronto goal.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s the authorities in Eilat have considered relocating the airport, approximately 20km north of Eilat, to the Ora Well area near Be'er Ora. There were numerous reasons behind this idea. Primarily, the fact that safety would be improved as in its current location, there is the chance of aircraft <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> buildings in the city. Other reasons were the pure value of the land which the airport occupies, {{and the fact that the}} airport is dividing the city of Eilat into two parts with the hotels and tourist areas on one side, and the residential buildings on the other.|$|E
5|$|At the , Webber <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> {{the back}} of Heikki Kovalainen's Lotus, sending the car flying through the air, {{collecting}} a track advertising board and landing upside down. The car then bounced back and <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> the tyre barrier at high speed. Webber received only minor injuries, but retired from the race.|$|R
50|$|On May 22, 1981, a TAME de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300 with {{registration}} HC-BAX <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> a fog-shrouded mountain near Zumba. It {{was flying}} in formation with a Beech 200 (HC-BHG), which also <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> the mountain. Fifteen passengers and three crew {{members on the}} Twin Otter died.|$|R

5|$|The Canadiens {{played the}} Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937. In the first period, Morenz {{went after the}} puck in the Chicago end while being chased by Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert. Morenz lost his balance {{and fell to the}} ice, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the boards and {{catching}} his left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz's left leg, creating a noise heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where it was found that his leg was fractured in four places.|$|E
5|$|The {{normal force}} {{is due to}} repulsive forces of {{interaction}} between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The normal force, for example, {{is responsible for the}} structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> an immobile surface.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very strong}} {{evidence}} that comets have previously been fragmented and collided with Jupiter and its satellites. During the Voyager missions to the planet, planetary scientists identified 13 crater chains on Callisto and three on Ganymede, the origin of which was initially a mystery. Crater chains seen on the Moon often radiate from large craters, and {{are thought to be}} caused by secondary impacts of the original ejecta, but the chains on the Jovian moons did not lead back to a larger crater. The impact of SL9 strongly implied that the chains were due to trains of disrupted cometary fragments <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the satellites.|$|E

5|$|An {{atmospheric}} probe {{was released from}} the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> and contaminating Europa.|$|E
5|$|Carrier Air Group 8 (CVG-8) was {{established}} on 15 September 1948 {{in response to}} the Berlin Blockade with newly qualified pilots and reservists who volunteered for active duty. VA-84 and VA-85, the air group's attack squadrons, began receiving Maulers in November and the last aircraft was delivered in January 1949. Later that month the air group made a flyover of President Harry Truman's Inauguration ceremony. The squadron conducted their qualifications aboard the Midway from 3 to 6 May with ten Maulers <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the safety barrier between them. CVG-8 made a two-week cruise aboard the Midway beginning on 27 June along the East Coast of the United States, before it was disbanded in November after the peaceful resolution of the Berlin Blockade.|$|E
5|$|Hornish began {{driving for}} Marlboro Team Penske during the 2004 IndyCar Series season in its No. 6 Dallara IR03-Toyota Indy V8, winning {{the season opener}} at Homestead-Miami in his first race with the team. After {{qualifying}} in 11th place at the Indianapolis 500, he battled for the lead with Buddy Rice and Dan Wheldon and led for nine laps (the first laps Hornish led in his Indianapolis 500 career). On lap 105, entering the main straightaway out of the fourth turn, Hornish tried to pass Darren Manning and Greg Ray's lapped car. They collided, <b>crashing</b> <b>into</b> the pit lane; Hornish finished 26th, dropping to ninth place in the point standings. The rest of his season was sub-par, with two podium finishes. Hornish was seventh in the championship standings with 387 points, his worst finish since he placed 21st in 2000.|$|E
