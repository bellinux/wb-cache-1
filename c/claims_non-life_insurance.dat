Mária Špaková Department: Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics Supervisor: RNDr. Michal Pešta Ph. D., MFF UK Abstract: This paper {{deals with the}} parameterization of claim size distributions in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> It consists of the theoretical and the practical part. In the first part we discuss the usual distributions of claims and their properties. One section is devoted to extreme values distributions. Consequently, we mention the most known methods for parameter estimation - the maximum likelihood method, the method of moments and the method of weighted moments. The last theoretical chapter is focused on some validation techniques and goodness-of-fit tests. In the practical part we apply some of the discussed approaches on real data. However, we concentrate mainly on the large claims modeling - firstly, we select a reasonable threshold for our data and then we fit the claims by the generalized Pareto distribution together with the introduced parameterization procedures. Based {{on the results of}} the applied validation methods we will choose appropriate models for the biggest <b>claims.</b> Keywords: parameterization, <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance,</b> <b>claims</b> distribution...|$|R

These include a general unit-linked life insurance contract driven by a Markov jump process and a <b>claim</b> process from <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> where the <b>claim</b> size distribution is affected by a traded price index.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{an issue of}} <b>claims</b> reserving for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> The issue is {{approached}} {{in a sense of}} analytical calculation and stochastic modelling. First, Chain-ladder, Bornhuetter-Ferguson, Benktander-Hovinen and Cape-Cod method are introduced. In following chapters, we try to find related stochastic underlying models including Generalized linear models and Mack's distribution-free approaches, we analyze second moments of claims estimates for each of the methods and examine alternative Merz-Wüthrich approach to reserve risk measurement. At the end, bootstrap algorithm and estimates are suggested and simulation results are compared with analytic ones...|$|R

40|$|This project {{studies the}} reserving problem for {{incurred}} but not reported (IBNR) <b>claims</b> in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> Based on an idea presented in Kremer (1995), we propose a new Poisson INAR (integer-valued autoregressive) {{model for the}} unclosed claim counts, which are the number of reported but not enough reported claims. The properties and the prediction of the proposed Poisson INAR model are discussed. We modify the estimation methods proposed in Silva et al. (2005) for the replicated INAR(1) processes {{to be applied to}} our model and introduce new algorithms for estimating the model parameters. The performance of three different estimation methods used in this project is compared, and the impact of the sample size to the accuracy of the estimates is examined in the simulation study.

40|$|In the {{presented}} thesis we {{deal with}} the generalized linear models framework in a claims reserving problem. <b>Claims</b> reserving in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> is firstly described and the considered class of models is introduced. Consequently, this branch of stochastic modelling is implemented in the reserving setup. For computation of the risk associated with claims reserving, we need a predictive distribution of future liabilities in order to evaluate risk measures such as Va- lue at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk. Since datasets in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> commonly consist of a small number of observations and estimation of predictive distributions can be complicated, we adopt a bootstrap method for this purpose. Model fitting, simulations and consequent measuring of the reserving risk are performed within the use of real-life data. Based on this, an analysis of fitted models and their comparison together with graphical outputs is included. ...|$|R
40|$|Generalized {{linear models}} (GLMs) and semiparametric {{extensions}} provide a flexible framework for analyzing the <b>claims</b> process in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> Currently, most applications are still based on traditional GLMs, where covariate effects are modelled {{in form of}} a linear predictor. However, these models may already be too restrictive if nonlinear effects of metrical covariates are present. Moreover, although data are often collected within longer time periods and come from different geographical regions, effects {{of space and time}} are usually totally neglected. We provide a Bayesian semiparametric approach, which allows to simultaneously incorporate effects of space, time and further covariates within a joint model. The method is applied to analyze costs of hospital treatment and accommodation for a large data set from a German health insurance company. ...|$|R

This type of provision is known by the acronym IBNR. After the introductory section containing a general introduction to the issue of <b>claims</b> reserving in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> different approaches to modeling of IBNR reserves are briefly presented. Subsequently, full attention is given to Chain-ladder method, which is most frequently used in the actuarial practise for the purpose of claims reserving. This method is then presented progressively from its simplest form of a simple computing algorithm followed by Mack's stochastic model to the last theoretical part of this part describing extended form of Chain-ladder method with relations between different groups of insurance portfolio included.

40|$|In {{this paper}} models for claim {{frequency}} and <b>claim</b> size in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> are considered. Both covariates and spatial random e ects are included allowing the modelling of a spatial dependency pattern. We assume a Poisson {{model for the}} number of claims, while claim size is modelled using a Gamma distribution. However, in contrast to the usual compound Poisson model going back to Lundberg (1903), we allow for dependencies between claim size and claim frequency. Both models for the individual and average claim sizes of a policyholder are considered. A fully Bayesian approach is followed, parameters are estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The issue of model comparison is thoroughly addressed. Besides the deviance information criterion suggested by Spiegelhalter et al. (2002), the predictive model choice criterion (Gelfand and Ghosh (1998)) and proper scoring rules (Gneiting and Raftery (2005)) based on the posterior predictive distribution are investigated. We give an application to a comprehensive data set from a German car insurance company. The inclusion of spatial e ects significantly improves the models for both claim frequency and claim size and also leads to more accurate predictions of the total claim sizes. Further we quantify the significant number of claims e ects on claim size. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{insurance}} market activity within financial development is gaining more attention in academia, as the sector experiences growth within emerging markets. This paper aims to understand which macro-economic and social variables impact the growth or {{decline of the}} <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> sector broadly across Africa, {{with a view to}} provide recommendations to drive increased penetration across the region. The study examines the explanatory factors of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand in Africa, using annual data from 1990 to 2013 on 28 countries. Using Fixed Effects Panel Data Regression, the study finds that: levels of income, and unemployment rates have a significant negative impact on <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand; whilst population growth rates, and the level of private sector credit (to GDP) positively impacted <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand. Urbanisation rates, and levels of merchandise trade had statistically insignificant effects on <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand. Since these variables only explained about 11 % of the variation in the dependent variable, the study suggests that further research into the cultural and institutional (ie.

An analysis of life insurance premium, group market is unconcentrated where as ordinary and industry markets are concentrated.

An analysis of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> premium, fire, marine and transportation and automobile markets are unconcentrated.
