40|$|International audienceDigital {{document}} categorization {{based on}} logo spotting and recognition has raised a {{great interest in}} the research <b>community</b> because <b>logos</b> in documents are sources of information for categorizing documents with low costs. In this paper, we present an approach to improve the result of our method for logo spotting and recognition based on keypoint matching and presented in our previous paper [7]. First, the keypoints from both the query document images and a given set of logos (logo gallery) are extracted and described by SIFT, and are matched in the SIFT feature space. Secondly, logo segmentation is performed using spatial density-based clustering. The contribution {{of this paper is to}} add a third step where homography is used to filter the matched keypoints as a postprocessing. And finally, in the decision stage, logo classification is performed by using an accumulating histogram. Our approach is tested using a well-known benchmark database of real world documents containing logos, and achieves good performances compared to state-of-the-art approaches...|$|R

Over the past decade, online, mobile and social media have also emerged as part of these branded landscapes. How have social media changed the ways in which companies and agencies develop and sustain relationships with potential consumers? Tracing the changes in the branding of telecommunications in Jamaica from public billboards and television advertisements (2001 - 2007) to forms of online advertising through social network sites such as Facebook (2008 - 2013), this article draws upon ethnographic research about interpretation of local and national culture by global telecommunications companies in the Caribbean. Building upon recent work in the study of consumption, new media as well as visual and sensory studies, I highlight the visual and aesthetic play and intimacy made possible through social media. I conclude by suggesting that social media expands the spaces for the consumption and circulation of mobile product and services and enables the aesthetic management of these products and services with consumers in novel ways...|$|R

40|$|Environmental print {{awareness}} {{refers to}} the stage of literacy development when children recognize familiar symbols and words, and display understanding and knowledge that print carries meaning. It {{has been well documented}} in literature that environmental print awareness influences the development of early literacy skills. This study was conducted to understand the development of environmental print awareness in kindergarten children. Thirty-eight typically developing Tamil speaking children enrolled in a English medium school and belonging to middle socioeconomic status, were followed from LKG to first grade. They were presented with 15 logos in English and 15 logos in Tamil as they appear in the environment. The 15 logos in each language belonged to three categories: child related, home related and community related. The children were presented with these stimuli every six months and their responses were recorded. Correct responses were given a score of 1 and wrong responses/ no responses were given a score of 0. The scores were analysed to look for a developmental trend in the awareness of environmental print. Results revealed that, across all the readings, children recognized child related logos best, followed by home related and then <b>community</b> related <b>logos.</b> In LKG, fewer logos were recognized and there were no differences in the recognition of English as compared to Tamil. In UKG and grade 1, more numbers of logos were recognized and English logos were recognized better than Tamil. The findings of this study have implications in creating literacy rich environments for children at home and school...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} fragmentation of the communities involved {{in the design of}} digital media for education. It draws on the experience gained at the Educational Technology Lab in the design of Logo-based microworlds with three different platforms respectively based on component computing, 3 D game engines and 3 D navigation with a GIS. The construct of halfbaked microworlds is used to discuss how the <b>Logo</b> <b>community</b> can contribute to the quest for integrated design. These kinds of microworlds implicitly exist within the community, but they can be explicitly designed mediated and put to use in the role of facilitators for integrated design and development to enable a growing communication amongst researchers, technicians, teachers and students. I use the term “half-baked ” microworlds to describe digital media designed to facilitate communication between researchers, technicians, teachers and students as they become engaged in changing them. Microworlds have been the main Logo-based vehicles through which the key ideas of generation of meanings through communicational and constructionist activity have been mediated within the field of instructional design (Goldenberg, 1999).

40|$|Magister Theologiae - MThChristianity {{has been}} diverse from its beginning, with local congregations {{established}} in different geographic contexts. Over the centuries it has been, and still is, subject to further fragmentation. The rise of Pentecostalism {{during the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth century has led to further fragmentation, also in South Africa. This study will contribute to the sub-discipline of contemporary church history by examining the ecumenical relationships between local churches. It will investigate the ongoing fragmentation of Christianity through the establishment of twelve new Pentecostal churches in the suburb of Belhar since the start of the century (2000 - 2013). These include: Breakthrough Christian Church, City of Grace (Living Waters) Community Centre, Philia <b>Community</b> Worship Centre, <b>Logos</b> Assembly of God Ministries, Belhar Lighthouse Family Church, Living Word and Faith Temple Church, Open Doors Full Gospel Church, Faith Christian Fellowship Church, New Birth Pentecostal Church, Moria Gemeentes Church, Edon Elohim Pentecostal Ministries and Pentecostal Church of Jesus Christ. The questions that will be posed in this study are why such churches came into being, what attracts members to these newly established churches and how they understand the relationships with other Pentecostal churches and so-called mainline churches in Belhar and further afield. The research problem that will therefore be addressed is: “What are the factors contributing to the continual fragmentation of Christian churches in Belhar from 2000 to 2013 ?” By documenting the establishment, growth and ecumenical relations of such churches, this study will seek to enhance the understanding of the factors that led to further and rapid fragmentation of Christianity in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{resurgence}} {{in the social}} significance of sustainability with the recent concerns of global warming, although sustainability {{is not a new}} idea. Environmental concerns began on a national level in 1970, but it is again a `hot 2 ̆ 7 topic, and businesses want the appearance of being ecologically friendly. It has become fashionable to be 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 or to give the appearance of being 2 ̆ 2 green. 2 ̆ 2 A visual identity does more than represent a company, product, or service; they trigger emotions, create desires and forge <b>communities.</b> A <b>logo</b> is just one element of a corporate identity system, but it is arguably one of the most important. Successful logos share several qualities: they are distinct, they are decipherable at any size, they have the capacity to be used in color or black and white, they translate well across a broad range of media, and they hold the possibility for animation. Logos communicate a corporation 2 ̆ 7 s visual identity on a qualitative level in order to improve the image of the company. This thesis utilizes studies in Psychology, branding, and explorations of logos-both style and classification-to create a proposal for a standard process when designing 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 corporate identities. The {{purpose of this study is}} to create a process for designers to use when creating visual identities for 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 industries. These identities should be unique and memorable without using clichy images or colors and which communicate the message of the product, service, or company. This study will examine the re-branding process and different methods of classifying trademarks and logos; such as style, material and referential qualities, and motifs. Responsible analysis of present trademarks and logos will show that the most successful marks are those where careful research of the corporate identity was completed. In most cases, the designer is working with a product that is not a concrete image, such as energy or electricity, or with images that are not aesthetic, such as biowaste. The results will show that to create a distinctive logo designers must look at the processes involved in the production of these commodities. Fulcrum Bioenergy is a relatively new company (2008), which uses a thermochemical process to convert municipal solid waste (garbage) into cellulosic ethanol that is used in fuel for transportation vehicles. The name of the company, Fulcrum, originated in a brainstorming session, not exactly because of the process the waste goes through to be converted to ethanol, but because they see the biofuel industry as a pivot and their company as the 2 ̆ 2 fulcrum 2 ̆ 2 leveraging new technologies with the social and environmental benefits of using garbage to create ethanol. A fulcrum is something that supplies the capability for action and each step of the thermochemical process is viewed as a fulcrum. The triangular shapes of the symbol within the logo (Figure 1) have a duel meaning: they represent the shape of a fulcrum and reflect transformation (the symbol is an abstract butterfly) ...|$|R
40|$|In Theorizing Asian America Lingyan Yang articulates the {{urgently}} needed theory, politics, methods, and ethics of Asian American Feminist Cultural Criticism and Literature {{in the global}} and diasporic context, turning every theoretical aporia into political possibilities and every political impossibility into theoretical contestations. ^ Yang compares and connects the texts and thoughts of the Asian American and the Asian diasporic postcolonial women intellectuals, which have inaugurated, defined, shaped and re-directed the intellectual history of Asian America, the inter-disciplinary history of Asian American Studies, and the feminist history of theorizing Asian American women and Asian American women theorizing. She defines Asian American and Asian diasporic women 2 ̆ 7 s cultural criticism and literature in English as that which is authored by North American women intellectuals and writers of Asian origin, specifically East Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian American and Asian diasporic, who were born in or have immigrated to, migrated to, or resided in North America, whose works have been published by, consumed by and circulating in the First World. On the disputed nationality of Asian American Studies, Yang questions Asian American cultural nationalism 2 ̆ 7 s problematic binary between the domestic Asian America and the global and diasporic postcoloniality. She re-conceptualizes the limits and boundaries of the idealism of Asian American communities by exposing the complicity between the <b>logos</b> of the <b>community</b> and the <b>logos</b> of the racialist, gendered and classed capitalist nation through reading Kogawa 2 ̆ 7 s Obasan and Ghosh 2 ̆ 7 s The Shadow Lines. Drawing from Foucault, Gramsci, Spivak and Said, {{she is the first}} to articulate a worldly Asian American feminist intellectual ethics. ^ Writing about a wide range of critical possibilities and contradictions, Yang raises the important questions on interdisciplinarity, institutionalization, community, and representation, taking neither theory nor politics lightly. She insists on the inclusive, engaged, progressive, decolonized and feminist humanism in theorizing the unsettling relationships between theory and politics, theory and practice, theory and minor/other discourses. Theorizing Asian America will be a unique contribution to contemporary critical cultural theories in general, and Asian American cultural criticism, postcoloniality, feminist theories, diaspora and ethnic studies in particular. ...|$|R
