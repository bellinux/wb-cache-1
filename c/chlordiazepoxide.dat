5|$|Long-acting {{compounds}} have a half-life of 40–250 hours. They have {{a risk of}} accumulation in {{the elderly}} and in individuals with severely impaired liver function, {{but they have a}} reduced severity of rebound effects and withdrawal. Examples are diazepam, clorazepate, <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> and flurazepam.|$|E
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, or {{time it takes for}} the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for <b>chlordiazepoxide.</b> The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2007, Adams {{was found}} {{unconscious}} {{in his bed}} by his youngest son (age 7) at their Tampa, Florida home. His son called 911, but Adams was pronounced dead by paramedics when they arrived. The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} of mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the sedatives <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs in his system were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E
5|$|Withdrawal is best {{managed by}} {{transferring}} the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam {{because it has}} the longest half-life {{of all of the}} benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses. A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form, which allows for even smaller reductions. <b>Chlordiazepoxide,</b> which also has a long half-life and long-acting active metabolites, can be used as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|Brian Keith Adams (April 14, 1964 – August 13, 2007) was an American {{professional}} wrestler. Adams is {{well known}} for his time with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), under the name Crush, and for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under his real name Brian Adams. Trained in Japan by Antonio Inoki, he was a two-time WCW World Tag Team Champion and a one-time WWF Tag Team Champion and a one-time AJPW World Tag Team Champion, among other titles and accomplishments. In 2002, he briefly tried a career in boxing until he was forced to retire due to back and shoulder injuries. He died of accidental respiratory failure from a combination of buprenorphine, carisoprodol, <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> and alprazolam.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory tests {{assessing}} the toxicity of <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> nitrazepam and diazepam on mice spermatozoa found that <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> produced toxicities in sperm including abnormalities involving both {{the shape and}} size of the sperm head. Nitrazepam, however, caused more profound abnormalities than <b>chlordiazepoxide.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> was {{discovered}} in 1959. It was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesized and the discovery of <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> was by pure chance. <b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> and other benzodiazepines were initially accepted with widespread public approval but were followed with widespread public disapproval and recommendations for more restrictive medical guidelines for its use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> (initially called methaminodiazepoxide) was {{the first}} {{benzodiazepine}} to be synthesised in the mid-1950s. <b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> was synthesised from work on a chemical dye, quinazolone-3-oxides. It was discovered by accident when in 1957 tests revealed that the compound had hypnotic, anxiolytic and muscle relaxant effects. Three years later <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> was marketed as a therapeutic benzodiazepine medication under the brand name Librium. Following <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> in 1963 diazepam hit the market under the brand name Valium - and was followed by many further benzodiazepine compounds over the subsequent years and decades.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> is a {{drug that}} is very {{frequently}} involved in drug intoxication, including overdose. <b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> overdose is considered a medical emergency and, in general, requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. The antidote for an overdose of <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. Flumazenil should be given with caution as it may precipitate severe withdrawal symptoms in benzodiazepine-dependent individuals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> is a long-acting {{benzodiazepine}} drug. The half-life of <b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> is 5 – 30 hours but has {{an active}} benzodiazepine metabolite (desmethyldiazepam), {{which has a}} half-life of 36 – 200 hours. The half-life of <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration. Delayed body clearance of the long half-life active metabolite also occurs in those over 60 years of age, which further prolongs {{the effects of the}} drugs with additional accumulation after repeated dosing.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the major}} {{interactions}} involving <b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> are listed below.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> {{taken during}} {{pregnancy}} {{can cause a}} postnatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In animal models, {{the oral}} {{median lethal dose}} of <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> is 537mg/kg.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> is {{available}} in various dosage forms, alone or {{in combination with other}} drugs, worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Internationally, <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> is a Schedule IV {{controlled}} drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} into the safety of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is limited and {{it is recommended that}} use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy should be based on whether the benefits outweigh the risks. If <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> is used during pregnancy the risks can be reduced via using the lowest effective dose and for the shortest time possible. Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy. <b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> and diazepam are considered to be among the safer benzodiazepines to use during pregnancy in comparison to other benzodiazepines. Possible adverse effects from benzodiazepine use during pregnancy include, abortion, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, functional deficits, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Caution is also advised during breast feeding as <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> passes into breast milk.|$|E
25|$|Primidone {{has been}} used in {{cerebral}} palsy. In 1953, Plum and Sparup found that out of thirty-three patients, twenty had a favorable or moderate response. Thorn reported in 1962 that sixteen patients responded favorably to both primidone and <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> and four to only primidone. Nine patients responded only to <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> and four responded to neither drug. The best results were obtained in athetosis and rigidity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> {{is a drug}} of {{potential}} misuse and is frequently detected in urine samples of drug users {{who have not been}} prescribed the drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> {{can cause}} {{physical}} dependence {{and what is}} known as the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those seen with alcohol and barbiturates. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible through a slow and gradual dose-reduction regime.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Carl F. Essig of the Addiction Research Center of the National Institute of Mental Health {{stated that}} meprobamate, glutethimide, ethinamate, ethchlorvynol, {{methyprylon}} and <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> as drugs whose usefulness {{can hardly be}} questioned. However, Essig labeled these newer products as drugs of addiction, like barbiturates, whose habit-forming qualities were more widely known. He mentioned a 90-day study of <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> which concluded that the automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal. Participants' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> has {{a medium}} to long {{half-life}} but its active metabolite {{has a very}} long half-life. The drug has amnestic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide,</b> {{trade name}} Librium, is a {{sedative}} and hypnotic medication of the benzodiazepine class; {{it is used}} to treat anxiety, insomnia and withdrawal symptoms from alcohol and/or drug abuse.|$|E
25|$|Phenobarbital is {{sometimes}} used for alcohol detoxification and benzodiazepine detoxification for its sedative and anticonvulsant properties. The benzodiazepines <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> (Librium) and oxazepam (Serax) have largely replaced phenobarbital for detoxification.|$|E
25|$|The {{elimination}} half-life of diazepam and <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> as well {{as other}} long half-life benzodiazepines, is twice as long in the elderly compared to younger individuals. Many doctors do not adjust benzodiazepine dosage according to age in elderly patients.|$|E
25|$|Delirium tremens due {{to alcohol}} {{withdrawal}} {{can be treated}} with benzodiazepines. High doses {{may be necessary to}} prevent death. Amounts given are based on the symptoms. Typically the person is kept sedated with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, lorazepam, <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> or oxazepam.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> is {{generally}} considered an inappropriate benzodiazepine for the elderly due to its long elimination half-life and the risks of accumulation. Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, pregnancy, children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.|$|E
25|$|In Hong Kong {{abuse of}} {{prescription}} medicinal preparations continued in 2006 and seizures of midazolam (120,611 tablets), nimetazepam/nitrazepam (17,457 tablets), triazolam (1,071 tablets), diazepam (48,923 tablets) and <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> (5,853 tablets) were made. Heroin addicts used such tablets (crushed and mixed with heroin) {{to prolong the}} effect of the narcotic and ease withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Chronic use of benzodiazepines, such as <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> {{leads to}} the {{development}} of tolerance, with a decrease in number of benzodiazepine binding sites in mouse forebrain. The Committee of Review of Medicines, who carried out an extensive review of benzodiazepines including <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> found - and were in agreement with the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the conclusions of a study carried out by the White House Office of Drug Policy and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (USA) - that there was little evidence that long-term use of benzodiazepines were beneficial in the treatment of insomnia due {{to the development of}} tolerance. Benzodiazepines tended to lose their sleep-promoting properties within 314 days of continuous use, and in the treatment of anxiety the committee found that there was little convincing evidence that benzodiazepines retained efficacy in the treatment of anxiety after 4 months' continuous use due to the development of tolerance.|$|E
25|$|In {{tests in}} {{pentobarbital}} trained rhesus monkeys benzodiazepines produced effects similar to barbiturates. In a 1991 study, triazolam {{had the highest}} self-administration rate in cocaine trained baboons, among the five benzodiazepines examined: alprazolam, bromazepam, <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> lorazepam, triazolam. A 1985 study found that triazolam and temazepam maintained higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. A 1991 study indicated that diazepam, in particular, had a greater abuse liability among people who were drug abusers than did many of the other benzodiazepines. Some of the available data also suggested that lorazepam and alprazolam are more diazepam-like in having relatively high abuse liability, while oxazepam, halazepam, and possibly <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> are relatively low in this regard. A 1991–1993 British study found that the hypnotics flurazepam and temazepam were more toxic than average benzodiazepines in overdose. A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Long {{half-life}} benzodiazepines like diazepam or <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> are {{preferred to}} minimize rebound effects {{and are available}} in low potency dose forms. Some people may not fully stabilize between dose reductions, even when the rate of reduction is slowed. Such people sometimes simply need to persist as they may not feel better until they have been fully withdrawn from them {{for a period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|The {{risk factors}} for {{benzodiazepine}} dependence are long-term use beyond four weeks, use of high doses, use of potent short-acting benzodiazepines, dependent personalities, and proclivity for drug abuse. Use of short-acting benzodiazepines leads to repeated withdrawal effects that are alleviated by the next dose, which reinforce in the individual the dependence. A physical dependence develops more quickly with higher potency benzodiazepines such as alprazolam (Xanax) than with lower potency benzodiazepines such as <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> (Librium).|$|E
25|$|A 1985 {{study found}} that {{temazepam}} and triazolam maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over {{all the rest of the}} benzodiazepines included in the study.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam was {{the second}} {{benzodiazepine}} invented by Dr. Leo Sternbach of Hoffmann-La Roche at the company's Nutley, New Jersey, facility following <b>chlordiazepoxide</b> (Librium), which was approved for use in 1960. Released in 1963 as an improved version of Librium, diazepam became incredibly popular, helping Roche to become a pharmaceutical industry giant. It is 2.5 times more potent than its predecessor, which it quickly surpassed in terms of sales. After this initial success, other pharmaceutical companies began to introduce other benzodiazepine derivatives.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{treating}} withdrawal symptoms. If delirium tremens occurs, aggressive treatment improves outcomes. Treatment {{in a quiet}} intensive care unit with sufficient light is often recommended. Benzodiazepines are the medication of choice with diazepam, lorazepam, <b>chlordiazepoxide,</b> and oxazepam all commonly used. They should be given until a person is lightly sleeping. The antipsychotic haloperidol may also be used. The vitamin thiamine is recommended. Mortality without treatment is between 15% and 40%. Currently death occurs in about 1% to 4% of cases.|$|E
