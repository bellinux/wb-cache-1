40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{investigated}} the peak <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> {{characteristics of the}} flux-lock type superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) with two magnetically coupled circuits. The flux-lock type SFCL with two magnetically coupled circuits has the similar fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics to the flux-lock type SFCL using its third winding. The <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> operation of the SFCL is performed by the generation of the magnetic flux between two coils when a fault happens and the fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics of the SFCL are dependent on the winding direction of two coils. To confirm it, the peak <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics of this SFCL were analyzed based on its electrical equivalent circuit and the fault limiting characteristics of this SFCL were investigated through the fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> experiment. Through the analysis on the short-circuit results, it was shown that the <b>limited</b> fault <b>current</b> could be adjusted by the winding direction of two coils...|$|R

25|$|Speaking at {{the first}} Gatwick Airport Consultative Committee (Gatcom) meeting since GIP's {{takeover}} of the airport (held on 28 January 2010 at Crawley's Arora Hotel), Gatwick's chairman Sir David Rowlands ruled out building a second runway for the foreseeable future, citing {{the high cost of}} the associated planning application – estimated to be between £100million and £200million – as the main reason for the new owners' lack of interest. At that meeting, Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate stressed GIP's preference for increasing the existing runway's capacity and confirmed GIP's plans to request an increase in the <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> on the permitted number of take-offs and landings. However, in 2012, Gatwick's new owners reversed their initial lack of interest in building a second runway at the airport for the foreseeable future. On 3 December 2012, chief executive Stewart Wingate argued in front of the House of Commons Transport Select Committee that allowing Gatwick to add a second runway to relieve the growing airport capacity shortage in the South East of England once the agreement with West Sussex County Council preventing it from doing so had expired in 2019 served the interests of the 12million people living in its catchment area better than building a third runway at Heathrow or a new four-runway hub airport in the Thames Estuary. In support of his argument, Wingate stated that expanding Heathrow or building a new hub in the Thames Estuary was more environmentally damaging, more expensive, less practical and risked negating the benefits of ending common ownership of Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted by the erstwhile BAA. Wingate contrasted this with the greater range of flights and improved connectivity including to hitherto un-/underserved emerging markets that would result from a second runway at Gatwick by the mid-2020s as this would enable it to compete with Heathrow on an equal footing to increase consumer choice and reduce fares. In this context, Wingate also accused his counterpart at Heathrow, Colin Matthews, of overstating the importance of transfer traffic by pointing to research by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). This counts the number of air travel bookings made by passengers passing through the IATA-designated London area airports and shows that only 7% of these passengers actually change flights there. Wingate believes this to be a more accurate measure of the share of passengers accounted for by transfer traffic at these airports than the more widely used alternative based on survey data collated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA survey data relies on the number of passengers changing flights at these airports as reported by the airlines to the airport authorities and shows that fewer than 20% of all passengers actually change flights there.|$|E
500|$|Elite League teams {{rely heavily}} on players from outside the United Kingdom (termed imports). The {{majority}} of these players are from North America, and typically played in the minor North American leagues such as the ECHL and AHL before coming to Britain. For example, of the 21 players to play for champions Belfast Giants in the 2005–06 season, 10 were Canadian, 8 were British and 3 were American. The league restricts the number of import players which can be dressed for a game, with a <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> of 14 imports.

500|$|Crisis Core uses a slot machine-like {{mechanic}} {{to affect}} the combat system. The [...] "Digital Mind Wave" [...] (DMW) features two sets of three spinning wheels; one set with the numbers one through seven, and another with pictures of characters that Zack befriends during the game. The DMW automatically spins as long as Zack has at least 10 [...] "Soldier Points", which are awarded to the player by defeating foes. If the DMW stops with the same three pictures lined up, Zack will then perform an appropriate Limit Break attack that can greatly harm an enemy or significantly heal Zack. Additionally, in this case, if the number slots give {{two or more of}} the same number, the materia in that slot will power up. Should the numbers line up as [...] "777", Zack will gain an experience level, increasing his health, soldier points, and ability points. If there is no match in the pictures, matching numbers on the slots will grant temporary bonuses, such as limited invincibility or zero-cost use of skills and abilities. The chance of matching pictures is tied to the <b>current</b> <b>Limit</b> level, which is raised by taking damage in battle and reduced upon successful battles, and after certain storyline events. After collecting certain items in the game, the pictures on the DMW may also randomly change to summonable creatures, which have more destructive and beneficial Limit Breaks should the pictures match up.|$|E

40|$|Keywords:hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse, arc trigger, {{fault current}} limiter, current density Abstract. With {{conventional}} high voltage <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse, the rated current is usually below 200 A. The rated current {{of the state}} of the art arc triggering hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse is only 600 A, with its interrupting capability being 25 kA, and still can’t meet the requirements of modern industrial application. With the arc triggering hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuses, the major obstacle to higher rated current and interrupting capability lies in the long operation time of the arc trigger. Increasing the current density of arc trigger notches can effectively improve the operation speed of the trigger. Simulation and parameter optimization of the arc trigger are conducted by using ANSYS 11. 0 to attain the optimal fuse element structure. In this study, the notch current density of the arc trigger was as high as 3300 A/mm 2, and the trigger can be used in the hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse of rated 35 kV, 2 kA and 40 kA interrupting capability...|$|R

50|$|Ideally, {{there would}} be one <b>current</b> <b>limit</b> per wire, {{but that would be}} prohibitively expensive.
