2500|$|Xu's {{choice of}} {{sections}} appears {{in large part}} to have been driven by the desire to create an unbroken, systematic sequence among the headers themselves, such that each had a natural, intuitive relationship (e.g., structural, semantic or phonetic) with the ones before and after, {{as well as by the}} desire to reflect cosmology. In the process, he included many section headers that are not considered ones today, such as 炎 (yán [...] "flame") and 熊 (xióng [...] "bear"), which modern dictionaries list under the 火 or 灬 (huǒ [...] "fire") heading. He also included as section headers all the sexagenary cycle characters, that is, the ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches. As a result, unlike modern dictionaries which attempt to maximize the number of characters under each section header, 34 Shuowen headers have no characters under them, while 159 have only one each. From a modern lexicographical perspective, Xu's system of 540 headings can seem [...] "enigmatic" [...] and [...] "illogical". For instance, he included the singular section header 409 惢 (ruǐ [...] "doubt"), with only one rare character (ruǐ 繠 [...] "stamen"), instead of listing it under the <b>common</b> <b>header</b> 408 心 (xīn [...] "heart; mind").|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a {{new method}} for {{implementing}} cryptographic hash functions is proposed. This method seeks {{to improve the}} speed of the hash function particularly when a large set of messages with similar blocks such as documents with <b>common</b> <b>headers</b> are to be hashed. The method utilizes the peculiar run-time reconfigurability feature of FPGA. Essentially, when a block of message that is commonly hashed is identified, the hash value is stored in memory so that in subsequent occurrences of the message block, the hash value {{does not need to be}} recomputed; rather it is simply retrieved from memory, thus giving a significant increase in speed. The system is self-learning and able to dynamically build on its knowledge of frequently occurring message blocks without intervention from the user. The specific hash function to which this technique was applied is Blake, one of the SHA- 3 finalists...|$|R

40|$|An {{interactive}} visualization tool, Visualizing Metra, {{was developed}} for Metra, Chicago’s regional commuter rail system, to support decision-makers in different departments requiring information about Metra’s stations, lines, ridership, land use, surrounding stations and connections to other transportation facilities. The application was developed as an intranet application in Macromedia Dreamweaver with a scalable base map with embedded links. The application allows the user to navigate visual, quantitative and text data. The strength of the application lies in its design. The design developed a template for each level in a spatial hierarchy providing a consistent approach to accessing information based on scale. Each level provides access to many different functions with <b>common</b> <b>headers</b> for navigation. The main frame has a GIS map of the station and surrounding suburbs. A zoom tools allows the user to see more or less detail. The secondary frames include track video and a slide show of the station area. The track video is accessible by clicking on the secondary window or on the video icon in the main window. Functions available at other levels include: * System level- ability to navigate directly to a line or station * Line level- zoom tool and ability to navigate directly to a station via a list or the map * Station and nearby blocks level- aerial photographs, socioeconomic data for the community * Station level- access to detailed Autocad representation of station information, and navigable station panoramas * Station building level- parking information The prototype was developed in collaboration with Metra staff to address their needs for access to and display of information.

Just like the D-type package boiler, fire heats the tubes surroundings causing the tubes to increase in temperature thus boiling off water molecules to steam. A-type package boilers were designed to improve package boiler reliability and reduce tube replacements. A-type package boilers are smaller than D-type therefore will fit smaller plants, but {{does not have the}} same power output as D-type package boilers.|$|E

40|$|Summary A {{number of}} commercially {{promoted}} boiler economy devices {{have been tested}} for their effect on the operation of a twin boiler system in a working primary school. Both boiler efficiency and site gas usage were measured. It was found {{that most of the}} devices had no effect on either aspect of per-formance. The only device to produce measurable reductions in gas usage and an increase in boiler effi-ciency appeared to achieve this by effecting unacceptable reductions in average boiler temperature.

5000|$|The Single Compilation Unit {{technique}} uses pre-processor directives to [...] "glue" [...] different translation units {{together at}} compile time {{rather than at}} link time. This reduces the overall build time, due to eliminating the duplication, but increases the incremental build time (the time required after making a change to any single source file that {{is included in the}} Single Compilation Unit), due to requiring a full rebuild of the entire unit if any single input file changes. Therefore, this technique is appropriate for a set of infrequently modified source files with significant overlap (many or expensive common headers or templates), or source files that frequently require recompilation together, such as due to all including a <b>common</b> <b>header</b> or template that changes frequently.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a common}} rail system, the fuel from {{the fuel tank}} is {{supplied}} to the <b>common</b> <b>header</b> (called the accumulator). This fuel is then sent through tubing to the injectors, which inject it into the combustion chamber. The header has a high pressure relief valve to maintain the pressure in the header and return the excess fuel to the fuel tank. The fuel is sprayed {{with the help of}} a nozzle that is opened and closed with a needle valve, operated with a solenoid. When the solenoid is not activated, the spring forces the needle valve into the nozzle passage and prevents the injection of fuel into the cylinder. The solenoid lifts the needle valve from the valve seat, and fuel under pressure is sent in the engine cylinder. Third-generation common rail diesels use piezoelectric injectors for increased precision, with fuel pressures up to [...]|$|E
50|$|Saturated steam at 600 psi is channeled {{from each}} steam {{generator}} to a <b>common</b> <b>header,</b> where the steam is {{then sent to}} the main engine, electrical generators, aircraft catapult system, and various auxiliaries. There are two main propulsion turbines, one high pressure turbine and one low pressure turbine, with a moisture separator in place between the two. The Low Pressure main propulsion turbine is double-ended, whereby the steam enters at the center and divides into two streams as it enters the actual turbine wheels, expanding and giving up its energy as it does so, causing the turbine to spin at high speed. The main shaft enters a reduction gear in which the high rotational velocity of the turbine shaft is stepped down to a usable turn rate for propelling the ship. The expended steam from the main engine and other auxiliaries enters condensers to be cooled into liquid water and recycled to the feed system.|$|E

Even if an extension has not been formally documented, as was the case for many <b>common</b> email <b>headers,</b> it is usually easy to reverse-engineer them. Since most values are textual, the space penalty is limited to the parameter names, usually at most a few tens of bytes per request. (Indeed, the ASN. 1 PER-encoded H. 323 signaling messages are larger than equivalent SIP messages.) Besides, extreme space efficiency is not a concern for signaling protocols.

Transient analysis models have been developed for typical fuel gas systems of combined cycle plants to ensure that the system is configured to respond appropriately to unplanned disturbances in fuel gas flow such as when a gas turbine trip occurs. Pressure control (regulator) and booster compressor control loop tuning parameters based on quantitative transient model results could be applied to set up targets for use in specifying and commissioning the fuel gas system.
