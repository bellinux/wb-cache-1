At room temperature, the material behavior is controlled by plasticity, resulting in a rate-independent and cyclically stable behavior. The material exhibits significant cyclic hardening at intermediate temperatures, 673 K to 873 K (400 0 C to 600 0 C), with negative strain rate sensitivity, due to dynamic strain aging.

40|$|In July of 1999, a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) was {{undertaken}} between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Solar Turbines, Inc. and Caterpillar, Inc. (Caterpillar Technical Center) to evaluate commercial cast stainless steels for {{gas turbine engine}} and diesel engine exhaust component applications relative to the materials currently being used. If appropriate, {{the goal was to}} develop cast stainless steels with improved performance and reliability rather than switch to more costly cast Ni-based superalloys for upgraded performance. The gas-turbine components considered for the Mercury- 50 engine were the combustor housing and end-cover, and the center-frame hot-plate, both made from commercial CF 8 C <b>cast</b> <b>austenitic</b> stainless <b>steel</b> (Fe-l 9 Cr- 12 Ni-Nb,C), which is generally limited to use at below 650 C. The advanced diesel engine components considered for truck applications (C 10, C 12, 3300 and 3400) were the exhaust manifold and turbocharger housing made from commercial high SiMo ductile cast iron with uses limited to 700 - 750 C or below. Shortly after the start of the CRADA, the turbine materials emphasis changed to wrought 347 H stainless steel (hot-plate) and after some initial baseline tensile and creep testing, it was confirmed that this material was typical of those comprising the abundant database; and by 2000, the emphasis of the CRADA was primarily on diesel engine materials. For the diesel applications, commercial SiMo cast iron and standard <b>cast</b> CN 12 <b>austenitic</b> stainless <b>steel</b> (Fe- 25 Cr- 13 Ni-Nb,C,N,S) baseline materials were obtained commercially. Tensile and creep testing from room temperature to 900 C showed the CN 12 <b>austenitic</b> stainless <b>steel</b> to have far superior strength compared to SiMo cast iron above 550 C, together with outstanding oxidation resistance. However, aging at 850 C reduced room-temperature ductility of the standard CN 12, and creep-rupture resistance at 850 C was less than expected, which triggered a focused laboratory-scale alloy development effort on modified <b>cast</b> <b>austenitic</b> stainless <b>steels</b> at ORNL. Isothermal fatigue testing at 700 C also showed that standard CN 12 was far superior to SiMo cast iron, but somewhat less than the desired behavior. During the first year, 3 new modified CF 8 C heats and 8 new modified CN 12 heats were made, based on compositional changes specifically designed to change the nature, dispersion and stability of the as-cast and high-temperature aging-induced microstructures that consisted of carbides and other precipitate phases. Screening of the alloys at room-temperature and at 850 C (tensile and creep-rupture) showed -a ten-fold increase in rupture life of the best modified CN 12 relative to the baseline material, better room-temperature ductility after aging, caused by less precipitation in the as-cast material and much less aging-induced precipitation. The best new modified CF 8 C steel showed strength at tensile and creep-rupture strength comparable to standard CN 12 steel at 850 C, due to a unique and very stable microstructure.

With this objective in mind, measurements for the experiment were restricted to techniques that should be robust if carried forward to eventual field implementation. Two parameters were investigated for their ability to discriminate between different microstructures in CASS components. The first parameter was a time-of-flight ratio of a normal incidence shear wave to that of a normal incidence longitudinal wave (TOFRSL). The ratio removed dependency on component thickness which may not be accurately reported in the field. The second parameter was longitudinal wave attenuation. The selected CASS specimens provided five equiaxed-grain material samples and five columnar-grain material samples for a two-class discrimination problem. Qualitative TOFRSL estimates and a threshold algorithm classified all 10 material samples correctly and indicated a reliable and robust technique. Qualitative longitudinal wave attenuation estimates and a threshold algorithm also classified all 10 materials samples correctly; however, the technique was not as robust as TOFRSL.

40|$|Owing {{to their}} low {{ductility}} at room temperature, heat resistant <b>cast</b> <b>austenitic</b> stainless <b>steels</b> {{are very sensitive}} to weld cracking. Cracks are formed in brittle zones of the heterogeneous microstructure constituted by the carbide rich interdendritic spaces. In order to identify the operating factors affecting the cracking propensity of such steels during welding, a three step method, based on numerical simulation, is presented. First, the macroscopic emperature and stress fields are determined by a finite element calculation, considering a homogeneous material. In a second step, a localisation criterion is defined to identify critical zones, according to the macroscopic fields determined in the first step. Then, the heterogeneous microstructure of the cast steel is modelled in a 'representative cell', and the thermomechanical history of the critical zone previously identified is applied as boundary condition, {{in order to determine the}} local stress field. The cracking is then supposed to occur when the maximal principal stress in the interdendritic zone of the representative cell reaches the cleavage stress of the carbides, determined using SEM in situ tensile tests. This method is used to predict cracking during multipass weld repair of bulk samples, under various welding conditions. A comparison is carried out between experiment and simulation to validate the method...|$|R
40|$|To {{enable the}} life {{extension}} of Light Water Reactors (LWRs) beyond 60 years, {{it is critical}} to gain adequate knowledge for making conclusive predictions to assure the integrity of duplex stainless steel reactor components, e. g. primary boundary and reactor vessel internal. Microstructural changes in the ferrite of thermally aged, neutron irradiated only, and neutron irradiated after being thermally aged <b>cast</b> <b>austenitic</b> stainless <b>steels</b> (CASS) were investigated using atom probe tomography. The thermal aging was performed at 400 ˚C for 10, 000 h and the irradiation was conducted in the Halden reactor at 315 ˚C to 0. 08 dpa (5. 6 × 1019 n/cm 2, E 3 ̆e 1 MeV). Low dose neutron irradiation at a dose rate of 5 × 10 - 9 dpa/s was found to induce spinodal decomposition in the ferrite of as-cast microstructure, and further to enhance the spinodal decomposition in the thermally aged cast alloys. Regarding the G-phase precipitates, the neutron irradiation dramatically increases the precipitate size, and alters the composition of the precipitates with increased, Mn, Ni, Si and Mo and reduced Fe and Cr contents. The results have shown that low dose neutron irradiation can further accelerate the degradation of ferrite in a duplex stainless steel at the LWR relevant condition...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} the results of own investigations and of the investigations described in technical literature regarding various methods of improving the resistance to carburising of the creep-resistant structural parts of carburising furnaces. Most of the studies referred to were carried out in a Foundry of the Szczecin University of Technology. The results of the investigations on the effect of chemical composition of <b>austenitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> on its resistance to the carburising effect controlled through application of the anti-carburising coatings based on aluminium and constituted on high-alloy steel substrate were summarised. The possibility to use machining of castings as a means to raise their performance life in carburising atmosphere was also mentioned...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} the casting wall thickness on the segregation of alloying elements in two-phase (F-A) 22 Cr- 6 Ni- 2 Mo- 1, 5 Cu cast steel. The values of the distribution coefficient k 0 for Cr, Mo, Si, and Ni, Mn, Cu in the cast stepped test piece walls of three different thicknesses were determined. After solutioning, the values of Rm, R 0, 2, A 5 and Z were measured in the wall of 45 mm thickness and were compared with the results obtained for <b>austenitic</b> <b>cast</b> <b>steel</b> of 18 Cr- 9 Ni grade. In the examined cast steel also the content of δ ferrite and the value of PREN were determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperatures}} and concentrated chloride environments involved in potash milling provide conditions for high susceptibility to localized corrosion. This must be countered with careful material selection that provides adequate protection at affordable cost. Indexes have been formulated {{to take into}} account the effect of the elemental composition of a passive alloy on the resistance of the alloy to localized corrosion. A very comprehensive index, the Localized Corrosion Resistance Index (LCRI), is studied by this thesis and is evaluated for its accuracy in ranking stainless alloys. The LCRI, Cr%+ 3. 3 (Mo%) - 0. 33 (Ni%) + 16 (N%), takes advantage of the readily available weight percentages of chromium, molybdenum, nickel, and nitrogen. This thesis examined the theories behind pitting and crevice corrosion and the effect these elements have on the passive layers protecting the surface of a stainless alloy. Electrochemical experiments were performed on selected alloys in laboratory conditions, a pilot plant flow loop, and in potash mill conditions. The data obtained for this thesis supported the use of the LCRI as a ranking index for austenitic and duplex stainless <b>steels.</b> Ferritic and <b>cast</b> <b>austenitic</b> <b>steels</b> had less resistance to localized corrosion than the LCRI indicated. Totally different indexes or radical correction factors would be required to allow comparison of all types of alloys. A separate and extensive study could eventually achieve this. Temperature effects were examined to determine if the ability to accurately rank alloys with the LCRI could be compromised. The experiments tracked the pitting resistance of the alloys over a temperature range of 20 - 100 °C, covering conditions found in potash mills. The results found the LCRI reliable over the whole range of temperatures. Chromium, molybdenum, nickel, and nitrogen factors in the LCRI were studied, each in tum, to evaluate their worth in predicting the localized corrosion behavior of passive alloys. The data supported the theories regarding the effect of each element on the passive layer protecting the surface of the alloys. A new index was formulated to better fit the experimental data. The formula Cr%+ 4. 1 (Mo%) 0. 14 (Ni%) + 6 (N%) indicates molybdenum had a more pronounced effect on corrosion resistance while nitrogen's beneficial effect and nickel's detrimental effect were less pronounced. This formula, denoted LCRIll, offers better accuracy than the more conventional LCRI...|$|R
