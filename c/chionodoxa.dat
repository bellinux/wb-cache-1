Each flower bed is planted {{with a series}} of Littleleaf lindens and Kennedy saucer magnolias bordered by low hedges of boxwood and American Holly. The outer edge of the flower bed facing the central lawn are edged with boxwood. Perennial flowering plants include delphinium, hollyhock, lavender, and roses. Many seasonal flowers are interspersed to add nearly year round color. Spring blooming bulbs planted in the rose garden include jonquil, daffodil, fritillaria, grape hyacinth, tulips, <b>chionodoxa</b> and squill. Summer blooming annuals change yearly. In the fall chrysanthemum and flowering kale bring color until early winter.|$|E
5000|$|Taxonomists can {{disagree}} {{as to whether}} two groups of plants are sufficiently distinct {{to be put into}} one species or not. Thus <b>Chionodoxa</b> siehei and <b>Chionodoxa</b> forbesii have been treated as a single species by some taxonomists or as two species by others. If treated as one species, the earlier published name must be used, so plants previously called <b>Chionodoxa</b> siehei become <b>Chionodoxa</b> forbesii.|$|E

5000|$|Taxonomists can {{disagree}} {{as to whether}} two genera are sufficiently distinct to be kept separate or not. While agreeing that the genus <b>Chionodoxa</b> {{is closely related to}} the genus Scilla, nevertheless the bulb specialist Brian Mathew considers that their differences warrant maintaining separate genera. Others disagree, and would call <b>Chionodoxa</b> siehei Scilla siehei. The earliest published genus name must be used when genera are merged; in this case Scilla was published earlier and is used (not <b>Chionodoxa).</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Chionodoxa</b> is {{distinguished}} from the closely related genus Scilla by two features: the tepals are joined at their bases to form a tube rather than being free; and the stamens have flattened stalks (filaments), which look almost like a cup in {{the centre of the}} flower. These differences are not considered by some botanists as sufficient to create a separate genus, and <b>Chionodoxa</b> species are often included in Scilla. <b>Chionodoxa</b> is also not recognised as a separate genus from Scilla by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, or the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website.|$|E

5000|$|Taxonomists can {{disagree}} {{as to the}} limits of families. When the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) first published its classification of the flowering plants in 1998, <b>Chionodoxa</b> siehei would have been placed in the family Hyacinthaceae. In the 2009 revision of their classification, the APG no longer recognize the Hyacinthaceae as a separate family, merging it into a greatly enlarged family Asparagaceae. Thus <b>Chionodoxa</b> siehei moves from the Hyacinthaceae to the Asparagaceae.|$|E

50|$|All <b>Chionodoxa</b> {{species are}} {{included}} in Scilla by some botanists, who do not consider the differences to be sufficient to create a separate genus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chionodoxa</b> forbesii or Forbes' {{glory-of-the-snow}} is a bulbous perennial from south-west Turkey flowering {{in early}} spring. After flowering, {{it goes into}} dormancy until the next spring.|$|E
5000|$|The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families regards <b>Chionodoxa</b> {{as part of}} Scilla, {{in which}} case the correct name for [...] Chionoscilla allenii is Scilla × allenii (G.Nicholson) Speta.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chionodoxa</b> nana or dwarf {{glory-of-the-snow}} is a bulbous perennial from Crete flowering {{in early}} spring with flowers in shades of lilac blue. After flowering, it goes into dormancy until the next spring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chionodoxa</b> siehei or Siehe's {{glory-of-the-snow}} is a bulbous perennial {{from west}} Turkey flowering in early spring. After flowering, {{it goes into}} dormancy until the next spring. It seeds readily to form colonies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chionodoxa</b> lochiae or Loch's {{glory-of-the-snow}} is a bulbous perennial from Cyprus flowering {{in early}} spring. After flowering, {{it goes into}} dormancy until the next spring. It was named after Lady Loch who collected it.|$|E
5000|$|Flora Frey garden (139 m2) - garden {{donated by}} the Flora Frey company, with bulbs {{including}} Dahlia as well as <b>Chionodoxa,</b> Crocus, Eranthis, Erythronium, Fritillaria meleagris, Galanthus, Leucojum, Muscari, Narcissus, Puschkinia, Scilla, Tulipa, etc.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all members}} of the genus <b>Chionodoxa,</b> the bases of the stamens are {{flattened}} and closely clustered {{in the middle of the}} flower. In the related genus Scilla, the stamens are not flattened or clustered together.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leaves are}} green, strap-like, and grow in pairs. The flowers are borne {{in early spring}} in racemes up to about [...] high. The six tepals are joined at the base to form a tube to about half their length. Like members of the genus <b>Chionodoxa,</b> the bases of the stamens are {{flattened}} and closely clustered {{in the middle of}} the flower; however, unlike <b>Chionodoxa,</b> they are joined to form a cup or corona. In the related genus Scilla (squills), the stamens are not flattened or clustered together. Seeds are borne in three-parted capsules. After the seed ripens in early summer, the plants become dormant until the next spring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chionodoxa</b> luciliae (syn. C. gigantea), the Bossier's {{glory-of-the-snow}} or Lucile's glory-of-the-snow, is a bulbous perennial {{from west}} Turkey flowering in early spring. After flowering, {{it goes into}} dormancy until the next spring. The Latin name is in honour of Lucile, {{the wife of the}} Swiss botanist Pierre Edmond Boissier.|$|E
50|$|It has {{relatively}} few flowers in a raceme, each about 2.5 cm in diameter. The flowers are bright blue, without white {{at the base}} of the tepals, as most other species of <b>Chionodoxa</b> have, although the stamen bases are white. Photographs taken in the wild show the flowers nodding rather than upright.|$|E
50|$|A {{rock garden}} is a garden {{that uses a}} {{combination}} of rocks and small plants. The plants are often chosen for their suitability to rocky terrain. Some of the bulb genera that are most suitable for rock gardens include: Allium, Anemone, Anthericum, Bulbocodium, <b>Chionodoxa,</b> Cyclamen, Eranthis, Erythronium, Galanthus, Ipheion, Muscari, Ornithogalum, Oxalis, Romulea, Rhodohypoxis and Scilla.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all members}} of the genus <b>Chionodoxa,</b> the bases of the stamens are {{flattened}} and closely clustered {{in the middle of the}} flower. In the related genus Scilla, the stamens are not flattened or clustered together. The differences are not considered by some botanists as sufficient to create a separate genus, so they include this species in Scilla.|$|E
50|$|Hyacinthoides is {{classified}} in the subfamily Scilloideae (now {{part of the family}} Asparagaceae, but formerly treated as a separate family, called Hyacinthaceae), alongside genera such as Scilla, <b>Chionodoxa</b> and Ornithogalum. Hyacinthoides is differentiated from these other genera by the presence of two bracts at the base of each flower, rather than one bract per flower or no bracts in the other genera.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{number of}} Scilla {{species in the}} genus depends on which {{proposals}} to split the genus are accepted. For {{a discussion of the}} relationship of Scilla to the closely related genus, <b>Chionodoxa,</b> see that page. Other proposals separate particularly the Eurasian species into a number of smaller genera such as Othocallis Salisb., e.g. Scilla siberica would become Othocallis siberica.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chionodoxa,</b> {{known as}} glory-of-the-snow, {{is a small}} genus of bulbous {{perennial}} flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Scilloideae, often included in Scilla. The genus is endemic to the eastern Mediterranean, specifically Crete, Cyprus and Turkey. The blue, white or pink flowers appear {{early in the year}} making them valuable garden ornamentals. The common name of the genus is based on the habit of flowering in high alpine zones when the snow melts in spring.|$|E
50|$|The flowers {{have six}} petals and six stamens, and are {{arranged}} singly or in racemes {{of two or}} three. Petals may be reflexed to the horizontal when sunlight is bright, but are more often cup-shaped. The flowers are usually blue, but those of Scilla siberica var. alba are white. The stamens of Scilla are separate, unlike those of the related genera Puschkinia and <b>Chionodoxa,</b> which are fused into a tube. The pollen is dark blue.|$|E
5000|$|Stability. Although {{stability}} {{is far from}} absolute, the procedures associated with establishing binomial names, such as the principle of priority, tend to favor stability. For example, when species are transferred between genera (as not uncommonly happens {{as a result of}} new knowledge), if possible {{the second part of the}} binomial is kept the same. Thus there is disagreement among botanists as to whether the genera <b>Chionodoxa</b> and Scilla are sufficiently different for them to be kept separate. Those who keep them separate give the plant commonly grown in gardens in Europe the name <b>Chionodoxa</b> siehei; those who do not give it the name Scilla siehei. The siehei element is constant. Similarly if what were previously thought to be two distinct species are demoted to a lower rank, such as subspecies, where possible the second part of the binomial name is retained as the third part of the new name. Thus the Tenerife robin may be treated as a different species from the European robin, in which case its name is Erithacus superbus, or as only a subspecies, in which case its name is Erithacus rubecula superbus. The superbus element of the name is constant.|$|E
50|$|All can {{be bought}} as dry bulbs and planted while dormant in late summer or early autumn {{at a depth of}} 8-10 cm. They require light when in growth, but can be grown under {{deciduous}} trees or shrubs, as their foliage dies down after flowering. All flower in early Spring, C. sardensis usually being the earliest. C. siehei seeds freely in many gardens, and can create a carpet of blue. In addition to the common purplish-blue varieties, <b>Chionodoxa</b> siehei is sold as pink and white cultivars.|$|E
50|$|The hybrids between Scilla bifolia and <b>Chionodoxa</b> siehei {{were named}} ×&thinsp;Chionoscilla allenii G.Nicholson, after their discoverer, James Allen. He noticed {{them in his}} garden in Shepton Mallet, England, {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century. As with most hybrids, {{individual}} plants vary; some have been given cultivar names, e.g. Fra Angelica. Like its parents, ×&thinsp;Chionoscilla allenii grows from bulbs and flowers freely in early spring. The flowers are various shades of blue from lilac to violet and are intermediate in size between those of the parents, up to 2.5 cm in diameter when fully open.|$|E

Each flower bed is planted {{with a series}} of Littleleaf lindens and Kennedy saucer magnolias bordered by low hedges of boxwood and American Holly. The outer edge of the flower bed facing the central lawn are edged with boxwood. Perennial flowering plants include delphinium, hollyhock, lavender, and roses.
