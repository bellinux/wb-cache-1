In 1987, the company introduced their adapted energy drink into Austria under the name Red Bull. It found huge success there by marketing to young professionals. The brand expanded throughout Europe during the early 1990s, exploding into the United States market during 1997, grabbing 75% of the market within a year. The wealth of Red Bull's founders grew with the company's success, and by March 2012, both Chaleo and Mateschitz had estimated net worths of over $5.3 billion each. Today, Red Bull GmbH operates in over 165 countries and employs over 10,000 people. Its signature product, Red Bull, remains the world's most-consumed energy drink with 5.2 billion cans sold in 2012.|$|E

40|$|<b>Carbonate</b> {{occurs at}} the Comanche {{outcrops}} in Gusev Crater {{on the basis of}} analyses made by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit [1]. Taken together, mineralogical data from Spirit's Moessbauer (MB) and Mini-TES spectrometer and chemical data from the APXS spectrometer show that Comanche <b>carbonate</b> has an Mg-Fe-rich bulk chemical composition, is present at high concentrations, and is distributed throughout the outcrop and not just at the MB and APXS analysis location. The granular outcrop texture and the observation that it appears to be resistant to weathering compared with surrounding material [1] imply that the <b>carbonate</b> may be present as a cement. A hydrothermal origin for the Comanche <b>carbonate</b> was inferred by analogy with laboratory experiments and with a <b>carbonate</b> occurrence within the Bockfjord volcanic complex on the island Spitsbergen (Svalbard, Norway) [1]. The laboratory <b>carbonates,</b> synthesized by precipitation from hydrothermal solutions, have (MB) parameters and average bulk chemical compositions that are characteristic of Comanche <b>carbonate.</b> The connection to Comanche <b>carbonate</b> is only through chemical data for certain occurrences of Spitsbergen <b>carbonates.</b> In fact, the common average bulk chemical composition for these Spitsbergen <b>carbonates,</b> the synthetic <b>carbonates,</b> the Comanche <b>carbonate,</b> and also the <b>carbonate</b> globules found in martian meteorite ALH 84001 is a chemical constraint consistent with a hydrothermal formation process for all the <b>carbonates</b> [e. g., 1 - 3].

50|$|Upon {{conclusion}} of fermentation, the beer is carbonated {{before it is}} consumed. This is typically done {{in one of two}} ways; force carbonation in a keg using compressed carbon dioxide, or bottle carbonation with priming sugar. Any bottle that is able to withstand the pressure of carbonation can be used, such as used beer bottles, flip-top bottles with rubber stoppers such as Grolsch, or even plastic bottles such as soda bottles, provided they are properly sanitized. Priming briefly reactivates the yeast that remains in the bottle, <b>carbonating</b> the brew. Homebrewed beers (filtering improves visual appearance of the product, but complicates carbonation). Bottled beer becomes clear quicker than kegged beer, since the yeast does not have as far to descend.|$|E
