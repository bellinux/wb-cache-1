50|$|Many users {{choose to}} equip their air-powered impact {{wrenches}} {{with a short}} length of air hose rather than attaching an air fitting directly to the tool. Such a hose greatly aids in fitting the wrench into tight areas, by not having the complete <b>coupler</b> <b>assembly</b> sticking {{out the back of}} the tool, as well as making it easier for the user to position the tool. An additional benefit is greatly reduced wear on the coupler, by isolating it from the vibration of the tool. A short length of hose also prevents the air fitting from being broken off in the base of the tool if the user loses their grip and the tool is allowed to spin.|$|E

40|$|A {{variable}} input coupler {{has been}} designed for the Fermilab vertical cavity test facility (VCTF), a facility for CW RF vertical testing of bare ILC 1. 3 GHz 9 -cell SRF cavities at 2 K, to provide some flexibility in the test stand RF measurements. The variable coupler allows the cavity to be critically coupled for all RF tests, including all TM 010 passband modes, which will simplify or make possible the measurement of those modes with very low end-cell fields, e. g., {pi}/ 9 mode. The variable <b>coupler</b> <b>assembly</b> mounts to the standard input coupler port on the cavity, and uses a cryogenic motor submerged in superfluid helium to control the antenna position. The RF and mechanical design and RF test results are described...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 29 -November 02, 1990 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaDatron Systems Inc. has {{developed}} a high efficiency autotrack feed series which uses a tracking mode coupler to generate track error signals. The mode coupler allows {{the use of a}} corrugated feed horn in doubly shaped or cassegrain geometries or a scaler ring feed in prime focus reflectors, to achieve extremely high overall antenna efficiencies. The low insertion loss of the mode coupler allows the incorporation of autotrack capability in an antenna system without degradation of the overall G/T or EIRP. Another feature of this feed is the excellent cross talk performance. The mode coupler is a rho-theta type tracker and as such is suitable for use in both single channel monopulse and equivalent full three channel monopulse autotrack applications. Datron has built, installed, and tested feeds of this type at S, C, and X band frequencies and is currently under contract to develop a dual K/Q band version. Datron has also integrated other components into the mode <b>coupler</b> feed <b>assembly</b> such as: amplifiers, filters, diplexers, couplers, downconverters, switches, noise sources, etc...|$|R
40|$|Main linac cryomodule of the Cornell ERL {{consists}} of 7 -cell cavities operating at 1300 MHz in CW mode. Each cavity {{has a single}} coaxial type input coupler with fixed coupling, Qext = 2 × 107. The input coupler will operate at RF power up to 5 kW at full reflection. The coupler design {{is based on the}} design of TTF-III input coupler with appropriate modifications and with taking into account the Cornell experience with couplers for ERL Injector. Unlike that of the TTF-III <b>coupler,</b> the cold <b>assembly</b> of the ERL main linac input coupler does not have bellows, which makes it stiff so the antenna orientation is not changing during cool down. Mechanical flexibility, necessary to accommodate large lateral movement of the cavity inside the vacuum vessel during cool down, is achieved by using two bellows insertions both in inner and outer tubes of warm coaxial line. The inner tube of the warm coaxial line is cooled with air to improve power handling capability...|$|R

INTRODUCTION The RF design of a self-matched RF window using a 10 inch (254 mm) alumina disk in a WR 2100 size waveguide is described in an earlier paper [1]. This paper describes the mechanical realization and initial power tests of the window design. To counteract tensile stress on the perimeter of the disk when heated by RF fields, a stainless steel rings is shrunk onto the ceramic during the brazing process. The stainless steel ring puts the ceramic disk in compression and thus results in a rugged window des [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This project aims {{to develop}} a method that {{drastically}} improves measurement of the acoustic properties of objects. Previously research at the University of Waikato has made progress with acoustic technologies as a precursor to a dual port vector network analyser. These technologies have been furthered to this end by 3 D printing a modified coupler that now includes a flange with alignment pins, and a groove to house an O-ring {{as well as a}} number of other ``custom'' components for the <b>coupler</b> <b>assembly.</b> This assembly has been interfaced successfully with a VNA and collected data, this process is not straightforward and requires carefully thought-out adjustment to produce sensible data. Complicating this process is the vast difference in propagation speeds for acoustic and electromagnetic signals. The swept measurements performed show promising results that further prove the hardware and indicate that particular calibration terms namely those for isolation that are normally ignored in the electromagnetic domain are potentially crucial in the acoustic domain...|$|E
40|$|For the {{injector}} of the EU- XFEL one so-called 3. 9 GHz module is required. This special module houses eight 3. 9 GHz s. c. cavities, a beam position {{monitor and}} a quadrupole package. The cavities were fabricated and vertically tested as an in-kind {{contribution to the}} EU-XFEL by INFN Milano collaborators. The power couplers have been fabricated and conditioned by FNAL. The string assembly took place inside the ISO 4 cleanroom at DESY. A seven meter long alignment and assembly girder for this special string assembly has been designed and fabricated at DESY. The girder facilitates the assembly of the 3. 9 GHz resonators with alternating power coupler orientation in ISO 4 cleanrooms. For redundancy and fast action on problems during string assembly, the DESY high pressure rinsing system (HPR) has been modified {{on the basis of}} the INFN Milano design for this 3. 9 GHz application. The HPR has been qualified by four 3. 9 GHz resonators, tested at INFN Milano. The integration of the cavities into Helium vessels, power coupler coupling factor and the power <b>coupler</b> <b>assembly</b> at DESY is qualified by one cavity that has been equipped with Helium tank and a power coupler and tested horizontally...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{work done}} in improving the sideband rejection ratio for 2 SB cryogenic radio astronomy receivers in general, but more specifically, for the future Onsala 20 m 3 -mm receiver system and the ALMA Band 5. In order to attain better than 15 dB sideband rejection ratio over the entire bandwidth (approximately 26 % RF fractional bandwidth and one octave the IF bandwidth), {{it is necessary to}} improve both RF and IF hybrid assembly to optimum performance, i. e. making the hybrids with minimum achievable amplitude and phase imbalance. For this reasons, a 4 - 8 GHz IF assembly comprising a compact 90 ° hybrid chip, two bias-T circuits and two transmission line circuits was designed and characterised. The compact size of the hybrid chip allows it to be integrated into virtually any sideband separating (2 SB) mixer operating at cryogenic temperatures and is furthermore especially advantageous for multi-pixel 2 SB receivers or low noise balanced amplifier layouts. The hybrid was fabricated using thin-film technology on Si-substrates and uses air bridges to inter-connect the fingers of the <b>coupler.</b> The hybrid <b>assembly</b> that integrates the bias-T circuit using a MMIC-like approach, where capacitors are integrated on-chip and fabricated using thin-film technology and micro-fabrication. Characterization of the hybrid assembly was performed at a cryogenic temperature of 4 K and sophisticated calibration and fixture de-embedding procedures was used. The measurement result shows that the IF hybrid assembly has state of the art performance, with amplitude and phase imbalance better than 0. 5 dB and ± 2 ° respectively at cryogenic temperatures. In order to allow complete characterization of the ALMA Band 5 cartridge a highly versatile measurement setup has been built. The measurement setup includes all necessary hardware and achieves automatic measurements for the system noise and sideband rejection with inbuilt optimization procedures. The measurement setup additionally comprises measurements of the receiver saturation, phase and amplitude stability, as well as optical beam characterization. The performance of the IF hybrid was verified in ALMA Band 5 receiver cartridge using the ALMA Band 5 measurement setup, demonstrating an average sideband rejection ratio of better than 15 dB, i. e. an improvement of 3 - 9 dB. To further improve the sideband rejection ratio, a novel design for a RF 90 ° waveguide hybrid was proposed (163 - 211 GHz). This suggested hybrid employs the multiple branch waveguide design. The specific feature of the proposed hybrid design is the use of controllable ripple in the operational frequency band for achieving better overall amplitude imbalance. This general design approach design could be used for waveguide hybrids at any frequency. Experimental verification of the hybrid shows nearly excellent agreement with the simulations yielding measured amplitude imbalance of 0. 15 dB and phase imbalance of ± 2. 7 ° (cf. Fig. 5) over most of the band. Such a waveguide hybrid is expected to further improve the sideband rejection ratio...|$|R
