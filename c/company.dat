5|$|Administrators in the National Park Service {{felt that}} {{limiting}} the number of concessionaires in each national park would be more financially sound. The Curry <b>Company</b> and its rival, the Yosemite National Park <b>Company,</b> were forced to merge in 1925 to form the Yosemite Park & Curry <b>Company</b> (YP).

5|$|As in {{the first}} attempt, a Sa'iqa <b>company</b> from the 103rd Battalion would occupy {{positions}} four kilometers east of Budapest to isolate the fort. It would be supported by an AT-3 Sagger ATGM platoon. The main attack would be launched from the east by a Sa'iqa <b>company</b> and a <b>company</b> from al-Mezahi's battalion as the first echelon.

In order to escape the enemy encirclement, F <b>Company</b> withdrew south, but G <b>Company</b> did not. By 08:30 the North Koreans had completely surrounded it and a supporting platoon of H <b>Company</b> mortarmen on Hill 303. At this point the force on the hill was cut off from the rest of the American force.

Covered by the reserve <b>company,</b> 'A' and some of 'B' <b>Company</b> were able to break contact and fall back. 'D' <b>Company,</b> {{along with those of}} 'B' <b>Company</b> that were still isolated and in contact, had to be left to fight their way back to the battalion's lines. By the time they arrived, there were only enough men left to form one platoon. The 2/18th's losses in this action amounted to about 90 men killed, wounded or missing.

5|$|In 1904 the <b>company</b> was {{incorporated}} as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation <b>Company</b> (ISCSNC), and the <b>company</b> continued to operate successfully until the Second World War.

In particular, road transport was able to offer a door-to-door service, (although the <b>company</b> did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided increased competition, entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line. When combined with waterfront disputes, rising costs, and the post-war costs of ship replacement, the <b>company</b> was in trouble, and in 1948, for the first time, no dividend was paid to investors.
