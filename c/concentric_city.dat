50|$|Alberti, {{followed}} by Filarete, {{were the first}} to develop the ideas of Utopia into the plan of a city. Filarete designed a <b>concentric</b> <b>city,</b> with peaks and radiating streets, which he called Sforzinda. His geometry was the imitation of a schema representing the work. It is believed to have derived from two overlaying squares. Sforzinda later became the most influential plan in the design of Palmanova. Since Palmanova was built during the renaissance, it imposed geometrical harmony and followed the idea that beauty reinforces the wellness of a society. Each road and move was carefully calibrated and each part of the plan had a reason for being. Each person would have the same amount of responsibility and land, and each person had to serve a specific purpose. The concentric shape was the most prominent design move, and had many reasons for being.|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{concept of}} "linear city" (ciudad lineal), introduced by Arturo Soria y Mata in 1882, was a revolutionary idea contrasting {{with the traditional}} <b>concentric</b> <b>city,</b> dense and congested. In several international and national cities, after a historical radial development, began a linear expansion driven by different factors, i. e. insufficient land availability or absence of an organic city planning and development. In this paper, after a brief introduction and {{the description of the}} Palermo case study as a linear city, a focus on the implication of this linear structure on the urban and public transport development is presented. Finally, suggestion of innovative solutions to accommodate this linearity, compared with the existing ones, will be described taking into account the role of Palermo as the most important node of attraction/generation of flows in the Region...|$|E

40|$|A new gating {{strategy}} for <b>concentric</b> <b>cities</b> {{based on the}} notion of the macroscopic or network fundamental diagram and the feedback-based gating concept is introduced and successfully tested. Different regions of large-scale urban networks may experience congestion at different levels and times during the peak period. In this paper, the zone, including the initial core of congestion, is considered as the first region, which has to be protected from congestion via gating; eventually, as the congestion continues to expand, the border of an extended network part becomes the second perimeter for gating control. Remarkable extensions while distributing the ordered controller flow to the gated traffic signals in case of low demand or occurrence of spillback are also considered. A greater part of the San Francisco urban network is used as test-bed within a microscopic simulation environment. Significant improvements in terms of network-wide mean speed and average delay per kilometer are obtained compared to the single perimeter gating and non-gating simulation scenarios...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{reforms of}} pricing {{of private and}} public {{transport}} in Paris. Paris has used a policy of very low public transport prices and no road pricing. The Paris transport network is represented as a stylized <b>concentric</b> <b>city</b> with the choice between car, rapid rail, metro and busses {{as well as two}} income classes and different transport motives. The model is used to test what are the efficiency gains of introducing road pricing and of increasing public transit prices in the peak. Are both reforms re-enforcing each other or are they largely substitutes? We find that a zonal pricing scheme for the center of Paris combined with higher public transport fares in the peak perform best. The benefits of an overall capacity extension of public transport supply are much lower than the benefits of pricing reforms and could very well not pass the cost benefit test. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The article {{deals with}} the built {{experience}} by the CESP (São Paulo’s Electricity Company) in Urubupungá Complex, during 1950 s and 1960 s, with concomitant construction of urban centers—an provisional in Jupiá and another permanent in Ilha Solteira—with accommodation for singles, working villages and residences for technicians and engineers. The city of Ilha Solteira implanted permanently was an intermediate form of organization between the camp of Jupiá {{and the structure of}} a city, with a slightly more open community in which the citizens were still quite protected by the company. This study aims to describe the planning and the process of opening the core of Ilha Solteira, through non participant observation field work and research literature on the topic of its conversion into town and the attempt to create a pole of development for the region through their characteristic urban design plan: linear city and radio <b>concentric</b> <b>city.</b> However, the transformation of Ilha Solteira on a city in the early 1980 s happened in the crisis of developmentalism and authoritarianism, in a time when the CESP no longer wished to transform Ilha Solteira in pole of regional development, but in a city able to stand alone, because their maintenance costs become prohibitive...|$|E
40|$|Residential {{areas to}} a great extend shape the {{landscape}} of Lviv. According to the general trend of the <b>concentric</b> <b>city</b> development, residential areas of the {{second half of the}} twentieth century surrounded in the form of a ring the city territory at the XIV – early XX century. Their spatial forms varied depending on the trends that prevailed in architecture and urban planning in USSR and then in U kraine: – 1945 – 1955, imitation of classical architecture and urbanism forms; – 1956 – 1990, application of the functionalism principles, construction of the city periphery, large-scale compositions of residential areas; – 1991 – up till now, the plurality of spatial forms, construction of individual building-seals, small residential neighborhoods. Radical real changes in Lviv townscape commenced in the end of 1950 s.  Since that time the dynamic development of the town began, and facilitated towns transformation into the largest industrial centre in eastern Ukraine.  First new dwelling sites emerged in 1950 – 1960 s in the western sector of the town. In 1970 – 1980 ’s housing appeared on vast territories of the southern, northern and eastern sectors of the town.  The new industrial and dwelling districts gained quite a new (much more larger than previous one) spatial scale of urban management and housing of the territory, determined by theory of the Soviet urban planning of that time. The territory planning presupposed the very change of the urban form, traditional blocks were altered by „free” located separate buildings on the territory. Dwelling housing, at first, consisted of 5 – 9 -storey buildings. In 1970 s and during the 1980 s the height of houses was risen to 12 – 15 -floors. Thus, large dwelling sites with great number of multistorey buildings were formed.  The compact town housing of the first half of 20 th century was changed by the new image of urban areas, that consisted a „separately located” edifices with vast spaces between them (yet the young trees were not high).  Two, almost independent, town scapes emerged coegsisting on the town’s territory: historical and contemporary townscapes (i. e. of the second half of the 20 th c.). Luckily the relief of the site allows to separate visually historical and contemporary town landscapes: historical town is situated in the amphiteatre of the Poltva river valley, and the new residential areas occupy the eminence of the plateau around the valley. |The peculiar example of the new town landscape construction is Syhiv residential site (district) in the southern sector of the town, being constructed during the last two decades. Housing of this area got started in 1980 s, and during the first several years consisted of groups of 9 -storey buildings of the same type, located almost regularly on the territory. This esidential territory occupies an area of 300 hectares between Zelena and Stryjska streets, former trade routes, stretching to the north-eastern and southern directions from Lviv. During the first decade the dwelling houses of Syhiv consisted of 9 -storey large panel construction apartment building, later on, after 1990 s, requirements of a total typification were eliminated, and separate 12 – 15 -storey houses of a tower-type gained monumentum; they were becoming spatial accents. By 1991, architectural image of Syhiv was replenished by houses of religious worship – churches and chapels. First, they were built-up spontaneously, almost without architects. The largest new church in Lviv was constructed in the district centre of Syhiv after the design of Radoslav Zhuk, Ukrainian born Canadian architect. In the beginning of 1990 s, the territorial development of the residential and industrial areas within the town was almost stopped instead, private single family house architecture in the suburban zone gained momentum, and in 1991 – 1997 a ring belt of two and three-storeyhouses, that embraced multistorey housing areas of 1960 – 1980 s was created. Another change of the spatial scale of the housing of a territory took place, this time – by its sharp reduce. At the end of 1990 s town landscape of the periphery zone of Lviv’s central part (at the border with the new dwelling quarters of multi-storey housing) was slightly changing. Construction of the 5 – 9 -storey multi-compartment dwelling houses with flats equipped in and correspondence to contemporary European requirements was commenced in this zone. These houses were erected by private investors on separate free plots, mostly among extant 2 – 3 -storey dwelling housing, that engirdled 3 – 4 -storey dwelling quarters (dated to a cross of the 19 – 20 th cc.) in the centre of the town. Due to their height the new constructions created local spatial emphasis. Peculiar feature of architectural image of these buildings is combination of forms of European Post-Modernism and regional Sub-Carpathian architecture. Houses posses slopping roofs, covered with roofings, facades are built of brick, covered with plaster, wood is applied as well as glass, metal and plastic material.

40|$|Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSSs) {{often include}} models {{that can be}} used to assess the impact of {{possible}} decisions. These models usually simulate complex spatio-temporal phenomena, with input variables and parameters that are often hard to measure. The resulting model uncertainty is, however, rarely communicated to the user, so that current SDSSs yield clear, but therefore sometimes deceptively precise outputs. Inclusion of uncertainty in SDSSs requires modeling methods to calculate uncertainty and tools to visualize indicators of uncertainty that can be understood by its users, having mostly limited knowledge of spatial statistics. This research makes an important step towards a solution of this issue. It illustrates the construction of the PCRaster Land Use Change model (PLUC) that integrates simulation, uncertainty analysis and visualization. It uses the PCRaster Python framework, which comprises both a spatio-temporal modeling framework and a Monte Carlo analysis framework that together produce stochastic maps, which can be visualized with the Aguila software, included in the PCRaster Python distribution package. This is illustrated by a case study for Mozambique in which it is evaluated where bioenergy crops can be cultivated without endangering nature areas and food production now and in the near future, when population and food intake per capita will increase and thus arable land and pasture areas are likely to expand. It is shown how the uncertainty of the input variables and model parameters effects the model outcomes. Evaluation of spatio-temporal uncertainty patterns has provided new insights in the modeled land use system about, e. g., the shape of <b>concentric</b> rings around <b>cities.</b> In addition, the visualization modes give uncertainty information in an comprehensible way for users without specialist knowledge of statistics, for example by means of confidence intervals for potential bioenergy crop yields. The coupling of spatio-temporal uncertainty analysis to the simulation model is considered a major step forward in the exposure of uncertainty in SDSSs...|$|R
40|$|Ribbons and patches. The {{morphology}} of non-urban {{housing and}} the associated garden complex This article discuses a method to analyze spatial patterns of suburban housing in Flanders and their relation to open space. The aim is to detect recent {{changes in the way}} housing construction consumes open space in Flanders. Trends indicate that recent housing production occurs at higher densities than before. It is not clear however how this trend translates in non-urban environments and which patterns underlie it. The article focuses on the morphology of housing plots, based on a combination of qualitative and GIS-techniques, in two non-urban case study areas. It identifies recent qualitative transformations in ex-urban housing production with important impacts on the privatization of open space in the form of domestic gardens. Housing production in suburban Flanders is traditionally dominated by private individual initiative aimed at homeownership. Suburban housing does not merely occur in <b>concentric</b> patterns around <b>cities,</b> but also in diverse patterns, geared by patterns of infrastructure, pre-existing settlement patterns, soil conditions and so forth. In order to understand recent housing patterns in different parts of Flanders, two basic modes of development are discerned that can be considered as the basic 'vocabulary' of suburban housing patterns. Ribbon development corresponds to a one-dimensional linear development pattern, and urbanization in the case of ribbon development does not require the preliminary construction of infrastructure. Residential subdivisions or allotments are defined as two-dimensional planar developments and require the preliminary construction of infrastructure in order to urbanize formerly open land. The importance of both modes of development is mapped out in two distinct areas of about 20. 000 ha each (one in the west of Flanders and one in the east), and for two periods (ca. 1950 - 1980 and ca. 1980 – 2007) based on historical cartography. This first part of the analysis identifies the basic development mode of suburban housing {{over a longer period of}} time, in order to determine the basic morphological characteristics of the study areas. In order to map out the most recent trends in housing production, this first line of research is complemented by fieldwork, as well as a detailed GIS-based and statistical analysis of residential construction permit data for the period 1998 - 2008 in one municipality. The analysis shows that ribbons and allotments have similar mean plot sizes in the two study areas, of 10 are for ribbons and 7 are for allotments respectively. The distribution of plot sizes for allotments further more reveals a smaller peak at 4 are, corresponding to allotments of grouped housing with semi-detached or row housing typologies, usually corresponding to social housing estates. These findings confirm the hypothesis that ribbons and allotments can be considered as the basic vocabulary of suburban housing production. The difference between both study areas resides in a different distribution of both development types. Allotments dominate in the study area in the west of Flanders, while ribbon development dominates in the east. These differences can be related primarily to differences in soil structure, the morphology of the natural landscape, traditional settlement structures and infrastructure patterns. Fieldwork and the analysis of residential construction permits draws the attention to a third and recent mode of suburban residential development, the construction of apartments. General housing construction data shows an increase in the production of smaller housing units also in 'rural' areas. They invariably locate in the centre of villages, along important thoroughfares and near intersections. The construction of apartments is a first factor in the 'densification' of housing in rural areas. A second expected factor, the reduction of plot sizes in individual housing construction, is not confirmed by the findings. To the contrary, plot sizes for individual housing construction increases. The overall densification of housing is completely accounted for by the increase of apartments. The increase in mean plot sizes for individual housing construction, originates in a rising share of ribbon development. Indeed, as construction land becomes scarcer, large patches of land suitable for allotments are less and less available. As a result, individual housing construction is dominated by a further infill of open spaces along existing ribbons. These findings have important implications for (the study) of the garden complex in Flanders. First of all, the morphology of gardens associated with ribbon development differs strongly from that of allotments. Ribbon plots are narrow and deep, while allotment plots tend to be more square. In allotments, larger garden complexes are created, as gardens border on other gardens or streets, while in ribbon development, gardens border on open space with various types of non-residential land use. In the case of very deep plots, only the first part of the plots tends to be used as a garden. The garden serves as an intermediary between the house and the open space. Allotments on the other hand create larger patches of 'urbanized' open space. As ribbon development occupies an intermediary position between the open space and the residential space, the garden complexes of ribbon development might hypothetically have ecological advantages as compared to the garden complexes associated with allotments or the hard surfaces associated with apartment construction. Further research is however needed to substantiate this hypothesis. The comparison of recent and traditional construction patterns shows that dispersed ribbon development traditionally occurs in large parts of both study areas. To summarize, ribbon development can be considered more 'rural' than allotments or apartment construction. The higher densities of the latter development modes however correspond better to present day spatial planning goals. This paradox suggests that further research into housing typologies that combine the possible ecological and cultural landscape values of traditional settlement types with higher densities remains a great challenge. Recent publications have provided best practice examples of such proposals, but the results from the field show that much work is still needed to convince future dwellers, policy makers and developers of these alternatives. status: publishe...|$|R
