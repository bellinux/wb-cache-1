5|$|In 2008, Australian {{researcher}} Jean Williams {{claimed that}} <b>cancer</b> <b>rates</b> {{in the town}} of Innisfail, Queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War. Williams, who had won the Order of Australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S. war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial's archives. A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, saying that he had been involved in the secret testing. Neither Williams or Bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims. The Queensland health department determined that <b>cancer</b> <b>rates</b> in Innisfail were no higher than those {{in other parts of the}} state.|$|E

5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian <b>cancer</b> <b>rates</b> are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E

Another large study in Sweden examined <b>cancer</b> <b>rates</b> of 700,000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 and those who did not. The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} if {{direct radiography}} (DR) performs better than screen-film mammography (SF) and computed radiography (CR) in dense breasts in a decentralized organised Breast Cancer Screening Programme. To this end, screen-detected versus interval cancers were studied in different BI-RADS density classes for these imaging modalities. The study cohort consisted of 351, 532 women {{who participated in}} the Flemish Breast Cancer Screening Programme in 2009 and 2010. Information on screen-detected and interval cancers, breast density scores of radiologist second readers, and imaging modality was obtained by linkage of the databases of the Centre of Cancer Detection and the Belgian Cancer Registry. Overall, 67 % of occurring breast cancers are screen detected and 33 % are interval cancers, with DR performing better than SF and CR. The interval <b>cancer</b> <b>rate</b> increases gradually with breast density, regardless of modality. In the high-density class, the interval <b>cancer</b> <b>rate</b> exceeds the <b>cancer</b> detection <b>rate</b> for SF and CR, but not for DR. DR is superior to SF and CR with respect to <b>cancer</b> detection <b>rates</b> for high-density breasts. To reduce the high interval <b>cancer</b> <b>rate</b> in dense breasts, use of an additional imaging technique in screening can be taken into consideration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Different methods {{exist to}} {{estimate}} smoking attributable <b>cancer</b> mortality <b>rates</b> (Peto and Ezzati methods, as examples). However, the smoking attributable estimates using these methods cannot {{be generalized to}} all population sub-groups. A simpler method has recently been developed that can be adapted and applied to different population sub-groups. This study assessed cumulative tobacco smoke damage (smoke load) /non-lung cancer mortality associations across time from 1979 to 2003 among all Massachusetts males and ages 30 – 74 years, using this novel methodology. Methods Annual lung <b>cancer</b> death <b>rates</b> were used as smoke load bio-indices, and age-adjusted lung/all other (non-lung) <b>cancer</b> death <b>rates</b> were analyzed with linear regression approach. Non-lung <b>cancer</b> death <b>rates</b> include all <b>cancer</b> deaths excluding lung. Smoking-attributable-fractions (SAFs) for the latest period (year 2003) were estimated as: 1 -(estimated unexposed <b>cancer</b> death rate/observed <b>rate).</b> Results Male lung and non-lung <b>cancer</b> death <b>rates</b> have declined steadily since 1992. Lung and non-lung <b>cancer</b> death <b>rates</b> were tightly and steeply associated across years. The slopes of the associations analyzed were 1. 69 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 35 – 2. 04, r = 0. 90), and 1. 36 (CI 1. 14 – 1. 58, r = 0. 94) without detected autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson statistic = 1. 8). The lung/non-lung <b>cancer</b> death <b>rate</b> associations suggest that all-sites <b>cancer</b> death <b>rate</b> SAFs in year 2003 were 73 % (Sensitivity Range [SR] 61 – 82 %) for all ages and 74 % (SR 61 – 82 %) for ages 30 – 74 years. Conclusion The strong lung/non-lung <b>cancer</b> death <b>rate</b> associations suggest that tobacco smoke load {{may be responsible for}} most prematurely fatal cancers at both lung and non-lung sites. The present method estimates are greater than the earlier estimates. Therefore, tobacco control may reduce <b>cancer</b> death <b>rates</b> more than previously noted. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the outcomes of}} breast biopsy recommendations for women screened through a mobile mammography van. METHODS: Data on all women screened through the Mobile Mammography Program in Suffolk County, Long Island, NY, from 1990 to 1994 were analyzed to determine biopsy recommendation rates, biopsy rates, positive biopsy <b>rates,</b> and <b>cancer</b> detection <b>rates.</b> Follow-up information {{was obtained from the}} women's physicians. RESULTS: The breast <b>cancer</b> detection <b>rate</b> for women screened through the Mobile Mammography Program averaged 0. 33 % over a five-year period. The biopsy recommendation rate based on abnormal mammograms remained stable, at about 1 % to 2 %, over a five-year period, as did the rate of positive biopsies among women having biopsies (36. 8 % to 44. 4 %). For women ages 50 and older, the <b>cancer</b> <b>rate</b> in 1994 was 0. 36 %, while for women younger than age 50, the <b>cancer</b> <b>rate</b> was 0. 25 % (0. 32 % for all ages). CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that a breast cancer screening program using a mobile van can have comparable <b>cancer</b> detection <b>rates</b> to national figures and a fairly stable biopsy recommendation rate from which follow-up resource needs can be estimated...|$|R

A total of 254 individual counties in Texas with corresponding lung <b>cancer</b> incidence <b>rates</b> from 2004 to 2008 and median household incomes in 2006 were collected from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance System.

40|$|Carcinogenic {{modeling}} {{is aimed}} at mathematical descriptions of cancer development in aging. In this work, we assumed that {{a small fraction of}} individuals in the population is susceptible to cancer, {{while the rest of the}} population is resistant to cancer. For individuals susceptible to cancer we adopted methods of conditional survival analyses. We performed computational experiments using data on pancreatic, stomach, gallbladder, colon and rectum, liver, and esophagus cancers from the gastrointestinal system collected for men and women in the SEER registries during 1975 - 2009. In these experiments, we estimated the time period effects, the birth cohort effects, the age effects and the population (unconditional) <b>cancer</b> hazard <b>rates.</b> We also estimated the individual <b>cancer</b> presentation <b>rates</b> and the individual <b>cancer</b> resistance <b>rates,</b> which are, correspondingly, the hazard and survival rates conditioned on the susceptibility to cancer. The performed experiments showed that for men and women, patterns of the age effects, the individual <b>cancer</b> presentation <b>rates</b> and the individual <b>cancer</b> resistance <b>rates</b> are: (i) intrinsic for each cancer subtype, (ii) invariant to the place of living of the individuals diagnosed with cancer, and (iii) well adjusted for the modifiable variables averaged at a given time period. Such specificity and invariability of the age effects, the individual <b>cancer</b> presentation <b>rates</b> and the individual <b>cancer</b> resistance <b>rates</b> suggest that these carcinogenic characteristics can be useful for predictive carcinogenic studies by methods of inferential statistics and for the development of novel strategies for cancer prevention...|$|R
