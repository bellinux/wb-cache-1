40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the 1989 foreign and joint venture groundfish {{activities in the}} eastern Bering Sea and off the Washington-Oregon-California coast. Tables contained herein provide estimates of the foreign and joint venture groundfish catches. Estimates of the rockfiih and flatfish catches are shown by species group and also by species. Estimates are made of the catches and average weights of Pacific salmon (Oncorhvnchus spp.), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolenis), snow (Tanner) crab (<b>Chionoecetes</b> <b>spp.),</b> and king crab (Lithodes and Paralithodes spp.) ...|$|E
40|$|Decapoda {{taken in}} Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) {{samples from the}} Pacific in 1997 and 2000 - 2003 have been {{identified}} and measured. Some previously un-described larval stages were referred to species and characteristics of these are described. Distributions and seasonal occurrence of decapod taxa in the samples are described and discussed with particular emphasis on the dendrobranchiate shrimp Sergestes similis and the brachyurans Cancer spp. And <b>Chionoecetes</b> <b>spp.</b> There is a prolonged larval season at low levels of abundance off the Californian coast but in the more northern waters there is a shorter productive period but numbers of larvae per sample are high, particularly in June. Larvae of Chionoecetes and other Oregoninae were found only from May to July...|$|E
