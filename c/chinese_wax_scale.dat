40|$|Soft wax scale (SWS) Ceroplastes {{destructor}} (Newstead) and <b>Chinese</b> <b>wax</b> <b>scale</b> (CWS) C. sinensis Del Guercio (Hemiptera: Coccidae) are indirect pests {{of citrus}} (Citrus spp.) in New Zealand. Honeydew they produce supports sooty mould fungi that disfigure fruit and reduce photosynthesis and fruit yield. Presently, control relies on calendar applications of insecticides. The main {{aim of this}} study was to provide the ecological basis for the integrated management of SWS and CWS. Specific objectives were to compare their population ecologies, determine major mortality factors and levels of natural control, quantify the impact of ladybirds on scale populations, and evaluate pesticides for compatibility with ladybirds. Among 57 surveyed orchards, SWS was more abundant than CWS in Kerikeri but was not found around Whangarei. Applications of organophosphates had not reduced the proportion of orchards with medium or high densities of SWS. Monthly destructive sampling of scale populations between November 1990 and February 1994 was supplemented by in situ counts of scale cohorts. Both species were univoltine, but SWS eggs hatched two months earlier than those of CWS, and development between successive instars remained two to three months ahead. The start of SWS crawler emergence varied by seven weeks between 1988 - 1993. A linear relationship between scale size and fecundity was found for both species. The variation in mean scale size amongst orchards corresponded to large differences in egg production. Survivorship curves and life tables were compared between populations with high and low levels of ladybird predation. Over 90 % of crawlers failed to settle. At four orchards with high numbers of ladybirds, 99 % of settled first and second instar scales died. The key mortality factor occurred at this stage where ladybirds were abundant. In contrast, where ladybirds were scarce, mortality of first and second instar scales was approximately 82 % and some scales survived to breed. Mortality of third instar and adult scales was approximately 80 % and 50 % respectively. Parasitised scales were incubated and parasitoids identified from emerged adults. Diseased scales were cultured to identify fungal entomopathogens. One primary and one secondary parasitoid (Euxanthellus philippiae Silvestri and Coccidoctonus dub ius (Girault) respectively) and two fungal pathogens (Verticillium lecanii (Zimmermann) Viegas and Fusarium spp.) attacked one or both of these stages of SWS and CWS. Parasitoids and pathogens each caused less than 30 % mortality. Density-dependent mortality was not shown by any of the natural enemies. The effect of ladybirds on scale populations was assessed by sampling and experiments where branches and trees were covered to exclude or include ladybirds. Ladybirds predated first and second instar scales and could reduce local scale populations to extinction. Both larval and adult steel blue ladybirds (SBL) Halmus chalybeus (Boisduval), Rhyzobius forestieri (Mulsant), and adult Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant and Rodolia cardinalis (Mulsant) fed on SWS in laboratory experiments. Adult SBL and R. forestieri consumed approximately 15 scales per day in the field. SBL comprised 98 % of ladybirds in visual and manual searches. Pesticides were screened for toxicity to SBL by a slide dip method, and for disruption to predation by the reduction in feeding on treated leaves. Fungicides and insecticides inhibited feeding by SBL and reduced their numbers. Copper-based fungicides reduced predation by about 80 % compared with approximately 30 % by non-copper fungicides. Buprofezin was non-toxic and non-disruptive to SBL. Mineral oils were moderately toxic but caused some disruption to predation. Organophosphates, synthetic pyrethroids and an insecticidal soap were highly toxic to SBL at recommended label rates. Three fungicides were evaluated in an orchard. Both copper and non-copper fungicides reduced numbers of ladybirds. Nine-spray programmes reduced numbers more than 5 -spray programmes. SWS were more abundant than CWS probably in part because their phenology made them less vulnerable to adverse environmental conditions and ladybirds. Currently, SBL are the key to biological control of SWS and CWS, but with present spray programmes particularly those involving organophosphates, ladybirds cannot be relied on to be sufficiently abundant at the right time of year to achieve control. Orchardists should avoid or reduce applications of copper fungicides during spring and summer to minimise disruption to predation of SWS by ladybirds. The introduction of parasitoids such as those which control SWS in South Mrica and Australia would complement the existing biocontrol from ladybirds and should be investigated...|$|E

30|$|The <b>Chinese</b> white <b>wax</b> <b>scale</b> insect, Ericerus pela, is a {{well-known}} resource insect species, owing to its role in wax production and has been bred in China for over one thousand years. White wax, produced by the male second-instar larvae, is widely used in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and cosmetics industries. However, female E. pela cannot produce wax. In addition, females and males are dramatically distinct at each developmental stage. The males undergo holometabolous-like development, developing through egg, first- and second-stage nymph, pupal (prepupal and pupal), and adult stages and emerging as winged adults. The second-instar male nymphal period lasts 2  months, which is a relatively long period, whereas the male adult period lasts only 1  week because the males die immediately after mating (Chen 2011). In contrast, the females undergo neotenous development, developing through egg, first- and second-stage nymph, and adult stages. The female adult period is approximately 8  months and is the longest developmental stage in E. plea. E. pela is widely distributed from the subtropics to temperate areas in China, Korea, and Japan. Individuals can survive a high temperature of 44.0  °C and a low temperature of − 30.4  °C in these areas (Chen 2011).|$|R
40|$|Background: The <b>Chinese</b> white <b>wax</b> <b>scale,</b> Ericerus pela Chavannes is {{economically}} {{significant for}} {{its role in}} wax production. This insect has been bred in China for over a thousand years. The wax secreted by the male scale insect during the secondinstar larval stage has been widespread used in wax candle production, <b>wax</b> printing, engraving, <b>Chinese</b> medicine, and more recently in the chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetics industries. However, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms responsible for white wax biosynthesis. The characterization of its larval transcriptome may promote better understanding of wax biosynthesis. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, characterization of the transcriptome of E. pela during peak wax secretion was performed using Illumina sequencing technology. Illumina sequencing produced 41, 839 unigenes. These unigenes were annotated by blastx alignment against the NCBI Non-Redundant (NR), Swiss-Prot, KEGG, and COG databases. A total of 104 unigenes related to white wax biosynthesis were identified, and 15 of them were selected for quantitative real-time PCR analysis. We evaluated the variations in gene expression across different development stages, including egg, first/second instar larvae, male pupae, and male and female adults. Then we identified five genes involved in white wax biosynthesis. These genes were expressed most strongly during the second-instar larval stage of male E. pela.

40|$|Studies on epigeal and {{arboreal}} and predatory arthropods in two mango orchards in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea Predatory arthropods {{were studied}} by the beating method and pitfall trapping in two mango orchards in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Both orchards were not sprayed with synthetic insecticides during or before the study period. Formicidae {{were the most}} numerous group within the epigeal and the arboreal arthropods (2772 and 2269 ind., respectively). The weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina, was the most abundant species within the arboreal arthropods. Pheidole spp. was most frequent in pitfall traps. Spiders were the second most numerous group (524 and 619 ind., respectively). Lycosidae were predominant in pitfall traps and Salticidae in net catches with the beating method on the trees. In the barber traps, Carabidae and Staphylinidae were only present in low numbers (47 ind.). Coccinellidae were the most numerous family within the arboreal predatory beetles (89 ind.). Telsimia sp. accounted for 63 % of the ladybird beetles. Crickets were frequently collected in pitfall traps (187 ind.). A survey on the occurrence and importance of mango pests in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea A survey was conducted at four sites in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea to determine the abundance and importance of nine insect pests in mango. The pests, except fruit flies which were monitored by fallen fruits, were monitored three times during 2002 according to their occurrence within the mango season. Out of these pests, the white mango scale Aulacaspis tubercularis, (Homopt., Diaspididae), the mango leafminer Acrocerops spp. (Lep., Gracillariidae), the leafhoppers,Idioscopus clypealis and,I. niveosparsus (Homopt., Cicadellidae), the soft scales Saissetia sp. and Parasaissetia sp. (Homopt., Coccidae) and the fruit fly Bactrocera frauenfeldi (Dip., Tephritidae) proved to be serious pests. Appropriate control measures, in particular biological and cultural methods, are proposed. Infestation levels with fruit piercing moths Othreis fullonia, O. materna, Eudocima salaminia (Lep., Noctuidae), aphids Toxoptera odinae (Homopt., Aphididae), blossom feeders Cosmostola sp., Gymnoscelis sp., Nanaguna breviuscula (Lepidoptera) and planthoppers Colgaroides acuminata, Colgar sp., Scolypopa sp. (Homopt., Flatidae, Ricaniidae) were lower. Appropriate control measures are recommended but not immediately required. On the biological control of Ceroplastes rubens (Homopt., Coccidae) with the introduced parasitoid Anicetus beneficus (Hym., Encyrtidae) A {{study was conducted in}} three provinces of Papua New Guinea to determine damage by the pink <b>wax</b> <b>scale</b> Ceroplastes rubens and to identify endemic parasitoids and parasitization levels in order to evaluate the necessity and possibility of a classical biological control with an introduced parasitoid. Infestation levels with the pink <b>wax</b> <b>scale</b> variied 3. 82 % and 6. 40 %. The parasitization levels variied between 1. 19 % and 3. 05 %. Out of the nine endemic parasitoids identified, Aprostocetus sp. (Hym., Eulophidae) was the most frequent one. The pink <b>wax</b> <b>scale</b> parasitoid Anicetus beneficus (Hym., Encyrtidae) was imported from Australia and released at four sites in the Central Province in March/April 2002. The establishment was controlled at two sites six resp. twelve months after release. Parasitization levels increased significantly (from 3. 05 % to 5. 45 % at Laloki and from 2. 04 % to 22. 15 % at Tahira). At both sites, A. beneficus was the most frequent parasitoid. The parasitization process at the Laloki site was disturbed by the ant Tapinoma sp. Studies on the biology of Deanolis sublimbalis (Lep., Pyralidae) and its natural enemies A study was conducted at four sites in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea to determine infestation levels and biological behaviour of the red banded mango caterpillar Deanolis sublimbalis (RBMC). Eggs and larvae were collected to identify natural enemies and to develop potential control strategies. Infestation levels of mango fruits variied between 3. 36 % and 23. 18 %. The eggs are mainly found at the peduncle covered with dried sepals. Pupation takes place inside the bark of the mango tree. No other plants than Mangifera spp. were confirmed as hosts in laboratory and field studies. The pest goes into diapause during mango off-season. No egg or larval parasitoids were recorded.

25|$|Though often counted {{among the}} various {{carnivorous}} plants, {{with the exception of}} Heliamphora tatei, the vast majority of plants in the genus Heliamphora do not produce their own digestive enzymes (i.e. proteases, ribonucleases, phosphatases, etc.), relying instead on the enzymes of symbiotic bacteria to break down their prey. They do, however, attract prey through special visual and chemical signals and trap and kill the prey through a typical pitfall trap. Field studies of H. nutans, H. heterodoxa, H. minor, and H. ionasi have determined that none of these species produce their own proteolytic enzymes. If production of these enzymes was used as a strict demarcation of what is and what is not a carnivorous plant, many of the Heliamphora species would not meet the requirement. H. tatei {{is one of the few}} species observed to produce both digestive enzymes and <b>wax</b> <b>scales,</b> which also aid in prey capture. The pattern of carnivory among Heliamphora species, combined with habitat data, indicates that carnivory in this genus evolved in nutrient-poor locations as a means to improve absorption of available nutrients. Most Heliamphora typically capture ants, while H. tateis improvements on the design allow it to capture and absorb nutrients from more flying insects. The carnivorous habit among these species is lost in low light conditions, which suggests that certain nutrient concentrations (specifically nitrogen and phosphorus) are only limiting during periods of fast growth under normal light conditions, thus rendering most of the carnivorous adaptations inefficient and not energy cost effective.|$|R
