5000|$|Huejotzingo ( [...] is a {{small city}} and {{municipality}} located just northwest {{of the city of}} Puebla, in central Mexico. The settlement’s history dates back to the pre-Hispanic period, when it was a dominion, with its capital a short distance from where the modern settlement is today.

Today, Huejotzingo is known for the production of alcoholic apple <b>cider</b> and <b>fruit</b> preserves, as well as its annual carnival. This carnival is distinct as it centers on the re-enactment of several historical and legendary events related to the area.

5000|$|Section 29 of the Act allowed 200 gallons (the {{equivalent}} of about 1000 750 ml bottles) of [...] "non-intoxicating <b>cider</b> and <b>fruit</b> juice" [...] to be made each year at home. Initially [...] "intoxicating" [...] was defined as anything more than 0.5%, but the Bureau of Internal Revenue soon struck that down and this effectively legalized home wine-making. For beer, however, the 0.5% limit remained until 1933. Some vineyards embraced the sale of grapes for making wine at home; Zinfandel grapes were popular among home winemakers living near the vineyards, but its tight bunches left their thin skins vulnerable to rot, due to rubbing and abrasion, on the long journey to East Coast markets. The thick skins of Alicante Bouschet were less susceptible to rot, so this and similar varieties were widely planted for the home wine-making market.|$|R
