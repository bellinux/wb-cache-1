50|$|The blue <b>agave</b> <b>plant</b> has spiked {{leaves and}} a round, fleshy core (the piña). The leaves are chopped {{off and the}} core is cooked and crushed to create juice, which is {{fermented}} and distilled to make tequila. The resulting unaged, clear tequila is then diluted with water to bring the alcohol content down to around 40%. Pure tequila is distilled 100% from the sap of the blue <b>agave</b> <b>plant,</b> while mixto tequilas only need {{to be at least}} 51% blue agave in order to legally be called tequila. In 1964, tequila makers were allowed to obtain up to 30% of the sugars in tequila from sources other than the <b>agave</b> <b>plant.</b> During a blue agave shortage in the 1970s, Mexican regulations were further revised to require that tequila contain only 51.5% <b>agave.</b> <b>Agave</b> <b>plants</b> take 10 to 12 years to mature and become ripe, while sugarcane can be harvested every year, so blending the agave spirit with sugarcane spirit is a cheaper method, while using 100% blue <b>agave</b> <b>plant</b> is more expensive.|$|R

50|$|Agave was {{cultivated}} by the Hohokam in {{the desert}} of the Tucson basin in rocky areas above the floodplain of the Santa Cruz river where more water-dependent crops were grown. The Hohokam <b>planted</b> <b>agave</b> in rockpiles about 5 ft across and 2 ft high. The pile of rocks {{around the base of}} the <b>agave</b> <b>plant</b> act as a mulch to help preserve moisture and prevent rodent predation. Check dams and contour terraces help channel the runoff from precipitation to the <b>agave</b> <b>plants.</b> About one-tenth of the Hohokam <b>agave</b> <b>plants</b> flowered each year and were harvested. The fields are dotted with the remains of large roasting pits for the agave. Rockpile cultivation began about 600 AD. Large-scale production characterized the classic period of Hohokam culture from 1150 to 1450.|$|R

30|$|<b>Agave</b> <b>plants</b> {{are used}} in Mexico for the {{production}} of different alcoholic beverages; of which, tequila is the most popular. Tequila is produced by distilling fermented agave juice (Agave tequilana Weber var. azul). The tequila market has had a tremendous expansion (from 104 to 253 million of liters) from 1995 to 2012 (Tequila 2012); however, <b>agave</b> <b>plants</b> diseases, high production costs and elevated volumes of vinasses have threatened the sustainability of this industry; for that reason, tequila producers have searched biotechnological and organizational alternatives, for increasing the productivity and efficiency of their processes (Casas 2006).|$|R
50|$|Raicilla is a {{distilled}} spirit, {{originating in}} the south western portion of the Mexican state of Jalisco. Like tequila and mezcal, it {{is a product of}} the <b>agave</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|R
50|$|These land estates were {{dedicated}} to farm labor, {{most in the}} production of mezcal, a wine made from <b>agave</b> <b>plant.</b> Other crops grown were sugar cane and rice; and livestock was also an important profit.|$|R

50|$|The {{differences}} in taste between tequila made from lowland and highland <b>agave</b> <b>plants</b> can be noticeable. Plants {{grown in the}} highlands often yield sweeter and fruitier-tasting tequila, while lowland agaves give the tequila an earthier flavor.|$|R

2500|$|Pulque is a milk-colored, {{somewhat}} {{viscous liquid}} {{that produces a}} light foam. [...] It is made by fermenting the sap of certain types of maguey (<b>agave)</b> <b>plants.</b> In contrast, mezcal is made from the cooked heart of certain <b>agave</b> <b>plants,</b> and tequila, a variety of mezcal, is made all or mostly from the blue agave. About six varieties of maguey are best used {{for the production of}} pulque. The name pulque is derived from Nahuatl. The original name of the drink was iztāc octli [...] (white pulque), the term pulque was probably mistakenly derived by the Spanish from the octli poliuhqui , which meant [...] "spoiled pulque".|$|R
5000|$|Tequila (Spanish [...] ) is a {{regionally}} specific {{distilled beverage}} {{made from the}} blue <b>agave</b> <b>plant,</b> primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila, 65 km northwest of Guadalajara, and in the highlands (Los Altos) of the central western Mexican state of Jalisco. Aside from differences in region of origin, tequila {{is a type of}} mezcal (and the regions of production of the two drinks are overlapping). The distinction in the method of production is that tequila must use only blue <b>agave</b> <b>plants</b> rather than any type of agave. Tequila is commonly served neat in Mexico and as a shot with salt and lime across the rest of the world.|$|R

50|$|Planting, tending, and {{harvesting}} the <b>agave</b> <b>plant</b> remains a manual effort, largely unchanged by modern farm machinery and relying on centuries-old know-how.
