5|$|In October 1166, Becket ordered Robert and Roger of Worcester {{to attend}} him in France, so they <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{guidance}} on his {{dispute with the}} king. When they informed the king of their intended journey he forbade them to leave England. Nevertheless, they attempted to sneak {{out of the country}} in February 1167. They were apprehended on 2February, and ordered to remain in England not only in the king's name, but also in Alexander's.|$|E
5|$|Some Democrats {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} outcome of the Music Hall Convention. After a period of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted to defend him against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens. Owens called on Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> the governorship.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E

5|$|On September 25, manager Bruce Bochy {{decided to}} give Zito one final start with the Giants {{as a tribute to}} his tenure with the team. Zito responded by {{allowing}} two runs (one earned) over five innings and earning the win in a 7–4 victory over the Dodgers. However, because Zito was removed between innings during the Dodger game, Bochy sent him in to pitch in relief in the final game of the year so that Giants' fans <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a standing ovation. Zito entered with two outs in the eighth inning on September 29 and struck out Mark Kotsay (playing his final game) as the Giants beat the Padres 7–6. He finished the 2013 season at 5–11 with a 5.74 ERA in 30 games, 25 of which were starts. Following the season, Zito took out a full-page ad in the San Francisco Chronicle thanking Giants fans for their support. The Giants declined Zito's 2014 option, buying it out for $7 million.|$|E
5|$|The Senate-passed bill {{then was}} {{transmitted}} to the House of Representatives, and was referred to the Coinage Committee on February 20. It was brought forward on February 27, 1925. When the Speaker, Frederick H. Gillett, {{asked if there was}} objection to the consideration of the bill, Ohio's James T. Begg wanted to know if there was anyone present who <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> information about it, and if there was not, he would object. Kvale stated that he could, and when Begg inquired if Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon favored the bill, he assured the Ohioan that this was so. Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1925.|$|E

To get rid of him, fellow politician Francis Kunjappan (Mukesh) offers him a never-did-before task in the United States which <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> enough money to fulfill his dream of a sports academy.

25|$|Giachino was not dead, {{but very}} badly wounded. An Argentine paramedic, Corporal Ernesto Urbina, {{attempted}} {{to get to}} Giachino but was wounded by a grenade. Giachino, seeing what had happened, pulled the pin from a hand grenade and threatened to use it. The Royal Marines then attempted to persuade the officer {{to get rid of}} the grenade so that they <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> medical treatment, but he refused, preventing them from reaching his position. After the surrender of the British forces at Government House, some three hours later, Giachino was taken to Stanley Hospital but died from loss of blood.|$|E

25|$|At that time, {{while still}} a cadet, {{he met the}} future King of Spain, Prince Alfonso, who was in exile, {{attending}} the military school at Sandhurst. Prince Alfonso was proclaimed King of Spain in December 1874 and received the news while he was dining with Gordon in London. During that time Spain was engaged in a civil war, the Third Carlist War, and Gordon told Prince Alfonso {{that he had made}} plans to travel to northern Spain and join his enemy Carlos, Duke of Madrid with the object of gaining military experience. Prince Alfonso told Gordon that he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a letter of recommendation so he could join the royalist army, but Gordon declined.|$|E
25|$|With {{his absence}} from the Sin Salida show Blue Panther Jr. lost any chance of {{advancing}} to {{the second round of}} the En Busca de un Ídolo as he was more than 90 points from fourth place, with only a maximum of 40 points being possible in the fan poll for that week. Delta, despite winning, was also out of contention for the second round as he had 300 points after the match and the fourth place Flyer, who had yet to wrestle and receive points that week had 344, more points than the fan poll <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him.</b> While Canelo Casas was only 23 points out of fourth place the fact that both the fifth and fourth place competitors, Disturbio and Flyer, had yet to wrestle and receive points Casas was all but eliminated from the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Arndt {{worked on}} the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him.</b> The {{production}} announced Arndt's exit from the project on October 24, 2013, and Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties. Abrams expressed relief that the release date was announced for December 2015 instead of a previously discussed summer release. He and Kasdan planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, New York City, Paris and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks. Abrams said that the key for the film was {{to return to the}} roots of the first Star Wars film and be based more on emotion than explanation. In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete. In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that Episodes VII–IX would not feature storylines from the Star Wars expanded universe, though other elements could be included as with the TV series Star Wars Rebels.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{the marked}} {{signing of the}} summer was defender Sol Campbell, who moved from rivals Tottenham Hotspur on a Bosman ruling.

Campbell was unveiled at a midday news conference on 3 July 2001, which journalists [...] "presumed had been called to announce goalkeeper Richard Wright's arrival from Ipswich."

500|$|... "The Puppy Episode" [...] and DeGeneres's {{attendant}} {{coming out}} generated enormous publicity {{before the show}} aired. Right-wing groups like the American Family Association pressured ABC to drop the storyline and Ellen sponsors not to advertise; two occasional advertisers, J. C. Penney and Chrysler, decided not to buy time during the episode. Another sponsor, Wendy's, decided not to advertise on Ellen again at all. Despite these losses of potential advertisers, ABC turned away ads from two LGBT-oriented sponsors, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and lesbian vacation company Olivia Cruises. Jerry Falwell called DeGeneres [...] "Ellen Degenerate", to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I've been getting that since the fourth grade. I guess I'm happy I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> work." [...] GLAAD organized [...] "Come Out With Ellen" [...] house parties across the United States and HRC created [...] "Ellen Coming Out House Party" [...] kits that included invitations, posters and an Ellen trivia game. HRC had initially planned to send out about 300 kits. Deluged with requests, they ended up sending out about 3,000. ABC affiliate WBMA-LP in Birmingham, Alabama, citing [...] "family values", first sought ABC's permission to move the episode out of prime-time to a late-night slot. When ABC declined the request, the affiliate refused to air the episode at all. Local LGBT organization Pride Birmingham arranged for a satellite feed of the episode and rented a 5,000-seat theatre for a viewing party, with about 1,000 people attending. Local activists circulated a petition requesting that Abilene, Texas-area affiliate KTXS-TV not air the episode but were unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|The {{week that}} Hauck {{was sentenced to}} prison, Cox was living in Nashville, Tennessee under the name Joseph Carter. He was dating a single mother, Amanda Gardner, who was unaware of his {{criminal}} past, and posing {{as the owner of}} a home restoration business. He told her he was from a wealthy family, and his silver 2005 Infiniti and [...] "fashionably decorated bungalow" [...] seemed to confirm this. Cox used a falsified passport to travel to Europe on a cruise of the Greek Isles with Gardner. He did not spend much time in Italy or Greece due to his intense fear of Interpol. He was reported by Gardner's 60-year-old babysitter, Patsy Taylor. She became suspicious of Cox, so she researched him online, where she discovered his true identity. Taylor was put in contact with the attorney of Rebecca Hauck by a St. Petersburg Times reporter. Hauck's family paid Taylor for Cox's address, as this information could be used to reduce Hauck's sentence. He temporarily escaped capture due to a chance series of events. Cox and Gardner's home was burglarized, and they checked into a hotel. On November 16, 2006, Cox was arrested by a half dozen Secret Service agents—who had been pursuing him for more than two years—when he and Gardner returned from the hotel. He had been building Williamson a house using his fake identity and credit history, but, fortunately for his friend, he was arrested before Williamson <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a down payment. Hauck's sentence was later reduced from 70 to 42 months {{as a result of her}} assistance in Cox's capture.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Venice, Frederick again caught cold; privately, Mackenzie was growing seriously concerned, having observed a continued tendency for Frederick's throat and larynx to swell. He forbade Frederick from speaking at any length, noting {{that if the}} Crown Prince insisted on speaking and contracted further colds, he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{no more than three}} months to live. At the beginning of October, Victoria noted that [...] "Fritz's throat is giving no cause for fresh anxiety & he really does take a little more care and speaks a little less." [...] On 6 October, Frederick, his family and Mackenzie left for a villa at Baveno on the shore of Lake Maggiore, with Mackenzie leaving Baveno on 8 October, after predicting Frederick's recovery [...] "in 3 or 4 months," [...] wrote Victoria. Their elder son Wilhelm joined them at Baveno on 17 October for Frederick's 56th birthday the following day. At the end of October, Frederick's condition abruptly worsened, with Victoria writing to her mother on 2 November that Frederick's throat was again inflamed, but not due to any cold, and that he was [...] "very hoarse again" [...] and easily became depressed about his health. General Alfred von Waldersee observed that Frederick's health had grave implications, as if William died soon and his son succeeded, [...] "a new Kaiser who is not allowed to speak is a virtual impossibility, quite apart from the fact that we desperately need a highly energetic one." [...] His son Wilhelm reported to King Albert of Saxony that his father was frequently short-tempered and melancholic, though his voice appeared to have slightly improved, and that Frederick's throat was being treated by [...] "blowing in a powder twice a day to soothe the larynx." ...|$|E
