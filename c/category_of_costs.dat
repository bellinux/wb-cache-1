40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} components of the balance sheet of a property-casualty insurance company is the loss reserve. In spite of what the term may suggest, a loss reserve is not a pot of funds set aside for the uncertain future. It is an accounting entry, a liability on the balance sheet. More precisely termed the unpaid-losses account, the loss reserve expresses the amount the company expects to pay out in the future to cover indemnity payments that will come due on policies already written for losses that have already been incurred and to cover the costs of dealing with the associated claims. The latter <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs,</b> which includes, for example, the litigation costs associated with settling claims, is called loss-adjustment expenses.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{the literature on}} the efficacy and effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy and examined the economic consequences of under-utilisation. Despite the literature documenting the value of beta-blockers, the therapy is not prescribed at the appropriate rates. Approximately half of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) survivors who are eligible for the therapy do not receive it. There are 3 sources of costs that may arise from such under-utilisation: 1. increased morbidity and mortality associated with under-use 2. increased demand for related medical resources when the health state following an AMI is suboptimal due to under-use of beta-blocker therapy; and 3. increased cost due to substitution of higher cost and/or less effective treatments for beta-blockers. For the first category, there is evidence suggesting that around 2900 to 5000 lives are lost in the US in the first year following an AMI due to underprescription. There is very little evidence on the second category of costs; 1 recent study does address this issue and indicates that beta-blocker therapy can lead to a 22 % relative risk reduction for hospital readmission during the first year. Several studies also show a decrease in reinfarction. There is no information that addresses the third <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> adequately (though 1 study does present evidence of substitution of calcium channel-blockers for beta-blockers).

40|$|The {{amount of}} soil erosion has {{decreased}} in the United States and Iowa, but soil erosion still remains a serious problem, especially for some soils. In 1982 there was an estimated 7. 4 tons per acre of soil erosion on Iowa cropland. By 2007 erosion in Iowa had decreased to 5. 1 tons per acre. For the entire United States, erosion rates dropped from 4. 0 tons to 2. 7 tons per cropland acre over the same time period. (USDA/NRCS, 2) Erosion represents costs to the farmers. These costs include lost fertilizer and soil carbon. Erosion also produces costs to society. These costs include clogged roadway ditches, increased turbidity in the water damaging fi sh and increasing the need for fi l-tration, and displaced soil in the water that increases siltation of water control structures. These societal costs are borne by taxpayers or society in general. They are ‘external ’ to the decisions made by the farmer. There is a third <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> not usually con-sidered {{in a discussion of}} soil erosion. These are the costs to the land owners caused by a decrease in land value. Land owners may be the farmer, but increas-ingly they are not. In 2007 over half the farmland in Iowa was rented. In the United States, 38 percent of the farmland was rented. This paper estimates the costs of erosion to the land owner. The focus is on Iowa soils. Farmer and Societal Cost There have been several studies estimating the costs of soil erosion in the United States. These studies have examined the costs to the individual farmer, the costs to society or both. Tegtmeier and Duffy esti-mated the external costs of agricultural production in the United States (primarily erosion related) to range from $ 14. 09 to $ 45. 68 in 2002 dollars. (Tegtmeier and Duffy) The USDA has undertaken a number of different studies to estimate the costs of erosion.

40|$|Social {{costs of}} {{production}} mean {{the whole of}} goods which must be spent by a society for reaching a given production effect, i. e. a stream of spent social work and expenditures for other than work production factors (area, national environment, resources of fixed capital and of turn-over funds). The <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> of an enterprise results from existing commodity-monetary relations in a socialist economy. They express individual expenditures of material resources of an enterprise for the production process realized in it. Expenditures of these resources can be connected with using or engaging production factors {{in the process of}} production. The scope of elements creating production costs of an enterprise is different in particular countries and in addition it changes in time. It depends on the system of management of the national economy, on using or not definite economic instruments and on carrying on a definite social policy by the state. With the postulate of non-contradiction of macro- and micro-economic calculi the problem of compliance of dynamics and relations of costs of enterprise and of social costs is connected. There arises a question, whether the costs of an enterprise can function as a representative of social costs. There appear some obstacles in respect to that. The costs of an enterprise do not encompass all the elements of social costs connected with production. Increase or decline in costs of an enterprise needs not to lead to changes in social costs and can cause changes in costs in other economic units. The basic hindrance is the deformation of social costs of purchasing certain goods by industrial enterprises by prices of goods in the turnover between the subjects of the national economy and by prices of imported goods. Actions should be taken up in the sphere of mechanisms of functioning of the national economy and in the sphere of economic instruments. These actions should near the production costs of an enterprise to social costs connected with its activities. The matter is to improve the price system and the amortization system of stable capital as well as to include a row of elements into the costs calculus.

40|$|Temporary {{agencies}} {{are commonly used}} by Swedish companies today, and according to Coe, Johns and Ward (2009), this is because Sweden has a strict labor market regulation which makes companies afraid to employ workers on a permanent basis. By using temporary agencies, companies can come around the Employment Protection Act (EPA) which makes us question which parts of the EPA that companies consider as a problem and if the use of temporary agencies actually can reduce this problem for Swedish companies. Focus in this thesis is companies´ personnel costs, {{which means that the}} EPA and the use of temporary {{agencies are}} investigated with these costs in mind. Therefore, the purpose with this thesis is to investigate how the EPA affects Swedish companies’ personnel costs over the years 2007 - 2009, and examine if the use of temporary agencies can reduce these costs. A descriptive investigation is conducted in order to examine the purpose of this thesis. The study is accomplished through an Internet based questionnaire which is send to 68 randomly chosen companies all over Sweden, with 51 - 150 workers from no specific branch or geographical area. 32 companies participate in the study. From the descriptive investigation it is evident that the EPA has increased personnel costs for Swedish companies over the years 2007 - 2009. However, this happens indirectly through decreased flexibility making it difficult for companies to quickly adjust to changes in demand. Also, a majority of the companies are critical towards the EPA and show direct consequences’ of negative impacts experienced. Consequently, we suggest that the EPA is updated to fit the conditions of today´s labor market. Furthermore, temporary agencies reduce companies’ personnel costs by enabling them to hire workers and avoid costs as employment benefits and costs for absenteeism. However, the direct costs of temporary workers are higher than the direct cost for permanent workers. Therefore, we suggest that the use of temporary agencies should not be used instead of permanent employments but mainly in situations of escalating demand when greater flexibility is needed. Finally, the costs for permanent workers are reported in account category 7 “personnel costs, depreciation etcetera” and the costs for temporary workers are reported in account categories 5 - 6 “other external operating expenses” in the income statement. However, both these account categories are included in the same main <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs.</b> This means that the only difference in the income statement is due to the higher cost of temporary workers. Besides this, companies´ accounting is not affected...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the {{fundamentals}} <b>of</b> quality <b>costing.</b> The measurement and management <b>of</b> quality <b>costs</b> is an interesting issue for several reasons. First <b>of</b> all, quality <b>costing</b> is a cost management tool which requires a strong integration of accounting with other specialisms. These specialisms often have a functional background, for instance engineering. Second, there is potential for many organizations to use this tool due to its great potential impact on performance: an impact {{that can be found}} both in relation to revenue, since quality can be used to position the products, and in relation to net cost reductions. Although there is strong evidence <b>of</b> quality <b>costing</b> in practice (e. g. Dale and Plunkett, 1999; Shotmiller and Campanella, 2007; Tennucci et al. 2010), it does not exist, by any means, in all companies and there may be scope for its greater use. Third, there are well known, expected relationships among <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> quality <b>costs</b> on which managers could base their quality cost reduction initiatives.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the information provision requirements placed on hedge funds in Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Because the legislation and rulemaking {{are yet to}} be implemented, I use three historical examples of similar information provision policies to identify areas <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits relevant to information disclosure policy. With these <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits established, I create a framework for consideration by economists in future cost-benefit analyses of the rule. The 1934 Securities Exchange Act, the 1960 Amendments to the Investment Advisers Act, and the 2004 SEC decision to mandate hedge fund information disclosure are unique policy events that provide the investigative background <b>of</b> the relevant <b>costs</b> and benefits <b>of</b> the SEC’s mandatory disclosure policies. Language from these statutes is the backbone for Dodd-Frank Title IV, which amends Section 204 of the Investment Advisers Act to include hedge funds in the SEC disclosure regulation scheme. Research and analysis of historical disclosure policies furnishes specific <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits to create a framework for future analysis. The relevant areas include the following categories: firm level <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> compliance with regulation; market-wide <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> decreased hedge fund activity, capital formation, and liquidity provided by funds; market-wide <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> decreased hedge fund incentive to uncover price information and add transparency to markets; the societal <b>cost</b> or benefit <b>of</b> funding a larger SEC bureaucracy and regulatory regime; decreased risk of system-wide shock and crash; and the increased ability of the SEC to monitor and deter fraud and insider trading by hedge funds.
