25|$|Because {{the player}} of a brass {{instrument}} has direct {{control of the}} prime vibrator (the lips), brass instruments exploit the player's ability to select the harmonic at which the instrument's column of air vibrates. By making the instrument about {{twice as long as}} the equivalent woodwind instrument and starting with the second harmonic, players <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> range of notes simply by varying the tension of their lips (see embouchure).|$|E

2500|$|Brendan's {{curiosity about}} K-9 is matched only by Sarah's renewed concern over Lavinia's absence. They thus split up and follow their new-found obsessions. Sarah goes into town to {{question}} the locals, and Brendan stays behind to test the capabilities of Sarah's new [...] "pet". In town, Sarah discovers that Lavinia has become disliked by some because of her blunt letters to the local newspaper editors about a growing practice of witchcraft in the area. Brendan, meanwhile, is attacked while using K-9 to analyse soil samples in Lavinia's garden. His attackers, George Tracey and his son, Peter, are tied into the local coven. George Tracey flees before Brendan <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> look at him, however K9 uses his laser gun to stun Peter before setting off in pursuit of George. [...] Peter is pinioned and interrogated by Brendan, but makes his escape when Brendan goes outside to investigate a crashing sound {{which turns out to}} be the accidental destruction of a greenhouse by K9 in his pursuit of the elder Tracey.|$|E

40|$|We {{are blessed}} when {{incremental}}ism will suffice. It {{is nice to}} be in a place where incremental reforms <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to <b>a</b> <b>good</b> destination. Incremental reforms are much easier and safer. But, Transformative change is harder. It is often easier to duck, by claiming credit for minor things, or claiming that major things were infeasible...|$|R

5000|$|The song's origins are {{the subject}} of {{different}} accounts (see Tommy Duncan for one); but there is agreement that Texas Playboys vocalist Duncan came up with the song's title and refrain, at which point songwriter Cindy Walker became involved.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between shapes {{plays an important}} role in shape interpolation. Traditional methods <b>can</b> not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> result because they mainly use local information of shapes and can not analyze the shape relation globally. In this paper,the authors put forwards a global interpolation method for shapes,which can make full use of the relation between shapes.

At the end of this paper,the experiment is done to show the good result of new method. 隱含在２Ｄ幾何圖形之間的圖形關系在圖形內插中起著十分重要的作用．本文在深入研究了圖形內插問題之后，提出了一種２Ｄ幾何圖形整體內插的思路并設計出了一種實現整體內插的算法．該算法根據內插圖形所具有的特性建立反映初始圖形之間相互關系的三維模型，然后通過該模型得到所需要的內插圖...|$|R
