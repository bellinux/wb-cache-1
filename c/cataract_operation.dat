From Chicago, they took another train, departing at 10:30a.m. on the 21st and arriving at noon on the 22nd, and the trip took 25 hours; the king had requested the train travel slowly, as he was recovering from bronchitis and malaria.

In May 2017, Mugabe took a weeklong trip to Cancún, Mexico, ostensibly to attend a three-day conference on disaster risk reduction, eliciting criticism of wasteful spending from opposition figures. He made three medical trips to Singapore in 2017, and Grace Mugabe called on him to name a successor.|$|E

40|$|Cataract {{disrupts}} the crystalline lens, a transparent, elastic, avascular, biconvex {{structure composed of}} a capsule, lens epithelium, and lens fiber cells. Many factors contribute to the progression of lens opacity, but aging is most frequently associated with cataract. As aging-related cataract develops, many biochemical and biophysical changes occur, most notably a marked increase in the insolubilization of the crystallin and extensive oxidation damage {{to many of the}} lens constituents. Cataract management should include ophthalmologic history and examination, medical evaluation, optical correction, control of ocular and systemic disease that may contribute to cataract, discontinuation of cataractogenic drugs, and periodic reexamination. Surgery is indicated when cataract is associated with vision decrease interfering with activities important to the patient, intraocular inflammation or glaucoma, or interference with management of posterior segment disease.
