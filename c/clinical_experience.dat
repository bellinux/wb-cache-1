5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is generally}} considered the best method for airway management under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, as it provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.

5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although <b>clinical</b> <b>experience</b> has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods.

5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that <b>clinical</b> <b>experience</b> support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). <b>Clinical</b> <b>experience</b> with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} {{of the degree}} requirements for nurse practitioners from a master’s degree (MS) to a doctor of nursing practice (DNP) degree will deliver a workforce of advanced practice nurses with {{the knowledge and skills}} necessary to meet the complex health care needs of patients and populations. The Institute of Medicine (2010) has forecasted an impending shortage of nurses by 2020, and one of the major challenges facing educational programs is lack of training sites. The shortage of quality <b>clinical</b> sites and <b>experiences</b> for students in primary care is a national challenge as well as a local challenge (AACN, 2014). While creating different clinical opportunities is an important element in the DNP program, another challenge faced by faculty is the ability to assess the students’ <b>clinical</b> learning <b>experiences</b> throughout the program. Historically, programs have maintained manual paper processes for clinical time tracking, logs, preceptor evaluations, and clinical instructor evaluations that limit the ability of the faculty to review individual student experiences. This method of tracking is not easily accessible to faculty or clinical preceptors, making it difficult to review progress and evaluate throughout the <b>clinical</b> <b>experiences.</b> In order for faculty to better assess the quality of the <b>clinical</b> <b>experiences</b> and to improve the process of communication with clinical preceptors, the University of Vermont (UVM) graduate nurse practitioner program implemented a centralized clinical tracking system that students utilize to document their experiences, preceptors utilize to complete evaluations, and faculty use to get a real-time understanding of student’s experiences throughout the semester and the program. The purpose of this project was to improve faculty insight to DNP students’ <b>clinical</b> <b>experiences.</b> Through a pilot implementation with the first cohort of DNP students in their initial clinical course (GRNS 408), the project was developed to provide the graduate program with tools to streamline the student’s tracking of <b>clinical</b> <b>experiences,</b> improve the preceptor evaluation of the student process, create reports to evaluate the students’ <b>clinical</b> <b>experiences,</b> and facilitate communication among the student, faculty, and clinical preceptors. The approach used to identify the impact of the intervention on the insights of the clinical faculty and how it relates to the <b>clinical</b> <b>experiences</b> of the DNP learners was a frequent retrospective data review process. Additionally, to control the rate of change of the intervention and ensure that the outcomes were linked to the intervention, we used a rapid cycle improvement process. The outcomes measured following implementation included review of the reports in the program throughout the semester, and the feedback from the users at the end of semester survey. The pilot phase of the project that changed the logging and evaluation of UVM DNP learners from a manual to an automated process was successful. With limited training for learners, preceptors and faculty, the project was able to provide easy tools for learners to log <b>clinical</b> <b>experiences</b> and for preceptors to evaluate students. With access to the data in real-time, the clinical faculty were able to get a snapshot of the <b>clinical</b> <b>experiences</b> every few weeks, and use that information to create meaningful discussions during clinical seminar time, and objectively evaluate the learner at specific points in time through the semester as well as an objective final faculty evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This Clinical Handbook {{has been}} {{designed}} to assist you as your progress through the clinical part of your counseling program. It will help you plan your coursework and <b>clinical</b> <b>experiences,</b> {{but it is important to}} remember that this part of your development is more than simply completing the coursework. Evaluation of students during this process is based on the development of both your professional and clinical competencies in theory and practice. Therefore, this Handbook is a general reference guide for your clinical training sequence, and the associated paperwork, but does not attempt to cover every situation. Your clinical training actually began with FS 5363 Prepracticum. This course provided the foundation of your basic interpersonal communication skills by providing an opportunity for you to practice the techniques, skills, and decision-making capabilities of counseling in a supervised, experiential setting. The second sequence in your experiential skills training is FS 5532 / 5542 Practicum and FS 5313 Group Counseling Procedures. These courses are required to be taken together and give you the opportunity to develop the necessary skills to actually work with clients for the first time. As part of the Practicum course, you will lead a group. Your <b>clinical</b> training and <b>experience</b> then continues through FS 5894 : Internship for two semesters.
