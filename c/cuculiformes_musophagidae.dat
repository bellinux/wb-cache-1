The head, hackle, back, saddle, sickles and wing bows of the may have a beetle-green to purple sheen that may be particularly rich in male birds but still very evident in females. The green and purple sheens are a structural coloration, not pigment. The feathers of chickens and nearly all birds which appear to have green feathers do not have any green pigment. Green pigment has only been found in turacos (<b>Cuculiformes,</b> <b>Musophagidae),</b> small African birds. Structural coloration is produced by the constructive interference of light reflecting from different layers of the structures in feathers.|$|E
