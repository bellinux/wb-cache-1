We use data breaches and an operational <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> index, created through textual analysis of Form 10 -Ks, as our two primary indicators of operational <b>control</b> <b>risk.</b> We find positive relations between our operational <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> indicators and future financial reporting control weaknesses, restatements, SEC comment letters, and audit fees, even after controlling for contemporaneous financial reporting control weaknesses. These findings suggest that operational <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> is informative of potential financial reporting deficiencies...|$|R

50|$|Sturgeons {{have adopted}} a {{temporal}} strategy to <b>controlling</b> <b>risks.</b> Sturgeons live a long time, delay maturation to large sizes, and spawn multiple times over their lifespan. The sturgeon’s long life span and repeat spawning in multiple years allows them to outlast periodic droughts and environmental catastrophes. The high fecundity that comes with large size allows them to produce large numbers of offspring when suitable spawning conditions occur and {{to make up for}} years of poor conditions. Adult green sturgeon do not spawn every year and {{only a fraction of the}} population enters freshwater where they might be at risk of a catastrophic event in any year. The widespread ocean distribution of green sturgeon ensures that most of the population at any given time is dispersed among areas where they are not vulnerable to catastrophic losses.|$|E

40|$|To give a {{quantitative}} description of well <b>control</b> <b>risk,</b> a multi-layer fuzzy comprehensive evaluation based on AHP (analytic hierarchy process) is used. During the evaluation, {{risk factors and}} weight are given by Delphi method and AHP method. A multi-level and multi-factor evaluation system is built including four level-one factors of geologic uncertainty, well control equipments, techniques and crew quality, and fourteen level-two factors. Then a calculation is given with an oilfield in West China. The result shows geologic uncertainty is the primary factor leading to well <b>control</b> <b>risks</b> and the grade of well <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> is “higher risk”. The application result indicates that well <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> assessment by fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is feasible.

40|$|I {{examine whether}} {{auditors}} effectively {{respond to an}} assessment of high <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> at the account level. The audit risk model assumes that auditors alter their audit procedures to compensate for {{a greater risk of}} material misstatement to maintain a low risk of audit failure (i. e., low audit risk). I use internal control weakness disclosures in interim and annual filings to identify assessments of high <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> within specific accounts, and restatements of these specific accounts to identify account–level audit failures. I find an increased incidence of account–level misstatements when <b>control</b> <b>risk</b> within that particular account is high, suggesting that, on average, auditors do not maintain a consistent level of audit risk at the account level in the presence of high <b>control</b> <b>risk.</b> In further analyses, I examine whether the effectiveness of the auditor’s response varies as auditor effort (measured using excess audit fees) increases. For certain accounts, I find that additional auditor effort mitigates the likelihood of an ineffective response to high <b>control</b> <b>risk,</b> but that this mitigating effect occurs only at high levels of auditor effort. The results of this study provide insight into the effectiveness of auditors’ use of the audit risk model at the account level and suggest areas of the audit where auditors can improve the link between account–level risk assessments and the design, performance, and evaluation of substantive audit tests...|$|R

A cornucopia of information security risk management approaches exist that can assist organisations in determining and <b>controlling</b> <b>risks.</b> However, with these choices organisations are finding it increasingly difficult to communicate the information security risks to the strategic level or for strategic management to communicate information security goals to the organisation. An approach is necessary that will enable organisations to communicate information security risk information to strategic level management quickly and unambiguously. This approach will have to provide information in accordance with corporate governance requirements and be based on best practice.
