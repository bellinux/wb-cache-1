5|$|The {{symptoms}} of narcosis {{may be caused}} by other factors during a dive: ear problems <b>causing</b> disorientation or nausea; early signs of oxygen toxicity <b>causing</b> visual disturbances; or hypothermia <b>causing</b> rapid breathing and shivering. Nevertheless, the presence of any of these symptoms should imply narcosis. Alleviation of the effects upon ascending to a shallower depth will confirm the diagnosis. Given the setting, other likely conditions do not produce reversible effects. In the rare event of misdiagnosis when another condition is <b>causing</b> the symptoms, the initial management– ascending closer to the surface– is still essential.|$|E

5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, <b>causing</b> anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, <b>causing</b> a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E

40|$|As part {{of their}} {{corporate}} social responsibility, many organizations practice cause-related marketing, in which organizations donate to a chosen <b>cause</b> with every consumer purchase. The extant literature has identified {{the importance of the}} fit between the organization {{and the nature of the}} <b>cause</b> in influencing corporate image, as well as the influence of a connection between the <b>cause</b> and consumer preferences on brand attitudes and brand choice. However, prior research has not addressed which <b>cause</b> composition most appeals to consumers or the impact of <b>cause</b> choice on corporate image. A between-subjects field experiment in the Netherlands examines the influence of three core <b>cause</b> attributes—cause type, <b>cause</b> scope, and <b>cause</b> acuteness—on consumers’ perceptions of corporate image. Furthermore, this experiment examines the extent to which consumer identification with the <b>cause</b> mediates the influence of the <b>cause</b> attributes on corporate image. The findings indicate that identification with the <b>cause</b> leads to more positive evaluations of marketing campaigns for <b>cause</b> type and <b>cause</b> scope. Also, however, our results uncover a negative direct relationship between <b>cause</b> scope and corporate image. <b>Cause</b> acuteness is only marginally influential in corporate image perceptions. By proposing and testing a comprehensive model of the influence of <b>cause</b> attributes on corporate image in cause-related marketing, this article provides important implications and suggests avenues for further research...|$|R

5000|$|The Nyayasutras {{dedicate}} many {{sections on}} causality and casual relations (Karana, Sanskrit: कारण), particularly Book 4. <b>Causes,</b> in Nyaya view states Fowler, are [...] "antecedents of their effects invariably and unconditionally".

The sutras assert that there cannot be reciprocity to a <b>cause,</b> either we misunderstand the <b>cause</b> or misapprehend the effect. The text rejects remote or supernatural <b>causes,</b> and rejects that qualities are <b>causes.</b> The text asserts that <b>causes</b> are immediately antecedent, <b>causes</b> exist before an effect in time, and to know something is to understand the effect and the specific <b>cause(s).</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{point of}} the koan {{is that for the}} {{ordinary}} person the two conflicting views of causality are between falling into <b>cause</b> and effect or not falling into <b>cause</b> and effect, because they dream of being free from <b>cause</b> and effect as being separate from <b>cause</b> and effect.

Thus awakened persons neither [...] "fall into" [...] nor do they [...] "not fall into" [...] <b>cause</b> and effect, because they are one with <b>cause</b> and effect.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{propose a}} method of redistributing {{ill-defined}} <b>causes</b> of death (IDCD) based on the investigation of such <b>causes.</b> METHODS In 2010, {{an evaluation of the}} results of investigating the <b>causes</b> of death classified as IDCD in accordance with chapter 18 of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10) by the Mortality Information System was performed. The redistribution coefficients were calculated according to the proportional distribution of ill-defined <b>causes</b> reclassified after investigation in any chapter of the ICD- 10, except for chapter 18, and used to redistribute the ill-defined <b>causes</b> not investigated and remaining by sex and age. The IDCD redistribution coefficient was compared with two usual methods of redistribution: a) Total redistribution coefficient, based on the proportional distribution of all the defined <b>causes</b> originally notified and b) Non-external redistribution coefficient, similar to the previous, but excluding external <b>causes.</b> RESULTS Of the 97, 314 deaths by ill-defined <b>causes</b> reported in 2010, 30. 3 % were investigated, and 65. 5 % of those were reclassified as defined <b>causes</b> after the investigation. Endocrine diseases, mental disorders, and maternal <b>causes</b> had a higher representation among the reclassified ill-defined <b>causes,</b> contrary to infectious diseases, neoplasms, and genitourinary diseases, with higher proportions among the defined <b>causes</b> reported. External <b>causes</b> represented 9. 3 % of the ill-defined <b>causes</b> reclassified. The correction of mortality rates by the total redistribution coefficient and non-external redistribution coefficient increased the magnitude of the rates by a relatively similar factor for most <b>causes,</b> contrary to the IDCD redistribution coefficient that corrected the different <b>causes</b> of death with differentiated weights. CONCLUSIONS The proportional distribution of <b>causes</b> among the ill-defined <b>causes</b> reclassified after investigation was not similar to the original distribution of defined <b>causes.</b> Therefore, the redistribution of the remaining ill-defined <b>causes</b> based on the investigation allows for more appropriate estimates of the mortality risk due to specific <b>causes...</b>|$|R
