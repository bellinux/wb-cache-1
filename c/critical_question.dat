500|$|At {{the end of}} his monologue, Colbert {{introduced}} what he {{characterized as}} an [...] "audition" [...] video to become the new White House Press Secretary—Scott McClellan had recently left the position. The video spliced clips of difficult questions from the White House press corps with responses from Colbert as Press Secretary. Colbert's podium included controls marked [...] "eject", [...] "Gannon" [...] (a reference to erstwhile White House reporter Jeff Gannon, who was suspected of asking planted questions), and [...] "volume", which he used to silence a <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> from journalist David Gregory. The video continued with Colbert fleeing the briefing room and the White House, only to be pursued by White House correspondent Helen Thomas, who had been a vocal critic of the Bush administration. At one point, Colbert picks up an emergency phone and explains that Thomas [...] "won't stop asking why we invaded Iraq". The dispatcher responds with, [...] "Hey, why did we invade Iraq?" [...] The entire second half of the video is a spoof of horror film clichés, particularly the film Westworld, with melodramatic music accompanying Thomas's slow, unwavering pursuit of Colbert, and Colbert loudly screaming [...] "No!" [...] at intervals. Widely available online, a portion of the mock audition tape aired on The Colbert Report on May 2, 2006.|$|E
500|$|An {{article in}} the Maryland Law Review {{authored}} by Christopher Gozdor (a lawyer in the Maryland Attorney General's office) was also critical of the decision, although he was concerned instead with an alleged lack of clarity in the majority opinion. It discussed the case law relating to government speech and examined what it described as the [...] "conditions doctrine", where certain conditions on receiving federal funds were upheld or struck down. The article {{then turned to the}} Rust distinction. Gozdor explained: [...] "The Court distinguished Velazquez from Rust because Rust involved a subsidy to facilitate private expression of the government's message, while Velazquez involved LSC funding that was designed [...] private speech." [...] The <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> for the court was the characterization of the speech that the law promoted. Because advocacy by LSC grantees to change welfare laws was not in advance of the government's own message, the restriction placed on it essentially prohibited a form of private speech. The relationship, Gozdor asserted, that the Court set forth was that the restriction [...] "distorted" [...] private speech. This [...] "distortion principle" [...] was the main criticism of the article (as was Scalia's dissent). Gozdor, agreeing with Scalia's dissent, wrote that the restriction did not create such a distortion of private speech because Congress had still permitted LSC to form affiliate organizations which would be considered [...] "legally separate". Notwithstanding the difficulty of an organization to classify itself as an [...] "affiliate entity" [...] of LSC, Gozdor argued that there was no real prevention of speech when there were ample alternative means of relaying the message.|$|E

Some observers consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki undefended, some say that both cities were legitimate military targets, and others say that Hiroshima {{could be considered a}} legitimate military target while Nagasaki was comparatively undefended. Hiroshima has been argued as not a legitimate target because the major industrial plants were just outside the target area. It has also been argued as a legitimate target because Hiroshima was the headquarters of the regional Second General Army and Fifth Division with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. Both cities were protected by anti-aircraft guns, which is an argument against the definition of [...] "undefended".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> was: whom did the {{football}} touch in the Fuqua/Tatum collision? If it bounced off Fuqua without ever touching Tatum, then Harris's reception was illegal. If the ball bounced off only Tatum, {{or if it}} bounced off both Fuqua and Tatum (in any order), then the reception was legal. The rule stated in the pertinent part that once an offensive player touches a pass, {{he is the only}} offensive player eligible to catch the pass. However, if a defensive player touches the pass [...] "first, or simultaneously with or subsequent to its having been touched by only one offensive player, then all offensive players become and remain eligible" [...] to catch the pass. (This rule was later rescinded in 1978.) If the reception were illegal, the Raiders would have gained possession (by a turnover on downs), clinching a victory.|$|E
2500|$|Behaviorists explain {{personality}} {{in terms of}} the effects external stimuli have on behavior. [...] The approaches used to analyze the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation. [...] This school of thought was developed by B. F. Skinner who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or [...] "the organism" [...] with its environment. [...] Skinner believed children do bad things because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child's crying in the past has led to attention. [...] These are the response, and consequences. [...] The response is the child crying, and the attention that child gets is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people's behavior is formed by processes such as operant conditioning. [...] Skinner put forward a [...] "three term contingency model" [...] which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the [...] "Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model" [...] in which the <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> is: [...] "Under which circumstances or antecedent 'stimuli' does the organism engage in a particular behavior or 'response', which in turn produces a particular 'consequence'?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Thus, Cln3 {{seems to}} be the size sensor in budding yeast, as it {{exhibits}} the necessary properties of a translational sizer and is the most upstream regulator of Start. A <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> remains, however, as to how its activity is rendered size dependent. As noted above, any translational size sensor should be at constant concentration, and thus constant activity, in the cytoplasm as cells grow. In order to detect its size, the cell must compare the absolute number of sizer molecules to some non-growing standard, with the genome the obvious choice for such a standard. It was originally thought that yeast accomplished this with Cln3 by localizing it (and its target, Whi5) to the nucleus: nuclear volume was assumed to scale with genome content, so that an increasing concentration of Cln3 in the nucleus could indicate increasing Cln3 molecules relative to the genome. However, the nucleus has recently been shown to grow during G1, irrespective of genome content, undermining this model. Recent experiments have suggested that Cln3 activity could be titrated directly against genomic DNA, through its DNA-bound interaction with SBF-Whi5 complexes. Finally, other models exist that do not rely on comparison of Cln3 levels to DNA. One posits a non-linear relationship between total translation rate and Cln3 translation rate caused by an Upstream open reading frame; [...] another suggests that the increase in Cln3 activity at the end of G1 relies on competition for the chaperone protein Ydj1, which otherwise holds Cln3 molecules in the Endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E

60|$|I {{have told}} how Cervantes made his race {{precious}} to me, and I {{am sure that}} it must have been he who fitted me to understand and enjoy the American author who now stayed me on Spanish ground and kept me happy in Spanish air, though I cannot trace the tie in time and circumstance between Irving and Cervantes. The most I can make sure of is that I read the 'Conquest of Granada' after I read Don Quixote, and that I loved the historian so much because I had loved the novelist much more. Of course I did not perceive then that Irving's charm came largely from Cervantes and the other Spanish humorists yet unknown to me, and that he had formed himself upon them almost as much as upon Goldsmith, but I dare say that this fact had insensibly {{a great deal to do}} with my liking. Afterwards I came to see it, and at the same time to see what was Irving's own in Irving; to feel his native, if somewhat attenuated humor, and his original, if somewhat too studied grace. But as yet there was no <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> with me. I gave my heart simply and passionately to the author who made the scenes of that most pathetic history live in my sympathy, and companioned me with the stately and gracious actors in them.|$|E
60|$|When all {{has been}} said of a man's gifts, the <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> still stands over, how he regards his {{responsibility}} for using them. Once {{in a conversation with}} Mr. Gladstone, some fifty years from the epoch of this present chapter, we fell upon the topic of ambition. 'Well,' he said, 'I do not think that I can tax myself in my own life with ever having been much moved by ambition.' The remark so astonished me that, as he afterwards playfully reported to a friend, I almost jumped up from my chair. We soon shall reach a stage in his career when both remark and surprise may explain themselves. We shall see that if ambition means love of power or fame for the sake of glitter, decoration, external renown, or even dominion and authority on their own account--and all these are common passions enough in strong natures as well as weak--then his view of himself was just. I think he had none of it. Ambition in a better sense, the motion of a resolute and potent genius to use strength for the purposes of strength, to clear the path, dash obstacles aside, force good causes forward--such a quality as that is the very law of the being of a personality so vigorous, intrepid, confident, and capable as his.|$|E

But now, {{on the surface}} of our piece of pottery, here are various bands and spots of colour which are presumably set there to make it pleasanter to the eye. Six of the spots, seen closely, you discover are intended to represent flowers. These then have as distinctly a graphic purpose as the other properties of the plate have an architectural one, and the first <b>critical</b> <b>question</b> we have to ask about them is, whether they are like roses or not. I will anticipate what I have to say in subsequent lectures so far as to assure you that, {{if they are to be}} like roses at all, the liker they can be, the better. Do not suppose, as many people will tell you, that because this is a common manufactured article, your roses on it are the better for being ill-painted, or half-painted. If they had been painted by the same hand that did this peach, the plate would have been all the better for it; but, as it chanced, there was no hand such as William Hunt's to paint them, and their graphic power is not distinguished. In any case, however, that graphic power must have been subordinate to their effect as pink spots, while the band of green-blue round the plate's edge, and the spots of gold, pretend to no graphic power at all, but are meaningless spaces of colour or metal. Still less have they any mechanical office: they add nowise to the serviceableness of the plate; and their agreeableness, if they possess any, depends, therefore, neither on any imitative, nor any structural, character; but on some inherent pleasantness in themselves, either of mere colours to the eye (as of taste to the tongue), or in the placing of those colours in relations which obey some mental principle of order, or physical principle of harmony.|$|E
