40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether intravenous infusion of 1000 ml 40 % <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> combined with the oral adminstration of 500 g sodium phosphate leads to a better cure rate and longer-lasting normocalcaemia and normophosphataemia than standard intravenous treatment with 500 ml <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> in cows with parturient paresis. Forty recumbent cows with hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia were alternately allocated to group A or B. Cows of both groups were treated intravenously with 500 ml 40 % <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate,</b> and cows of group B additionally received another 500 ml <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> via slow intravenous infusion and 500 g sodium phosphate administered via an orogastric tube. Thirty-two cows stood within 8 hours after the start of treatment and 8 did not; of the 32 cows that stood, 18 belonged to group A and 14 to group B (90 % of group A vs. 70 % of group B; P = 0. 23). Seven cows relapsed; of these and the 8 that did not respond to initial treatment, 10 stood after two standard intravenous treatments. Downer cow syndrome occurred in 5 cows, 3 of which recovered after aggressive therapy. The overall cure rate did not differ significantly between groups A and B. Twelve (60 %) cows of group A and 14 (70 %) cows of group B were cured after a single treatment and of the remaining 14, 11 were cured after two or more treatments. Two downer cows were euthanized and one other died of heart failure during treatment. Serum calcium concentrations during the first eight hours after the start of treatment were significantly higher in group B than in group A, and oral sodium phosphate caused a significant and lasting increase in inorganic phosphate. More cows of group B than group A were cured after a single treatment (P > 0. 05). These findings, although not statistically significant, are promising and should be verified using a larger number of cows...|$|R
40|$|Radiological {{examination}} and surgical biopsy were required of a swelling in the cervical region {{in a healthy}} 200 kg, six-month-old hand-reared female giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis). Induction was with intramuscular administration of medetomidine, butorphanol and ketamine and maintained with 1. 5 per cent isoflurane-in-oxygen on a circle anaesthetic machine. Induction and maintenance were uneventful but recovery delayed and characterised by hindlimb weakness, opistotonus and torticollis {{of the head and}} neck. Atipamezole and naltrexone were administered to facilitate recovery but with minimal clinical improvement. Venous blood gas analysis indicated moderate metabolic acidosis, hypochloraemia, increased anion gap and marked hypocalcaemia (0. 64 mmol/l).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> injection 48 and 24 hours prepartum and immediately after parturition on dry matter intake at day of calving, milk yield, incidence of metabolic disorders and uterine conditions during the first 21 days postpartum in cows fed anionic diets. Thirty six lactating dairy cows were balanced by parity (1, 2, 3 +) and allocated to 4 subcutaneous injection treatments of 15. 2 gr <b>calcium</b> as <b>borogluconate</b> at different times pre and postpartum than expected calving date. Group 1 consisted of 9 cows receiving no treatment before or after parturition. Group 2 consisted of 9 cows receiving <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> 48 h prepartum. Group 3 consisted of 9 cows receiving <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> 24 h prepartum. Group 4 consisted of 9 cows receiving 15. 2 gr of ca as borogluconate immediately postpartum. Dry matter intake was in treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4 was 10. 87, 12. 32, 12. 63 and 15. 03 kg in the first 24 h after calving, respectively And indicated significantly difference among treatments. milk yield in 2, 3 and 4 treatments was significantly greater than group 1 in the first 21 days of lactation (38. 7, 38. 9, 40. 3 vs 36. 07 kg/d). Treatment had a significant effect on the subclinical hypocalcemia incidence so incidence risk of subclinical hypocalcemia in 1 treatment was 10 times more likely than 4 treatment. Data regression analysis indicated that 4 treatment had a significant effect on the ketosis incidence. So that the cows no calcium injection 2. 43 times more likely to experience ketosis than 4 treatment. But experimental treatments were not significantly effect on the incidence of milk fever, displacement abomasum, retained placenta, metritis and endometritis.

50|$|Rest, {{and lack}} of stress, are {{important}} to aid recovery. Animals lying flat out on their side, unable to get up, should be rolled over several times each day to prevent loss of circulation and muscle damage. If the animal has signs of hypocalcemia, such as rumen stasis, then <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> may be administered. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can improve recovery.

40|$|Thirty cows with {{parturient}} paresis {{were divided}} into three groups of 10. All the cows were given 500 ml of a 40 per cent <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> solution intravenously {{over a period of}} 10 minutes, and 20 were also given 500 ml of a 10 per cent solution of sodium phosphate intravenously; in 10 of the cows this solution was administered over a period of 10 minutes immediately after the <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> solution, and in the other 10 cows 200 ml of the solution was administered rapidly and the remaining 300 ml was added to 10 litres of sodium chloride and glucose solution and infused slowly over six hours.

40|$|Relationships between calcium {{of blood}} plasma and {{measurements}} of the electrocardiogram QT interval corrected for heart rate and interval from Q to the apex of T corrected for heart rate were investigated in six dairy cows. Calcium was varied by infusing 4. 7 % solution of ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid disodium salt to induce hypocalcemia, followed by treatment with <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate.</b> The within-cow regressions of the intervals on calcium in plasma were significant in all four electrocardiogram leads (leads I, aVF, SIII, and SaVF). These regressions differed between cows in these same leads. Correlation coefficients between calcium and the intervals were consistently larger than âˆ’. 94 in lead SIII in all cows. When the results from four of the cows similar in age and breed were analyzed separately, regression coefficients between individual cows were not significantly different.

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the role of opioidergic processes in the effects of nutrition on the secretion of LH pulses in the mature male sheep. In the first of three experiments, adult Merino rams were acclimatised to a maintenance diet and then allocated to one of three dietary groups (n = 5) : continuation of the maintenance diet (Group M); reduction to half of the maintenance allocation (Group HM); or supplementation of the maintenance diet with lupin grain (Group HD). An initial administration of naloxone (2 mg/kg body weight, i. v.) was followed at 40 -min intervals by three further administrations (1 mg/kg). Blood was sampled every 20 min for 12 h before the initial naloxone administration and then for a further 6 h. LH pulse frequency after naloxone treatment was significantly higher in Group HD than in Group HM (P < 0. 05). The second study tested whether the response to naloxone depended on calcium status. We used 22 adult Merino rams in two consecutive experiments, one in which the rams were fed a maintenance diet, and one in which the rams were fed with the maintenance diet plus 1 kg lupin grain for 5 weeks. In both experiments, rams were allocated to groups that received one of the following treatments: (a) 0. 02 g/kg <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> + 0. 2 mg/kg naloxone hydrochloride (Nal + Ca 2 +; n = 6); (b) 0. 2 mg/kg naloxone hydrochloride (Nal; n = 6); (c) 0. 02 g/kg <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate</b> (Ca 2 +; n = 5); (d) 0. 1 ml/kg NaCl 0. 9 % (Saline; n = 5). All treatments were given as a single i. v. administration daily for 5 days. Blood was sampled every 20 min for 24 h during the acclimatization period (Day 0) and on the last day (Day 5) of treatment. In the first study (under maintenance), none of the treatments affected LH pulse frequency. In the second study (the lupin-supplemented rams), LH pulse frequency was significantly increased (P < 0. 05) by the administration of naloxone + Ca 2 +, naloxone alone and Ca 2 + alone. Overall, rams on a low plane of nutrition showed the smallest response to naloxone, suggesting that an opioidergic mechanism is not involved in the suppressive effect of restricted nutrition on the gonadotrophic axis. Rather, because testosterone secretion was increased on the high plane of nutrition, the LH responses to naloxone are better explained by the effects of testosterone on opioidergic mechanisms. Finally, we failed to observe any interaction between opioids and calcium in the control of LH secretion...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{report the}} {{successful}} recovery of few dairy cattle from botulism {{in response to}} a modified therapeutic strategy. Materials and Methods: Seventy four naturally-occurring clinical cases of bovine botulism encountered during the period of 2012 - 2014 which were confirmed by mouse lethality test became material for this study. Affected animals were made into three groups based on the treatment modifications made during the course of study. Results and Discussion: With the modified therapeutic regimen, 17 animals recovered after 7 - 10 days of treatment. Clinical recovery took 2 - 30 days. Animals which were not given intravenous fluid and calcium recovered uneventfully. Cattle which were already treated with intravenous fluids, <b>calcium</b> <b>borogluconate,</b> and antibiotics did not recover. They were either died or slaughtered for salvage. Conclusion: In cattle with botulism, administration of Vitamin AD 3 E and activated charcoal aid the clinical recovery. Besides, strictly avoiding anti-clostridial antibiotics, fluid therapy, and calcium therapy may facilitate the clinical recovery. Upon fluid administration, the pulmonary congestion existed in the ailing cattle might have worsened the anoxia. Administration of antibiotics like penicillin, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines further worsen the neuronal paralysis by increasing the availability of botulinum neurotoxin. Cattle in early botulism have fair chances of recovery with the modified therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on 384 dairy cows in Gondar town during October, 2009 to January, 2010 to determine the prevalence of milk fever and risk factors associated with the disease. Data was collected using regular farm visits, clinical examination of periparturient cows and response to treatment. The overall prevalence of milk fever was 30. 2 %. Milk fever {{was significantly associated with}} milk yield (p 30 liters of milk per day per cow had 21. 83 %, 22. 4 %and 50. 92 % milk fever respectively. The occurrence of milk fever was 17 %, 17 % and 73. 3 % in cows with 50 % Friesian blood and 50 %Friesian blood cows.
