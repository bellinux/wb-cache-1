The club announced its search for a star player under the league's allowance for one star player outside of the $1.5million salary cap, insisting that the player should not look at the position as a retirement fund. Coach Lawrie McKinna sought interest from Australia national football team players Ante Milicic and Simon Colosimo, and announced that he may sign more than the three under-20 players required by league rules. Early concerns for the club focussed on concerns over financial stability, but after forming a partnership with technology company Toshiba and a <b>cash</b> <b>injection</b> from local businessman John Singleton, the club's financial worries were eased. McKinna was keen to sign local player Damien Brown of Bateau Bay, formerly of the Newcastle Jets. In a decision which prompted the player to declare that he was [...] "over the moon", Brown became the first player to sign with the club. Club chairman Lyall Gorman was pleased that a local had become a [...] "foundation player" [...] and part of Brown's role would be to assist with selection of younger players from the local area.

40|$|In {{this section}} we {{describe}} the financial effect of rail on its government and private owners. 7. 1 Government The government as owner could put cash into rail in ways that include direct cash subsidies for market services, equity inputs of various sorts, <b>cash</b> <b>injections</b> for special purposes (say a restructuring or to meet general losses). Equally it could remove cash from rail by way of company taxation, regular or special dividends, share repurchases or other one-off transactions (such as a sale). The government had traditionally subsidised passenger services and this continued through to 1988. From this date passenger-service subsidies have been provided by local government. The position is described in Figure 15. For {{the purpose of the}} welfare analysis we will treat these subsidies as the purchase of passenger services by central government and then local government. This treatment does not differ between pre and post privatisation. To the extent that the subsidy is an efficient response to an externality problem it would not enter the welfare calculation of privatisation. It would, however, be an important component of any analysis of the public interest in closing down rail commuter passenger services. Figure 15 provides a break down of the <b>cash</b> <b>injections</b> by government in rail. Direct cash inputs to rail were by way of passenger subsidies for both long distance and suburban rail services, take over of the 1990 debt plus injection of new equity and the ongoing subsidies from (local) government of suburban passenger services 33.
