5|$|In the meantime, Romeo and Juliet {{was finally}} staged by the Kirov Ballet, choreographed by Leonid Lavrovsky, on 11 January 1940.

5|$|In August 1968, the Polish People's Army {{took part}} in the Warsaw Pact {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia. Some Polish intellectuals protested, and Ryszard Siwiec burned himself alive during the official national holiday celebrations. The Polish participation in the crushing of the Czech liberal communism (called socialism with a human face, and, according to David Ost, constituting the <b>crowning</b> <b>achievement</b> of Marxist revisionism) further alienated Gomułka from his former liberal supporters. But within the party, the opposition to Gomułka faded and the 5th Congress of the PZPR in November reconfirmed his rule. Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his Brezhnev Doctrine, a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the fraternal course.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} Flavian {{construction}} projects was carried out {{during the reign of}} Domitian, who spent lavishly to restore and embellish the city of Rome.

Among the most important new structures were an Odeum, a Stadium, and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill, known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect Rabirius. The most important building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, which was said to have been covered with a gilded roof.
