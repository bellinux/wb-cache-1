5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E

The goal of the petition was compliance with the commitment made by President Bill Clinton in previous years to follow the Kyoto Protocol. However, she {{was not able to}} present the petition because the president was rushed away after the concert, due to security concerns.|$|E

5|$|One {{result of}} the {{economic}} and political tensions was the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, in which widespread rural discontent was followed by an invasion of London involving thousands of rebels. The rebels had many demands, including the effective end of the feudal institution of serfdom and a <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> levels of rural rents. The ensuing violence took the political classes by surprise and the revolt was not fully put down until the autumn; up to 7,000 rebels were executed in the aftermath. As a {{result of the}} revolt, parliament retreated from the poll tax and instead focused on a system of indirect taxes centring on foreign trade, drawing 80% of tax revenues from the exports of wool. Parliament continued to collect direct tax levies at historically high levels up until 1422, although they reduced them in later years. As a result, successive monarchs found that their tax revenues were uncertain, and HenryVI enjoyed less than half the annual tax revenue of the late 14th century. England's monarchs became increasingly dependent on borrowing and forced loans to meet the gap between taxes and expenditure and even then faced later rebellions over levels of taxation, including the Yorkshire rebellion of 1489 and the Cornish rebellion of 1497 during the reign of HenryVII.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian <b>cap,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E
5|$|When he played, Bates {{stood at}} , {{something}} that teammates taunted him about: in Milwaukee spring training camp, players threw a <b>cap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and addressed {{it as if}} it were Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a 100-yard race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but about halfway through the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it went after the hat; Bates won the race. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lives in Houston and works for an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry. He also coaches his daughter's softball team outside of work.|$|E

5000|$|Conducting wire: A {{relatively}} wide pipe completely {{filled with}} water is equivalent {{to a piece of}} wire. When comparing to a piece of wire, the pipe should be thought of as having semi-permanent <b>caps</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ends. Connecting one end of a wire to a circuit is equivalent to un-capping one end of the pipe and attaching it to another pipe. With few exceptions (such as a high-voltage power source), a wire with only one end attached to a circuit will do nothing; <b>the</b> pipe remains <b>capped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> free end, and thus adds nothing to the circuit.|$|R
