40|$|The {{conceptual}} design and preliminary engineering calculations {{have been completed}} for a two cassette cryostat. This report summarizes the design. A cryocooler is permanently mounted {{in the center of}} a stainless steel, 0. 75 inch thick top lid. The cryocooler sits upon a spacer which raises the cooling stage elevations to favorably match the cassette heat intercept elevations. The top lid (32. 0 -inch outside diameter) mates to a 24 -inch pipe size flange with o-ring. The 24 -inch pipe size vacuum vessel with end plate has a minimum internal depth of 16 -inch to give adequate clearance for the depth of the cryocooler and multilayer insulation blankets. Support stand legs elevate the container to a convenient height and allow for placement of the AFE power supply underneath. Two cassette slots are located on either side of the cryocooler. The slots are positioned parallel to each other, 10. 5 -inch center to center (6 standard cassette slot widths) so that the standard 8 slot AFE backplane can be used. The slot opening through the lid is approximately 1. 422 -inch x 16. 782 -inch. A 0. 016 -inch thick titanium (Ti- 6 AI- 4 V) envelope with sealing lip is inserted through lid and defines the gas helium boundary that the VLPC cassette resides. The internal dimensions of the titanium envelope are 1. 390 -inch x 16. 75 -inch x 10. 531 -inch deep. When the cassette is inserted the clearances will be 0. 015 -inch on the long side, 0. 063 -inch on the short side, and 0. 032 -inch at the bottom. The cassette gasket seals against the top lip of the titanium envelope. A soft gasket or thin vacuum sealant tape seals the underside of the titanium envelope to the top surface of the lid. A clamping hold down bar may be necessary to make this vacuum seal. Gas helium for the cassette space is supplied through a fitting and port that is added to the cassette bulkhead assembly. This is the only modification necessary the standard D-Zero cassette. Evacuation and backfilling and then stagnant positive pressure are achieved through this one port. After the titanium envelope/pocket and cassette are mounted to the top lid, the lid is raised so that assembly work can be accomplished below. Three pneumatic cylinders mounted to the lid are pressurized (with air or the gas helium source) to raise the lid. Safety linkages are installed to prevent accidental lowering of the lid while work is being performed. Honeycomb sandwich panels are attached to the titanium envelope to support the thin envelope against the pressure differential. A thin thermoplastic mesh placed between the honeycomb panel and titanium envelope helps to insulate the panel so it is not a significant parallel heat path down the wall. There are two panel sets for each cassette. One for the area above the upper intercept and one set for the area below. It is reasonable that a 0. 40 -inch thick panel will suffice. A high conductance thermal link is made between the first stage of the cryocooler and the uppermost intercept location. This is solid OFHC copper part with a short section of flexible copper braid that connects to bars that clamp solidly to the long sides of the cassette envelope. Apiezon 'N' grease is used at assembly to enhance heat transfer at the <b>clamp</b> <b>bar</b> to titanium envelope interface. A second high conductance thermal connection is made between the second stage of the cryocooler and the bottom of the cassette envelope. The link is mostly solid OFHC copper along with a short flexible braid section in between. The two piece clamping bar encases the bottom 1. 75 -inch of the cassette. Thermal grease is used at the interface...|$|E

40|$|Vibration in {{internal}} turning {{is a problem}} in the manufacturing industry. Vibrations appear under the excitation applied by the material deformation process during the machining of a workpiece. In order for a lathe to perform an internal turning or boring operation, for example, in a pre-drilled hole in a workpiece, it is generally required that the boring bar should be long and slender; therefore extra sensitive to vibrations. These vibrations will affect the result of machining, in particular the surface finish, also the tool life may be reduced. As a result of tool vibration, severe acoustic noise frequently occurs in the working environment. This thesis comprises three parts and the first part presents a method for active control of boring bar vibration. This method consists of an active boring bar controlled by, for example, an analog controller. The focus lies on the analog controller and the advantages that may be obtained from working in the analog domain. The controller is a lead-lag compensator with digitally controlled parameters, such as gain and phase. However, signals remain in the analog domain. In addition, the analog controller is compared with a digital adaptive controller and it is found that both controllers yield an attenuation of the vibration by up to 50 dB. The second part of this thesis concerns the dynamic properties of a <b>clamped</b> boring <b>bar</b> used by the industry. In order to design a robust controller for a certain system, knowledge about the system's dynamic properties is required. On the workshop floor, a boring bar is dismounted and remounted, and reconfiguration of boring bars will alter the dynamic properties of the <b>clamped</b> boring <b>bar.</b> The dynamic properties of a standard boring bar and an active boring bar for a number of possible clamping conditions, as well as for a linearized clamping have been investigated based on an experimental approach. Also simple Euler-Bernoulli modeling of <b>clamped</b> boring <b>bars</b> incorporating simple non-rigid models of the boring <b>bar</b> <b>clamping</b> are investigated. Initial simulations of nonlinear SDOF systems have been carried out: one with a signed squared stiffness and one with a cubic stiffness. The purpose of these simulations was to identify a nonlinearity that introduces a similar behavior in the SDOF system dynamics as the nonlinear behavior observed in the dynamic properties of a <b>clamped</b> boring <b>bar.</b> The third and final part of this thesis focuses on vibration analysis methods in engineering education. A signal analyzer (which is a commonly used instrument in signal processing and vibration analysis) was made accessible via the Internet. Assignments were developed for students to learn and practice vibration analysis on real signals from a real setup of a relevant structure; a <b>clamped</b> boring <b>bar.</b> Whilst the experimental setup was fixed, the instrument and sensor configuration nonetheless enable a variety of experiment, for example: excitation signal analysis, spectrum analysis and experimental modal analysis...|$|R

The vibrator is made of aluminum in different sizes and is excited using a constant air jet to obtain its fundamental resonance frequency. The fundamental frequency obtained from the experimental measure-ment is compared with the theoretical values calculated based on the equivalent SDOF and exact analysis theories. It is found that the exact analysis gives a closer value to the experimental results as compared to the SDOF system. Although both the experimental and theoretical results exhibit the same trend, they are different in magnitude. To overcome the differences in both theories, a correction factor is added to account for the production errors...|$|R

40|$|Impact {{sounds were}} {{synthesized}} according to standard textbook equations {{given for the}} motion of simply supported, metal plates. In a two-interval, forced-choice procedure, highly practiced listeners identified from these sounds a predefined class of target plates based on their particular material and geometric properties. The effects of two factors on identification were examined: the relative level of partials comprising the sounds and the relative amount of information (given as the difference in d′) each partial provided for identification. In different conditions one factor was fixed while the other either increased or decreased with frequency. The effect on listener identification in each case was determined from a logistic discriminant analysis of trial-by-trial responses, yielding a vector of listener decision weights on the frequency and decay of individual partials. The weights increased proportionally with relative level, but were largely uninfluenced by relative information content—a result exactly opposite to that expected from a maximum-likelihood observer. The dominant effect of relative level was replicated for other sound sources (<b>clamped</b> <b>bars</b> and stretched membranes) and was not diminished by randomizing the relative level of partials across trials. The results are taken to underscore the importance of relative level {{in the identification of}} rudimentary sound sources...|$|R

40|$|Contact sounds {{can provide}} {{important}} perceptual cues in virtual environments. We investigated {{the relation between}} material perception and variables that govern synthesis of contact sounds. A shape-invariant auditory-decay parameter was a powerful determinant of the perceived material of an object. Subjects judged the similarity of synthesized sounds with respect to material (Experiment 1 and 2) or length (Experiment 3). The sounds corresponded to modal frequencies of <b>clamped</b> <b>bars</b> struck at an intermediate point. They varied in fundamental frequency and frequency-dependent rate of decay. The latter parameter has been proposed as reflecting a shape-invariant material property: damping. Differences between sounds in both decay and frequency affected similarity judgments (magnitude of similarity and judgment duration), with decay playing a substantially larger role. Experiment 2, which varied the initial sound amplitude, showed that decay rate, rather than total energy or sound duration, was the critical factor in determining similarity. Experiment 3 demonstrated that similarity judgments {{in the first two}} studies were specific to instructions to judge material. Experiment 4, in which subjects assigned the sounds to one of four material categories, showed an influence of frequency and decay but confirmed the greater importance of decay. Decay parameters associated with each category were estimated and found to correlate with physical measures of damping.

40|$|Vibration {{in metal}} cutting {{is a common}} problem in the {{manufacturing}} industry, especially when long and slender tool holders or boring bars {{are involved in the}} manufacturing process. Vibration has a detrimental effect on machining. In particular the surface finish is likely to suffer, but tool life is also most likely to be reduced. Tool vibration also results in loud noise that may disturb the working environment. The first part of this thesis describes the development of a robust and manually adjustable analog controller capable of actively controlling boring bar vibrations related to internal turning. This controller is compared with an adaptive digital feedback filtered-x LMS controller and it displays similar performance with a vibration attenuation of up to 50 dB. A thorough experimental investigation of the influence of the clamping properties on the dynamic properties of <b>clamped</b> boring <b>bars</b> is also carried out in second part of the thesis. In relation to this, it is demonstrated that the number of clamping screws, the clamping screw diameter size, the screw tightening torque and the order the screws are tightened, have a significant influence on a <b>clamped</b> boring <b>bar’s</b> eigenfrequencies as well as on its mode shape orientation in the cutting speed - cutting depth plane. Also, an initial investigation of nonlinear dynamic properties of <b>clamped</b> boring <b>bars</b> was carried out. Furthermore, vibration in milling has also been studied in relation to millingtool holders with a long overhang. A basic investigation concerning the spatial dynamic properties of the tool holders of milling machines, both when not cutting and during cutting, has been carried out. Also, active control of milling tool holder vibration has been investigated and a first prototype of an active milling tool holder was implemented and tested. The challenge of transferring electrical power while maintaining good signal quality to and from a rotating object is addressed and a solution to this is proposed. Finally, vibration is also a problem for the hydroelectric power industry. In Sweden, hydroelectric power plants stand for approximately half of Sweden’s electrical power production and are also considered to be a so-called green source of energy. When renovating water turbines in small-scale hydroelectric power plants and modifying them to optimize efficiency, it is not uncommon that disturbing vibrations occur in the power plant. These vibrations have a negative influence on the production capacity and will wear various components quickly. Occasionally, these vibrations may cause severe damage to the power plant. To identify this vibration problem, experimental modal analysis and operating deflection shape analysis were utilized. To reduce the vibration problem, active control using inertial mass actuators was investigated. Preliminary results indicate a significant attenuation of the vibrations...|$|R
