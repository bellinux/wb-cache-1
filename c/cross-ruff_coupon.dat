We develop the profit maximization models for two kinds of coupons: in-pack <b>cross-ruff</b> <b>coupon</b> and on-pack <b>cross-ruff</b> <b>coupon</b> under substitute (complement) demand, and conclude that 1) the coupon values, prices and profit under substitute demand are higher than under complement demand or independent demand; 2) the profit under on-pack coupon mode are higher than in-pack coupon mode. According to the results, we provide the managerial insights for choosing the linked brands. Through numerical example, we observe that the coupon values, target brand prices and carrier brand prices for on-pack <b>cross-ruff</b> <b>coupon</b> are more sensitive than in-pack <b>cross-ruff</b> <b>coupon</b> to reference price...|$|E
40|$|Cross-ruff coupons are {{obtained}} {{at the time}} of purchase of a carrier brand and may be redeemed at a later date on a target brand. These coupons therefore have the ability to link consumer purchases across different brands as well as shopping trips. We model the effects of cross-ruff coupons on consumer choice behavior and derive the conditions under which cross-ruff coupons can lead to higher sales and profits than other types of package coupons. The model also provides insights into the selection of appropriate carrier and target brands, and on how the choice of an appropriate carrier or a target brand is affected when the categories that these brands belong to are demand complements or substitutes. We conduct an empirical analysis using data from 195 different <b>cross-ruff</b> <b>coupon</b> campaigns observed in grocery stores in a major U. S. city over a three-month period. The data are consistent with the key insights provided by the model. Coupons, Sales Promotions, Stochastic Choice Models, Markov Chains, Marketing Mix Response...|$|E
