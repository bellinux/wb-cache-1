5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E
5|$|This small martin's {{flight is}} {{typically}} slow and leisurely, {{but it is}} capable of considerable speed when required. The <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> {{similar to those of the}} Eurasian crag martin and include a soft chi, chi contact call and a twittering song.|$|E
5|$|Vocal {{differences}} reinforce species {{separation between}} closely related birds {{such as the}} least and little terns, and can help humans distinguish similar species, such as common and Arctic terns, since flight <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> unique to each species.|$|E
50|$|The Interconnection Exchange (ICX) {{will receive}} all {{calls from the}} mobile and fixed {{operators}} whenever the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> made to other network and will pass it to the destination network if the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> local, and will pass to the IGWs if the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> international.

5|$|Since the 2001 {{discovery}} of a single individual in Myanmar, at least nine separate sites {{have been identified in}} the limestone outcrops of the Dawna and Karen Hills outside the Thanlwin, Ataran, and Gyaing Rivers of Kayin and Mon States. The Thai and Myanmar populations are morphologically identical, but their echolocation <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> distinct. It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated.|$|E
5|$|System <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> being {{split into}} userland and kernel {{versions}} and being encapsulated into messages. This will {{help reduce the}} size {{and complexity of the}} kernel by moving variants of standard system calls into a userland compatibility layer, and help maintain forwards and backwards compatibility between DragonFly versions.

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} <b>calls</b> have <b>been</b> recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> made when a bird was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration 'chatter' <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> given when a bird sighted a human near the enclosure.|$|R
50|$|The <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a harsh chirrup or a repeated, rising, buzz-like zweeed. The alarm <b>call</b> <b>is</b> {{short and}} harsh.|$|R
50|$|The Himalayan flameback’s <b>call</b> <b>is</b> {{a series}} of rapidly {{repeated}} klak-klak-klak-klak-klak. The <b>call</b> <b>is</b> slower and softer than the Greater Goldenback.|$|R
5|$|The Cape sparrow's <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> chirps {{similar to}} those of the house sparrow, but much more musical and mellow. The basic call is used in flight and while {{perching}} socially and transcribed as chissip, chirrup, chreep, or chirrichup. A loud, distinctive call used by the male to advertise nest ownership can be written as tweeng or twileeng; this call can be extended into a jerky and repetitive song, chip cheerup, chip cheerup.|$|E
5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of the}} mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E
5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} (Uratelornis chimaera) is {{a species of}} bird in the ground roller family Brachypteraciidae, placed in the {{monotypic}} genus Uratelornis. Endemic to arid spiny forests near the coast in southwestern Madagascar, this ground roller occurs at extremely low population densities throughout its habitat. This species requires shade and a deep layer of leaves on the ground, and it is absent from parts of the spiny forest lacking these features. It has no recognized subspecies, and its closest relative is the scaly ground roller. The long-tailed ground roller is the only ground roller to definitively display sexual dimorphism (differences in plumage or size between sexes). It is a medium-sized bird with a plump silhouette and a long tail. The upperparts are dark brown with black streaks while the underparts are light gray. The white throat is framed by black malar stripes and a black breastband, and a white stripe is present {{at the base of}} the bill. Sky-blue feathers are visible at the edge of the wings and the tail. <b>Calls</b> <b>are</b> rarely made outside the breeding season, though multiple courtship <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> made.|$|E
5000|$|Its <b>call</b> <b>is</b> unique, {{loud and}} {{sounds like a}} [...] "whooping kuk-kuk-cow-cow-cow-cowp-cowp." [...] Its <b>call</b> <b>is</b> similar to the yellow-billed cuckoo.|$|R
50|$|The male's {{territorial}} <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a {{very loud}} kay-oh. The alarm is a harsh keeab, and another <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a repetitive piou-piou-piou-piou.|$|R
30|$|If {{the number}} of {{available}} channels in the target cell is zero, then neither an arriving new call nor a handoff <b>call</b> may <b>be</b> served. The new <b>call</b> <b>is</b> blocked, and the handoff <b>call</b> <b>is</b> dropped immediately.|$|R
5|$|Throughout Great Britain and Ireland, {{ships in}} distress, {{or the public}} {{reporting}} an accident, contact the emergency services by telephone or radio. <b>Calls</b> <b>are</b> redirected to HM Coastguard or the Irish Coast Guard as appropriate, who will coordinate air-sea rescue operations and may call on the RNLI (or independent lifeboats), their own land-based rescue personnel and rescue helicopters to help.|$|E
5|$|WWV's {{time signal}} {{can also be}} {{accessed}} by telephone by calling +1-303-499-7111 (Boulder, Colorado). An equivalent time service operated by the U.S. Naval Observatory can be accessed by calling +1-202-762-1401 (Washington, D.C.). Telephone <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> limited to two minutes in length, and the signal is delayed {{by an average of}} 30 milliseconds.|$|E
5|$|Bat {{echolocation}} is a perceptual {{system where}} ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, {{the brain and}} auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localize, and even classify their prey in complete darkness. Bat <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> {{some of the most}} intense, airborne animal sounds, and can range in intensity from between 60 and 140 decibels. Microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit the sound through their mouth and sometimes their nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Microbat calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000Hz, extending beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000Hz).|$|E
50|$|In the US, {{under the}} purview of the Bell System, local {{telephone}} <b>calls</b> <b>were</b> typically unmetered and included in flat rate billing. The term toll <b>calling</b> <b>was</b> adopted for long distance <b>calls</b> which <b>were</b> subject to toll charges.|$|R

50|$|ANI is {{generally}} not transmitted when a <b>call</b> <b>is</b> operator assisted; only the area code of the last switch to route the <b>call</b> <b>is</b> sent.|$|R
5|$|<b>Calls</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} a variety of purposes, {{including}} mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information {{about the nature of the}} threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and palm cockatoos use tools to drum.|$|E
5|$|Like New World monkeys, strepsirrhines rely on scent marking {{for much}} of their communication. This {{involves}} smearing secretions from epidermal scent glands on tree branches, along with urine and feces. In some cases, strepsirrhines may anoint themselves with urine (urine washing). Body postures and gestures may be used, although the long snout, non-mobile lips, and reduced facial enervation restrict the use of facial expressions in strepsirrhines. Short-range calls, long-range calls, and alarm <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> also used. Nocturnal species are more constrained {{by the lack of}} light, so their communication systems differ from those of diurnal species, often using long-range calls to claim their territory.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook fusca {{is found}} on Timor, Roma, Leti and Semau Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Veillot in 1817 as Strix fusca. It has a more grey-brown plumage with no red tinge, unlike other subspecies. it has grey streaks on its belly and white spots on its secondaries, inner wing-coverts and nape. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species. Its <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> shorter and more frequent than subspecies boobook.|$|E
50|$|The <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a cour-lee, {{similar to}} that of the Eurasian curlew, but higher-pitched, more melodic, and shorter. The alarm <b>call</b> <b>is</b> a fast cu-ee.|$|R
50|$|After {{a channel}} is {{initially}} seized, each device must indicate {{the progress of}} a call. The progress indicators include whether a <b>call</b> <b>is</b> answered or remains unanswered, and when a <b>call</b> <b>is</b> answered, which party disconnects first. These <b>call</b> progress states <b>are</b> important as Telephony systems need to know when the <b>call</b> <b>was</b> attempted, answered, and cleared, hence the term Answer and Disconnect Supervision.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{important issues}} in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in Japan and examines what language teachers should {{take into consideration}} when introducing CALL in their classrooms.

Second, <b>CALL</b> <b>is</b> evaluated under such research areas as brain-imaging, motivation, self-achievement, and physical movement. Third, concerns of language teachers toward <b>CALL</b> <b>are</b> discussed briefly. This literature review concludes that <b>CALL</b> <b>is</b> not error-free and thus requires a great amount of attention and modification by language teachers, leaving a further discussion of teachers' roles in CALL to subsequent papers...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact <b>calls,</b> <b>are</b> animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} {{produces}} {{a variety of}} vocalizations, {{the most common of}} which are the tremolo, the yodel, the wail, and the hoot. Each of these calls communicates a distinct message. The frequency at which it vocalizes has been shown to vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have also been shown to occur more frequently in cold temperatures and when there is little to no rain.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{recognized}} {{calls for the}} mockingbird: the nest relief call, hew call, chat or chatburst, and the begging call. The hew call is mainly used by both sexes for potential nest predators, conspecific chasing, and various interactions between mates. The differences between chats and chatbursts are frequency of use, as chats are year-round, and chatbursts occur in the fall. Another difference is that chatbursts appear {{to be used in}} territorial defense in the fall, and the chats are used by either sex when disturbed. The nest relief and begging <b>calls</b> <b>are</b> only used by the males.|$|E
