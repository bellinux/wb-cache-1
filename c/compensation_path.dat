40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf [73]) A typical DC motor {{position control}} system suppresses load disturbances by obtaining the gain of the proportional controller through {{trial and error}}. This trial and error is usually based on feedback from one or two load disturbance sensors that must {{be added to the}} system. Since this method does not provide a return-to-zero effect when stopping the motor, there is no self-regulation. Consequently, the typical system is impractical. The master's thesis presents a new, more practical design technique for DC motor optimal position control with load disturbance. The following theory is derived: In any linear system, the total performance index is a sum of separate performance indexes. Then, by the reference V, the general relationship between the gain of the proportional controller and the command input angle is obtained. Finally the quadratic optimal feedback form, the feedforward <b>compensation</b> <b>path,</b> and the proportional controller are combined with the DC motor optimal position control, so that the output of a system with load disturbance can be controlled without trial and error or added sensors. Since this new method also provides a return-to- zero effect, it is effective and practical. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E

This paper presents the design of a continuous-time ΔΣ modulator (CTDSM) to be used in an ultrasound beamformer for biomedical imaging. To achieve better resolution, the prototype modulator operates at 1. 2 GHz.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} data rates in wireless communication require analog to digital converters (ADCs) with greater requirements on speed and accuracy, while being power efficient to prolong battery life. This dissertation contains {{an introduction to}} the field and five papers that focus on the continuous-time (CT) Delta-Sigma modulator (DSM) as ADC. Paper I analyses the performance degradation of dynamic nonlinearity in the feedback DAC of the DSM, caused by Vth mismatch in the current-switching (differential) pair of a current-steering DAC. A model is developed to study return-to-zero (RZ) and non-return-to-zero (NRZ) feedback DACs, with and without data-weighted averaging (DWA), where an RZ DAC with DWA recovers the performance. Paper II and III presents a feedback scheme for improved robustness against variations in loop delay. An RZ pulse, centered in the clock period, is used in the innermost feedback path which has the highest sensitivity to loop delay, while NRZ pulses are adopted in the outer feedback paths to reduce the sensitivity to clock jitter and lower the integrator slew rate requirements. Furthermore, the otherwise obligatory loop delay <b>compensation</b> <b>path</b> (e. g. an additional DAC and adder) could be omitted to reduce hardware complexity. A discrete-time model of the feedback scheme confirms a negligible loss in performance. The 3 rd-order CT DSM in 65 nm CMOS with 9 MHz LTE bandwidth achieves 69 / 71 dB SNDR/SNR and consumes 7. 5 mW from a 1. 2 V supply. Measurements with OFDM signals verify an improved tolerance to blockers outside the signal band of the DSM. Paper IV and V present two filtering ADCs, where the DSM is merged into the channel select filter to suppress the noise from the DSM. The first and second prototypes provide a 2 nd- and 3 rd-order channel select filtering and improve the SNDR of the DSM by 14 dB and 20 dB, respectively, which in theory can be exploited to reduce the DSM power consumption by four to eight times. The first prototype has a 288 MHz clock frequency, a 9 MHz LTE bandwidth, a 2 nd-order Butterworth filter response with 12 dB gain, an input-referred noise of 8. 1 nV/sqrt(Hz), an in/out-of-band IIP 3 of 11. 5 / 27 dBVrms, and a power consumption of 11. 3 mW. The second prototype is clocked at 576 / 288 MHz with an 18. 5 / 9 MHz LTE bandwidth, a Chebyshev filter response with 26 dB gain, a low input-referred noise of 5 nV/sqrt(Hz), and an in/out-of-band IIP 3 of - 8. 5 / 20 dBVrms, with a power consumption of 7. 9 / 5. 4 mW for 2 xLTE 20 /LTE 20 mode. The prototype was characterized for OFDM modulated blockers and essentially meets the cellular standard LTE Rel. 11. A delay, introduced by the feedback DAC, is compensated by adjusting the filter coefficients to restore the original Chebyshev filter function. Both prototypes have state-of-the-art power efficiency compared to other filtering ADCs and are comparable or better than a stand-alone filter. Furthermore, the filtering ADC provides both filtering and A/D conversion, which suggests that the A/D conversion is included in a power efficient manner, broadly speaking "for free"...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from October 26, 2016 - April 26, 2017 Incremental ADCs (IADCs) have found wide applications in sensor interface circuitry since, compared to ∆Σ ADCs, they provide low-latency high-accuracy conversion and easy multiplexing among multiple channels. On the other hand, continuous-time ∆Σ ADCs (CTDSM) have been receiving more and more attention as a power-efficient solution in targeting medium to high accuracy over wider range of signal bandwidth (tens of MHz). In this dissertation, novel configurations have been explored in both architectures for power-efficient and high-accuracy data conversion. First, a multi-step incremental ADC (IADC) using multi-slope extended counting technique is described. Only one active integrator {{is used in the}} three-step conversion cycle. The accuracy of the IADC is extended by having it configured as multi-slope ADCs in two additional steps. The proposed IADC uses the same circuitry as a first-order IADC (IADC 1), but it exhibits as good efficiency as its second-order ∆Σ ADC counterpart. For the same accuracy, the conversion cycle is shortened by a factor of more than 2 ⁹ compared to the IADC 1. Fabricated in 0. 18 -μm CMOS process, the prototype ADC occupies 0. 5 mm². With a 642 kHz clock, it achieves SNDR of 52. 2 dB in the first step. The SNDR is boosted to 79. 8 dB in the second step, and to 96. 8 dB in the third step, over a 1 kHz signal band. The power consumption is 35 µW from a 1. 5 V power supply. This gives an excellent Schreier FoM of 174. 6 dB. Secondly, a multi-step incremental ADC with extended binary counting is proposed. It achieves high accuracy by splitting one conversion cycle into two serial steps. During the first step, the ADC works as a first-order incremental ADC (IADC 1). The second step reuses the single integrator and extends the accuracy to 16 bits by a two-capacitor SAR-assisted binary counting technique. For the same accuracy, the conversion cycle is shortened by a factor of more than 2 ⁸ as compared to the single-step IADC. Fabricated in 0. 18 -μm CMOS process, the SAR-assisted IADC achieves a peak SNR/SNDR/DR of 97. 1 / 96. 6 / 100. 2 dB over a 1. 2 kHz bandwidth, while dissipating 33. 2 μW from a 1. 5 V supply. This gives a Schreier FoM of 175. 8 dB and Walden FoM of 0. 25 pJ/conv. -step. Finally, the design of a continuous-time ∆Σ modulator (CTDSM) to be used in an ultrasound beamformer for biomedical imaging is described. To achieve better resolution, the prototype modulator operates at 1. 2 GHz. It incorporates a digital excess loop delay (ELD) compensation to replace the active adder in front of the internal quantizer.

40|$|The {{emplacement}} of the Jurassic dolerites of Tasmania {{is considered}} {{in terms of}} the tectonic structure of Tasmania at the time of intrusion. At this time Tasmania consisted of a Permo-Triassic sedimentary cover draped in gentle downwarps over an uneven basement of folded Precambrian-Palaeozoic rocks, with uplifted highs in the west, northeast, and east. Characteristics required for the recognition of dolerite feeders in Tasmania, particularly cones, are discussed and the structures are examined in the light of these. In form, the cones are generally asymmetrical structures. In many cases there is insufficient evidence present to determine whether they represent rootless conical sheets emplaced under a flotational mechanism, or whether they represent conical feeders. Possible modes of emplacement are considered. Some of the cones appear to be secondary structures developed in the sedimentary cover at about the base of the Triassic sequence, possibly from cupola-like structures on underlying sill sheets. The intruding dolerite was controlled by, and also caused, extensive Jurassic faulting. The recognisable tectonic pattern is shown. The faulting in places suggests the development of horstlike and graben-like structures in the downwarps between the main pre-existing highs. Some of the major Tertiary faults of the State were originally lines of Jurassic movements, and there is a suggestion that the Tertiary Midlands, Cressy, Tamar, and possibly the Derwent and Oyster Bay trough structures were inherited, in part, from Jurassic structures. It is considered east-north-easterly and north-easterly tensional forces were important in producing the fault pattern and that it was controlled to a certain extent by the margins of the main pre-existing highs and structural trends in the basement. The greatest fracturing took place in the central trough of the main downwarp between the highs of western and eastern Tasmania. Dolerite magma probably rose here from feeder• dykes and its emplacement was controlled by compensation surfaces, giving rise to transgressive sills, meeting in numerous large dykes, with considerable rafting of sedimentary blocks. Away from the main downwarp, sill sheets were more extensively developed and in the broad scheme their emplacement apparently followed <b>compensation</b> <b>paths.</b> Cone structures were emplaced, apparently mostly on the margins of the downwarps and on small intervening highs. On the upper flanks of the main highs, feeders were mainly plug and dyke-like plugs. Where basement highs exceeded heights of about 4, 000 feet above the basement level in the downwarps, dolerite feeders were lacking. At the time of the dolerite intrusions Tasmania was probably situated below the Antarctic Circle, just east of the Ross Sea, and comparisons are made with the similar Ferrar dolerites of Antarctica. Differences in the emplacement of the dolerite appear to be due to structural differences between the two regions at the time of emplacement. Only limited comparisons can be made between Jurassic trends associated with the dolerites of the two regions, but maxima in the trends of Tasmanian dykes were apparently similarly orientated to those of Antarctica...|$|R

The design of the test parts follows the criteria of simplicity, consideration of machining operation characteristics and easy measurement. An illustrative example is used to demonstrate the design of test parts, the error analysis and generalization, and the predicting power of the proposed approach. It was demonstrated that approximately 4 times improvement for an ordinary CNC machine can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} higher data rates in {{receivers}} with carrier aggregation (CA) such as LTE, increases {{the efforts to}} integrate large number of wireless services into single receiving path, so it needs to digitize the signal in intermediate or high frequencies. It relaxes most of the front-end blocks but makes the design of ADC very challenging. Solving the bottleneck associated with ADC in receiver architecture is {{a major focus of}} many ongoing researches. Recently, continuous time Sigma-Delta analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are getting more attention due to their inherent filtering properties, lower power consumption and wider input bandwidth. But, it suffers from several non-idealities such as clock jitter and ELD which decrease the ADC performance. This dissertation presents two projects that address CT-?? modulator non-idealities. One of the projects is a CT- ?? modulator with 10. 9 Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) with Gradient Descent (GD) based calibration technique. The GD algorithm is used to extract loop gain transfer function coefficients. A quantization noise reduction technique is then employed to improve the Signal to Quantization Noise Ratio (SQNR) of the modulator using a 7 -bit embedded quantizer. An analog fast path feedback topology is proposed which uses an analog differentiator in order to compensate excess loop delay. This approach relaxes the requirements of the amplifier placed in front of the quantizer. The modulator is implemented using a third order loop filter with a feed-forward <b>compensation</b> <b>paths</b> and a 3 -bit quantizer in the feedback loop. In order to save power and improve loop linearity a two-stage class-AB amplifier is developed. The prototype modulator is implemented in 0. 13 ?m CMOS technology, which achieves peak Signal to Noise and Distortion Ratio (SNDR) of 67. 5 dB while consuming total power of 8. 5 -mW under a 1. 2 V supply with an over sampling ratio of 10 at 300 MHz sampling frequency. The prototype achieves Walden's Figure of Merit (FoM) of 146 fJ/step. The second project addresses clock jitter non-ideality in Continuous Time Sigma Delta modulators (CT- ??M), the modulator suffer from performance degradation due to uncertainty in timing of clock at digital-to-analog converter (DAC). This thesis proposes to split the loop filter into two parts, analog and digital part to reduce the sensitivity of feedback DAC to clock jitter. By using the digital first-order filter after the quantizer, the effect of clock jitter is reduced without changing signal transfer function (STF). On the other hand, as one pole of the loop filter is implemented digitally, the power and area are reduced by minimizing active analog elements. Moreover, having more digital blocks in the loop of CT- ??M makes it less sensitive to process, voltage, and temperature variations. We also propose the use of a single DAC with a current divider to implement feedback coefficients instead of two DACs to decrease area and clock routing. The prototype is implemented in TSMC 40 nm technology and occupies 0. 06 mm^ 2 area; the proposed solution consumes 6. 9 mW, and operates at 500 MS/s. In a 10 MHz bandwidth, the measured dynamic range (DR), peak signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), and peak signal-to-noise and distortion (SNDR) ratios in presence of 4. 5 ps RMS clock jitter (0. 22 % clock period) are 75 dB, 68 dB, and 67 dB, respectively. The proposed structure is 10 dB more tolerant to clock jitter when compared to the conventional ??M design for similar loop filter...|$|R
