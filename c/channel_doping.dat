To combat drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), MOSFET channels are more doped near the source and drain terminals {{to reduce the size of}} the depletion region in the vicinity of these junctions (called halo doping to describe the limitation of this heavy doping to the immediate vicinity of the junctions). At short channel lengths the halo doping of the source overlaps that of the drain, increasing the average <b>channel</b> <b>doping</b> concentration, and thus increasing the threshold voltage. This increased threshold voltage requires a larger gate voltage for channel inversion. However, as channel length is increased, the halo doped regions become separated and the doping mid-channel approaches a lower background level dictated by the body doping.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} work {{aimed at}} investigating the possible benefit of strained-Si/SiGe heterostructure MOSFETs designed for nanoscale (sub- 50 -nm) gate lengths {{with the aid}} of device fabrication and electrical measurements combined with computer simulation. MOSFET devices fabricated on bulk-Si material are scaled in order to achieve gains in performance and integration. However, as device dimensions continue to scale, physical constraints are being reached that may limit continued scaling and/or the gains in performance from scaling. In order to continue the benefits of scaling, a possible solution is to change to a strained-Si/SiGe material system where enhanced electron mobility of 1. 7 - 2 X has been demonstrated for long-channel n-type devices. The electron mobility enhancement observed for long channel length devices may not be the same for devices with nanoscale gate length. In particular, increased <b>channel</b> <b>doping,</b> which is required to control short-channel effects can result in degraded transport characteristics. In this work, the impact of high <b>channel</b> <b>doping</b> on mobility enhancements in strained-Si n-MOSFETs is investigated experimentally. Increased <b>channel</b> <b>doping</b> will increase Coulomb scattering interactions increasing its influence on the overall mobility. Electron transport models were calibrated using experimental data for both strained and un-strained Si devices for various <b>channel</b> <b>doping</b> concentrations.
