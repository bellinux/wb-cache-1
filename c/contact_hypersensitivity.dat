5000|$|Oral {{tolerance}} {{refers to}} {{a specific type of}} peripheral tolerance induced by antigens given by mouth and exposed to the gut mucosa and its associated lymphoid tissues. The hypo-responsiveness induced by oral exposure is systemic, and can reduce hypersensitivity reactions in certain cases. Records from 1829 indicate that American Indians would reduce <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> from poison ivy by consuming leaves of related Rhus species; however, contemporary attempts to use oral tolerance to ameliorate autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and other hypersensitivity reactions have been mixed. The systemic effects of oral tolerance may be explained by the extensive recirculation of immune cells primed in one mucosal tissue in another mucosal tissue, allowing extension of mucosal immunity.

Although IL- 17 F is highly homologous to IL- 17 A and binds the same receptor, the functional roles of this molecule remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated with Il 17 a−/−, Il 17 f−/−, and Il 17 a−/−Il 17 f−/− mice that IL- 17 F played only marginal roles, if at all, {{in the development of}} delayed-type and <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivities,</b> autoimmune encephalomyelitis, collagen-induced arthritis, and arthritis in Il 1 rn−/− mice. In contrast, both IL- 17 F and IL- 17 A were involved in host defense against mucoepithelial infection by Staphylococcus aureus and Citrobacter rodentium. IL- 17 A was produced mainly in T cells, whereas IL- 17 F was produced in T cells, innate immune cells, and epithelial cells. Although only IL- 17 A efficiently induced cytokines in macrophages, both cytokines activated epithelial innate immune responses. These observations indicate that IL- 17 A and IL- 17 F have overlapping yet distinct roles in host immune and defense mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|Activation of TP receptors stimulates {{vascular}} {{endothelial cell}} pro-inflammatory responses such as increased expression of cell surface adhesion proteins (i.e. ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin); stimulates apoptosis (i.e. cell death) of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes; causes the chemokinesis (i.e. cell movement) of native T cells; and impairs the adhesion of dendritic cells to T cells thereby inhibiting dendritic cell-dependent proliferation of T cells. TP deficient mice exhibit an enhanced <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> response to DNFB thymocytes in the thymus of these deficient mice {{are resistant to}} lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis. TP receptor-depleted mice also gradually develop with age extensive lymphadenopathy and, associated with this, increased immune responses to foreign antigens.

5000|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the {{interleukin}} 1 cytokine family. This gene and eight other interleukin 1 family genes form a cytokine gene cluster on chromosome 2. The activity of this cytokine is mediated via the interleukin-1 receptor-like 2 (IL1RL2/IL1R-rp2/IL-36 receptor), and is specifically inhibited by interleukin 36 receptor antagonist, (IL-36RA/IL1F5/IL-1 delta). Interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) are reported to stimulate the expression of this cytokine in keratinocytes. The expression of this cytokine in keratinocytes can also be induced by a <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reaction or herpes simplex virus infection.

The magnitude of the late ear swelling depends on that of the early swelling. We studied the influence of ultraviolet radiation on both phases of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> to picrylchloride. Mice were exposed to subedemal doses of ultraviolet radiation on the shaved backs for four consecutive days. Four days later mice were sensitized on non-irradiated skin.

40|$|Evidence {{in favor}} of a role for Langerhans cells in <b>contact</b> {{allergic}} <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions has been reviewed. This includes mononuclear cell to Langerhans cell apposition and damage to some Langerhans cells at sites of specific challenge to a variety of contact allergens. Such apposition occurs in actively sensitized patients and guinea pigs and in passively sensitized guinea pigs. In addition, in passively sensitized guinea pigs, Langerhans cells circulate in dermal vessels resembling lymphatics and are much increased in the dermis after challenge with the contact allergen. These observations, together with the existing knowledge that Langerhans cells occur in the lymph nodes and thymus, suggest that these cells may be involved not only in contact allergic reactions but also in other immunologic reactions, particularly in cell-mediated reactions in the skin...|$|R

Recently, we reported on the T-T-cell interaction in delayed hypersensitivity (DH) response in mice induced by immunization with methylated human serum albumin (MHSA) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), as revealed by cell transfer study and adult thymectomy (6). We suggested that the suppressor T cells regulated the DH in the induction stage. The suppressor activity was detected in such conventionally immunized mice, prominent in the young mouse thymus cells, but rare in the old mouse thymus cells or peripheral lymphocytes (6). On the other hand, DH seems to be regulated by humoral antibodies. There is an apparent inverse relationship between induction of humoral antibody response and DH reactivity (7, 8). Moreover, DH induction is inhibited by antibodies such as gammal-eontrasensitizing antibodies (9, 10). Pretreatment of guinea pigs with cyclophosphamid...|$|R
40|$|One {{explanation}} {{for the fact that}} certain genetically defined strains of mice prove to be resistant to effects of low dose ultraviolet B radiation on the induction of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> is that ultraviolet B resistant mice possess a second pathway for antigen presentation through the skin—a pathway that is independent of epidermal Langerhans cells and {{beyond the reach of the}} damaging effects of ultraviolet B Light. As a corollary, ultraviolet-B susceptible mice would be expected to be deficient in this pathway. Several experimental strategies were employed to determine whether Langerhans cells are required for the induction of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> by epicutaneously applied hapten. The results reveal that tape-stripped skin supports the induction of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> whereas surgical excision of hapten-painted skin within 1 h of application fails to permit the development of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Because the former selectively eliminates epidermal Langerhans cells while the latter deletes both Langerhans cells and dermal antigen-presenting cells, we conclude that either Langerhans cells or dermal cells are sufficient to provide antigen presentation in the induction of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> When large amounts of hapten are painted epicutaneously, or when hapten is injected subcutaneously or painted on sub-dermal tissues, <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> also results, indicating that induction of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> does not require that antigen processing and presentation be provided by cutaneous cells. Reasons are presented for concluding that under physiologic circumstances induction of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> by epicutaneous hapten application relies primarily upon the antigen-presenting capabilities of epidermal (Langerhans cells) and dermal cells...|$|E
40|$|The role of interleukin- 4 as a {{regulator}} of immune {{responses in}} the skin is investigated {{with regard to the}} outcome of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reaction in interleukin- 4 -deficient BALB/C mice. In previous studies conflicting results were obtained concerning the role of interleukin- 4 in <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions supporting either a proinflammatory or rather an inhibitory function of this cytokine. Interleukin- 4 deficient BALB/C mice sensitized to 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene showed after challenge a significant reduction in magnitude and duration of the <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> response in comparison with wild-type mice. This attenuation was accompanied by a significant reduction of edema and cellular infiltrates in the dermis and a lacking induction of IL- 10 mRNA expression in skin. Also, adoptive transfer experiments revealed that BALB/C mice failed to exhibit <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> after injection of lymph node cells obtained from sensitized interleukin- 4 deficient mice. To examine further the role of the contact allergen used to induce the <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> response, mice were also sensitized and challenged with Oxazolone. Here a similar magnitude and duration of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in both the interleukin- 4 deficient mice and BALB/C control mice was observed. This indicates that the <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> response to 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene and Oxazolone may partly evolve on different pathways being dependent and independent of interleukin- 4. Our results clearly show that the complete loss of endogenous interleukin- 4 expression in BALB/C mice is associated with an impaired manifestation of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> response to 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene, implying an important proinflammatory function of this cytokine...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacologic {{suppression}} of the effector phase ot <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> appears to have major relevance with regard to treatment of type IV reactions like contact dermatitis.

Pentoxifylline, a methylxanthine derivative used in the treatment of vascular disorders, currently has been found to suppress the production of tumor necrosis factor α by human and murine leukocytes. Therefore, the effect of pentoxifylline on the elicitation phase of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was studied. Intraperitoneal injection of pentoxifylline into sensitized Balb/c and C 3 H/HeN mice before application of the challenging hapten dose resulted in a significant reduction of the outcome of the <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reaction. The suppressive effect of pentoxifylline was dose dependent and maximally pronounced upon injection 3 h before hapten application. In contrast to the effector phase of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> induction of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was not affected by pentoxifylline when injected into naive mice before performance of sensitization.

To specifically investigate the role of γδT cells in the development of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> this study employed Tδ gene knockout mice that are deficient in γδT cells but are normal in the development of αβT cells. The result indicates that <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> responses were significantly greater in γδT cell deficient mice than in wild-type mice. Similar results were obtained when wild-type mice were depleted of γδT cells with antibody treatment before hapten sensitization. Depletion of CD 4 + T cells did not affect the increased <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> response in γδT cell deficient mice, suggesting that the effect of γδT cells is on CD 8 + T cells and does not require CD 4 + T cells. Further experiments demonstrated that primed CD 8 + T cells from the deficient mice exhibited significantly higher CTL activity. The cytokine profile of CD 4 + T cells was not significantly altered. Transfer of primed lymph node cells from hapten-primed γδT cell deficient mice elicited a similar level of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in naive wild-type and the deficient recipient mice, indicating that γδT cells have little effect on the elicitation of primed T cells and <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> responses.

Ear excisions made at 24 hr after injection of 0. 25 µg of picryl chloride (PCl) or at 12 hr after injection of 5. 0 µg of dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) essentially blocked onset of delayed type hypersensitivity, hence the first fraction to escape (80 % of PCl, 98 % of DNCB) was not used for sensitization. This large fraction serves rather {{to set up a}} state of specific tolerance, for these individuals showed extensive deficits in their ability to respond to a later sensitizing course. Also the ability to form hapten-specific antibody appeared nearly completely suppressed. Injections of allergen into the blood stream or directly in auricular nodes, in an amount approximating that which escaped early from the ear, also led to the same degrees of unresponsiveness—sometimes full, sometimes partial tolerance. The same types of specific tolerance were secured also by injecting subsensitizing doses into the ear, without excision, or into the flank and by contact tests applied to the flank. The allergen remaining in the ear after the early outflow, particularly between 12 – 24 hr and 3 – 4 days, appeared to constitute the sensitizing depot. The longer this depot was available to the animals the greater the immunological "information" for sensitization was picked up until the depot had served its full function around the 4 th day. "Peripheral sensitization" was clearly demonstrable. The eventual degree of sensitivity attained by the animals was a resultant of two immunologic processes which occurred independently—tolerogenic effects of escaped chemical {{on the one hand and}} on the other the sensitizing effect of the local sensitizing depot of allergen bound in the ear tissue...|$|R
40|$|The {{identity}} of the effector T cell population involved in <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> is still questionable with evidence promoting both CD 4 + or CD 8 + T cells. Previous experimental studies have relied on the in vivo depletion of T cell subsets using antibody, {{or the use of}} knock-out mice with deficiencies in either CD 4 + or CD 8 + T cell-mediated immunity. To address the role of the class I- and class II-mediated pathways of T cell activation in <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> responses in mice with an intact immune system, we utilized various trinitrophenyl-derivatized peptides, which bind specifically with H- 2 Kb (major histocompatibility complex class I) or H- 2 I-Ab (major histocompatibility complex class II). The subcutaneous injection of major histocompatibility complex class II-specific, but not of class I-binding, hapten-derivatized peptides in incomplete Freund's adjuvant induced specific, albeit low, <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> responsiveness to trinitrochlorobenzene. When bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells, however, were pulsed with the same peptides and administered intradermally, the opposite result was observed, namely that the class I binding peptides induced <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> responses similar to that observed after epicutaneous trinitrochlorobenzene application. In contrast, dendritic cells pulsed with major histocompatibility complex class II binding peptides did not reproducibly sensitize for <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> responses. Surprisingly, both immunization protocols efficiently induced CD 8 + effector T cells. These results support the notion that CD 8 + T cells are the dominant effector population mediating <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> responsiveness and that the CD 4 + T cell subset only contributes little if at all...|$|E
40|$|Dinitrochlorobenzene-induced <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> {{is widely}} {{considered}} as a cell-mediated rather than antibody-mediated immune response. At present, very {{little is known about}} the role of antigen-specific antibodies and B cells in the development of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced hypersensitivity reactions, and this is the subject of the present investigation. Data obtained from multiple lines of experiments unequivocally showed that the formation of dinitrochlorobenzene-specific Abs played an important role in the development of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> The appearance of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced skin dermatitis matched in timing the appearance of the circulating dinitrochlorobenzene-specific antibodies. Adoptive transfer of sera containing dinitrochlorobenzene-specific antibodies from dinitrochlorobenzene-treated mice elicited a much stronger hypersensitivity reaction than the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from the same donors. Moreover, dinitrochlorobenzene-induced <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was strongly suppressed in B cell-deficient mice with no DNCB-specific antibodies. It was also observed that treatment of animals with dinitrochlorobenzene polarized Th cells into Th 2 differentiation by increasing the production of Th 2 cytokines while decreasing the production of Th 1 cytokines. In striking contrast to the long-held belief that dinitrochlorobenzene-induced <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> is a cell-mediated immune response, the results of our present study demonstrated that the production of dinitrochlorobenzene-specific antibodies by activated B cells played an indispensible role in the pathogenesis of dinitrochlorobenzene-induced CHS. These findings may provide new possibilities in the treatment of human <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> conditions...|$|E
40|$|Exposing mice to UV {{radiation}} in the UVB range (280 – 320 nm) {{causes a}} selective immune suppression {{that contributes to}} the development of UVB-induced skin cancers. Among the immune responses suppressed by UVB irradiation are contact and delayed hypersensitivity reactions to haptens administered at unexposed sites. In these studies we provide evidence that delayed and <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> to the same hapten are not equivalent reactions and that they are suppressed in UVB-irradiated mice by 2 different mechanisms. This conclusion is based on the findings that: (1) suppression of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> could not be overcome by immunizing UVB-irradiated mice with hapten-coupled antigen-presenting cells derived from normal donors; and (2) treatment of UVB-irradiated mice with methylprednisolone before immunization prevented the suppression of delayed hypersensitivity but had no effect on the suppression of <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> The decreased ability to induce <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in UVB-irradiated mice could be transferred to x-irradiated mice by reconstituting them with spleen cells from UVB- irradiated donors. The induction of hapten-specific suppressor cells, however, required both UVB irradiation and priming with hapten. Based on these results, we postulate that UVB irradiation induces a population of suppressor-inducer cells with specificity for a modified skin antigen and that this antigen serves as a carrier molecule for haptens that induce <b>contact</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and for tumor-specific transplantation antigens on UVB-induced tumors...|$|E
40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} {{is becoming a}} common skin problem all over the world. It accounts for about 4 - 7 % of all dermatological problems. This {{is due to a}} delayed <b>hypersensitivity</b> reaction following <b>contact</b> with antigens. <b>Hypersensitivity</b> to chemicals appears to become a serious health problem for the general population, particularly in their work environment it will be the most incapacitating condition as a consequence of skin being exposed to chemical agents. Allergic {{contact dermatitis}} is characterized by erythema, scaling, edema, vesiculation and oozing. Itching varies from mild to severe. These features can be correlated with vicharchika. So in order to manage vicharchika in terms of Allergic contact dermatitis, a comparative study was done to evaluate the effect of virechana and shamanaushadhis. Group A was given virechana followed by shamanoushadhis i. e., Laghu sootashekara vati and Nava kwatha along with Manjishtadi taila for external application for 30 days. Group B was given only shamanoushadhis for 30 days. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed by noting the prime lakshanas of vicharchika like shyava varna, pidaka, kandu and srava before and after the treatment and statistically analysed using student ‘t’ test. After treatment it is observed that, both shodhana chikitsa and shamana chikitsa have their own role in the management of vicharchika. Even statistically, both are having highly significant values within the individual groups. But when both shodhana and shamana treatment are statistically compared, they show no significant values which means that both are effective with no significant difference between them...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic paronychia, earlier {{considered}} to be an infection due to Candida, is currently being considered as a dermatitis of the nail fold. Irritant, allergic and protein contact dermatitis are the suggested major pathogenic mechanisms. Hypersensitivity to Candida {{is more likely to be}} the etiology, rather than the infection itself. Aims: To assess the clinico-etiological profiles of patients with chronic paronychia and to determine the role of <b>contact</b> sensitization and <b>hypersensitivity</b> to Candida. Methods: All consecutive patients of chronic paronychia attending the dermatology outpatient department (OPD) were assessed for risk factors, number of nails affected, clinical presentation and presence of fungus, patch tested for contact allergy and prick tested for hypersensitivity to Candida allergen. Results: A total of 80 patients of chronic paronychia were recruited into our study. There was female preponderance (66 patients, 82. 5 %), with the most common group affected being housewives (47 patients, 58. 8 %). Frequent washing of hands (64 patients, 80 %) was the most common risk factor. Fungal culture was positive in 56. 1 % (41 patients), the predominant species cultured was Candida albicans (15 patients, 36. 5 %). Patch testing with Indian standard series was positive in 27. 1 % patients (19 out of 70 patients tested), with nickel being the most common allergen. Prick test with Candida allergen was positive in 47. 6 % patients (31 out of 65 patients tested). Limitations: Prick test and patch test provide indirect evidence of hypersensitivity, with inherent limitations. Conclusion: Our study shows that chronic paronychia is probably a form of hand dermatitis associated with prolonged wet work, and that there is a higher incidence of contact sensitization and Candida hypersensitivity in these patients...|$|R
40|$|<b>Contact</b> allergy (delayed <b>hypersensitivity)</b> {{may develop}} {{as a result}} of skin {{exposure}} to contact allergens (haptens) and can lead to allergic contact dermatitis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate some predictive animal test methods for contact allergens. It was done with the aim that the test methods giving the clinically most relevant results should be used in risk assessment of chemicals and in research. A slightly modified multi-dose-response induction protocol was evaluated with two model contact allergens when applied to three guinea pig predictive test methods. The protocol was easily applied to the cumulative contact enhancement test (CCET) and the Freund's complete adjuvant test (FCAT), which have only one induction route. However, for the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT) with two induction routes, the topical doses at induction interacted with the logistic model. The protocol would benefit from further development and some modifications are suggested. Calculations of the estimated concentration sensitizing 50 % of the animals (EC 50) improves the possibility for proper ranking of contact allergens and augments the information used in risk assessment. The calculated EC 50 -values for the model allergens were: 0. 00045 % in the FCAT, 0. 0025 % in the GPMT and 0. 0042 % in the CCET for potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7), and 0. 068 % in the GPMT, 0. 89 % in the FCAT and 1. 8 % in the CCET for hydroxycitronellal (HC). A multi-dose-response induction protocol was applied on a modified mouse ear swelling test (MEST) and evaluated with four contact allergens and one irritant. This protocol could detect the moderate to strong contact allergens as sensitizers, but not one (HC) of the two weak contact allergens. The irritant (negative control) gave a Ônegative' response. The EC 50 -values calculated for the three detected allergens were 0. 002 % for oxazolone, 0. 03 % for K 2 Cr 2 O 7 and 0. 7 % for methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDBGN). The murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is a predictive test method, but its ability to discriminate between allergens and irritants has been questioned. Eight contact allergens and six irritants were investigated in the evaluation of the LLNA. The moderate to strong allergens gave clearly Ôpositive' results (stimulation index (SI) = 12. 8 - 39. 9), but one weak allergen (benzocaine) was not classified as a sensitizer (SI< 3). The irritants tested, i. e. chloroform/methanol, methylsalicylate, nonanoic acid, oxalic acid, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Triton X- 100, however, gave also Ôpositive' results (SI = 5. 0 - 10. 7), not distinguishable from the results with weak and moderate contact allergens (SI = 3. 4 - 17. 1). The addition of 10 % SDS could not be used to reduce the induced proliferation due to irritation from the test chemicals, nor could an alternative choice of vehicle. The allergenicity of a preservative, i. e. Euxyl K 400, and one of its ingredients, MDBGN, was investigated in three different animal predictive test methods, and patch testing in dermatitis patients was performed for comparison. The CCET using 57 a multi-dose-response induction protocol (EC 50 = 1. 9 % for MDBGN) and the LLNA (SI = 7. 4 - 7. 9 for MDBGN and 8. 4 - 12. 0 for Euxyl K 400) confirmed the sensitization potential of the substance based on dermatitis patients patch test results (total frequency varied between 0. 9 - 1. 8 %). However, the results from the GPMT were not statistically significant. In conclusion, even though the LLNA and the MEST have some advantages compared to the guinea pig test methods concerning speed, labor-intensiveness and cost, and the use of an objective end point, the methods are at present not capable of replacing the predictive guinea pig test methods. Both the LLNA and MEST gave a lower sensitization rate with the weak and moderate contact allergens tested than the guinea pig test methods did. The MEST is judged to be less capable of detecting potential contact allergens than the LLNA, but on the other hand no false Ôpositive' reactivity with the irritant tested was seen. Dose-response designs of predictive test methods increase the amount of information obtained from each sensitization study and should be considered for inclusion in the protocols used when the sensitizing potential of a substance is investigated. Investigators are advised to select the predictive test method with the induction procedure that is most relevant for the prospected use of the substance being tested. A test method with a particular induction route may be more suitable for testing a substance than one of the recommended methods, so there is also a possibility to use other available standardized predictive animal test methods. However, that predictive test methods have a varying capacity to detect the sensitizing potential of a substance is evident...|$|R
