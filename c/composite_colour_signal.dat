40|$|Abstract:Quality of the <b>Colour</b> <b>Composite</b> video <b>signal</b> {{has become}} the basic {{criteria}} of today’s TV transmission systems (Terrestrial / Satellite / Cable). Video streaming is increasingly finding its way in day-to-day lives of people. The videos typically passes through several processing stages {{before they reach the}} end user. The effect of most processing stages is to degrade the quality of the video that passes through it. The only reliable method to assess the video quality perceived by a human observer is to ask human subjects for their opinion, which is termed subjective video quality assessment (VQA). Subjective VQA is impractical for most applications due to the human involvement in the process. Hence we go for objective analysis, which includes the verifying <b>Colour</b> <b>Composite</b> Video <b>Signal</b> parameters like sync pulses, colour burst and the luminance. The need to have a low cost video switcher and a CCVS analyzer with high performance and to easily carry the analyzer equipment from one place to other i. e., a portable system, made us to develop the low cost microcontroller based automatic video switcher and CCVS analyzer.

40|$|Metamer {{mismatching}} {{refers to}} the fact that two objects reflecting light causing identical <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> (i. e., cone response or XYZ) under one illumination may reflect light causing non-identical <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> under a second illumination. As a consequence of metamer mismatching, two objects appearing the same under the first illuminant can be expected to appear different under the second illuminant. Metamers of the flat grey reflectance (i. e., 50 % across the visible spectrum) are of particular interest since they show the potential seriousness of metamer mismatching. Metamer mismatching of flat grey is very significant for some lights and includes the possibility of 20 objects having the same <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> as flat grey under red light dispersing into a whole hue circle under a neutral (“white”) light.

40|$|Colour and {{greyscale}} (black and white) pictures {{look different}} to us, {{but it is}} not clear whether the difference in appearance is a consequence of the way our visual system uses <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> or a by-product of our experience. In principle, colour images are qualitatively different from greyscale images because they make it possible to use different processing strategies. <b>Colour</b> <b>signals</b> provide important cues for segmenting the image into areas that represent different objects and for linking together areas that represent the same object. If this property of <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> is exploited in visual processing we would expect colour stimuli to look different, as a class, from greyscale stimuli. We would also expect that adding <b>colour</b> <b>signals</b> to greyscale signals should change the way that those signals are processed. We have investigated these questions in behavioural and in physiological experiments. We find that male marmosets (all of which are dichromats) rapidly learn to distinguish between colour and greyscale copies of the same images. The discrimination transfers to new image pairs, to new colours and to image pairs in which the colour and greyscale images are spatially different. We find that, in a proportion of neurons recorded in the marmoset visual cortex, colour-shifts in opposite directions produce similar enhancements of the response to a luminance stimulus. We conclude that colour is, both behaviourally and physiologically, a distinctive property of images. ...|$|R

We paired males with both receptive and non-receptive females to test whether female response might affect male behavioural decisions. Males preferred the clear environment in all trials and this environment also resulted in males having the highest average visual contrast. Sexual behaviour was influenced by complex interactions between female receptivity, light environment, and male colour pattern contrast. Males spent significantly more time in the environment in which their <b>colour</b> <b>signal</b> had the highest contrast, but only when paired with receptive females.
