5|$|Final Fantasy Fables is a Final Fantasy spinoff {{starring}} a Chocobo in {{a setting}} which features common elements and <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. Music {{from the rest of}} the series is also reused. The game is composed of a number of minigames woven into a main adventure. The game was received positively by critics, who appreciated the originality and light-hearted nature of the title.|$|E
5|$|Spoo is {{a fictional}} {{foodstuff}} {{that served as}} a running joke within the Babylon 5 science fiction television series. In the series' fictional universe, spoo is made from worm-like <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same name and is generally regarded as the most delicious food in the galaxy; the creature itself, however, is regarded with contempt by most species. Despite appearing only in a few episodes, spoo was embraced by fans and became part of the series' extended mythology.|$|E
5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance. We {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E

5|$|The god Hermes {{is not in}} the game, but in the novel, he is {{responsible}} for informing Athena that Kratos is committing suicide. New characters include Coeus, the First Officer of Kratos' ship, and the two servants of Medusa: Jurr and a blind man. The twins encountered in the sex mini-game are revealed to be the daughters of Aphrodite named Zora and Lora. The book also explains how certain <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mythology that were slain by heroes are, apparently, still alive. For example, Zeus recollects that Hercules slew the Hydra, and Athena confirms this, but informs Zeus that the new Hydra is a newborn spawn of the Titans Typhon and Echidna, and was released by Ares.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Ranko brought {{together}} two popular fictional <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1930s; the giant ape King Kong, {{who had been}} introduced in the film King Kong (1933), and the Loch Ness Monster, a cryptid who was to have lived in Loch Ness. Gaston Leroux's character of Balaoo the gorilla, who had appeared in a 1911 book and a 1913 film, might also have been an influence on Ranko. The plot and themes of the story were also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 film The 39 Steps, itself an adaptation of John Buchan's 1915 adventure novel.|$|E
5|$|The spire can {{be divided}} into three sections. The lower section, which is the base, is formed of seven {{superimposed}} layers, each layer representing a level of heaven in accordance with the Traiphum Buddhist cosmology. The middle section is {{in the shape of a}} bell; however the roundness has been flattened to create a four sided shape. This represents the stupa in which the Buddha's ashes have been interred. The top section is similar to the top of chedis, depicting a tapered lotus bud or the crystal dew drop signifying the escape from the Saṃsāra or cycle of rebirths. The spire is supported by garudas on its four sides; as well as being the symbol of kingship, the garuda represents the mythical <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Himavanta forest surrounding Mount Meru.|$|E

50|$|<b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Night is a {{young adult}} novel by Kate Thompson. It was first {{published}} by Bodley Head on June 5, 2008. It was shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal and the 2008 Booktrust Teenage Prize.|$|R
5|$|The {{wreckage}} {{was found}} on 22November 1918 {{at a depth of}} , and was salvaged on 12August 1922. Investigations indicated that just one third of the cargo had been stowed in the hold, the rest unsecured on deck. The salvage operation turned into a bizarre public attraction; for example, a sewing machine from the steamer was smashed into pieces and sold for one crown each. It is estimated that about 20,000 people came to watch the raising of the ship, requiring the addition of trains from Norrköping. Newsreels featuring the raising of the ship were shown in cinemas all over Sweden. In order to finance the salvage operation, the Per Brahe was sent on a macabre tour throughout Sweden. The newspapers fed people's superstitions that the mythical <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forests had claimed Bauer by sinking the ship. The most common theme was connected to the tale Agneta och sjökungen (Agneta and the Sea King) from 1910 in which the Sea King lures a maiden into the depths. On 18August 1922, the Bauers were buried at the Östra cemetery in Jönköping (in quarter 04 plot number 06).|$|E

25|$|In 1892, Congress enacted {{an eight-hour}} day law which applied to {{contractors}} doing {{work on behalf}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal government.

25|$|The third {{treatise}} discusses war and peace, presenting through animal characters a moral about {{battle of}} wits being a strategic means to neutralize a vastly superior opponent's army. The thesis in this treatise {{is that a}} battle of wits is a more potent force than a battle of swords. The choice of animals embeds a metaphor of a war between good versus evil, and light versus darkness. Crows are good, weaker and smaller in number and are <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day (light), while owls are presented as evil, numerous and stronger <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night (darkness). The crow king listens to the witty and wise counsel of Ciramjivin, while the owl king ignore the counsel of Raktaksa. The good crows win.|$|E

He received one-quarter of the profits for both Lick It Up and Animalize although he had no involvement with either record.|$|E
2500|$|Critics, {{including}} Saddam's {{legal counsel}} Khalil al-Dulaimi, alleged that American officials had a heavy {{influence on the}} court.

50|$|A Tibicena, {{also known}} as Guacanchas, was a mythological <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guanches, prehispanic {{inhabitants}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canary Islands.

2500|$|Chandler's {{first book}} is titled The Explicit Gospel. The book was {{published}} by Crossway Books in 2012, and was written with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> Jared Wilson. RELEVANT Magazine explained that <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book was to clarify the gospel and its implications. The book {{is divided into three}} main sections: The Gospel on the Ground, The Gospel in the Air and Implications and Applications. His second book is titled <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Word: The Jesus-Centered Church, and was written with fellow Village pastor Josh Patterson and LifeWay Vice-President Eric Geiger. Published by B Publishing Group, the book is described in B's promotional materials this way: [...] "When the gospel is rightly declared and applied to God's people, the church becomes [...] "a <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Word." [...] She understands, embraces, and lives out <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> Christ's birth, life, death, and resurrection in more than her doctrinal statement. The gospel impacts all the church is and does." ...|$|R
25|$|Personality issues arose once again, and Vincent {{was fired}} {{following}} the Lick It Up tour, {{due in part}} to excessive guitar soloing at a 1984 concert in Quebec. He was replaced by Mark St. John (birth name Mark Norton). Vincent's work on <b>Creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Night was not officially recognized until the album was remastered in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The Sixth Key {{takes the}} form of a quill pen. It can be used to write {{extremely}} powerful spells that are capable of creating illusions and wiping out large numbers of the <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Incomparable Gardens, among other things. Saturday is also seen combining the power of the Key with ordinary sorcery. It gives dominion over the Upper House and Saturday.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Kiss {{made major}} changes to their {{business}} dealings– {{chief among them}} was severing ties with their manager of nine years, Bill Aucoin, and cutting back on their unwieldy organizational tree. Although Frehley had already {{decided to leave the}} band, he was pictured on the covers of 1982's Killers and <b>Creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Night, although he did not participate in the recording of either album.|$|E
25|$|By 1947, when Abba Lerner {{wrote his}} article Money as a <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State, economists had largely {{abandoned}} {{the idea that}} <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> money was closely linked to gold.

50|$|Although {{the mythical}} beings in the {{fountain}} are labeled as “centaurs” {{they are in}} fact “ichthyocentaurs". This is because <b>the</b> lower portion <b>of</b> their bodies are sea serpents rather than horses. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centaurs is portrayed in a struggle with some sort <b>of</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waters. They both are surrounded by playful sea urchins who stray water on them.|$|R
50|$|Bazhov also {{introduced}} numerous daughters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Snake, including Golden Hair from <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same name. The relationship {{between him and}} another folklore <b>creature,</b> <b>The</b> Mistress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Copper Mountain, is unclear. Bazhov noted that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people that he talked to seemed to know it. Bazhov believed that <b>the</b> most ancient <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ural mythology is the Azov Girl, the Snake appeared next, {{and the last one}} was the Mistress. It is further proved by the fact that Poloz is a zoomorphic being, as he probably comes from <b>the</b> era <b>of</b> totemistic beliefs.|$|R
25|$|Adam is {{the first}} human created by God. Though {{initially}} alone, Adam demands a mate from God. Considered God's prized creation, Adam, along with his wife, rules over all the <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world and resides in the Garden of Eden. He is more gregarious than Eve, and yearns for her company. His complete infatuation with Eve, while pure in and of itself, eventually contributes to his joining her in disobedience to God.|$|E
25|$|That the State {{ought to}} confine itself to what regards the State, or the <b>creatures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State, namely, the {{exterior}} establishment of its religion; its magistracy; its revenue; its military force by sea and land; the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat; in a word, to every {{thing that is}} truly and properly public, to the public peace, to the public safety, to the public order, to the public prosperity.|$|E
