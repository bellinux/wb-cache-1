50|$|An Injection molding machine, or (Injection {{moulding}} machine BrE), {{also known as}} an injection press, is a machine for manufacturing plastic products by the injection molding process. It consists of two main parts, an injection unit and a <b>clamping</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
50|$|An HSK {{connection}} {{depends on}} a combination of axial clamping forces and taper-shank interference. All these forces are generated and controlled by the mating components’ design parameters. The shank and spindle both must have precisely mating tapers and faces that are square to the taper’s axis. There are several HSK clamping methods. All use some mechanism to amplify the clamping action of equally spaced collet segments. When the toolholder is clamped into the spindle, the drawbar force produces a firm metal-to-metal contact between the shank and the ID of the <b>clamping</b> <b>unit.</b> An additional application of drawbar force positively locks the two elements together into a joint {{with a high level of}} radial and axial rigidity. As the collet segments rotate, the clamping mechanism gains centrifugal force. The HSK design actually harnesses centrifugal force to increase joint strength. Centrifugal force also causes the thin walls of the shank to deflect radially at a faster rate than the walls of the spindle. This contributes to a secure connection by guaranteeing strong contact between the shank and the spindle. The automotive and aerospace industries are the largest users of HSK toolholders. Another industry that is seeing increasing use is the mold and die industry.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a mini-robot {{based on}} {{parallel}} kinematic architecture is presented. It consists on a mobile platform, which can translate vertically along the axis normal {{to the base}} plane and rotates alternatively around the two other orthogonally axes. The structure has overall dimensions of few centimetres with promising applications in the optical field. As the miniaturisation increases, the requirement of high precision becomes {{one of the most}} critical point. For this aim, the application of Parallel Kinematic architecture at millimetre and sub-millimetre range offers new solutions, since they can achieve very high positioning accuracy and stiffness, also at high dynamics working conditions. Moreover, all types of architectures that have single plane motion drivers and that use constant length legs are particularly attractive for MEMS applications thanks their production feasibility based on IC-technologies [1] [2] [3]. Furthermore, characteristic limitations reducing their employment in industry, as the dimension of work space with respect to the total volume occupied by the device, become less important at small scale and can be avoided with appropriated design. The present work describes the design and development of the mini PKM. Firstly, different kinematics configurations were analysed and then the feasibility study of the robot - manufactured using silicon based technologies - was performed. These results are reported in previous publications [4] [5]. In particular, two interesting configurations were selected. The first one has 3 DoFs, the kinematic chain is P-R-S (Prismatic, Rotational, Spherical joints), and the legs are arranged symmetrically around the central platform in order to guarantee a better stress distribution. The second one has 2 DoFs, the kinematic chain is P-R-U (Universal joint) and the legs are arranged at T-shape in order to optimise the mobility of the mechanism with respect to the overall stiffness. Although the latter configuration doesn’t distribute stress equally and introduces a mutual constraint between the rotational DoFs, it offers other valuable advantages: such as a simple control system due to the decoupling of the rotations and an easier manufacture because of the intrinsic difficulty of realizing spherical joints at small scale. In this paper, the feasibility study of this second kinematic configuration at millimetre range will be explained more in details. The components have been re-designed in order to be manufactured by traditional precision machine tools, like turning, milling and drilling, thus the dimensions were scaled to millimetre range.

We present results on a relative cost analysis within a randomized noninferiority trial of EIMC comparing the AccuCirc device with Mogen clamp in Zimbabwe. Methods: Between January and June 2013, male infants who met inclusion criteria were randomized to EIMC through either AccuCirc or Mogen clamp conducted by a doctor, using a 2 : 1 allocation ratio. We evaluated the overall unit cost plus the key cost drivers of EIMC using both AccuCirc and Mogen clamp. Direct costs included consumable and nonconsumable supplies, device, personnel, associated staff training, and environmental costs. Indirect costs comprised capital and support personnel costs. In 1 -way sensitivity analyses, we assessed potential changes in unit costs due to variations in main parameters, one at a time, holding all other values constant. Results: The unit costs of EIMC using AccuCirc and Mogen clamp were $ 49. 53 and $ 55. 93, respectively. Key cost drivers were consumable supplies, capacity utilization, personnel costs, and device price. Unit prices {{are likely to be}} lowest at full capacity utilization and increase as capacity utilization decreases. Unit prices also fall with lower personnel salaries and increase with higher device prices. Conclusions: EIMC has a lower unit cost when using AccuCirc compared with Mogen <b>clamp.</b> To minimize <b>unit</b> costs, countries planning to scale-up EIMC using AccuCirc need to control costs of consumables and personnel.

A statistically designed test using Li-ion cells from various manufacturers began in September 2004 {{to study the}} effects of temperature, end-of-charge voltage, and depth-of-discharge operating conditions on the cycle life and performance of these cells. Performance degradation with cycling is being evaluated, and {{performance characteristics}} and failure modes are being modeled statistically. As technology improvements are incorporated into aerospace Li-ion cells, these new designs can be added to the test to evaluate the effect of the design changes on performance and life. Cells from Lithion and Saft have achieved over 2000 cycles under 10 different test condition combinations and are being evaluated. Cells from Mine Safety Appliances (MSA) and modules made up of commercial-off-the-shelf 18650 Li-ion cells connected in series/parallel combinations are scheduled to be added in the summer of 2005. The test conditions include temperatures of 10, 20, and 30 C, end-of-charge voltages of 3. 85, 3. 95, and 4. 05 V, and depth-of-discharges from 20 to 40 percent. The low-Earth-orbit regime consists of a 55 min charge, at a constant-current rate that is 110 percent of the current required to fully recharge the cells in 55 min until the charge voltage limit is reached, and then at a constant voltage for the remaining charge time. Cells are discharged for 35 min at the current required for their particular depth-of-discharge condition.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the microsystem technology field brings relevant technological breakthroughs and social benefits. It aims the developing of advanced systems whose operation normally combined {{two or more of}} the following properties: electrical, mechanical, optical, biological or others, integrated onto a monolithic or hybrid miniaturized structure. Thus, the technological trends of multifunctional integration and miniaturisation are the key points of this new discipline. This works deals with investigating the problematic in development, fabrication and reliability of microsystems with particular attention to complex devices. Specifically, the complex terms refers to the following: silicon based micro-systems containing advanced mechanical components and kinematic architecture enabling the accurate positioning of an end-effector; micro-systems constituted by several components requiring specific materials and 3 D variable shaping, and then assembled. Moreover, the present book aims to evaluate potentialities and manufacture feasibility of PKM (Parallel Kinematic Machine) at millimetre and sub-millimetre scale. In micro applications, two distinct technology solutions can be distinguished. At micro scale, silicon is the most common material as it combines unique electrical and mechanical properties suitable for accomplishing the based functional principles of a micro product. Moreover, the production capabilities of microelectronic foundry can be exploited as well as the batch characteristic for cost effective solutions. This approach leads to a monolithic system with nearly 2 D ½ layout and overall package of few mm 3. Among the main applications, there are accelerometers, pressure sensors and optical micro switching, which involve the oscillation and the deformation of simple mechanical elements as proof mass, beams and cantilever. The challenge here is to establish the production of complex mechanical components and kinematic architectures (as PKM) for the development of advanced mechanical systems. On the other hand, hybrid approach conceive the product as constitute by several parts assembled together, with the further issue of choosing the most appropriate material and production technologies for each component. As far as concerns the creating, the handling and the flexible assembly of 3 D micro sized components, hybrid solution is intrinsic a complex task and the scaling down of existing manufacturing and product principles reach their limits and lead to ineffective industrial solutions. In this context, the feasibility of complex hybrid ceramic and metal-based micro systems is deeply investigated. The present book comprises three principal parts. The first one introduces the microtechnology field. The benefits derived by the miniaturisation and the functional integration are illustrated. Moreover, the most significant factors involved in developing a micro product are illustrated. Furthermore, the most promising fabrication technologies, with particular attention to those that allow the developing of complex micro-devices and the problematic in scaling down the existing fabrication concepts are illustrated. Finally, micro assembly technologies are briefly reviewed. These topics take place in Chapter I. The second part more concerns the investigation of silicon-based solutions. In Chapter II, particular attention is paid to the industrial feasibility of complex micro devices. The study involves the following tasks: prototyping of a micro-hinge anchored to the substrate; development of a 1 DoF multi-body device with planar motion; feasibility study of a multi DoF compliance systems, based on PK architecture, enabling the out of plane positioning of an end-effector. Successively, Chapter III addresses the reliability study of micro electromechanical systems under cyclic loading. The study becomes even more urgent when complex compliance configurations are chosen. The development of an experimental set-up for performing the fatigue test is presented. Moreover, the Woehler parameters of the 15 m thick epitaxial polysilicon are defined. The activities are performed at the MEMS Business Unit of STMicroelectronics, currently the Italian leader company in producing silicon-based products and within the European MACROS (Modelling And Characterization for Reliability Of Silicon MEMS) project. The third part finally deals with potential and limitations in scaling down conventional processes to develop ceramic and metal based complex hybrid solutions. Chapter IV addresses the application of spark erosion processes for machining 3 D micro-components in ceramic composites. The production performance is investigated in details and the roughing–finishing technological parameters are defined. The activities are performed within the Power MEMS Belgian project at the Micro Precision Engineering (MPE) Research Group, Mechanical Engineering Department of the Catholic University of Leuven. The research input is given by the fabrication of micro turbines for fuel based micro power generators. Then, Chapter V deals with the manufacture feasibility using micro cutting processes of a 2 DoF micro mechanism based on parallel kinematic architecture and multi body configuration, with promising applications in the high precision positioning field. The activities are performed within the MEPROMEC project, -Development and industrial application of tools and methodology for the mechatronic design-, founded by the province of Trento, Italy, at the Institute of the Industrial Technologies and Automation of the National Research Council of Italy. The study highlights the critical issues in manufacturing and assembly complex hybrid microsystems, and points out the importance of developing properly <b>clamping</b> <b>units</b> and rough pieces based on Design for Production and Design for Assembly concepts in order to improve the machining accuracy, the handling tasks and the functional integration. Finally, in Chapter VI conclusions and future works are drawn. SOMMARIO	 1 SUMMERY	 3 CONTENTS	 5 CHAPTER I: MICROTECHNOLOGY: STATE OF THE ART. 	 9 1. DEFINITION OF MICROPRODUCT. 	 9 2.
