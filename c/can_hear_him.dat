5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{wondered}} by many readers if Garfield {{can actually be}} understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> However, it is mentioned {{in more than one}} strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield. However, in the feature film Garfield Gets Real and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans. In the 1 April (April Fools' Day) 1997 strip, Garfield, still with thought balloons, can be understood by Jon.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, Treatt {{was given}} the {{position}} of Challis lecturer in criminal law at the University of Sydney, a position he was to hold until 1959. One of his students was the future Justice of the High Court of Australia, Michael Kirby: [...] "I can still see Mr Vernon Treatt QC coming on to {{the stage of the}} Phillip Street Theatre where we took some of our lectures. Treatt's task was to instruct a hundred first year law students in that most important discipline, criminal law. I can see him toss his hat onto the chair, open his notes and begin reading his latest lesson. I <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> talking about the sections of the Crimes Act 1900 of New South Wales dealing with 'unnatural offences'. I can recall his rasping voice as he intoned the old provisions of section 79, spitting out the exceptionally ugly words of denunciation in the parliamentary prose". In March 1928, Treatt was appointed and served as a Crown Prosecutor for the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Court of Quarter sessions for the metropolitan district.|$|E

500|$|Concerning the {{recording}} of the album's opening song [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", producer DJ Premier later stated [...] "Nas — he's one of our saviors now. When we did ‘N.Y. State of Mind,’ at the beginning when he says, ‘Straight out the dungeons of rap / Where fake niggas don’t make it back,’ then you hear him say, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ ’cause he had just written it. He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesn’t know how he's going to format how he's going to convey it. So he's going, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [...] One, two, three. And then you <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> go, ‘Yo,’ and then he goes right into it." [...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and banging on the [...] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers…. And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And {{that was when he}} was up and coming, his first album. So we was like, 'Yo, this guy is gonna be big.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Reasonable Doubt {{has often}} been {{considered}} by many fans to be Jay-Z's best record. He himself deemed it his best. According to Birchmeier, it differed from his subsequent albums by lacking [...] "pop-crossover" [...] songs and hits. Shaheem Reid of MTV explained, [...] "Reasonable Doubt might not have the radio hits or club bangers {{of many of his}} other albums, but it may be Jay at his most lyrical—and certainly at his most honest, according to him". Huey said the lyrical appeal lied within Jay-Z's [...] "effortless, unaffected cool" [...] flow, [...] "disarming honesty", and knack for [...] "writing some of the most acrobatic rhymes heard in quite some time". According to Huey, this [...] "helped Reasonable Doubt rank as one of the finest albums of New York's hip-hop renaissance of the '90s". Birchmeier, on the other hand, believed the superior quality of producers was more responsible for the album's reputation as a classic more so than Jay-Z. In a retrospective review for MSN Music, Robert Christgau said the album was [...] "designed for the hip-hop cognoscenti and street aesthetes who still swear he never topped it," [...] finding it [...] "richer than any outsider could have known, and benefiting from everything we've since learned about the minor crack baron who put his money where his mouth was. You <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> marshalling a discipline known to few rappers and many crack barons, and that asceticism undercuts the intrinsic delight of his rhymes".|$|E
2500|$|During {{dangerous}} missions Yossarian always shouts at Aarfy {{to get out}} of the way so he can get to {{the escape}} hatch. Aarfy always replies that he can not hear him, infuriating Yossarian even more, and no matter how loud Yossarian shouts, Aarfy never <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> (except when he says [...] "never mind"). On one mission Yossarian gets so upset he punches Aarfy, but to no effect as his body fat absorbs all the blows. Yossarian's frustration with Aarfy is never vented and he always gives up, leaving Aarfy to carry on regardless.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007 he {{recorded}} {{a version of}} Hammerfall's [...] "The Fire Burns Forever", notable for his mic being down so low you <b>can</b> barely <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> Live videos of the event show him drowning out singer Joacim Can's during the first verse of the song before he microphone was turned down for the remainder.|$|R
5000|$|Narrator: No {{one knows}} who {{the voice of}} the narrator is or why we <b>can</b> even <b>hear</b> <b>him.</b> Is he the voice of God? History? Buddha? Or Brad Pitt?

2500|$|He {{would tell}} stories to {{children}} and spread The New Church gospel to the adults, receiving a floor to sleep on for the night, and sometimes supper, in return. [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> read now, {{just as he did}} that summer day, when we were busy quilting upstairs, and he lay near the door, his voice rising denunciatory and thrillin—strong and loud as the roar of wind and waves, then soft and soothing as the balmy airs that quivered the morning-glory leaves about his gray beard. His was a strange eloquence at times, and he was undoubtedly a man of genius," [...] reported a lady who knew him in his later years.|$|E

5000|$|Joachim Gasquet, {{a friend}} of the artist, later recalled: [...] On his last mornings he {{clarified}} this idea of death into a heap of bony brainpans to which the eyeholes added a bluish notion. I <b>can</b> still <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> reciting to me, one evening along the Arc River, the quatrain by Verlaine: :For in this lethargic world:Perpetually prey to old remorse:The only laughter to still make sense:Is that of death's heads.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the guitar}} parts, Beck used a Gibson Les Paul played through a Vox AC30 {{amplifier}} and Page played a Fender Electric XII twelve-string electric guitar.
