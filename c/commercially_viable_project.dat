40|$|This project {{evaluated}} the technical feasibility of converting {{energy from the}} wind with a novel “wind fin” approach. This patent-pending technology has three major components: (1) a mast, (2) a vertical, hinged wind structure or fin, and (3) a power takeoff system. The wing structure responds to the wind with an oscillating motion, generating power. The overall project goal {{was to determine the}} basic technical feasibility of the wind fin technology. Specific objectives were the following: (1) to determine the wind energy-conversion performance of the wind fin {{and the degree to which}} its performance could be enhanced through basic design improvements; (2) to determine how best to design the wind fin system to survive extreme winds; (3) to determine the cost-effectiveness of the best wind fin designs compared to state-of-the-art wind turbines; and (4) to develop conclusions about the overall technical feasibility of the wind fin system. Project work involved extensive computer modeling, wind-tunnel testing with small models, and testing of bench-scale models in a wind tunnel and outdoors in the wind. This project determined that the wind fin approach is technically feasible and likely to be <b>commercially</b> <b>viable.</b> <b>Project</b> results suggest that this new technology has the potential to harvest wind energy at approximately half the system cost of wind turbines in the 10 kW range. Overall, the project demonstrated that the wind fin technology has the potential to increase the economic viability of small wind-power generation. In addition, it has the potential to eliminate lethality to birds and bats, overcome public objections to the aesthetics of wind-power machines, and significantly expand wind-power’s contribution to the national energy supply...|$|E
40|$|The {{real estate}} and {{construction}} sectors are very important and {{integral part of the}} Malaysian economy. At a macro-level, governmental development plans in Malaysia are based on successive five year plans since 1956. For each of the five year plans, the {{real estate and}} construction sectors feature prominently in terms of value and policy implementation. The budget for the five year plans is in relation to public sector expenditure and does not include private sector initiatives. As regards real estate project delivery methods in Malaysia, the most common form is the traditional design-bid-build method. The design-build method is getting some acceptance of late, whereas infrastructure projects do adopt the build-operate-transfer method. This thesis seeks to classify, analyze and compare the various types of delivery methods and thereafter examine whether there is a methodology for selecting the best delivery method in Malaysia. Each delivery method, apart from actual project delivery itself, entails different apportionment of project risks between the owner and contractor. Choosing the right delivery method can lead to project success, whereas selecting the wrong delivery method invariably leads to project failure. (cont.) For the private sector in Malaysia, the owner can pretty much choose the most <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> <b>project</b> delivery method. However, for the public sector, there are political and policy considerations, and rules and regulations which may affect the choice of project delivery method. As a developing country, there is much that Malaysia can learn from the US and other developed countries which are more advanced and experienced in terms of project delivery methods, construction and engineering. by Yew Chin Tan.

The original vision was for member countries to promote trade {{as well as to}} demonstrate, through practical examples, how <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> <b>projects</b> can be implemented using the technology, experience and capital from the South. Regrettably, these dreams still remain unfulfilled. The experience gained by the developing countries after several years of bilateral interaction with the North underscores the idea that South-South trade should be symmetrical. However the most discernible pattern in the South-South relationship is still asymmetrical. A case in point is the Nigeria-China relations which appear to be in great disequilibrium and to China’s advantage. As the bilateral relations have progressed from cultural linkages to in-tense economic penetration of the Nigerian economy, observers of Nigeria’s international relations have become highly conscious of the reciprocal need to transform this intensive relationship into a mutually constructive one, that is towards the promotion of a more symmetrical relationship. This article, using dependency approach, demonstrates that these disparities actually account for the sharp differences in the outcomes of the bilateral trade and the level of development in the two countries.

40|$|Historically, {{the cost}} of {{generating}} electricity has been estimated by calculating a constant (over time) inflation-adjusted price of electricity at which the discounted revenue {{from the sale of}} electricity generated at a given plant, net of taxes, equals the discounted cost of building and operating the plant. That constant real price {{is referred to as the}} levelized cost, because the construction costs are spread over the operating life of the hypothetical plant. Specifically, utilities finance the up-front costs of construction and then repay lenders with revenue from the sale of electricity. Because of the large up-front costs incurred when a plant is built and the long operating life of most power plants, the rate at which costs and revenues are discounted is particularly salient when estimating the levelized cost. That rate is derived from the returns required by investors to finance construction, which depend on a project’s market risk. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) uses a levelized-cost model in which estimated costs and revenues are discounted on the basis of the rates of returns to debt and equity considered necessary to attract investment in <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> <b>projects.</b> A project’s costs and revenues are based on assumptions about future market conditions and technological developments that are often distinct to the underlying technology. CBO adopted most of its technical assumptions from data provided by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) after comparing those assumptions to other studies and adjusting the assumptions for its analysis. Incentives and carbon dioxide charges were incorporated into the model through various alterations to CBO’s reference scenario. Levelized-cost models for traditionally regulated utilities can be constructed by finding the price at which the discounted value of costs equals the discounted value of net revenues over the life of a power plant: Find p R real such tha...|$|R

Objectives: The aim {{of this article is to}} provide a holistic view of what the process entailed to leap from academic research to the commercialisation of the research into a company as was the case for Gradnet. Method: A case-study approach was used to document the conceptualisation and development of the research-based, spin-off company, Gradnet. This includes the background of the original research that formed the basis of the innovation process. Results: It was found that the commercialisation process of academic research is not necessarily a natural process for the researcher in the absence of an appropriate supporting infrastructure.

40|$|AbstractHigh quality {{infrastructure}} {{is a must}} for rapid economic development and requires sustained investment. It includes highways, railways, ports, bridges, hospitals, power plants, tunnels, and municipal facilities like sanitation, waste management, potable water supply, and other facilities serving public needs. Developing countries face shortage of government or public funds and are generally inadequate in addressing the infrastructural needs of the country. It is highly difficult and often impossible by governments in their own capacity to bring together all the infrastructure elements. This realization has brought together {{the public and the}} private sector in a mutually beneficial relationship in the form of Public Private Partnerships [PPPs]. PPPs are an effective tool for bringing private sector efficiencies in creation of economic and social infrastructure assets and for delivery of quality public services. PPP is seen as a financing mechanism for bridging the demand supply gap in terms of private capital and experience. Several schemes have therefore provided an increasingly popular vehicle to move towards infrastructure development. PPPs have become the preferred mode for construction and operation of <b>commercially</b> <b>viable</b> infrastructure <b>projects</b> in sectors such as highways, airports, ports, railways and urban transit systems.

The combined cooling and cathode air allows for a reduction in part count and hence a lower cost solution. However, efficient heat rejection challenges escalate as power and ambient temperature increase.
