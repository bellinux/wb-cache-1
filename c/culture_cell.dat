40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with morphological studies on tissue <b>culture</b> <b>cells</b> derived from a spontaneous mammary carcinoma and it's serially transplanted tumors of AKR mice. Four lines of tissue <b>culture</b> <b>cells</b> were obtained. A- 419 and A- 319 lines of cells {{were obtained from the}} fourth transplant generation of the tumor (adenocarcinoma), A- 600 line of cells were obtained from the 26 th transplant generation of the tumor (sarcomatous), and A- 162 line of cells were from the adenocarcinoma produced by back-transplantation of primary <b>culture</b> <b>cells</b> of A- 419 line cells to AKR mice. These four lines of tissue <b>culture</b> <b>cells</b> showed similar morphology and distribution, mixed growth of both epithelial cells and fibroblastic cells. Back-transplantation of primary <b>culture</b> <b>cells</b> of A- 419 and A- 319 lines to AKR mice produced adenocarcinomas, but A- 319 line cells of later passages (28 th, 29 th, 31 st, and 35 th passage) and A- 600 line cells produced sarcomas when transplanted back to AKR and C(3) Hf mice. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the sarcomatous transformation; 1) transformation of carcinoma cells to sarcoma cells and 2) malignant change of interstitial connective tissue cells during serial passages of the <b>culture</b> <b>cells.</b> The second mechanism was considered to be most probable in the present case...|$|R

50|$|DMF devices {{also can}} be used in cell cultures. Digital Microfluidic Immunocytochemistry in Single Cells (DISC) was {{developed}} using DMF platforms to culture and use antibodies to label phosphorylated proteins in the cell. Cultured cells are then removed and taken off chip for screening. Another technique synthesizes hydrogels within DMF platforms. The process uses electrodes to deliver reagents to produce the hydrogel, and then delivery of cell culture reagents for absorption into the gel. The hydrogels are an improvement over 2D cell culture because 3D cell culture have increased cell-cell interactions. Spherical cell cultures are another method developed around the ability of DMF to deliver droplets to cells. Application of an electric potential allows for automation of droplet transfer directly to the hanging cell <b>culture.</b> <b>Cell</b> culture in spheroids mimic in vivo tissues. Another use of DMF platforms in cell culture is its ability to conduct cell free in vitro through single molecule PCR inside droplets. PCR amplified products are then cultured within the cell by using a temperature gradient {{across the surface of the}} DMF platform.|$|E
40|$|We studied {{whether the}} peroxisomal proliferation, {{induction}} of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) and activation of cholesterol synthesis by gemfibrozil shown in whole body (Hashimoto F., Ishikawa T., Hamada S. and Hayashi H., Biochemical. Pharm., 49, 1213 - 1221 (1995)) is also detected at a <b>culture</b> <b>cell</b> level, {{and we made}} a comparative analysis {{of the effects of}} clofibric acid. Gemfibrozil at 0. 25 mM increased the activity of some peroxisomal enzymes (catalase and the cyanide-insensitive fatty acyl-CoA oxidizing system) after incubation for 72 h. However, contrary to whole body experiments, gemfibrozil decreased the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis from [14 C]acetate. At 1 mM, gemfibrozil decreased not only the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis, but also the protein conetnt of the cells and peroxisomal enzyme activity, indicating nonspecific inhibition at this concentration. Clofibric acid (0. 25 and 1 mM) increased the activity of peroxisomal enzymes, but decreased the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis. With respect to the direct effect on HMG-CoA reductase in the cell homogenate, gemfibrozil at 0. 25 mM did not affect the activity, but it clearly inhibited the activity at 2 mM and above. Clofibric acid at 2 mM hardly affected the activity, but it clearly decreased the activity at 5 mM and over. That is, gemfibrozil directly inhibited the activity more strongly than clofibric acid. The direct inhibition of the enzyme itself required higher concentrations of both agents than did inhibition at the <b>culture</b> <b>cell</b> level. These results suggest that the cytotoxicity of gemfibrozil is greater than that of clofibric acid, and that gemfibrozil, as well as clofibric acid, can induce peroxisomal enzymes in the <b>culture</b> <b>cell</b> level. In contrast to whole body results, gemfibrozil may suppress cholesterol synthesis from [14 C]acetate through the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase at the <b>culture</b> <b>cell</b> level. The decreases in the reductase activity caused by gemfibrozil and clofibric acid at the <b>culture</b> <b>cell</b> level may not be caused by the direct inhibition of the enzyme...|$|E

In addition, passaging primary MV patient isolates in B 95 - 8 cells selected variants that had alternate receptor usage compared to the original isolate.
