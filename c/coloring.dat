40|$|We {{present an}} {{interactive}} image enhancement technique {{to adjust the}} global <b>color</b> composition of an image by finding and replacing <b>color</b> gradients. We show how <b>color</b> gradient transformations can perform the basic operations of <b>color</b> editing. To recolor an image, the user designates a mapping of source <b>color</b> gradients to corresponding target <b>color</b> gradients. Each <b>color</b> gradient can be represented by a spherical parameterization, consisting of its midpoint <b>color,</b> contrast radius, as well as hue and luminance angles, {{in order to give}} the user separate and independent control over <b>color</b> shift, contrast adjustment, and <b>color</b> variation. <b>Color</b> gradients provide not only a flexible way of selecting <b>color</b> features but also a powerful way of manipulating image <b>colors,</b> as each mapping between a source and a target <b>color</b> gradient defines an affine <b>color</b> transformation. To determine the region of influence of each <b>color</b> mapping, perceptual similarity between <b>colors</b> is evaluated by applying Shepard's law of generalization to <b>color</b> differences. Through a feature-based warping approach, our <b>color</b> warping algorithm applies a continuous, nonlinear, volumetric deformation to the <b>color</b> space in order to approximate the requested <b>color</b> mappings. By making interactive <b>color</b> correction easier to control, our technique may prove useful in a variety of <b>color</b> image enhancement tasks in digital photography, video processing, and information visualization...|$|R
