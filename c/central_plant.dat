5|$|To {{help get}} the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters {{listed as a}} landmark, RMJM Hillier and Rohm and Haas focused renovations on opening up floor space and modernizing systems. A part of the {{original}} plan that altered the building's facade was abandoned, but the facade received a thorough cleaning. Inside, most of the enclosed office space was removed and replaced with open workstations. The new layout was also designed to let more light into the interior of the building. The work spaces also received new furniture, which replaced some that dated back to the 1960s. The dining area was moved from the basement to street level in a space that was previously occupied by a bank, but had lain vacant for several years. Security, telecommunications, and <b>central</b> <b>plant</b> systems were also upgraded and modernized. The interior renovations finished around May 2008, with improvements to the surrounding plaza completed several months later.|$|E

25|$|A {{network of}} tunnels runs between {{many of the}} major {{buildings}} on campus and the <b>Central</b> <b>Plant,</b> with the major trunk passage located beneath Ring Mall. Smaller tunnels branch off from this main passage to reach individual buildings, carrying electrical and air-conditioning utilities from the <b>Central</b> <b>Plant.</b> These tunnels {{have been the subject}} of much campus lore, the most popular story being that the tunnels were constructed to facilitate the safe evacuation of faculty in the event of a student riot. The main tunnel actually emerges above ground in the form of an unusually thick bridge near the Engineering Tower, in an area where Ring Mall crosses between two hills.|$|E

50|$|Capital {{markets have}} come to realize that right-sized resources, for {{individual}} customers, distribution substations, or microgrids, are able to offer important but little-known economic advantages over <b>central</b> <b>plants.</b> Smaller units offered greater economies from mass-production than big ones could gain through unit size. These increased value—due to improvements in financial risk, engineering flexibility, security, and environmental quality—of these resources can often more than offset their apparent cost disadvantages. DG, vis-à-vis <b>central</b> <b>plants,</b> must be justified on a life-cycle basis. Unfortunately, many of the direct, and virtually all of the indirect, benefits of DG are not captured within traditional utility cash-flow accounting.|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, {{the college}} was given its third $5,000 grant {{allocation}} by the Hobart Center for Foodservice Sustainability which cited Bates as [...] "having the best sustainability program among numerous entrants nationwide, which included K-12 schools and higher educational institutions, healthcare and hospitality facilities." [...] In 2010, the college was {{named one of}} 15 colleges in the United States to the [...] "Green Honor Roll", by Princeton Review. Bates currently mitigates 99% of emissions via electrical consumption and purchases all of its energy from Maine Renewable Resources. The college expended $1.1 million of its endowment to install lighting retrofits, occupancy sensors, motor system replacements and energy generating mechanisms. Select buildings at the college are open 24/7, thus requiring extra energy, due to this the college has implemented technology that places buildings on [...] "stand-by" [...] mode while minimum occupancy is attained to preserve energy. The practice is set to reduce the college's overall emissions levels by 5 to 10 percent. Overall, the academic buildings and residential halls are equipped with daylighting techniques, motion sensors, and efficient heating systems. Bates expended $1.5 million to implement a <b>central</b> <b>plant</b> that provides steam for heating for up to 80% of all on-campus establishments. The <b>central</b> <b>plant</b> {{is equipped with a}} modernized biomass systems and a miniature back-pressure steam turbine which reduces campus electricity consumption by 5%. The college also installed a $2.7 million 900kW hyper-roterized turbine that accounts for nearly one tenth of the campus' entire energy consumption. Bates was the first food-service operation in higher education to join the Green Restaurant Association. In 2013, the environmental practices of the college's dining services were placed along with Harvard University, and Northeastern University, as the best in the United States by the Green Restaurant Association; it earned three out of three stars, the only educational institution in Maine to do so.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, <b>central</b> <b>plants</b> {{have been}} an {{integral}} part of the electric grid, in which large generating facilities are specifically located either close to resources or otherwise located far from populated load centers. These, in turn, supply the traditional transmission and distribution (T&D) grid that distributes bulk power to load centers and from there to consumers. These were developed when the costs of transporting fuel and integrating generating technologies into populated areas far exceeded the cost of developing T&D facilities and tariffs. <b>Central</b> <b>plants</b> are usually designed to take advantage of available economies of scale in a site-specific manner, and are built as [...] "one-off," [...] custom projects.|$|R

40|$|Texas A&M University main {{campus in}} College Station {{consists}} of 114 buildings served by two <b>central</b> <b>plants.</b> The two main campus loops {{are more than}} 50 years old with a total piping length for each loop in excess of 13 miles. The main campus has long {{had a problem with}} thermal distribution to the 114 buildings served by the <b>central</b> <b>plants.</b> Pressure problems were encountered in the chilled water and hot water distribution system during peak demand periods. The differential pressure between supply and return headers at buildings far from the <b>central</b> <b>plants</b> was negative, in the middle area was neutral, and close to the plant was positive. Various modifications were performed over the years without completely solving this problem. Discovering the real cause could help improve the thermal distribution and help determine how to best operate the system. This paper presents the causes and recommendations for the correction of the thermal distribution problems, which include not only malfunctioning automatic building hydraulic controls, but also some building hydraulic configurations themselves. Based on the findings, the thermal distribution problems will be solved by repairing the controls and retrofitting building hydraulic configurations as needed...|$|R

[...] A <b>central</b> mix <b>plant</b> offers more accurate control of the concrete quality through better measurements {{of the amount of}} water added, but must be placed closer to the work site where the concrete will be used, since hydration begins at the plant.|$|R
