40|$|A waveguidevalve with a peak RF power {{handling}} capability of 70 MW and a reliable vacuum seal {{was needed for}} changing the new SLC klystrons. The original SLAC indium real valve experienced RF breakdown above 35 MW and {{did not make a}} reliable vacuum seal. A new design was developed which incorporates the old valve housing but employs a new concept. The indium-knife edge seal has been replaced by an O-ring seal mechanism, which is transported to an RF-free environment during high power operation. The O-ring “garage door ” seal RF currents are reduced to a manageable level through the use of an RF <b>choke</b> <b>plunger</b> which has a rejection capability in excess of 20 dB. The isolation between the high power RF and the O-ring chamber exceeds 100 dB. 1. Backgroun...|$|E
40|$|The {{calculation}} {{and experimental}} results for a magic tee with movable <b>choke</b> <b>plungers</b> in - and -arms for the tuning the coupling-factor and RF phase of high-power accelerating cavities are presented. The investigations {{were carried out}} at 2. 797 GHz and 1. 3 GHz. The so-called E-H tuner shall provide the possibility of independent adjustment of external Q-factor and RF phase for the TESLA cavity structures. The QEXT of the cavity structures must be tuneable {{in the range from}} 0. 9 * 106 to 9 * 106 to match the RF system under different beam conditions. For matching the waveguide power distribution system to cavities with different quench thresholds, adjustable directional couplers are necessary. A hybrid coupler with a coupling factor of 3. 0 dB and an adjustable range of ± 1 dB at more than 25 dB directivity was calculated. The adjustment elements of this coupler are variable <b>choke</b> <b>plungers</b> in two additional H-arms opposite the coupling-slot. ...|$|R
40|$|The simulations, {{manufacturing}} and experimental results for two devices of linear collider RF {{power distribution system}} are presented. One of these devices is magic tee with movable <b>choke</b> <b>plungers</b> in Е- and Н-arms for the tuning the coupling-factor and RF phase of high-power accelerating cavities. The QEXT of the cavity structures must be tuneable {{in the range from}} 0. 9 * 106 to 9 * 106 to match the RF system under different beam conditions. For matching the waveguide power distribution system to cavities with different quench thresholds, adjustable directional couplers are necessary. These directional couplers with a coupling factor of 3. 0 dB and 12. 5 dB with adjusting range of ± 1 dB and directivity better than 30 dB in were designed and produced. The adjustment elements of these couplers are movable membrane based plungers in two additional 900 -bended H-arms opposite the coupling slot. All devices were designed for operation at 1. 3 GHz and pulse power 1 - 5 MW...|$|R
