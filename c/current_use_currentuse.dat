The analytical results highlight different factors that influence {{the effectiveness of a}} <b>current</b> <b>use</b> program in delaying development. The results also underscore the difficulty a local government might have in influencing the behavior of the landowner.

Key Words: <b>current</b> <b>use</b> assessment, development penalties, land-use change, pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits, property taxation, use value During the 20 th century, state and municipal gov-ernments in the United States witnessed an ongoing conversion of agricultural land and other forms of open space to metropolitan uses. As Morris (1998) has noted, “Since 1957, every state has responded to development pressures by allowing or requiring preferential property tax treatment of farmland, and in some states other open space land. … [T]he most common policy assesses the land at its value in its current agricultural or open space use ” (p. 144). Such policies are known as <b>current</b> <b>use</b> (or use-value) assessment. With the sole exception of Mich-igan, every state employs some form of a <b>current</b> <b>use</b> assessment program. Because they are so wide-spread, we believe <b>current</b> <b>use</b> programs must be acknowledged in developing a theory that relates property taxation to land use patterns. This study focuses on the tax treatment of prop-erties that are first enrolled in and then later with-drawn from <b>current</b> <b>use</b> assessment. In 15 states, th...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{parenteral}} anticoagulants in <b>current</b> <b>use.</b> These agents {{can be divided into}} indirect anticoagulants whose activity is mediated by plasma cofactors and direct anticoagulants that do not require plasma cofactors to express their activity. The indirect parenteral anticoagulants in <b>current</b> <b>use</b> include heparin, low-molecular-weight-heparins (LMWHs), fondaparinux, and danaparoid. These drugs have little or no intrinsic anticoagulant activity, and exert their anticoagulant activity by potentiating antithrombin (AT), an endogenous inhibitor of var-ious activated clotting factors. The parenteral direct anticoagulants in <b>current</b> <b>use</b> all target thrombin. These agents include recombinant hirudins, bivaliru-din, and argatroban...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{studied the}} {{associations}} between 1) <b>current</b> <b>use</b> of oral contraceptives (OCs) and 2) glucose levels, insulin levels, and diabetes in young women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were women (n = 1, 940) in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective observational study of African-Americans and whites aged 18 - 30 years at enrollment in 1985 - 1986. We analyzed the cross-sectional associations between 1) <b>current</b> <b>use</b> of OCs and 2) fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and presence of diabetes using generalized estimating equations {{to adjust for}} repeated measures. We also examined the effect of <b>current</b> <b>use</b> of OCs on incident diabetes at year 10 of the study. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, <b>current</b> <b>use</b> was associated with lower fasting glucose levels [- 3. 1 mg/dl, 95 % CI (- 3. 7, - 2. 5) ] and reduction in the odds of diabetes [odds ratio 0. 56 (0. 32, 0. 97) ], but not lower fasting insulin levels [- 0. 01 microU/ml (- 0. 03, 0. 02) ], compared with nonuse in both African-American and white women. After adjustment for covariates, <b>current</b> <b>use</b> of OCs was still associated with lower fasting glucose levels [- 1. 8 mg/dl (- 2. 4, - 1. 3) ] and lower odds of diabetes [odds ratio 0. 56 (0. 33, 0. 95) ], although the associations were attenuated. After adjustment, <b>current</b> <b>use</b> of OCs was associated with higher insulin levels [0. 12 microU/ml (0. 006, 0. 23) ]. No association existed between pattern of use of OCs and incident diabetes at year 10, although {{the total number of}} new persons with diabetes at year 10 was small (n = 17). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Current</b> <b>use</b> of OCs is associated with lower glucose levels in young African-American and white women and may be associated with lower odds of diabetes...|$|R

The <b>current</b> <b>use</b> value is the typical selling price for property with an assumption that it will continue after the sale to be <b>used</b> in its <b>current</b> <b>use</b> rather than being converted to its highest and best use.
