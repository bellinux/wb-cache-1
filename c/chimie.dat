5|$|After the French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Louis Jacques Thénard, and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac {{approved}} the experiments {{of the young}} pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the Académie des Sciences and published in Annales de <b>Chimie</b> et Physique. In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from muride to brôme on the proposal of M. Anglada. Brôme (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench). Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name brôme for the characteristic smell of the vapors. Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in Stassfurt enabled its production as a by-product of potash.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{was elected}} to the National Academy of Sciences at age forty-eight {{and was one of the}} {{founding}} members of the National Academy of Engineering. He was also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In addition, he received over 100 patents, the Industrial Research Institute Medal in 1947, the American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal in 1948, the Missouri Award for Distinguished Service in Engineering in 1952, the Society of Chemical Industry's Perkin Medal in 1953, the American Chemical Society Priestley Medal in 1955, the Société de <b>Chimie</b> Industrielle (American Section) International Palladium Medal in 1963, the American Academy of Achievement Gold Plate Award in 1965, and the St. Louis Globe-Democrat Man of the Year award in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{started his}} {{experiments}} in 1857 and published his findings in 1858 (April issue of Comptes Rendus <b>Chimie,</b> Béchamp's paper appeared in January issue). Béchamp noted that Pasteur {{did not bring}} any novel idea or experiments. On the other hand, Béchamp was probably aware of Pasteur's 1857 preliminary works. With both scientists claiming priority on the discovery, a dispute, extending to several areas, lasted throughout their lives.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} natural {{products}} {{dates back to}} the early 19th century, when the foundations of organic chemistry were laid. Organic chemistry was regarded at that time as the chemistry of substances that plants and animals are composed of. It was a relatively complex form of chemistry and stood in stark contrast to inorganic chemistry, the principles of which had been established in 1789 by the Frenchman Antoine Lavoisier in his work Traité Élémentaire de <b>Chimie.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before {{entering}} Dutch politics, Bolkestein {{worked for}} the oil company Royal Dutch Shell from 1960 to 1975. During this period {{he was assigned to}} postings in East Africa, Honduras and El Salvador, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and France. In Paris, he served {{on the board of the}} Shell <b>Chimie</b> from 1973 to 1975. During his tenure with Shell, he completed the first part of the economics program at the London School of Economics in 1964 and he also completed a law degree at Leiden University, graduating in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Harley made {{observations}} {{while in}} Paris, which {{were recorded in}} the <b>Chimie</b> Anatomique of Charles Philippe Robin and François Verdeil. Among these were the recognition of iron as a constituent of urine, and the observation that the colour of normal human urine was due to urobilin. While at Heidelberg Harley studied in Robert Bunsen's laboratory the methods of gas analysis. After his return to England he made researches on the chemistry of respiration. Some of the results {{were published in the}} Philosophical Transactions. He read at the Leeds meeting of the British Association in 1858 a paper in which he showed that pancreatin was capable of digesting both starchy and albuminous substances. In 1862 he received the triennial prize of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for his researches into the anatomy and physiology of the suprarenal bodies.|$|E
25|$|Denis Wirtz {{was born}} in the Ixelles {{municipality}} of Brussels, Belgium. He is fluent in English and French, and became a U.S. citizen in 2007. Wirtz earned a Physics Engineering degree at the Ecole Polytechnique of the Université libre de Bruxelles in 1988. With a Hoover Fellowship from the Belgian American Educational Foundation (BAEF), he earned an M.S. and Ph.D in Chemical Engineering from Stanford University, working under the guidance of Gerald G. Fuller in polymer physics. He was then granted a fellowship through the European Union’s Human Capital and Mobility program to conduct postdoctoral research with 1991 Nobel Laureate in Physics Pierre-Gilles de Gennes at the Ecole Supérieure de Physique et <b>Chimie</b> Industrielles (ESPCI) in Paris, France. He joined the faculty of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in 1994 and was promoted to the rank of full professor in 2003. In 2009, he was selected to be the Theophilus Halley Smoot Professor of Engineering Science by President Ronald J. Daniels and the Board of Trustees, with secondary appointments in the departments of Materials Science and Engineering, , where he collaborates with fellow researchers in the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier {{employed}} the new nomenclature in his Traité élémentaire de <b>chimie</b> (Elementary Treatise on Chemistry), published in 1789. This work represents {{the synthesis of}} Lavoisier's contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern textbook on the subject. The core of the work was the oxygen theory, and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement {{of the law of}} conservation of mass, and denied the existence of phlogiston. This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and presented Lavoisier's theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. It remains a classic in the history of science. While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier's new ideas, demand for Traité élémentaire as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication. In any event, the Traité élémentaire was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation.|$|E
25|$|His first {{practical}} application was to heat water for his revolving engine. He observed that passing steam over burning coal or tar caused the flames to burn brighter and without smoke, and he theorized that the steam was decomposed in this process. Word of these experiments reached the eminent French chemist Gay-Lussac, and he commented {{on them in}} Annales de <b>Chimie</b> et de Physique in 1819. He contended that the temperature was insufficient to cause decomposition. Instead, the steam freed more flammable vapors in the fuel causing the flame's change. Morey was correct. He produced what {{is now known as}} town gas. The oxygen from the water combines with carbon from the fuel to form carbon monoxide and the hydrogen forms a diatomic molecule. Both later burn to form water and carbon dioxide. Morey was not the first to use water-gas for lighting, and his devices, including the patented 1818 American Water Burner, simply used the gas immediately instead of piping it to be burnt elsewhere, done as early as 1792 in England. Morey apparently did not know of this advance or at least did not recognize it as the same process. Strangely, in 1819 J. F. Dana of Dartmouth and Harvard proposed attaching steam boilers to street lamps to take advantage of Morey's discovery, but water-gas was already being piped to some London street lamps from a central source in 1812. Still, Morey's device did produce more light, and there is evidence that it resulted in more efficient combustion.|$|E

500|$|By 1789, when Lavoisier {{published}} his Traité Élémentaire de <b>Chimie</b> and founded the Annales de <b>Chimie,</b> the new chemistry {{had come into}} its own. Priestley published several more scientific papers in Birmingham, the majority attempting to refute Lavoisier. Priestley and other Lunar Society members argued that the new French system was too expensive, too difficult to test, and unnecessarily complex. Priestley in particular rejected its [...] "establishment" [...] aura. In the end, Lavoisier's view prevailed: his new chemistry introduced many of the principles on which modern chemistry is founded.|$|E

Pierre was an instructor at the School of Physics and Chemistry, the École supérieure de physique et de <b>chimie</b> industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI). They were introduced by the Polish physicist, Professor Józef Wierusz-Kowalski, who had learned that Marie was looking for a larger laboratory space, something that Wierusz-Kowalski thought Pierre had access to. Though Pierre did not have a large laboratory, he was able to find some space for Marie where she was able to begin work.|$|E

2500|$|The term radical {{was already}} in use when the now {{obsolete}} radical theory was developed. Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau introduced the phrase [...] "radical" [...] in 1785 and the phrase was employed by Antoine Lavoisier in 1789 in his Traité Élémentaire de <b>Chimie.</b> A radical was then identified as the root base of certain acids (the Latin word [...] "radix" [...] meaning [...] "root"). Historically, the term radical in radical theory was also used for bound parts of the molecule, especially when they remain unchanged in reactions. These are now called functional groups. For example, methyl alcohol was described as consisting of a methyl [...] "radical" [...] and a hydroxyl [...] "radical". Neither are radicals in the modern chemical sense, as they are permanently bound to each other, and have no unpaired, reactive electrons; however, they can be observed as radicals in mass spectrometry when broken apart by irradiation with energetic electrons.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{changes in}} {{periodicals}} {{occurred during the}} course of the Enlightenment. First, they increased in number and size. There was also a move away from publishing in Latin in favour of publishing in the vernacular. Experimental descriptions became more detailed and began to be accompanied by reviews. [...] In the late 18th century, a second change occurred when a new breed of periodical began to publish monthly about new developments and experiments in the scientific community. The first of this kind of journal was François Rozier's Observations sur la physiques, sur l’histoire naturelle et sur les arts, commonly referred to as [...] "Rozier’s journal", which was first published in 1772. The journal allowed new scientific developments to be published relatively quickly compared to annuals and quarterlies. A third important change was the specialization seen in the new development of disciplinary journals. With a wider audience and ever increasing publication material, specialized journals such as Curtis’ Botanical Magazine (1787) and the Annals de <b>Chimie</b> (1789) reflect the growing division between scientific disciplines in the Enlightenment era.|$|E
