5|$|It {{was during}} this period that Cleveland began a {{relationship}} with a widow, Maria Crofts Halpin, and later assumed responsibility for supporting her and a child born at the time. The matter became a <b>campaign</b> <b>issue</b> for the GOP in his first presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when he ran}} for {{governor}} in 1826, Edwards {{had the good fortune to}} enter a three-way race that split the Jacksonians between state Senator Thomas Sloo and Lieutenant Governor Adolphus Hubbard. As a <b>campaign</b> <b>issue,</b> Edwards focused on Illinois' dire financial situation, blaming Sloo and Hubbard and other legislators for it. Edwards won 49.5percent of the vote to Sloo's 46percent, with the rest going to Hubbard.|$|E

5|$|Although the Kentucky Constitution {{prohibited}} governors {{from serving}} consecutive terms, Beckham {{announced he would}} seek a full term as governor in 1903. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and was eligible to run. Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non-controversial reforms, he had no significant opposition in winning his party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of any significant <b>campaign</b> <b>issue</b> in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates.|$|E
5|$|By mid-March, a {{provision}} in the stimulus package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant AIG and other TARP recipients became a <b>campaign</b> <b>issue.</b> Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the outrage over the AIG bonuses to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded by insisting that the stimulus package was necessary for job creation.|$|E
5|$|Beshear faced heavy {{deficits in}} polls against McConnell {{throughout}} {{the general election}} campaign. McConnell also raised twice {{as much money as}} Beshear during the campaign. Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a <b>campaign</b> <b>issue,</b> claiming much of the money came from political action committees that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, had voted to cut Medicare; McConnell responded that Republicans had not cut Medicare, but had put forward a plan to curb its growth, a plan that didn't differ significantly, McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, {{district}} court judge Ricardo Rodriguez campaigned to unseat Guerra as district attorney, and the Garza case arose as a <b>campaign</b> <b>issue.</b> Rodriguez said that he wanted justice for the Garza family. He {{said that he would}} take a new look at Garza's case if he were elected. Rodriguez won the election. In the days after the vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a special prosecutor in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred to take a new look at the evidence once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was open again. Without mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E
5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major <b>campaign</b> <b>issue.</b> The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The presidential race was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E
5|$|The primary <b>campaign</b> <b>issue</b> was {{the ongoing}} Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the {{hand-picked}} candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted the state's reputation for violence to end even if it meant siding with the tobacco industry against the state's farmers.|$|E

25|$|Latinos {{forced out}} from other near {{downtown}} and lakefront areas by urban renewal settled {{close to the}} border with Lakeview at Sheridan, near Irving Park. In 1975 Young Lords founder Jose (Cha-Cha) Jimenez joined with a broad coalition of whites, blacks and Latinos and ran unsuccessfully against Daley-sponsored Christopher Cohen. They still were able to garner 39% of the vote. His main <b>campaign</b> <b>issue</b> was housing corruption, which was then displacing Latinos and the poor from prime real estate areas of Chicago.|$|E
25|$|After President Kennedy was assassinated, Stevenson {{continued}} {{to serve in}} his position as Ambassador to the UN under President Lyndon Johnson. As the country moved toward the 1964 presidential election, the war in Vietnam became an important <b>campaign</b> <b>issue.</b> The Republican presidential candidate, Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, advocated victory in Vietnam—a rollback strategy that Johnson denounced as tantamount to nuclear war. Stevenson was not a major player on the Vietnam issue. He did support Johnson publicly and in private because he believed in the containment of communism, but he also wanted to start negotiations with North Vietnam through the United Nations, which Johnson rejected.|$|E
25|$|As a Roosevelt {{supporter}} and {{a delegate}} from the District of Columbia, {{he served as}} one of nine members on the Platform Committee of the 1932 Democratic National Convention and authored the original draft of the platform. Time magazine later credited him with the platform's opposition to forgiving the debts of America's allies in World War I and its promise to reduce government expenditures by 25%. Palmer said that the savings could be devoted to programs to relieve unemployment. With the repeal of prohibition a major <b>campaign</b> <b>issue,</b> Palmer used his expertise as the Attorney General who first enforced Prohibition to promote a plan to expedite its repeal through state conventions rather than the state legislatures.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{election}} of 1844, Whig candidate Henry Clay and the presumed Democratic candidate, former President Van Buren, both declared themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas, each hoping to keep the troublesome topic from becoming a <b>campaign</b> <b>issue.</b> This unexpectedly led to Van Buren being dropped by the Democrats in favor of Polk, who favored annexation. Polk tied the Texas annexation question with the Oregon dispute, thus providing a sort of regional compromise on expansion. (Expansionists in the North were more inclined to promote the occupation of Oregon, while Southern expansionists focused primarily on the annexation of Texas.) Although elected by a very slim margin, Polk proceeded as if his victory had been a mandate for expansion.|$|E
25|$|An early January 1999 {{poll showed}} Giuliani {{trailing}} Clinton by 10 points. In April 1999, Giuliani formed an exploratory committee {{in connection with}} the Senate run. By January 2000, Giuliani had reversed the polls situation, pulling nine points ahead after taking advantage of several campaign stumbles by Clinton. Nevertheless, the Giuliani campaign was showing some structural weaknesses; so closely identified with New York City, he had somewhat limited appeal to normally Republican voters in Upstate New York. The New York Police Department's fatal shooting of Patrick Dorismond in March 2000 inflamed Giuliani's already strained relations with the city's minority communities, and Clinton seized on it as a major <b>campaign</b> <b>issue.</b> By April 2000, reports showed Clinton gaining upstate and generally outworking Giuliani, who stated that his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more. Clinton was now 8 to 10 points ahead of Giuliani in the polls.|$|E
25|$|As the Constitutional Convention {{concluded}} {{its work}} on the amendment, some politicians announced plans to make the November 2004 elections a referendum on same-sex marriage. In Vermont following the enactment of civil unions legislation in 2000, {{a large group of}} its supporters had been defeated. One political action committee announced plans to target legislative candidates who supported same-sex marriage, eight Republicans and two independents. Ronald Crews of the Massachusetts Family Institute estimated a possible shift of 10 to 15 seats against same-sex marriage. The elections resulted in shifts that consistently favored supporters of same-sex marriage rights. Carl Sciortino, a gay activist and first-time candidate, drew support from supporters of same-sex marriage, but ran largely on traditional issues like education, taxation, and health-care, and narrowly defeated a 16-year veteran and same-sex marriage opponent in the Democratic primary on September 14. Later that month, Speaker of the House Finneran resigned from the legislature to be replaced by Sal DiMasi, who backed same-sex marriage. Some candidates who backed a constitutional amendment did not make same-sex marriage a <b>campaign</b> <b>issue</b> as anticipated, but it proved critical in a few races. All 50 incumbents who opposed a constitutional amendment and faced challengers won re-election. Four supporters of Goodridge retired and successors with similar views replaced them. Five opponents of Goodridge retired and three of their successors were supporters of same-sex marriage. In special elections in the spring of 2005, three incumbents who supported a constitutional amendment lost to supporters of same-sex marriage.|$|E
