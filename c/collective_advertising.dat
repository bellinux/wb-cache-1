5000|$|The various {{advertisements}} heard throughout Southern California {{radio is}} perhaps the most widespread example of the Auto Square's <b>collective</b> <b>advertising.</b> Although no one dealership receives extra air time, the advertisements generally proclaim the low prices, sales, and reputation of the auto mall as the highest volume dealer. The popular jingles, [...] "Take the 605 to South Street, come on, it's all there! Take the 605 to South Street, Cerritos Auto Square!" [...] (Sung to the tune of The Orlons [...] "South Street") or [...] "We sell more, so you save more, Cerritos...Auto Square!" [...] are ubiquitous and are good examples of effective advertising strategies using simple, easy-to-remember lyrics.|$|E
40|$|A {{relative}} increase {{in demand for}} quality can have one of two potentially countervailing effects: it can cause substitution of one quality for another and/or it might expand overall demand by bringing new consumers into the market. This article investigates demand expansion and substitution among beef qualities by exploiting {{the use of a}} no-purchase option in a nonhypothetical choice experiment involving real food and real money. A random parameters logit model, which permits very flexible substitution patterns, is used to show that expanding demand for high quality rib-eye steak increases revenue by a greater degree than expanding demand for low quality steak. Regardless of whether high or low quality demand is expanded, the expansion effect dominates the substitution effect. We also show that the introduction of a new "natural" steak causes a greater reduction in market share for high quality than low quality beef, but despite this overall steak demand increases. These results have important implications for the manner in which <b>collective</b> <b>advertising</b> is conducted and for the effects of new product introductions on industry profitability.

40|$|Classification JEL : M 37, Q 13, Q 18 The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose an {{interpretation}} of advertising strategies in the French wine sector. Several public reports reveal the weakness of promotional investments by the French wine producers. This situation can be explained by two strategic motivations. First, the structure of the French wine industry is mainly composed of numerous little producers. Stakeholders of small scale cannot a fford to develop strong brand names. This contrasts with the industry of Californian or Australian wines, which are supported by important promotional budgets. Secondly, the multitude of collective label (e. g Protected Designations of Origin, AOC in France) raises the risk of free riding and the possibility of externalities (advertising spillover) of individual strategies. So French fi rms are encouraged to join their investments and to develop <b>collective</b> <b>advertising.</b> These generic promotions are mainly done by collective marketing orders, called "interprofessions" in France. For several authors, the generic aspect makes necessary the cooperation between actors and justifi es the mandatory programs. Our study underlines a second e ect where the individual investments in advertising allow the development of the sector overall in spite of the presence of externalities. A process of cooperation is not thus an indispensable condition...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the role for <b>collective</b> action in <b>advertising</b> investments needed to compete on foreign markets and/or to enter into new markets. We model the choices facing producers in regions where both AO (high quality) and table (low quality) wines are produced. By joining forces with producers of other regions to invest in advertising, producers may penetrate into new markets. We show that entering new markets may be profitable according to the relative size of the markets, the fixed costs of advertising, and the market situation in the internal and new markets. We discuss the policy implications of the results, arguing about possibile modifications of the AO system to facilitate collective action and improve investment levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{advertising}} {{industry is}} often seen as adaptable and flexible, and its work organization and diverse project ecologies are assumed to nurture creativity, learning and innovation. The advertising industry in Oslo is currently going through a restructuring process of adapting to the Internet as an emerging media channel for marketing, but struggles to benefit from collective learning. The established advertising agencies have been reluctant regarding the new opportunities in Internet-based advertising, which has allowed {{for a set of}} smaller and specialized web agencies to emerge, and who now possess the best skills within interactive advertising. The paper argues that there are two parallel epistemic communities in the localized advertising industry. It is shown that the advertising industry seems to have been caught in a path-dependent technological trajectory, and that in order for collective learning to unfold geographical proximity needs to be supplemented by cultural and epistemic proximity and compatibility. <b>Advertising,</b> <b>collective</b> learning, epistemic communities, Internet, knowledge, path dependency,...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} analyses the web {{sites of the}} most famous Italian political parties on two important occasions: during the campaign for the regional elections on April 2000 and for the political elections on May 2001. The focus is on the discursive strategies adopted by the parties to describe both themselves and the political competitors with particular reference to the linguistic bias model (LIB) elaborated by Maass, Salvi, Arcuri & Semin (1989). The results of critical textual analysis (van Dijk, 1993; 1998; Fairclough, 1993; Fairclough & Wodak, 1997) suggest that the web pages of Italian parties match self and <b>collective</b> narrative to <b>advertising</b> style. Despite the use of a common and simplistic ‘wooden language’ (Slama Cazacu, 1997) all the parties make explicit reference to the other parties, trying to display the best possible image of the self and the worst of the others, using specific linguistic indices as foreseen by the LIB model...|$|R

In 2006 Jane Fonda supported her in the party's campaign prior to the 2006 election. Feminist Initiative received only approximately 0.7% of the votes, compared to the 4% threshold required for parliamentary representation. In the 2009 European parliament elections, the party received 2.22% of the vote. In the summer of 2010 - {{leading up to the}} 2010 election - Schyman burned 100,000 Swedish krona in a protest against unequal pay in Sweden. The stunt, staged by <b>advertising</b> <b>collective</b> Studio Total, gave Feminist Initiative widespread attention, but in the election, the party received only 0.4% of the votes. In the 2014 European Parliament election proved to be the party's most successful election so far, as the party attracted 5.3% of the national vote in Sweden, with Soraya Post taking one seat as an MEP. In the 2014 general election, Fi received a best-ever 3.1% of the vote; despite not meeting the 4.0% threshold for getting seats, Fi became the most popular party outside of parliament.|$|R
40|$|The elderly {{population}} has increased considerably {{in recent years}} and it is estimated that by 2050 32 % of the Spanish population will be older persons. This group is underrepresented in the media and does not attract much research interest. To put this right, we present an analysis of the representation of older persons in advertisements appearing in magazines aimed directly or indirectly at seniors in Spain. A content analysis estimated the frequency of appearance of the images and words that represent the elderly, and a discourse analysis enabled this study to investigate the presence of stereotypes and discourse relations between advertising and theories of ageing. The results show that the older people who appear in the ads are mostly men portrayed as consumers of entertainment products who are {{at the beginning of their}} period of old age. A marked gender stereotype is observed. The differentiation between the institutional and commercial advertising discourse is also clear. The study analyses such advertising over three decades, covering the period in which the age distribution of the population has been inverted in Spain. Throughout this period, the frequency of appearance has been very low. Older persons are clearly an invisible <b>collective</b> in magazine <b>advertising...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{advertising}} productivity of a collective brand strategy vs a non-collective brand strategy, as well as the moderating role of company characteristics (age of the company, individual brand reputation and degree of competition that the company faces). The main hypothesis is that a collective brand has a positive influence on the advertising productivity of its member companies, as it is a collective reputation indicator in experience goods. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology is based on the application of regression models with panel data of companies in a Spanish experience goods industry between 2004 and 2012. The empirical analysis is made in the Spanish winery sector, given the proliferation in the wine market of public collective brands (i. e. protected designation of origin labels). Findings – The results show that a company associated with a collective brand has greater advertising productivity than a non-associated company. Advertising productivity is also higher for brands with better individual reputations associated with a collective brand. Moreover, the relative effect of a <b>collective</b> brand on <b>advertising</b> productivity is higher when the company competes in a market with a higher level of competition. Originality/value – The literature has paid little attention to the relationship between collective brand strategy and the advertising productivity of member companies. This study considers that the advertising productivity of companies in collective brands could be explained by the effects derived from the collective brand reputation...|$|R
40|$|The postreligious {{space of}} Douglas Coupland's fiction {{provides}} {{the backdrop for}} a disenchanted consumer <b>collective</b> nursed on <b>advertising</b> slogans rather than Sunday school parables. This thesis seeks to examine {{the ways in which}} Coupland resacralizes the currently secular concepts of epiphany and apocalypse in order to reinvest the lives of his suburbanite protagonists with a sense of wonder and the desire for transcendence. Coupland's fictional subjects represent a collection of fragmented subcultures that are dissatisfied with the bypassing of the "real" for a diet of shiny, happy, yet artificial, products. As their only collective reference points are media generated, the television and mall have become sanctuaries that inscribe a virtual grand narrative that provide {{little in the way of}} religious support. The subjects of Coupland's fiction move beyond what Jameson describes as the "waning of affect" in a depthless, zombie culture as they shun irony, cynicism and passivity to experience what Coupland deems "moments of transcendence and epiphany". This thesis also seeks to place Coupland in context alongside five other postmodern authors in order to contrast Coupland's subjects' desire for reenchantment with the often apathetic, "blank" inhabits of the depthless spiritual landscapes of fiction by Brett Easton Ellis, Jay McInerney, Don Delillo, Martin Amis and Chuck Palahniuk. The thesis is divided into two sections: epiphany and apocalypse, with three chapters in each section. The first chapter focuses on how the epiphany's metaphysical and ideological presuppositions are problematic for postmodern fiction. Both the Christian and the modernist epiphany are largely absent in postmodern fiction, yet Coupland frequently uses the epiphany, investing it with ideas from both traditions, yet rewriting it for a postmodern context. The second chapter is the discussion of three quasi-initiation stories, Ellis's Less Than Zero, McInerney's Bright Lights, Big City and Coupland's Shampoo Planet. This serves as a contrast between Coupland's use of epiphany as postreligious sacred experience, McInerney's problematic attempts to place an epiphany in a postmodern context, and the complete absence of epiphany in Ellis's work. Chapter Three is a discussion of the progression from momentary, singular epiphanies in Coupland's Generation X to the extended epiphany, or conversion narratives, of Life After God and Hey Nostradamus! This chapter also investigates Coupland's problematic relationship with postmodem "knee jerk" irony and how it must diminish if the epiphany is to manifest itself in the lives of his protagonists. Chapter Four offers a discussion of the postmodem concept of apocalypse as nihilistic end-time fear, with a specific focus on Don Delillo's White Noise, contrasting it with the Judeo-Biblical notion of apocalypse as a redemptive, hopeful structure that reveals truth and unlocks transcendence. Chapter Five discusses. Coupland's engagement with both ideas of apocalypse, but emphasizes his privileging of the supernatural, purposeful nature of the cleansing Judeo-Christian visions of apocalypse. This chapter explores the saviour/destroyer technology of Coupland's Microserfis and the futuristic apocalyptic visions of Eleanor Rigby. The last chapter is a discussion of Martin Amis's London Fields, Chuck Palahniuk's Survivor and Coupland's Girlfriend in a Coma. All three apocalyptic novels have a female prophetess that predicts the doom, destruction and apathy of the future, yet Girýfriend in a Coma is the only narrative to envision a surpassing of the "filture" for a glimpse of "eternity" itself, invested with hope and redemption.
