5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally {{has no effect on}} platelet function).|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E

5|$|The {{mammalian}} {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows {{in the correct}} direction through the heart (preventing backflow).

Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but {{toward the end of the}} ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle.

MethodsOf 303 consecutive patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass grafting with 3 -vessel coronary disease and a dominant right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> tributary of an infarcted nonischemic territory, 154 were randomized to right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> revascularization and 149 to no right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting. In all cases, standard on-pump surgical myocardial revascularization was performed. ResultsOverall hospital mortality was 2 of 154 versus 1 of 149 (P =. 97); no difference in in-hospital outcome was observed between the 2 groups. At follow-up, cardiac event–free survival was 84 of 152 in the right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting series and 62 of 148 in the non–right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting group (P =. 20). However, when the analysis was limited to surviving patients without new scintigraphic evidence of ischemia (to avoid confounding factors derived from ischemia in the left coronary system or right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> graft malfunction), we found that patients who received a right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> graft had fewer cardiac events, a lower incidence of arrhythmia, and less left ventricular dilatation than did the non–right <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> revascularized series.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia is {{characterized}} as the dilation of {{a segment of}} <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> at least 1. 5 times the adjacent segment in which inflammation, neurohormonal activity and atherosclerosis are {{held responsible for the}} pathogenesis. The association between the <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia and inflammatory markers has been shown, however there is nodata related to Pentraxine 3 (PTX- 3). In this study, we investigated the association between serum PTX- 3 and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia. Patients and Methods: The study population consisted of 66 patients who underwent coronary angiography with the suspicion of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and 32 controls. Patients were divided in two groups as the <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia group (n= 34) and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease group (n= 32). PTX- 3 and hs-CRP levels were measured. Results: Serum PTX- 3 levels were comparable between <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia groups (0. 67 ± 0. 29 vs. 0. 66 ± 0. 34, p= 0. 63), <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia groups had significantly increased PTX- 3 levels when compared to the control group (0. 67 ± 0. 29 vs. 0. 32 ± 0. 24, p< 0. 001; 0. 66 ± 0. 34 vs. 0. 32 ± 0. 24, p< 0. 001; respectively). Similarly, hs-CRP levels were comparable in <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia groups (1. 4 ± 0. 7 vs. 1. 2 ± 0. 5, p= 0. 19), coronary artrey disease and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> ectasia groups had significantly increased hs-CRP levels when compared to the control group (1. 4 ± 0. 7 vs. 0. 8 ± 0. 5, p< 0. 001; 1. 2 ± 0. 5 vs. 0. 8 ± 0. 5, p< 0. 001 respectively). The correlation analysis revealed that serum PTX- 3 was associated with hs-CRP (Rho= 0. 24, p= 0. 016).

40|$|BackgroundPatients on {{dialysis}} sustain {{at least}} a threefold higher in-hospital mortality rate and markedly higher long-term mortality following <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass graft surgery than the general population. Smaller {{studies have suggested that}} dialysis patients have superior outcomes with off-pump compared with on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery. MethodsFrom the United States Renal Data System database, 13, 085 patients on dialysis having first <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery between 2001 and 2006 were identified. Of these, 2335 (17. 8 %) had off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival of patients having off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass and patients having on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess effects of off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass on mortality with adjustment for baseline patient characteristics. ResultsOff-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery was associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared with on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery (hazard ratio 0. 92, 95 % confidence interval 0. 86 – 0. 99, P = . 02). The observed survival benefit was most notable in the first year after surgery (70. 3 % vs 68. 7 %) and was lost 2 years after surgery (55. 4 % vs 55. 2 %). No difference was noted in the in-hospital mortality rate with off-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery versus on-pump <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass surgery (9. 7 % vs 11. 0 %, P =. 06).
