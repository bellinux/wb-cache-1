40|$|Today&# 039;s consumers&# 039; {{choice of}} {{clothing}} has shifted towards fast fashion, and they demand the right product {{at the right}} time and at the right price. Hence, the garment manufacturing units often find it hard to cater to consumer needs. Their demand for aesthetics, appearance, handle, lustre and comfort in clothing is mainly achieved by <b>chemical</b> <b>finishing,</b> especially in fabric form. However, some of these essential features may be deteriorated or lost during the conversion of fabric into the final garment. Hence, garment finishing comes into play to obviate these issues. In addition, production of customised designs in specific locations of a garment, and some value-added finishes, are only feasible in the final garment. This chapter covers the techniques used for garment finishing. Essential information on the mechanical and <b>chemical</b> <b>finishing</b> of garments made from various fibres and denim products is covered.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Highloft {{nonwovens}} are low density fabrics {{characterized by}} a high ratio of thickness to weight per unit area, which means that highlofts contain considerable void volume. They are usually made of synthetic fibers. The present research effort was directed to study cotton blended highlofts. The major problems with using cotton in highlofts are cotton’s high flammability and lack of resiliency. The objective {{of this research was}} to carry out single-bath <b>chemical</b> <b>finishing</b> of perpendicular-laid (P-laid) highlofts to afford the composites’ improved flame resistance (FR) and physical resiliency. We have developed two finishing formulations containing the flame retardants (a) diammonium phosphate (DAP) /urea, and (b) DAP and cyclic phosphonate ester along with the crosslinking agent DMDHEU. Both the formulations imparted flame resistance to the highly flammable highlofts, protecting them completely. However, the formulation containing DAP/urea is preferred because it is of lower cost. Using the vertical flame test, damage sustained was limited to charring {{in the vicinity of the}} instigating flame. The crosslinking agent was effective in improving compressional resistance and recovery. So, the finishing treatment produced P-laid cotton blend highlofts that were both FR and resilient.

40|$|Uranium is a {{chemical}} element with the brand U discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth. Initially {{it was not}} particularly interesting for mankind, it was used mainly for colouring the glass. A major turning point came after the Second World War, when uranus began {{to be used for}} nuclear weapons and later for nuclear industry. At that time Czechoslovakia was the great world power in the production of uranium. The aim of my bachelor´s work is a description of the uranium research characteristics and development of uranium mining in the 20 st and the 21 st century in the Czech Republic and in the world. An intergovernmental contract between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union about an uranium supply was signed in 1945. Jáchymov was the key place for the Soviet Union, there was only a research carried out in other places of Czechoslovakia. There were exported 98 500 tons of the separated uranium ore and the concentrate to the USSR. The uranium industry employed 40 000 people in the fifties of the last century and it should be mentioned that a considerable part consisted of inmates and prisoners. At the turn of the fifties and sixties, the supply for military purposes is filled up and the uranium begins to be used mainly for nuclear energy. The mining is reduced after 1989 mainly due to an overproduction of uranium. The uranium mines are gradually closed and the places of extraction and <b>chemical</b> <b>finishing</b> departments of the ore are recultivated. The only mine, which is still in operation, is in Dolní Rožínka in the Bohemian-moravian highlands. A significant problem nowadays after the extraction seems to be the location of Stráž pod Ralskem, where the uranium is mined by the method of chemical infusion (In Situ Leach), and the <b>chemical</b> <b>finishing</b> department of the ore, mainly a MAPE Mydlovary. The price of remedial work estimated at 40 billion Czech crowns in Stráž pod Ralskem and will last approximately for the next 20 years. Redevelopment in the 5 MAPE Mydlovary is estimated in the tens of billions of Czech crowns and it will take about another ten years. Bachelor´s thesis is divided into two parts. In the theoretical part, there are described the sources and methods of uranium mining, the concepts of radioactivity, uranit. After that there is described the current state of environmental burdens in the MAPE Mydlovary in Českobudějovicko. In the practical part I deal with the issue of the impact of uranium mining on man and the environment, the development in uranium mining in developing countries and the perspective of the extraction and a comparison of the uranium reserves in the Czech Republic and in the world.

40|$|Cardiovascular stents are {{biomedical}} {{devices for}} the treatment of stenosis problem in the vascular system. Stenosis can be considered as the narrowing of the vessel in a way that creates a block or contraction to blood flow. In order to overcome such blockings, stents are placed and expanded in the narrowing location. Stent manufacturing is vastly done by laser beam machining and requires a good accuracy and control of the process to be successful. Recent studies have assessed nanosecond-pulsed lasers for efficient production in terms of productivity and quality. To achieve the required properties with regard to burr and dross removal, edge rounding and surface finishing, currently chemical etching followed by electrochemical polishing is applied after laser machining. Both from the perspective of process control, speed and repeatability as well as biocompatibility, these <b>chemical</b> <b>finishing</b> processes, using concentrated acids, are far from optimal. Plasma electrolytic polishing (PeP) can provide an alternative, using biocompatible, aqueous solutions and high DC voltages of u > 200 V to establish a vapour skin around the workpiece which leads to the generation of an atmospheric plasma. Here, electrochemical and electrothermal reactions take place which remove burr and dross and smoothen the workpieces' surface. Roughness values of Ra ≥ 0. 02 μm have been achieved. This work presents the study of a novel stent manufacturing route for producing permanent stents in AISI 316 L stainless steel. The stent mesh was microcut employing a ns-pulsed fiber laser. The stents were post-processed via traditional chemical etching and PeP. The results were compared in terms of geometrical integrity and surface roughness...|$|E

In order to introduce this type of approach. nanotechnology is applied. In particular, the introduction of nanoparticles into the textile is done by the immersion of the fabrics into an aqueous nanoparticle solution, followed by the tinal fixation of the nanoparticles through thermal treatment. The textile material put in contact with the dispersion of nanoparticles absorbs them and, because of the formation of various types of bindings according to both the fiber typology and the nanoparticles, prevents any following release. Cotton, polyester and a blend of them are used. The action mechanism is very similar to the dyes and chemical behavior: {{in the case of the}} cotton, by formation of a chemical bond among the cellulose and the nanoparticles; in the case of the polyester by adhesion of nanoparticles on the polymer surface, after fixation using either thermal or coating treatment.

40|$|Chemical or wet {{processing}} of textiles can be basically divided to three stages: pretreatment, dyeing and finishing. Raw cotton fibers {{have to be}} treated through several chemical, physical and biological processes before dyeing to obtain desirable properties and become suitable for use or for further treatments. These processes are known as “pretreatment processes”. The aim of the cotton pretreatment is to remove the undesired substances from raw cotton, which are brought to material {{in the form of}} natural and process-related attendant substances, by application of processes such as singeing, desizing, scouring and bleaching. Finishing provides extra properties for textiles that customers will value. In the other word, finishing is completing the fabric’s performance by providing special functions. The most conventional and important <b>chemical</b> <b>finishing</b> processes are: softening finishing, hand building finishing, easy-care and durable press finishing of cellulosic fabrics, repellent finishing, soil-release finishing, flame retardant finishing, non-slip finishing, antistatic finishing, anti-pilling finishing, elastomeric finishing, ultraviolet protection finishing, antimicrobial finishing, insect resist and mite protection finishing and etc. The main trend of development in chemical processes of textiles is shortening and simplification of pretreatment processes through combination of two or more stages. The important processes, such as desizing, scouring and bleaching are usually carried out in separate stages in the conventional pretreatment processes. Also consumption of large amount of energy and water is the other aspect of the conventional preparation of textiles. It has been already known that, to minimize the energy and water consumption the combination of several stages of the pretreatment processes by lowering the number of operations or reducing the time of reaction is absolutely necessary. Also, textile industry tends to utilize combination of the finishing processes in a single bath or at least reducing number of the necessary stages to decrease the costs of production. Using multifunctional finishing seems {{as one of the most}} attractive fields in textile industry. This idea has been investigated by some researchers to provide more effects in a finished fabric just in a single bath. In this study, it has been tried to combine some important pretreatment processes of cotton fabric by means of enzymes and also create several finishing effects on the cotton fabric through a novel multifunctional finishing process. Thus, the first part of this study has been dedicated to prove the possibility of simultaneous acid-demineralization and enzymatic desizing of cotton fabric in acidic conditions (pH 2) by using industrial acid stable enzymes. Acid-demineralization is necessary to remove undesired cationic metals and earth alkalis. The obtained results show that by use of a mixture of two appropriate enzymes, a glucoamylase (Multifect GA 10 L) and an a-amylase (Optisize Next) in a solution of citric acid and presence of a chelating agent, enzymatic desizing, and acid-demineralization is successfully carried out at the same time. Therefore, two processes of pretreatment are integrated into a single process, which effectively reduce time and costs for textile industry. In the second part, multifunctional finishing of cotton through synthesis and employment of a novel polycarboxylic acid was studied to produce a fabric with several functional properties: easy-care, flame retardant and antimicrobial; without any extra finishing process. By this way, it is possible to combine three separate finishing processes into a single stage. This goal is achieved by carboxylation of polyvinylamine (PVAm), resulting to form a polyamino carboxylic acid as a novel polycarboxylic acid. This product was used for crosslinking of cotton fabric by pad-dry-cure process. The reaction between the carboxylic groups of polyamino carboxylic acid and the hydroxyl groups of cellulose in cotton forms ester links. It makes durable press effect, reduces the flammability of treated cotton and creates biostatic properties. Moreover, due to presence of free amino groups the treated cotton with the polyamino carboxylic acid improves dyeability of cotton with reactive dyes and enables a salt-free dyeing process...|$|E

Similarly, the wet clinginess can be {{a major source of}} sensorial discomfort for fire-fighters in situations of profuse sweating.

Nevertheless, recent studies in the United States and Israel have identified patients reacting to DPCF, considered to have allergic contact reactions to clothes, either from formaldehyde released by the DPCF therein or from the DPCF per se (in patients negative to formaldehyde). However, all studies had some weaknesses in design or interpretation and in not a single case has the clinical relevance been proven. The amount of free formaldehyde in most garments will likely be below the threshold for the elicitation of dermatitis for all but the most sensitive patients. The amount of free cyclized urea DPCF in clothes is unlikely to be high enough to cause sensitization.

30|$|In view of {{the past}} {{reported}} studies, the most utilized material fabric is cotton. In some of the studies, the greigh fabric have been processed through the textile finishing processes for making a finished fabrics. Textile finishing usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, mercerizing and dyeing process. Textile finishing usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, mercerizing and dyeing process (Hall 1966). None reported the cotton fabric experiencing the finishing process mercerizing process. It is remarkable that the wet preparing of cotton fabrics prompts its shrinkage, expanding the yarn number, mass every unit territory, and fabric thickness (Tarbuk et al. 2014). Mercerised cotton fibre will be round and hollow rather than strip like shapes, and the cross-segments of the filaments change from kidney like to roundabout molded. The primary explanation behind this is the cotton fibre swelling amid the mercerisation process. Amid mercerization, Sodium Hyroxide (NaoH) infiltrated into the lumen of the cotton strands and swelled. Mercerizing process is the act of chemical treatment on cellulosic fibre to improve {{the properties of the}} fibre in term of tensile strength, absorption properties and also greater affinity of dyes and various <b>chemical</b> <b>finishes.</b> Mercerized cotton holds the properties of higher mass per unit area, thickness, breaking force and elongation, luster, with a change of surface charge that ensures further quality improvement and also higher adsorption of anionic auxiliaries.|$|R

Microscopic slides and 100 % cotton fabric in plain weave were coated with fluorocarbon polymers (FCP), paraffin waxes with zirconium salts (PWZ), methylolmelamine derivatives (MMD), polysiloxanes with side alkyldimethylammonium groups (PSAAC) and aminofunctional polysiloxanes (AFPS). From the goniometer contact angle measurements of different liquids, the surface free energy of the coated glass plates was calculated according to approaches by Owens-Wendt-Kaelble, Wu, van Oss-Chaudhury-Good, and Li-Neumann-Kwok. The results showed that all the coatings decreased the surface free energy of the substrate, which was also influenced by the liquid combination and the theoretical approach used. In {{spite of the fact that}} the liquid contact angles were much higher on the coated fabric samples than on glass plates and resulted in the lower values of work of adhesion, a very good correlation between the coatings deposited on both substrates was obtained. The presence of repellent coatings FCP, PWZ and MMD converted the solid surface from polar to highly apolar by masking the functional groups of glass and cellulose.
