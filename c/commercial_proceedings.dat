40|$|The European Commission {{published}} a White Paper on 2 April 2008 on damages actions for breach of EU antitrust rules. The {{content of the}} White Paper is since then being prepared to be converted into EU legislation on private antitrust enforcement. This paper presents the developments in private antitrust enforcement in Poland after 2 April 2008. It commences with an outline of EU actions in this field which act as {{an introduction to the}} more detailed analysis of recent jurisprudential and legislative developments in Poland. The latter part of the paper covers, in particular, the 2009 Act on the Pursuit of Claims in Group Proceedings and the 2011 Act Amending the Civil Procedure Code and Some Other Acts which abolishes all specific elements of <b>commercial</b> <b>proceedings,</b> including the statutory ‘non-admission of evidence’ principle. These two legal acts are assessed in order to establish whether their introduction is likely to help facilitate private antitrust enforcement in Poland and to consider to what an extent are these developments responding to the challenges outlined by the European Commission. ...|$|E
40|$|The article substantiates the {{necessity}} of a system analysis of the processes of application of the norms of international treaties by commercial courts of the Russian Federation. This need is justified, at least, by the following: an insignificant amount of special research in this field in comparison with a similar subject within the courts of general jurisdiction, the creation of a relatively new body of supranational control over compliance with the norms of international treaties in the field of commercial courts’ practice. The purpose of the study is to identify problems of application of international treaties of the Russian Federation arbitration courts of Russia. The author uses methodology of formal legal analysis of Russian legislation and courts’ decisions. The results and scope of it’s application. The author, taking into account the specifics of <b>commercial</b> <b>proceedings</b> and the nature of disputes heard in commercial courts, proposed legal grounds in a concentrated form which allow to state the existence of the obligation to apply the norms of international treaties by Russian commercial courts. Two levels of such grounds can be stated – international and domestic. Publication of the texts of international treaties as a problematic segment of their applicability. The article highlights one of the problematic segments of the application process of the norms of international treaties for the purpose of more detailed reflection. The practice of commercial courts demonstrates that in both legislative acts and acts of applying law, the concepts of "official publication" and "bringing to the public" are alternated with each other. Despite the reform, the procedure of official publication has not acquired the character of a systemic institution of Russian law. This significantly complicates the activity of administering justice with respect to the legislative acts of international law. Conclusions. From {{the point of view of}} international law, the state, independently determining the procedure and methods of implementing international treaties within its legal system, is not limited in its ability to burden itself with the need to abide by additional procedures not provided by the international legal system of procedures. Official publication, as a necessary procedure for the entry of a legislative act into the force, represents such an additional procedure designed to protect more effectively human rights and freedoms and to streamline law enforcement practice. In this connection, the author formulated the provisions, the implementation of which can help in matters of systematization of the institution of official publication of international treaties of the Russian Federation. </p...|$|E

Within the historical development the thesis also describes individual international agreements which govern international commercial arbitration as such. In this chapter the author also asks fundamental questions concerning the principles of the functioning of arbitration proceedings. In its second chapter the thesis first concentrates on defining ADR and arbitration proceedings with an emphasis given on the finding of nodal points between ADR and arbitration proceedings. The author tends to the opinion that the arbitration proceedings are part of ADR. In the following part of this chapter the thesis concentrates on an analysis of the international element in contractual obligations and the elementary difference between the international arbitration proceedings and the in-country arbitration proceedings.

The Act of 28 February 2003 the Bankruptcy and Reorganization Law (J. L. No 60, item 535 as amended), the articles 492 - 521 b. r. l. is the main source of law in the commented matter. The idea of the Polish regulation derives from the Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States. The statistics of the usage of the reorganization proceedings in Poland are not very impressive.

40|$|When {{developing}} {{information systems}} business modelling {{is needed in}} order to highlight the essentials of businesses. Patterns of inter-related speech acts are the basis for identifying essentials in Language/Action-oriented approaches for business modelling. Weigand et al. has made an attempt to conceptualise the notion of patterns in a layered architecture founded in such approaches. In this paper we present a framework of generic layered patterns for business interaction inspired by a critical examination of Weigand's meta-pattern framework. Through our framework of interdependent layers of generic patterns based on solid foundations that transcends the notion of speech acts we are able to describe and understand short-termed and longtermed business interaction. The five layers of generic patterns are business act as the basic unit of analysis, action pair, exchange, business transaction, and transaction group. Each layer, except for the first one, is derived from lower layers. The copyright of this paper belongs to the paper's authors.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} {{that attempt to}} relate the action concept to information systems. There are approaches based on Activity Theory, Actor Network Theory, Organisational Semiotics and Language Action Perspective. Within the approaches of Organisational Semiotics and Language Action {{there is a great}} interest in the concepts of speech act and communicative action. In the communicative action theory of Habermas, there are fundamental distinctions made between communicative actions and material (instrumental) actions. Sociality and comprehensibility are associated with communicative actions and not with material actions. Instrumentality is associated with material actions and not with communicative actions. These characterisations are analysed and contested. Based on these analyses, an investigation of action types related to information systems has been pursued. The approach for Information System Actability {{has been used as a}} framework. Three different usage situations of information systems have been investigated and characterised: Interactive, automatic and consequential usage situations.

This trend is motivated mostly by increasing number of carrier Ethernet networks {{as well as the}} size of these networks, and consequently the increasing sales of these networks. To manage these networks efficiently, detailed and accurate knowledge of their topology is needed. Knowledge of a network's entities and the physical connections between them can be useful in various prospective. Administrators can use topology information for network planning and fault detecting. Topology information can also be used during protocol and routing algorithm development, for performance prediction and as a basis for accurate network simulations.

A literature review produced three groups of activities that can support open innovation: network building, an improvement in knowledge flows and exchange, and the exchange of technology and licenses. The analysis shows that the commercially successful projects did apply many of the recommended practices from open innovation, even if some of them originally began as internally focused projects. Only one successful project out of six actually established a new business model, which many authors consider to be an integrated part of the open innovation approach. The analysis also shows that even projects that applied many or even most of the open innovation approaches recommended in the prior literature did not automatically become <b>commercial</b> successes.

40|$|Concerning the {{development}} and adoption of the computer-based patient record (CPR), an unsolved problem is still the approach that {{should be taken to}} construct a highly configurable, generic CPR. This holds in particular for a CPR that supports care-clusters and care-networks in delivering care and continuity of care for chronically ill patients. The first step in finding such an approach, is the identification of generic activity patterns in the interaction between a patient and a care-cluster. These generic activity patterns are considered to be helpful in the identification of generic functional building blocks or components, which are necessary for constructing the CPR. By modeling and comparing the essential activities performed in care-clusters involved in the care for three different patient groups, twelve generic activity patterns in the interaction between a patient and a care-cluster are identified. Differences between care-clusters occur mainly in the method used to execute these generic activity patterns. From the comparison of the identified activity patterns with existing models of the care process, we concluded that although differences occur in the approach used for modeling the care process, no real conflicts between our results and the existing models occur. Contrary to the other models, our description of the care process focuses on aspects like responsibilities, co-ordination, delegation of activities and perceives the patient as an active participant of the care process.

40|$|Contemporary {{research}} on roadblocks and facilitators of settlement {{has thus far}} been framed by standard economic modeling and distributive bargaining theories. Each of these frameworks provides helpful insights into those elements that assist or hinder the settlement process. However, each of these models has thus far not examined how particular roadblocks and facilitators of settlement operate {{in the context of}} international <b>commercial</b> arbitration <b>proceedings</b> from a comparative cross-cultural perspective. How diverse regions approach roadblocks and facilitators of settlement {{in the context of the}} integration of global markets is a new arena for research and practice. To date, most {{research on}} international arbitration has focused exclusively on Western models of arbitration as practiced in Europe and North America. While such studies accurately reflected the geographic foci of international arbitration practice in the mid- 20 th century, in recent years, the number of international arbitrations conducted in East Asia has grown steadily and on par with growth in Westem regions. This article presents a cross-cultural examination of how international arbitrators in East Asian and Western countries view the particular factors that help or hinder the settlement process in international arbitration. The result of a 115 -person survey and 64 follow up interviews shed light on the underlying cultural attitudes and approaches to perceived roadblocks and facilitators of settlement in international arbitration. The findings indicate that arbitration practitioner's perceptions of the factors influencing the achievement of settlement as well as specific barriers to settlement demonstrate a high degree of convergence across regions. At the same time, regional and socio-economic distinctions are reflected in varying arbitrator perceptions regarding arbitrator proclivity towards making the first move towards settlement in arbitration, the degree of focus on past facts and legal rights as opposed to exploring creative solutions and orientation toward adversarial procedures...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{ascertain}} the rules of private international law determining the procedural law of international <b>commercial</b> arbitral <b>proceedings.</b> In an Introduction, the author outlines the fundamental notions, introduces the topic and the major doctrines and issues, and sets out his methodology {{and structure of the}} work. The thesis examine first, as a preliminary issue, the considerations influencing the assumption of jurisdiction over arbitral proceedings. Chapter 1 discusses the various theories on the lex arbitri (the law supplying the general legal framework of an arbitration) as relevant to the procedural law, and concludes that they are deductive and therefore unable to satisfactorily to determine the applicable procedural law. Chapter 2 analyses major national laws as case-studies of the technique and scope of application of international arbitration law, and suggests a model of legislative and court jurisdiction based on the legal concept of 'seat of the arbitration' and on considerations based on the most appropriate court to control an arbitration. Chapter 3 discusses the obligations {{of the state of the}} seat under the European Convention on Human Rights and confirms the findings in Chapter 2. In a second part, the thesis elaborates on the title and extent of permissible municipal law interference. Chapter 4 tests the validity of the propositions derived from Chapters 2 and 3 against arbitral practice and concludes that seldom will arbitrators derogate from the law of the seat. Chapter 5 examines the particular case of arbitrations with states and similar entities. The third part discusses the relevance of compliance with the law of the seat at the stage of enforcement of an award. Chapter 6 deals with the technical issue of whether annulment at the place of making precludes enforcement in other fora. That chapter gives the opportunity to discuss models of separation of international jurisdiction and co-operation between different jurisdictions from a practical perspective. It thus serves as a convenient introduction to Chapter 7, which discusses the more abstract question of the nexus required between an arbitral award and the municipal law of the state of rendition in order for the award to enter, in limine, the scope of application of the international instruments in the field. The thesis ends with Conclusions in the form of model provisions for municipal law and arbitration rules. </p...|$|R
