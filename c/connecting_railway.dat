5|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) {{built the}} <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway</b> in 1867 to connect its main {{line to the}} Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad. By the early 1870s, New York Junction station was {{established}} where the <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway</b> crossed over the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad mainline in North Philadelphia. A signal tower, still extant, was constructed around this time.|$|E
5|$|As {{a part of}} the Pennsylvania system, the CL {{continued}} to operate its own property (which included the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was leased to the Pennsylvania. Starting at the end of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL as a Class I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL was leased.) However, net operating income, revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadto create the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary. That company was merged into the <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway,</b> previously a short link in Philadelphia, in 1956, and its lessee merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Transportation.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway</b> was a {{subsidiary}} of the Pennsylvania Railroad, incorporated to build a connection between the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad and the PRR in the city of Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway</b> {{main line}} was {{operated}} {{as part of}} the PRR main line from Philadelphia to New York, providing through and local passenger service and extensive freight service to the many industries located in northern Philadelphia. The main passenger station on the line was North Philadelphia station. Because of the northern alignment of the <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway,</b> passenger trains between New York and Pittsburgh would stop there only, bypassing 30th Street Station. The Chestnut Hill, Fort Washington and Bustleton Branches also saw passenger service; the other lines were exclusively freight lines. In particular, the Kensington & Tacony Branch served the upper Philadelphia waterfront and the Frankford Arsenal, and the Oxford Road Branch served a Sears distribution center near its crossing of the Reading.|$|E

25|$|The loss of {{industry}} in Philadelphia {{began to take}} its toll, {{and many of the}} freight branches became little-used. In 1973, the Oxford Road Branch was abandoned north of the Reading crossing. The <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway</b> survived as a separate corporation through the Penn Central merger, but all its tracks were sold to Conrail and Amtrak in 1976 and the corporation was subsequently dissolved.|$|E
25|$|During the 2010s, the Moscow (Little) Ring Railway was {{converted}} {{to be used}} for frequent passenger service; it is fully integrated with Moscow Metro; the passenger service started on September 10, 2016. There is a <b>connecting</b> <b>railway</b> line on the North side of the town that connects Belorussky terminal with other railway lines. This is used by some suburban trains.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1902, {{these seven}} {{corporations}} were consolidated into The <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway</b> Company. This company {{and all its}} predecessors were directly or indirectly controlled by the PRR throughout their history. On December 9, 1956, the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, an agglomeration of certain PRR Lines West, was merged into the corporation. This was solely {{for the sake of}} corporate bookkeeping and had no effect on operations.|$|E

50|$|In 1860 the L&NR {{was absorbed}} {{as part of}} the Cambrian Railways, along with all of its <b>connecting</b> <b>railways.</b> It then became part of the GWR on {{grouping}} in 1923.|$|R
50|$|The Cheshire Lines Committee {{put forward}} several plans to <b>connect</b> <b>railway</b> lines to Liverpool Docks via the extension. One {{of these was}} the Liverpool, St Helens & South Lancashire Railway.|$|R
25|$|On December 1, 1871, the PRR leased the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company, which {{included}} the original Camden and Amboy Railroad from Camden, New Jersey (across the Delaware River from Philadelphia) to South Amboy, New Jersey (across Raritan Bay from New York City), {{as well as a}} newer line from Philadelphia to Jersey City, New Jersey, much closer to New York, via Trenton, New Jersey. Track connection in Philadelphia was made via the PRR's <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway</b> and the jointly owned Junction Railroad (Philadelphia).|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} was some distance {{short of the}} principal commercial area of the City of London, and as regular business travel developed the inconvenience of the location became an issue. The LSWR had hoped to build a line eastwards to near London Bridge but the slump following the railway mania, and {{the high cost of}} building through the area, led to abandonment of the idea. When the South Eastern Railway built its extension from London Bridge to Charing Cross, a <b>connecting</b> <b>railway</b> line from it to Waterloo was built; but friction and competitive hostility between the companies frustrated beneficial use of the connection and it fell into disuse at the end of 1867.|$|E
25|$|In May 1897 Wemyss {{indicated}} to the NBR {{that he planned}} to build a new <b>connecting</b> <b>railway</b> from Muiredge Den to Methil; at six miles in length it was to connect numerous collieries in the district. The NBR immediately took the view that this was prohibited under the thirling agreement, and lengthy and antagonistic correspondence followed. The NBR argued that the licence to build new colliery connections was personal to Wemyss (not the WCC) and did not allow him to carry the minerals of others on the line. The matter went to arbitration, and the arbitrator gave his decision on 10 March 1899: he found in favour of Wemyss. The NBR complied with the obligations of the NBR's finding, but continued to try to dissuade Wemyss from building the line by proposing concessions on the continued use of the NBR lines.|$|E

25|$|Past the City Avenue interchange, I-76 {{enters the}} city of Philadelphia and becomes {{concurrent}} with US 1, with the Schuylkill Expressway widening to eight lanes and running between a yard on Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and the river {{to the north and}} wooded areas of Fairmount Park to the south. US 1 splits from I-76 by heading northeast on the Roosevelt Expressway, while I-76 continues south on the Schuylkill Expressway, heading through Fairmount Park and running parallel to CSX's Trenton Subdivision, Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill River to the east. The freeway curves to the southwest, with CSX's Trenton Subdivision heading east away from the road and CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision beginning to run parallel. I-76 comes to a diamond interchange with Montgomery Drive that provides access to Fairmount Park and serves the Mann Center for the Performing Arts. Following this, the Schuylkill Expressway narrows to six lanes and turns to the southeast, running through more of the park with the railroad tracks, Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill River parallel to the northeast. The freeway passes under CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision and comes to an interchange with US 13 and US 30 at Girard Avenue. Within this interchange, the highway passes under the Pennsylvania Railroad, <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway</b> Bridge that carries Amtrak's Northeast Corridor across the Schuylkill River before heading under the Girard Avenue Bridge that carries US 13 (Girard Avenue) across the river. US 30 becomes concurrent with I-76 on the Schuylkill Expressway at this point and the road heads south, with the Philadelphia Zoo to the west and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill River still parallel to the east. The freeway turns southeast and runs between Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to the southwest and the river drive, trail, and river to the northeast, with Boathouse Row on the opposite bank of the river. The Schuylkill Expressway comes to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance with Spring Garden Street, which heads east across the Schuylkill River towards the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The freeway continues south, heading east of a large Amtrak railroad yard, and comes to an interchange with the western terminus of I-676, which heads east along with US 30 on the Vine Street Expressway into Center City.|$|E

2500|$|On September 22, 1892, the Engelside Railroad was incorporated, {{and built}} [...] of {{line from the}} <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway</b> main line near 32nd and Jefferson Streets to near 32nd and Thompson Streets, where it {{connected}} with the Reading (former Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad trackage).|$|E
2500|$|The PRR {{controlled}} the Philadelphia & Trenton, and had {{originally intended to}} directly connect the two lines {{through the heart of}} Philadelphia. However, attempts to buy out and demolish buildings in the right-of-way led to riots, and the Philadelphia & Trenton was forced to end at Kensington. To resolve the problem, <b>Connecting</b> <b>Railway</b> Company was incorporated May 15, 1863, and between 1864 and June 1867, constructed a [...] connecting line between Frankford Junction on the Philadelphia & Trenton and Mantua Junction (now Zoo interlocking) on the PRR main line, passing through what is now North Philadelphia.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Townhead basin served much heavy {{industry}} in that quarter of Glasgow, progressive {{improvements to the}} navigability of the River Clyde meant that 100-tonne (110-short-ton) ships, and by {{the early years of}} the nineteenth century 400-tonne (440-short-ton) ships, could reach the Broomielaw quays from the sea. The conveyance of coal, iron ore and machinery from the canal down to the quays resulted in a huge and inconvenient cartage traffic through the city streets; this [...] "added a cost equivalent to [...] carriage on a railway", and of course involved a trans-shipment. The engineer Rennie designed a canal link from the Monkland Canal to the Clyde in 1797, but it involved [...] vertical interval of lockage and was impossibly expensive; Stevenson prepared a similar scheme later but it too foundered. The Canal Company bought land for a <b>connecting</b> <b>railway</b> for the purpose in 1824, but that scheme also came to nothing.|$|E
