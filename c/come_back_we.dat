500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the video}} the {{isolated}} and sad men depart with the doors closing on them. As the final chorus breaks into dance grooves, Madonna comes out of the theater and gives the boy a quick kiss on his lips. Both are clad in loose-fitting gray suits, which gives Madonna an androgynous look. They stroll away playfully in the sunrise, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan in The Kid with the old boss pursuing them and shouting [...] "Come back, <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> <b>we</b> still need you" [...] in Italian. The tension between the visual and the musical dimensions of the video is extremely unsettling according to author Nicholas B. Dirks. Only when she disappears from the carousel and reappears to run away from her patriarchal boss with the young boy, then the music and visuals become comparable.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, Rhimes {{stated that}} she did not feel Izzie's {{character}} arc—specifically her relationship with Alex—had fully concluded, and hoped to give proper closure to their relationship in the seventh season. She later confirmed that she had intended to kill off Izzie off-screen, but opted against this a day later as she felt that it would destroy Alex, rather than give him closure. Instead, she concluded: [...] "I'm open to seeing Izzie again. So if she [...] were to <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> <b>we</b> would be thrilled to [...] But if she doesn't, we'll just move on." [...] Heigl also went on to say in October 2010 that the character returning to show looks bleak because, [...] "that chapter is closed, and it's sad. And it's hard." [...] She also felt that Izzie coming back to the show would, [...] "just feel manipulative." ...|$|E
500|$|In the semifinal, the Gliders had to {{beat the}} reigning champions, Team USA, {{in front of a}} small crowd of 4,428 at the North Greenwich Arena. Team USA had first {{possession}} and earned the first points of the game, but both teams' shooting was poor, and the score was only 10–12 at quarter time. The second quarter started with Merritt scoring twice to give Australia the lead 14–12. Team USA turned the ball over the Gliders several times, but they were unable to capitalise on their strong defence, leaving the score tied at 26–26 at half time. In the third quarter, an early goal by Gauci from outside the paint gave the Gliders the lead. A series of steals gave the Gliders additional shots, most of which they missed, but Team USA gave up a series of turnovers, and their shooting was worse than their rivals', resulting in a 10–0 run by the Gliders. Team USA were unable to score at all until the last minute of the quarter. A hurried goal with seconds to go by Hill saw the Gliders leading 38–28. Team USA would ultimately post 28 turnovers to Australia's 17, and the Gliders would score 12 points from turnovers to Team USA's three. Triscari warned his players, [...] "They will <b>come</b> <b>back!</b> <b>We</b> have to stop them!" ...|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} death of Ianto Jones during Torchwoods third series, a {{campaign}} to bring him back was started through networking sites such as LiveJournal, Twitter and Facebook. The resulting website, www.saveiantojones.com, has organised a protest which encourages fans to send coffee, along with postcards and letters of complaint, to the BBC, a reference to Ianto's status as the [...] "coffee boy". Via the Save Ianto Jones website, fans are also campaigning {{to raise money for the}} BBC charity Children in Need in honour of the character. The fundraising site states that [...] "Though we, his devoted fans, still hope that he'll <b>come</b> <b>back</b> ... <b>we</b> mourn him. In the series, he died saving the children of Earth; so it seems fitting to honour his memory by helping the Children in Need." [...] Torchwood Magazine reported that the site had raised nearly £4,000, with individual donations ranging from £2 to £50. John Barrowman described the charity campaign as [...] "a fun way to mourn Ianto" [...] and stated that it was [...] "the kind of thing that's really appreciated". Gareth David-Lloyd was flattered by the strong fan reaction, saying it is [...] "satisfying in drama when you create such an emotional response, because that's what you set out to do in the first place". He praised the fan donations, claiming [...] "So far, they've raised about £3,000 for Children in Need, and £1,000 for Lluest Horse and Pony Trust in West Wales, which I'm a patron of, so that's got to be a good thing". Coventry Telegraph records that by 21 July 2009, £4,172 had been donated in Ianto's name.|$|E
2500|$|Saladin {{proceeded}} to take Nusaybin which offered no resistance. A medium-sized town, Nusaybin {{was not of}} great importance, but it was located in a strategic position between Mardin and Mosul and within easy reach of Diyarbakir. In the midst of these victories, Saladin received word that the Crusaders were raiding the villages of Damascus. He replied [...] "Let them... whilst they knock down villages, we are taking cities; when we <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> <b>we</b> shall have all the more strength to fight them." [...] Meanwhile, in Aleppo, the emir of the city Zangi raided Saladin's cities {{to the north and}} east, such as Balis, Manbij, Saruj, Buza'a, al-Karzain. He also destroyed his own citadel at A'zaz to prevent it from being used by the Ayyubids if they were to conquer it.|$|E
2500|$|In a March 30, 2010 {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel explained why {{she decided to}} move on from the character: I had {{tried to make it}} work with All My Children. I don’t have a business head, so I don’t really make business decisions; every decision I make in my life is emotional and it was difficult to feel that the show wasn’t... that Bianca was getting lost. That who she was, was getting lost. I went back several times and they were so lovely to let me come back and play a character I love with the people I love so many times. But I felt that the people making the show didn’t really understand what Bianca was about anymore... It troubled me. I got letters from people to whom Bianca meant a great deal essentially saying, [...] "Please don’t <b>come</b> <b>back.</b> <b>We</b> can't take it anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Faces {{released}} {{their final}} album Ooh La La, which reached {{number one in}} the UK and number 21 in the US in 1973. During the recording of the album, the rift between Stewart {{and the rest of the}} Faces grew further, as (according to Ian McLagan), Stewart didn't participate until two weeks into the sessions, [...] "and then complained that some songs were in the wrong key for him. So we recorded them again and waited a week for him to <b>come</b> <b>back.</b> <b>We</b> cut the track for 'Ooh La La' three times before he eventually passed on it, leaving it for Woody to sing. [...] The week the album came out he did all he could to scuttle it and told anyone who would listen how useless it was.". The band toured Australasia, Japan, Europe and the UK in 1974 to support the album and the single [...] "Pool Hall Richard".|$|E

6000|$|When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> <b>we</b> {{found them}} both {{waiting to be}} called in; upon which he agreed to examine him alone, and so I began thus to {{discourse}} him. [...] "Prithee, Will Atkins," [...] said I, [...] "what education have you? What was your father?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Go to Virginia Water in it," [...] said Jone, [...] "and when we <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>we</b> {{can go to}} the hotel. I made a mistake, but I've got {{to stand}} by it or be called a greenhorn." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{thought it}} very likely {{you would have}} <b>come</b> <b>back.</b> <b>We</b> knew of course of your having been at Ricks. If I didn't find you I thought I might perhaps find Mr. Vetch," [...] Mrs. Brigstock went on.|$|E

5000|$|Several of {{his closest}} friends spoke at his funeral, {{including}} Wilhelm Liebknecht and Friedrich Engels.
