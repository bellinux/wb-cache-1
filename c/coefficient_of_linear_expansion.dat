In the first chapter reviewed domestic and foreign literature sources, discusses the physical causes of low <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> <b>expansion</b> of Invar alloys. Examples of various chemical compositions of Invar alloys are given and their use is considered. Analyzed the shortcomings of classical Invars and defined prerequisites for improving the mechanical properties of them. Considered the effect of chemical composition on the structure, mechanical and special properties of Invar alloys. It is shown that without the heat treatment is not possible to obtain simultaneously low values of <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> <b>expansion</b> and increased strength properties. Analysis of literature sources shows that {{there are only a few}} scattered data on the effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties of high strength Invar alloys with a low <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> <b>expansion.</b> There is no consensus about the effect of temperature and time of heat treatment parameters.

To investigate were selected Invar alloys based on Fe-Ni system, alloyed with carbon and carbide forming elements, which from the literature should ensure the hardening of these alloys due to the dispersed carbide phase. Doping cobalt is used to reduce the coefficient of expansion. The alloys were melted in a vacuum induction furnace at 60 kg ingots, forged and then rolled into rods.
