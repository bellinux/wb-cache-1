30|$|<b>Corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> admixtures, {{which are}} added to the {{concrete}} at the time of mixing, are used to delay the onset of corrosion in reinforced concrete. The inhibitors work by either slowing the ingress of aggressive ions, such as chlorides, or increasing the amount of chlorides necessary to initiate the corrosion process (Brown 1999). The use of <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> admixtures is not included in the study reported here.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Admixtures are {{materials}} that are added to concrete at some stage in its production to give concrete new properties whether in fluid or plastic conditions. The admixtures used {{in the construction industry}} are broadly classified into Mineral and Chemical admixtures. In recent years, the use of mineral and chemical admixtures in producing high performance concrete has increased significantly. The chemical reaction of cement with admixtures differs from material to material. Calcium nitrite based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> admixtures have gained popularity for protection of reinforced and pre-stressed concrete structures but calcium nitrite is not commercialized indigenously in lndia due to manufacturing difficulties. Hence, the objective of the present investigation was to study a novel <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> admixture system and to compare its effectiveness with sodium nitrite. Designlmethodologylapproach - Di-sodium phthalate, sodium orthophosphate and sodium nitrite-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> admixtures were selected for the present investigation. The critical quantities of <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> additives were determined by accelerated laboratory tests. The following types of tests were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> admixtures: compressive strength of 100 x 100 x 100 mm concrete cubes after 3, 7, 14 and 28 days of curing, linear polarization resistance measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, an accelerated 12 V controlled potential test. Findings - From the above tests, the inhibitor admixtured concrete not only improved in compressive strength but also increased its corrosion resistance properties. Of the inhibitors studied, di-sodium phthalate showed superior corrosion resistance properties, compared to sodium nitrite. Originalitylvalue - Di-sodium phthalate may be considered a better substitute for calcium nitrite-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> admixtures for durable concrete structures. This fulfils the objective of the investigation...|$|R

The present study aims at {{the evaluation of the}} effect of hot <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> model additives on the performance of an ablative phenolic resin using oxy-acetylene torch test which measure different properties. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) in combination with energy disperse Xray (EDX) are used. Two kinds of <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> additives are employed: an inorganic inhibitor based on graphene oxide sheets (GO); a ceramic nanoparticle (ZrB 2) with inhibiting properties. The results obtained show that hot <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> additives drastically modify the ablation and thermal stability.

The dehydrated cactus addition was mixed at different concentrations by either solution or cement mass (0. 10 %, 0. 25 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, and 2. 0 %). Half-cell potentials and LPR measurements were performed at different time periods to characterize the possible <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> effect of the cactus additions tested in such alkaline media. Results showed good <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> effect of dehydrated Nopal on reinforcing steel, in all tested solutions, when chloride ions are present.

40|$|Steel {{reinforced}} concrete {{is one of}} the most durable and cost effective construction materials but it can suffer in high chloride environments from corrosion due to chloride induced break down of the normal passive layer protection. One way of protection embedded steel reinforcement from chloride induced corrosion is by the addition of <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> admixtures (CIA) to the concrete mixes. In this paper, the effectiveness of various <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> admixtures (CIA), namely calcium nitrite and sodium benzoate, admixed with OPC mortar ingredients on fresh parameters (initial flowability and rate of flowability loss), microstructure related properties (cement-phase composition, capillary porosity and permeation) and reinforcement corrosion activity was extensively investigated. The role of these CIA on the mechanical properties (such as compressive, tensile and bond strength) of OPC matrix was also studied. Therefore, various 0. 50 w/c OPC mortars made with 0, 2, 4 and 5 % of either calcium nitrite or sodium benzoate were prepared and then assessed using mortar flow table, thermogravimetric analysis de-sorption test, initial surface absorption test and half-cell apparatus. The results emphasized that the beneficial role of <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> admixtures on enhancing the resistance of reinforcement against corrosion is significantly dependent on the modifications occur to the microstructure of OPC matrix as a result of inclusion of CIA. The use of calcium nitrite and sodium benzoate has led to reducing the capillary porosity and rate of water flow into OPC matrix and increasing the amount of C-S-H. The amount of enhancement in the microstructure related properties is generally increased with CIA content. Also, the tensile and bond strength are significantly improved as a result of admixing calcium nitrite in OPC mix, while, all studied mechanical properties (compressive, tensile and bond strength) have been degraded when sodium benzoate was utilized...|$|R

Increased corrosion inhibition shall be allowed by placing polyurea capsules containing water soluble chemicals that protect the steel such as calcium nitrite. The capsules are modified with iron oxide nanoparticles to generate a magnetic susceptibility of the capsules. The iron oxide particles are introduced to the process in the preliminary step of emulsification of the water phase. The magnetic property can be possibly used to attract the capsules by running current through the steel wires which induces a magnetic field around them. The <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibiting</b> property emerges when necessary after cracks in the concrete matrix penetrate to the steel bars which facilitates water with dissolved salts to reach the metal surface.
