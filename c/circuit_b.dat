The paper is divided into seven main chapters as follows: Chapter 1 is a general introduction to the project. Chapter 2 provides a quick summary of the origin of the geothermal energy with some historical data. Chapter 3 reviews the actual state of the art regarding the Geothermal Heat Pumps, by providing a rapid overview of all the technologies (Surface Water Heat Pumps, Ground Water Heat Pumps and Ground Coupled Heat Pumps) and their possible applications. Chapter 4 gives the reader some general data regarding the various typologies of heat exchangers that are used in these kind of applications. Chapter 5 provides a quick overview of the legislation regarding the refrigerants and an introduction to some possible refrigerants that could be used during the heat pump cycle (according to the legislation), with some economic data related to heat pumps operated with those refrigerants. Chapter 6 is the main chapter constituting the project itself. After a quick presentation of the main assumptions taken in this paper, the building site is analyzed using the planimetry and a system to fulfil the space heating/cooling and domestic hot water is designed (heat pumps and pipes). Afterwards the peak and simultaneous loads for each typology of building are evaluated to choose the shape of the distribution circuits; those in this paper are named circuit A for houses and row-houses and <b>circuit</b> <b>B</b> for all the other buildings. A first simple economical evaluation of the proposed heat pumps is then shown. In this chapter the needed electric heating to fulfil the peak load in each domiciles are also evaluated, after having chosen the dimension of the system, and the losses along the pipe network; in particular, adding the last ones to the chosen size of thesystem, the required size for the heat pump in each circuit was obtained, i. e. 131. 56 kW for circuit A and 726. 30 kW for <b>circuit</b> <b>B.</b> With these data, a simple economical evaluation was completed, using known information from the company Johnson Controls,obtaining, with the chosen sizes and the chosen limits to the economic evaluation, a simple payback period of 8. 760 and 8. 068 years respectively for circuit A and B. In the end, with data regarding some heat-packs furnished by Johnson Controls, a simulation of the heat pump systems was operated using EES to confirm that what was hypothesized is achievable in the reality and to see how some parameters changes with the decrease of the load. The results of the simulation show that the size of the intermediate heat exchanger between the brine and the groundwater is 36. 31 m 2 for the heat-pack of circuit A and 102. 4 m 2 for each of the two heat-pack of <b>circuit</b> <b>B</b> and that the size of the heat exchangers to produce the domestic hot water and the space heating water, in <b>circuit</b> <b>B</b> during the summer mode at full load, is 2. 853 m 2. The mass flow rates(kg/s) of the brine and of the groundwater for the two circuits during the winter and the summer modes were also found. After this some simulations were run at a partial load only with the purpose to see how the COP varies.

30|$|The wheel {{assemblies}} are {{coupled to}} each other by the HIS system. In the body bounce motion shown in Figure  1, {{the top and bottom}} chambers are compressed and extended, respectively. Owing to the asymmetry of the hydraulic cylinders, every hydraulic circuit contains a small amount of fluid flowing into the accumulators. This leads to a small pressure change in the two hydraulic circuits. Thus, the actuators could generate an additional hydraulic force to restrict the bounce motion of the sprung mass relative to the unsprung mass. In the body pitch motion, all the front and rear suspensions are compressed and extended, respectively. The front and rear cylinder bodies move downward and upward relative to the piston rod, respectively. It reduces the volume of the front top and rear bottom chambers, and simultaneously increases the volume of the front bottom and rear top chambers. Thus, the fluid in <b>circuit</b> <b>B</b> flows into the corresponding accumulator B, and the fluid in the corresponding accumulator A flows into circuit A. Consequently, the pressures in circuits A and B are increased and decreased, respectively. It in return generates the large pitch restoring moment to prevent the vehicle body pitch motion relative to the unsprung mass.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for time domain transient simulation of electric power systems with or without power electronic (switching) subsystems. The new methodology has been named quadratic integration method. The method {{is based on the}} following two innovations: (a) the nonlinear system model equations (differential or differential-algebraic) are reformulated to a fully equivalent system of quadratic equations, by introducing additional state variables, and (b) the system model equations are integrated assuming that the system states vary quadratically within a time step (quadratic integration). The proposed method yields an implicit integration scheme which demonstrates improved convergence characteristics and most importantly improved solution precision. The approach also demonstrates superior behavior compared to traditionally used methods (such as the trapezoidal integration rule) in terms of accuracy and numerical stability properties, especially for switching systems. The method is free of artificial numerical oscillations. Details about the numerical properties of the method are discussed in the paper.

40|$|Abstract — One of {{the most}} widely used {{architectures}} for packet switches is the crossbar. A special version of a it is the buffered crossbar, where small buffers are associated with the crosspoints. The advantages of this organization, when compared to the unbuffered architecture, is that it needs much simpler and slower scheduling circuits, while it can shape the switched traffic according to a given set of Quality of Service (QoS) criteria in a more efficient way. Furthermore, by supporting variable length packets throughout a buffered crossbar: a) {{there is no need for}} segmentation and reassembly <b>circuits,</b> <b>b)</b> no internal speedup is necessary, and c) synchronization between the input and output clock domains is simplified.

Simulations show that the latency insensitive network allows excellent characterization of network performance in terms of the cost of routing, amount of blocking due to congestion, and message buffering. The network routers show that peak performance near 100 % link utilization is achieved under congestion and combining. This enables accurate high-level modeling of the behavior of the network fabric so that optimized network design, including placement and routing, can occur through high-level network synthesis tools. The chip also shows that when elastic interfaces are used at the boundary of clock synchronization points then efficient domain crossings can occur. Buffering at the synchronization points are required to allow for variability in clocking frequencies and correct data transmission.
