It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount, as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin. It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the relationship between these features is still being investigated.|$|E

However, in the past both the Great Whirl and the Socotra Gyre have been known to occasionally collapse, and their exact locations differ from year to year.

500|$|The Gulf Stream is {{typically}} [...] wide and [...] to [...] deep. [...] The <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> is fastest near the surface, with {{the maximum speed}} typically about [...] [...] As it travels north, the warm water transported by the Gulf Stream undergoes evaporative cooling. The cooling is wind-driven: Wind moving over the water causes evaporation, cooling the water and increasing its salinity and density. [...] When sea ice forms, salts are {{left out of the}} ice, a process known as brine exclusion. [...] These two processes produce water that is denser and colder (or, more precisely, water that is still liquid at a lower temperature). In the North Atlantic Ocean, the water becomes so dense that it begins to sink down through less salty and less dense water. (The convective action is not unlike that of a lava lamp.) This downdraft of cold, dense water becomes a part of the North Atlantic Deep Water, a southgoing stream.

40|$|Impact of hydrodynamics and {{seagrass}} habitat {{structure on}} the suspension feeder Cerastoderma eduleThe edible cockle Cerastoderma edule, {{one of the}} most common suspension feeder on the tidal flats along the European Atlantic Coast, shows large annual as well as site specific fluctuations in the survival and growth of juvenile and adult cockles. Amongst the main factors that may induce these variations are abnormal climatic conditions, predation by crustaceans and fish, intraspecific competition, and spat fall transport by near bottom flow. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of hydrodynamic exposure and habitat structures, as well as the interaction of these factors which may influencing the cockle population structure. The effect of different hydrodynamic exposure and seagrass habitat structure on the abundance, biomass and growth of C. edule was investigated in intertidal Zostera noltii beds and adjacent sand flats in the Wadden Sea, near the island of Sylt. Regardless of the seagrass density and hydrodynamic exposure, the abundance and biomass of cockles were generally higher inside the seagrass beds in comparison to the adjacent sand flats. However, transplantation of cockles of equal size into sheltered and exposed seagrass beds and sand flats resulted in lower growth rates of individuals in the seagrass beds. Furthermore, shell lengths and body weights of C. edule were distinctly higher in exposed than in sheltered seagrass beds, where individuals seemed to have starved. Highest growth rates were measured in areas with highest <b>current</b> <b>velocities.</b> Experiments carried out with an in situ three-currents-flume, which modifies tidal <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> within the same seagrass site, showed an increase in cockle shell length and body weight at mean <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> between 4 and 8 cm s- 1. Corresponding measurements of seston content and the percentage of POC and PON within the water column of the different flume lanes revealed highest seston values in lanes with the lowest <b>current</b> <b>velocities.</b> In contrast, values of the percentage of POC and PON increased with increasing current speeds. Thus it is concluded that seagrass vegetation positively effects the abundance of cockles, whereas the growth and condition of C. edule is controlled by <b>current</b> <b>velocities,</b> promoting the quality of food for C. edule at higher <b>current</b> <b>velocities...</b>|$|R

A subsequent study, published in March 2005, revealed further details about this star: [...] Tycho G was probably a main-sequence star or subgiant before the explosion, but some of its mass was stripped away and its outer layers were shock-heated by the supernova. Tycho G's <b>current</b> <b>velocity</b> is perhaps the strongest evidence that it was the companion star to the white dwarf, as it is traveling at a rate of 136km/s, which is more than four times faster than the mean velocity of other stars in its stellar neighbourhood.|$|E

The comparison of the models showed that the ANN model outperforms the ANFIS model.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between physical, {{chemical and biological}} processes influencing lagoonal and coastal bottoms are poorly understood, despite their ecological and economic importance in relation to aquaculture, and particularly shellfish farming. In such systems, {{it is known that}} the biota may {{play an important role in}} determining the erosion potential of intertidal and subtidal sediments. An increase in erosion rate may result from bioturbation due to burrowing organisms, particularly bivalves, associated with physical disturbance due to tidal currents. Within this framework, a laboratory benthic annular flume system (AFS) was deployed to evaluate the relationship between sediment stability of a subtidal mudflat and density of the infaunal Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, under the influence of different <b>current</b> <b>velocities.</b> There was a significant correlation between mean erosion rate and <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> in all treatments with clams (P < 0. 001). There was also a significant correlation between mean erosion rate and R. philippinarum density (P < 0. 001), reflecting bioturbation enhanced sediment erosion. The effects of clam density on sediment erodibility were more marked at the lower <b>current</b> <b>velocities.</b> In the control, the critical erosion velocity (Ūcrit) was about 32 cm s- 1. With increasing R. philippinarum density, Ūcrit decreased down to the minimum value of about 20 cm s- 1 at a density of 206 clams m- 2. Our study led to the conclusion that the burrowing activity of R. philippinarum reduces sediment stability, particularly at relatively low <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> (25 cm s- 1) and at densities below those found in the clam cultivation areas...|$|R

40|$|Seiche {{oscillations}} {{in a free}} entrance bay are investigated {{within the}} framework of the linear theory of long waves in two-dimensional formulation. Analytical solution for a rectangular basin of constant depth for the case when the nodal line of the level is located at the basin entrance is obtained. It is shown that allowance for two-dimensional spatial character is important for transverse seiches: the wave currents depend on two spatial coordinates, and their amplitudes are the functions of the basin width and length. The amplitudes of wave <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> are the functions of the basin width and length for transversal seiches and are directly proportional to the initial level deviations as well as inversely proportional to square root of the basin depth. It is found that for the longitudinal seiches the wave <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> are normal to the bay entrance and their maximum values do not depend on its width and length. The longitudinal seiches are characterized by the highest velocities of the wave currents. The features of the seiches in a free entrance basin and in a completely enclosed one are compared, their similarities and differences are determined. The lowest seiche mode in the basin with a free entrance is the Helmholtz mode. It is absent in an enclosed basin and also this mode has no nodal lines within the bay. Wave current for the Helmholtz mode is always directed perpendicularly to the basin entrance and its maximum velocity does not depend on the basin width and length. It is directly proportional to free surface initial deviation and inversely proportional to square root of the basin depth. The lowest <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> will take place at an open boundary of the basin.

Bistatic operation is illustrated by application to a bistatic pair: Both remote systems receive backscattered echo, with one remote system in addition receiving bistatic echoes transmitted by the other. The pair produces elliptical velocity components in addition to two sets of radials. Results are compared with drifter measurements and checks performed on internal consistency in the radar results. We show that differences in drifter/radar <b>current</b> <b>velocities</b> are consistent with calculated radar data uncertainties.
