50|$|Although many {{different}} models were offered {{with hundreds of}} possible variations, the general layout and configuration of the boats were rather consistent between models. Most boats had an upper salon with helm controls at deck level. Aft and a few feet lower than deck, a galley with a <b>convertible</b> <b>settee</b> was standard. Below the salon was a cuddy cabin consisting of two double beds with a narrow passage between them. Sometimes a storage locker or dresser was installed in place {{of one of the}} berths or the berth width was lessened to accommodate it. A stand-up head was placed under the helm allowing room for an enclosed stand-up shower or 36” tub surround in addition to the head and small sink.|$|E
50|$|Swan 65 sleeps 12 in four cabin spaces - two in {{forecastle}} in pipe cots, four in two forward cabins in pilot berths, {{three in}} main cabin in pilot berths and <b>convertible</b> <b>settee,</b> and {{three in a}} single and a double berth in the aft cabin. The saloon is roomy and not as dark as the narrow coach roof windows might suggest. Below the decks the sixty five offers very good combination of ocean going practicality and comfort as the berths are relatively small and secure, but the galley and chart table areas {{as well as the}} dining area are large, well equipped and very practical. A cut out in the bulkhead allows passing items and communication between the galley and the U- Shaped dining area. On some sixty fives this bulkhead is solid while on others it’s completely open with just a pillar running from {{the lower part of the}} bulkhead to the deck head. Forward of the saloon are two matching guest cabins with upper and lower single berths parallel to the centerline. Two forward heads with WC lavatory and shower. The owners stateroom in the aft is very spacious, having a double and a single berth, dressing table, cupboards and wardrobes and with WC lavatory and shower. The U-Shaped galley is large, well ventilated and equipped with double stainless steel sink, pressure water system, water heater, top opening refrigerator and deep freeze range/owen and ample storage areas. Throughout the history of Nautor the yard has provided their customers with a chance to choose the interior materials and lay-out to suit their liking which is why some of the interior arrangements deviate from the standard. Some yachts like Sayula II has even a small workshop fitted inside the boat to make repairs at sea easier.|$|E
50|$|Robin Day {{continued}} to expand Hille’s furniture collections throughout the 1950s, pioneering technical innovations such as frames made of {{flat bar steel}} or square-section tubular steel. His Single <b>Convertible</b> Bed <b>Settee</b> (1957), with its lightweight foam cushions and simple swing-down wooden seat back, characterised the elegant flexibility of his designs. Day was a great advocate of Pirelli rubber webbing, which he adopted {{as a replacement for}} traditional coil-sprung upholstery. In fact, he admired it {{to such a degree that}} he left it exposed as a decorative feature on several designs, including the Gatwick Chair (1958), created for Gatwick Airport, and a modular seating system called the Form Group (1960), one of several Design Centre Award winners.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{original}} business idea of Pekka Koskenkylä, the Swan 36 had {{to be not only}} a winner, but its interior also had to be different and more luxurious than any of the earlier and existing S&S #1710 designs. Because of this and also because of regional marketing reasons a famous Swedish naval architect Olle Enderlein was hired to assist Sparkman & Stephens in designing the interior to Swan 36. The result was something very different with wide open spaces and completely non fiberglass atmosphere. This interior design allowed the sleeping capacity to be increased from six to seven which was one more than its predecessors had to offer. This was achieved by putting a wide <b>convertible</b> U-Shaped <b>settee</b> to the port side of the saloon. With the table in raised position it gave comfortable area for six persons to eat and with the table in lowered position it converted into a large double bed while leaving the aisle free for people to walk back and forth. With the lifting back rest on the settee the mid ships sleeping capacity was raised to three. The interior design also featured an unusually large galley which occupied most of the starboard side of the saloon. This saloon arrangement had its clear advantages while in port but some sailors thought it was not entirely practical while under sail and because of this customer feedback the interior was largely re-designed to the succeeding model Swan 37.|$|R
