40|$|The {{objective}} of most US institutions with assets to invest is to fund {{some sort of}} liability, {{as is the case}} with banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and so forth. As a result, asset/liability management (ALM) should be the investment focus and the basis for selecting the <b>core</b> <b>portfolio.</b> Insurance companies may be the birthplace of ALM and certainly have been the model of ALM discipline, thanks to the heavy regulations imposed on them. IAIS Standard No. 13 (International Association of Insurance Supervisors 2006) defines asset/liability management as the practice of man-aging a business so that decisions and actions taken with respect to assets and liabilities are coordinated. Therein lies the essence of proper ALM: It should be an orchestrated event based on enhancing the funded ratio (assets/liabili-ties). It should not have any other objective or interference, such as generic market indices, peer group comparisons, or inflation. In short, ALM can be defined as the process that deals with interest rate risk management. Banks and insurance companies have practiced ALM since their incep...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies an {{acquisition}} and remanufacturing {{problem in a}} market-driven multi-product remanufacturing system, where the remanufacturer acquires multiple used products (cores) of highly variable quality under independently uncertain demand and carbon emissions regulation. In order to balance between the environmental and economic benefit, the problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming model in presence of the quality variability of cores and carbon tax scheme, subject to budget and risk constraints. Since {{the average cost of}} the remanufactured products is independent of the remanufacturing quantity, the model is then decomposed into two separated sub-problems, namely the remanufacturing problem and the acquisition problem. In the remanufacturing problem, the optimal remanufacturing policies, including the optimal remanufacturing cost thresholds and the optimal remanufacturing rate, are derived. In the acquisition problem, the optimal policies of <b>core</b> <b>portfolio,</b> acquisition quantities, and remanufacturing quantities can be derived. The acquisition problem, viewed as an extended Multi-Product Newsvendor Problem (MPNP), is a convex optimization problem. Furthermore, a two-tier bisection method with polynomial computational complexity can be developed to obtain the optimal policies based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to show the application of the model and the effect of the quality variability. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The {{private capital}} {{business}} for public REITs {{was started by}} Kimco Realty, Developer Diversified, AMB and ProLogis during the years 1998 - 2000, {{at the time when}} the public equity was not easily available. Over the past decade, public REITs have used their private capital funds to take out REITs' existing portfolios and newly completed projects, to finance land purchases and development pipelines, and to diversify their rental income into a fee income business. Given the limited disclosure of public REITs in their private capital funds and a lack of standardized industry terms and practice applicable to this field, this research can be described a fact-finding study. By studying each of the private capital funds managed by 7 leading REIT managers, I categorize these funds in terms of fund type, inception year, fund life, fund style strategy, investment target, geographical focus, fund terms, target leverage, key investors, parent REIT's ownership, gross fund assets, distribution frequent and incentive design. In addition, I argue that the private capital business of public REITs would not have grown successfully without fuel of the merchant development activities under the public REIT's framework. This is particularly true with respect to the industrial REIT sector. I carefully examine the case of ProLogis' business model, comprised of three indispensable pillars - merchant building, fund management and <b>core</b> <b>portfolio,</b> to substantiate this claim. By creating a new structure diagram of "public REIT-sponsored private capital fund", I demonstrate the "co-opetition" phenomenon among pension funds, real estate investment managers ("REIMs") and public REIT private capital funds in the value chain of the institutional real estate investment. (cont.) The concept can be described by the fact that two primary investors (pension funds and REIMs) of this field could themselves replicate what public REIT private capital funds are doing. I also relate this observation to the real estate M&A deals that occurred in 2007, where REIMs were observed to "arbitrage" between public REIT and private real estate markets by taking the public REITs private. Moving forward, public REIT-sponsored private capital fund is well positioned to grow as it complements a niche market for pension funds and REIMs to add private real estate exposure in a predictable and sizeable format. However, concerns on above 75 % FFO coming from merchant development and private capital for leading REITs (such as ProLogis) may trigger regulatory scrutiny from Internal Revenue Service, as this represents a huge deviation from original purpose of being a REIT - to act as passive investor for <b>core</b> <b>portfolio</b> holding and pay out as dividends most of its net income. In an extreme scenario, REITs like ProLogis may voluntarily or involuntarily spin off their private capital business. Under current capital market conditions, this might actually unlock public REITs' shareholder value. Referencing from mid-cap asset managers' comparable (such as Eaton Vance and Janus Capital), REITs' private capital business can be valued from the 4 x price-earnings multiple to a likely 20 - 30 x range. by Cervantes Lee.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an inquiry into}} the historical performance of core institutional real estate investment property during the 1984 - 2003 period. The focus of the analysis is on identifying systematic determinants of long run investment performance. The analysis seeks to increase our understanding of equilibrium asset pricing within this asset class, as well to provide some useful perspective for <b>core</b> <b>portfolio</b> strategic or tactical planning. This thesis extends earlier research by Geltner (1999) and Li and Price (2005) that indicated that a classical single-factor CAPM accurately modeled the cross-section of long-run total returns across the major asset classes, including real estate. The present thesis narrows that earlier focus {{to concentrate on the}} cross-section of long-run total return performance within the core institutional real estate asset class. This thesis uses the property level data of the NCREIF Index to construct portfolios and historical return indexes based on property size (value), and based on CBSA "tier" (that is, "upper", "middle", and "tertiary" cities from an institutional investment perspective). By using unique portfolios created from the NCREIF property set that represent possible factors that systematically affect asset pricing, such as property location, property size and property type, and calculating their beta estimates from historical data, this thesis tests various CAPM models including the single factor Sharpe-Linter model, as well as a multi factor Fama-French-like model. The beta for the portfolios was defined with respect to the performance of the aggregate of all NCREIF properties. This thesis finds that an equilibrium asset pricing model consisting of the two Fama-French-like factors, property size and MSA tier, plus property type dummy variables, explains some 90 % of the long-run historical cross-section of core property portfolio returns. Interestingly, the "market factor", the beta with respect to aggregate NCREIF, is found to be insignificant, and possibly a negative influence on expected return. Furthermore, the size factor works opposite to the way it does in the stock market, with larger properties commanding an expected return premium. Surprisingly, the city "tier" factor gives an expected return premium to upper tier cities. Tests for an "income factor" (similar to the Fama-French book-to-market factor) found this factor to be insignificant. The most significant factor was found to be the property type. Thus, the equilibrium asset price model that seems to work well within the institutional core real estate asset class seems to be very different from, almost opposite to, the analogous model within the stock market. by Arvind Pai.

40|$|Background: Crowded teeth develop {{when there}} is not enough space in the jaws into which the teeth can erupt. This gives the patient crooked or wonky teeth and cause them to present for treatment. Crowding can affect the baby teeth (primary dentition) and/or the adult teeth (permanent dentition). Crowding tends to {{increase}} with age, especially in the lower jaw, so that only a third of adults have well aligned lower front teeth (incisors) 1. Crowding of the adult teeth can also occur when space is lost following the early loss of baby teeth either as a result of tooth decay or trauma. The Cochrane Oral Health Group undertook an extensive prioritisation exercise in 2014 to identify a <b>core</b> <b>portfolio</b> of titles that were the most clinically important ones to maintain on the Cochrane Library and this review was identified as a priority title by the orthodontic expert panel. Objectives: To test the null hypotheses that there are no differences in outcomes between 1) the age at which orthodontic treatment for crowded teeth is carried out; 2) different orthodontic interventions for correcting/preventing crowded teeth against the alternative hypothesis that there are. Search methods: We searched the following databases were searched up to July 2016 : Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE. No restrictions were placed on language or date of publication when searching databases. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on any active interventions such as orthodontic braces (removable, fixed, functional), head-braces or extractions, against controls of no treatment, delayed treatment or another active intervention. The studies included had at least 80 % of participants aged 16 years old and under. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted information regarding methods, participants, interventions, outcomes, harms and results, independently and in duplicate. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. Main results: 19 RCTs were identified which included 1, 101 participants. A meta-analysis was carried out on four papers, two that compared copper NiTi to NiTi and two that compared vibrational appliances to controls. No difference was found between either type of intervention. Additionally, subgroup analyses were carried out on thirteen other comparisons that revealed: there is low level evidence that Lower Lingual Arches and lip bumpers maintain space and prevent crowding, that the Schwarz appliance reduces crowding in the lower arch, that coaxial NiTi is better at treating crowding in the lower arch than single stranded NiTi and that self-ligating brackets are over {{a minute and a half}} quicker to untie and ligate than conventional brackets. No other statistically significant outcomes were found that were clinically significant, in any of the other comparisons. There were an insufficient number of studies to allow analysis between different age groups. Authors' conclusions: 1) There is currently insufficient evidence to allow analysis and comparisons between different age groups. 2) There are three interventions that are effective at preventing crowding in the early dentition that are the Lower Lingual Arch, lip bumper and Schwarz appliance. There is some evidence to suggest that Coaxial NiTi is better at aligning teeth and reducing crowding than single-stranded NiTi. An additional outcome of clinical interest was that self-ligating brackets are quicker to untie and ligate than conventional brackets, saving clinical time. Further high-quality evidence is needed...|$|E

40|$|Technology {{licensing}} agreements potentially {{can create}} future appropriabilityproblems. Drawing on the appropriability literature, {{we argue that}} {{the inclusion of a}} grantback clause in technology licensing agreements is an attempt to balance the gains from and protection of the focal firms’ technologies.

We hypothesize also that technological uncertainty is a positive moderator in the decision to include a grant-back clause, if the licensed technology is close to either the licensee’s or the licensor’s core technologies. We employ a hierarchical nested decision model to test the hypotheses on a sample of 397 licensed technologies. This method allows us to model the choice to include a grant-back clause as nested in the decision about which technologies to license out. We find broad support for our theoretical arguments...|$|R
