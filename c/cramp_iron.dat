6000|$|I {{thought of}} the blowing up of Hell Gate; of the geysers in the Yellowstone Park; of Jonah and his whale: but the lively original, as I watched it {{foreshortened}} from above, exceeded all these things. He staggered to the bench, the heavy wooden seat <b>cramped</b> with <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> into the enduring stone, and clung there with his left hand. It quivered and shook, as a breakwater-pile quivers to the rush of landward-racing seas; nor was there lacking when he caught his breath, the [...] "scream of a maddened beach dragged down by the tide." [...] His right hand was upon the doctor's collar, so that the two shook to one paroxysm, pendulums vibrating together, while I, apart, shook with them.|$|R

The architectural marble elements of the entrance and the orthostats on the front row were tied to each other with lead-soldered <b>iron</b> <b>cramps.</b> In front of the entrance a granite pavement was uncovered, consisting of hexagonal blocks - 0.70 by 0.70 m diagonally.|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} Mughal {{building}} is the domed tomb of Humayun, built between 1562 and 1571 by a Persian architect. The central dome likely has {{a core of}} brick, {{as can be seen}} in the later stripped tomb of Khan-i-Khanan. The central dome is faced with marble blocks in attached to the core by alternating wide and narrow layers and there is evidence of the use of <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> to secure them. <b>Iron</b> <b>cramps</b> may also help form a tension ring at the base of the dome. The central double dome covers an octagonal central chamber about 15 meters wide and is accompanied by small domed chattri made of brick and faced with stone. Smaller domes were widely made with rectangular bricks beginning in the 16th century, the necessary curvature being created by tapering the mortar joints. Chatris, the domed kiosks on pillars characteristic of Mughal roofs, were adopted from their Hindu use as cenotaphs.|$|R

50|$|There were {{at least}} two bridges on this spot. The first, less massive than its successor, was {{probably}} contemporary {{with the construction of}} the Wall in AD 122-4. It crossed the river on a series of at least eight hexagonal stone piers about 13 ft apart: the first of these (from the east) can be seen where it has been incorporated into the stonework of the later abutment. The overall length of the bridge between abutments was 200 ft. The width of these piers suggests that the bridge was intended to convey a structure 10 ft wide - the width of the Broad Wall in this area - and that it therefore carried Hadrian's Wall across the river with a series of small stone arches. The masonry appears to have been plain but substantial, and the surviving hexagonal pier bears traces of dovetail <b>cramps</b> of <b>iron</b> set in lead which would have held the stones tightly together.|$|R
25|$|At the Timurid {{capital of}} Samarkand, nobles and rulers in the 14th and 15th centuries began {{building}} tombs with double-shelled domes containing cylindrical masonry drums between the shells. In the Gur-e Amir, built by Timur around 1404, a timber framework {{on the inner}} dome supports the outer, bulbous dome. Radial tie-bars {{at the base of}} the bulbous dome provide additional structural support. Timber reinforcement rings and rings of stone linked by <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> were also used to compensate for the structural problems introduced by using such drums. Radial sections of brick walls with wooden struts were used between the shells of discontinuous double domes to provide structural stability as late at the 14th century.|$|R
50|$|Gwilt {{was drawn}} towards the study {{rather than the}} active {{practice}} of architecture, and from early on he devoted himself to archæological pursuits. He wrote many papers for the Archæologia and the Vetusta Monumenta of the Society of Antiquaries, {{of which he was}} elected a fellow on 14 December 1815. In 1820 he superintended the rebuilding of the tower and spire of Wren's church of St. Mary-le-Bow in the City of London, the upper part of which had to be taken down due to the decay of the <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> used to hold the stones together. The foundations of the building, which incorporate Norman and even supposed Roman remains, were repaired at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|A spire {{declared}} {{the presence of}} the gothic church at a distance and advertised its connection to heaven. The tall, slender pyramidal twelfth-century spire on the south tower Chartres Catedral is one of the earliest spires. Openwork spires were an astounding architectural innovation, beginning with the early fourteenth-century spire at Freiburg Minster, in which the pierced stonework was held together by <b>iron</b> <b>cramps.</b> The openwork spire, according to Robert Bork, represents a [...] "radical but logical extension of the Gothic tendency towards skeletal structure." [...] The organic skeleton of Antoni Gaudi's phenomenal spires at the Sagrada Família in Barcelona represent an outgrowth of this Gothic tendency. Designed and begun by Gaudi in 1884, they were not completed until the 20th century.|$|R
2500|$|Originally the {{structure}} ran perfectly straight, {{but during the}} construction of the Fatih Mosque – for unknown reasons – it was bent in that section. The masonry is not regular, and uses a combination of ashlar blocks and bricks. The first row of arches is built with well-squared stone blocks; the upper row is built with four to seven courses of stones alternated with a bed of smaller material (opus caementitium) clamped with <b>iron</b> <b>cramps.</b> The width of the aqueduct bridge varies [...] from 7.75 metres to 8.24 metres. The pillars are 3.70 metres thick, and the arches of the lower order are 4 metres wide. As a result of geophysical surveys performed in 2009, it is now known that pillars' foundations are approximately 5.4–6.0m below the present-day surface.|$|R
5000|$|The {{overall design}} {{was that of}} a Greek cross with a massive portico of Corinthian columns. Its ambitious lines called for a vast {{building}} 110 metres long by 84 metres wide, and 83 metres high. No less vast was its crypt. Soufflot's masterstroke is concealed from casual view: the triple dome, each shell fitted within the others, permits a view through the oculus of the coffered inner dome of the second dome, frescoed by Antoine Gros with The Apotheosis of Saint Genevieve. The outermost dome is built of stone bound together with <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> and covered with lead sheathing, rather than of carpentry construction, as was the common French practice of the period. Concealed flying buttresses pass the massive weight of the triple construction outwards to the portico columns.|$|R
6000|$|Here--not {{to speak}} of the noble rooms and halls--there are numberless treasures beyond all price; too {{valuable}} in their way for me to select any one as more curious and valuable than many others. Letters of statesmen and warriors of all nations, and several centuries back,--among which, long as it has taken Europe to produce them, I saw none so illustrious as those of Washington, nor more so than Franklin's, whom America gave to the world in her nonage; and epistles of poets and artists, and of kings, too, whose chirography appears to have been much better than I should have expected from fingers so often <b>cramped</b> in <b>iron</b> gauntlets. In another case there were the original autograph copies of several famous works,--for example, that of Pope's Homer, written on the backs of letters, the direction and seals of which appear in the midst of [...] "the Tale of Troy divine," [...] which also is much scratched and interlined with Pope's corrections; a manuscript of one of Ben Jonson's masques; of the Sentimental Journey, written in much more careful and formal style than might be expected, the book pretending to be a harum-scarum; of Walter Scott's Kenilworth, bearing such an aspect of straightforward diligence that I shall hardly think of it again as a romance;--in short, I may as well drop the whole matter here.|$|R
50|$|The church {{took five}} years to {{complete}} {{largely because of the}} Incorporated Church Building Society’s concerns with the experimental roof structure. The Society provided grants for church construction, but could force changes on the design requested by its panel of architects, as a condition of making the grant. The panel repeatedly rejected Prior’s design. Its members included J. P. Seddon, James Brooks, Ewan Christian and J. O. Scott and subsequently David Brandon, William White and Norman Shaw. Prior provided detailed structural plans and justifications for the roof, providing information {{on a wide range of}} existing examples, including the Treasury, Merton College, Oxford, The Hall at Ightham Mote and Shaw’s hall at Adcote, Shropshire. Prior made some alterations, including the omission of <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> and ties and had his calculations checked by leading civil engineers. As a result, the design was allowed to proceed.|$|R
25|$|Islamic {{rule over}} {{northern}} and central India {{brought with it}} the use of domes constructed with stone, brick and mortar, and <b>iron</b> dowels and <b>cramps.</b> Centering was made from timber and bamboo. The use of <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> to join together adjacent stones was known in pre-Islamic India, and was used {{at the base of}} domes for hoop reinforcement. The synthesis of styles created by this introduction of new forms to the Hindu tradition of trabeate construction created a distinctive architecture. Domes in pre-Mughal India have a standard squat circular shape with a lotus design and bulbous finial at the top, derived from Hindu architecture. Because the Hindu architectural tradition did not include arches, flat corbels were used to transition from the corners of the room to the dome, rather than squinches. In contrast to Persian and Ottoman domes, the domes of Indian tombs tend to be more bulbous.|$|R
25|$|The dome is 42 meters {{wide and}} made of two shells. A {{stairway}} winds between them. Eight white stone external ribs mark {{the edges of the}} eight sides, next to the red tile roofing, and extend {{from the base of the}} dome to the base of the cupola. Each of the eight sides of the dome also conceal a pair of intermediate stone ribs that are connected to the main ribs by means of a series of masonry rings. A temporary wooden tension ring still exists near the bottom of the dome. Three horizontal chains of sandstone blocks notched together and reinforced with lead-coated <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> also extend the entire circumference of the dome: one at the base (where radial struts from this chain protrude to the exterior), one a third of the way up the dome, and one two thirds of the way up the dome. Only four major cracks have been observed on the inner dome, compared to about fourteen each on the domes of the Pantheon and St. Peter's Basilica.|$|R
500|$|The current central dome, {{above the}} pendentives, is about [...] thick. It is about [...] wide and {{contains}} 40 radial ribs that spring {{from between the}} 40 windows at its base. Four of the windows were blocked as part of repairs in the 10th century. The ring of windows {{at the base of}} the central dome are in the portion where the greatest hoop tension would have been expected and so they may have been used to help alleviate cracking along the meridians. <b>Iron</b> <b>cramps</b> between the marble blocks of its cornice helped to reduce outward thrusts at the base and limit cracking, like the wooden tension rings used in other Byzantine brick domes. The dome and pendentives are supported by four large arches springing from four piers. Additionally, two huge semi-domes of similar proportion are placed on opposite sides of the central dome and themselves contain smaller semi-domes between an additional four piers. The Hagia Sophia, as both the cathedral of Constantinople and the church of the adjacent Great Palace of Constantinople, has a form of octagonal plan.|$|R

6000|$|Poor Captain Mohammed of the Mukhbir, who {{had already}} escaped one shipwreck, was in mortal terror: he at once got up steam, and kept his weary vigil all night. He was {{perfectly}} safe, as the northern reef, under which the Sambúk Musahhil rode easily as if in smooth water, and the headland, Ras el-Tárah, formed a complete defence against the Aylí, while the natural pier to the south would have protected him from its complement, the Azyab or [...] "south-easter."

Gentle and simple, high and low--the Hayes, the Fowles, the Fenners, the Collinses--they were all in a tale against me. Only Sir John Pelham up yonder at Brightling bade me heart-up and go on. Yet how could I? Did I ask Master Collins for his timber-tug to haul beams? The oxen had gone to Lewes after lime. Did he promise me a set of <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> or ties for the roof?

40|$|Abstract Introduction Perforation {{caused by}} capsule {{endoscopy}} impaction is extremely rare and, at present, only five cases of perforation from capsule endoscopy impaction {{are reported in}} the literature. Case presentation We report here two cases of patients with undiagnosed small bowel stenosis presenting with acute perforation after capsule endoscopy. Strictures in the small bowel were likely the inciting mechanism leading to acute small bowel obstruction and subsequent distension and perforation above the capsule {{in the area of}} maximal serosal tension. Case 1 was a 55 -year-old Italian woman who underwent capsule endoscopy because of recurrent postprandial <b>cramping</b> pain and <b>iron</b> deficiency anemia, in the setting of negative imaging studies including an abdominal ultrasound, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy and small bowel follow-through radiograph. She developed a symptomatic bowel obstruction approximately 36 hours after ingestion of the capsule. Emergent surgery was performed to remove the capsule, which was impacted at a stenosis due to a previously undiagnosed ileal adenocarcinoma, leading to perforation. Case 2 was a 60 -year-old Italian man with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea who underwent capsule endoscopy after conventional modalities, including comprehensive blood and stool studies, computed tomography, an abdominal ultrasound, upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, barium enema and small bowel follow-through, were not diagnostic. Our patient developed abdominal distension, acute periumbilical pain, fever and leukocytosis 20 hours after capsule ingestion. Emergent surgery was performed to remove the capsule, which was impacted at a previously undiagnosed ileal Crohn’s stricture, leading to perforation. Conclusions The present report shows that, although the risk of acute complication is very low, the patient should be informed of the risks involved in capsule endoscopy, including the need for emergency surgical exploration. </p...|$|R
6000|$|As we have said, {{the sloping}} {{foundation}} of the building was cut {{into a series of}} terraces or steps. There were seven of these. The first operation was the cutting of thirty-six holes in the solid rock, into which iron hold-fasts were securely fixed. The cutting of these holes or sockets was ingeniously managed. First, three small holes were drilled into the rock; and then these were broken into one large hole, which was afterwards smoothed, enlarged, and undercut, so as to be of dovetail form; the size of each being 7 and a half inches broad and 2 and a half inches wide at the top, and an inch broader at the bottom. They were about sixteen inches deep. Thirty-six massive malleable iron hold-fasts were then inserted, and wedged into the places thus prepared for them, besides being filled up with lead, so that no force of any kind could draw them out. The next proceeding was to place beams of solid oak timber, lengthwise, on the first step, thus bringing it level with the second step. Timbers of the same kind were then placed above and across these, bringing the level up to the third step. The next [...] "course" [...] of timbers was again laid, lengthwise, bringing the level to the fourth step, and so on to the seventh, above which two completely circular timber courses were laid, thus making a perfectly flat and solid foundation on which the remainder of the column might rest. The building, therefore, had no tendency to slide, even although it had not been held in its place by the thirty-six hold-fasts before mentioned. In addition to this, the various courses of timber were fastened to the rock and to each other by means of numerous <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> and bolts, and wooden trenails.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{earliest}} times, wrought <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> and dowels {{were used in}} the traditional masonry structures to secure stones which might be prone to movement or displacement. In the period between the late 19 th century and the early 20 th century, masonry-clad buildings are exploded to use. However, due to the porous nature of the mortar and the inconsistent fill around the steel members, the protective oxide film is lost over time, resulting in corrosion of the steel framing and other embedded metals. The metals which are used for historical construction are cast iron, steel and wrought iron. The causes of metal deterioration are corrosion, mechanical breakdown, weathering and connection failure. The traditional restorations are repair, replacement and jointing method. And new, a new method, cathodic protection, is also applied on historical building restoration. New materials began to be used for replacing the original materials, The most common have been aluminum, epoxies, reinforced polyester, glass fiber-reinforced concrete and titanium. The first cathodic protection system for stone clad steel framing was installed in 1991. Cathodic protection (CP) prevents corrosion by converting all of the anodic sites on the metal surface to cathodic sites by supplying electrical current from an alternate source. Different from the traditional way, CP method does not to remove the masonry and install new masonry back. According to Roberto Pane, the extreme variety of cases and the need for safeguarding a large amount of monuments shows that restoration can not be constrained within stiff limits. As a conclusion of this studying, due to the former experience, the Barcelona Cathedral’s façade can be considered to use the CP method for restoration blend with the old with regard to size, scale and appearance...|$|R
40|$|A burial mound was {{excavated}} in 2009 {{near the}} village of Dolno Izvorovo, Kazanlak district. In its south periphery a monumental tomb was found with north-south orientation. Because of the intensive fluvial processes the level of the surrounding terrain has raised and at present the monument is lying under it. The tomb consists of a corridor, first rectangular and second circular chambers. It has been partially destroyed and robbed in Antiquity. The two chambers are built of granite stones fastened with <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> poured with led. The floors are covered with stone slabs. All interior surfaces are overlaid with white plaster. The circular chamber roof is corbelled from the first row. The dome consists of nine rows of sector blocks of different height. Opposite the entrance there is a ritual stone bed with plastic decoration in mode of κλινη and two stools. There are two platforms on the east and west sides of the chamber. The entrance is framed in Ionic order and there are two holes for a wooden folding door on the threshold. The rectangular chamber is built of five rows of granite stones. Its entrance is also with Ionic frame /the lintel is not preserved/. It has been closed with stone folding door with coffers. Two antes with capitals flank the entrance - probably they have supported an epistyle. Massive local stones form the facade {{on both sides of the}} antes. The walls of the corridor are perpendicular to the facade and have the same masonry. The floor is of tamped soil. A member of the Thracian aristocracy was buried in the tomb. His battle horse was sacrificed in the first chamber, while the warrior himself with his personal belongings and funeral gifts was placed in the second chamber. Because of the plundering of the tomb most of the finds are missing. Only a few fragments and parts of artifacts are found. They are made of metal, clay, wood and bone. Among them there are gilt bronze and clay parts of a wreath, golden buttons and beads, a silver rosette and loops, bone beads, a ceramic vessel, two amphorae, iron nails and hinges from the wooden doors. According to the architecture and the artifacts, the funeral and the closure of the tomb are dated to the last decade of 4 th century BC...|$|R
40|$|Plate-bandes are {{straight}} masonry arches (they are called, also, flat arches or lintel arches). Ideally {{they have the}} surfaces of extrados and intrados plane and horizontal. The stones or bricks have radial joints converging usually in one centre. The voussoirs have the form of wedges and in French they are called "claveaux". A plate-bande is, in fact, a lintel made of several stones and the proportions of lintels and plate-bandes are similar. Proportions of plate-bandes, that {{is the relationship between}} the thickness t and the span s (t/s) varies, typically between 1 / 4 – 1 / 3 in thick plate-bandes, and is less than 1 / 20 in the most slender ones. A ratio of circa 1 / 8 was usual in the 18 th Century and follows a simple geometrical rule: the centre form with the intrados an equilateral triangle and the plate-bande should contain an arc of circle. The joints are usually plane, but in some cases present a «rebated» or «stepped» form. 	Plate-bandes exert an inclined thrust as any masonry arch. This thrust is usually very high and it requires either massive buttresses, or to be built in the middle of thick walls. Master builders and architects have tried since antiquity to calculate the abutment necessary for any arch. A modern architect or engineer will measure the arch thrust in units of force, kN or tons. Traditionally, the thrust has been measured as the size of the buttresses to resist it safely. Old structural rules, then, addressed the design problem establishing a relationship between the span and the depth of the buttress. These were empirical rules, particular for every type of arch or structure in every epoch. Thus, the typical gothic buttress is 1 / 4 of the vault span, but a Renaissance or baroque barrel vault will need more than 1 / 3 of the span. A plate-bande would require more than one half of the span; this is precisely the rule cited by the French engineer Gautier, who tried unsuccessfully to justify it by static reasons. They were used, typically, to form the lintels of windows or doors (1 - 2 m, typically); in Antiquity they were used, also, though rarely, at the gates of city walls or in niches (ca. 2 m, reaching 5. 2 m). 	Plate-bandes may show particular problems: it is not unusual that some sliding of the voussoirs can be observed, particularly in thick plate-bandes. The stepped joints on Fig. 1, left, were used to avoid this problem. There are other «hidden» methods, like <b>iron</b> <b>cramps</b> or the use of stone wedges, etc. In seismic zones these devices were usual. Another problem relates to the deformation; a slight yielding of the abutments, or even the compression of the mortar joints, may lead to some cracking and the descent of the central keystone. Even a tiny descent will convert the original straight line of the intrados in a broken line with a visible «kink» or angle in the middle. Of course, both problems should be avoided. Finally, the wedge form of the voussoirs lead to acute angles in the stones and this can produce partial fractures; this occurs usually at the inferior border of the springers at the abutments. 	It follows, that to build a successful plate-bande is not an easy matter. Also, the structural study of plate-bandes is far from simple, and mechanics and geometry are related in a particular way. In the present paper we will concentrate on the structural aspects and their constructive consequences, with a historical approach. We will outline the development of structural analysis of plate-bandes from ca. 1700 until today. This brief history has a more than purely academic interest. Different approaches and theories pointed to particular problem, and though the solution given may have been incorrect, the question posed was often pertinent. The paper ends with the application of modern Limit Analysis of Masonry Structures, developed mainly by professor Heyman in the last fifty years. The work aims, also, to give some clues for the actual architect and engineer involved in the analysis or restoration of masonry buildings...|$|R
