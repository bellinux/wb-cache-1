5000|$|In 1962 {{a report}} {{published}} by the British Royal College of Physicians, Smoking and Health, revealed findings which linked smoking with respiratory disease. The publication of the report led to the 1965 ban on cigarette advertising on television, and in 1987, {{a statement from the}} Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain ordered that British pharmacies [...] "should not sell tobacco or tobacco products, including <b>cigarettes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>tobacco,</b> from registered pharmacy premises". It was still possible to buy cigarettes from pharmacies in Britain until 2001. Tobacco products may be purchased in British supermarkets which may also include a pharmacy aisle on the same premises; however, tobacco must be sold from a separate kiosk and, following the Health Act 2009, tobacco products may not be displayed openly but held in a closed cabinet or under a counter.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} smoke and smoke {{fractions}} from tobacco and a substitute smoking material (NSM) on the DNA content of mammaliam cells in culture were measured. Tobacco smoke caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in the DNA content of all the mammalian cells exposed compared with controls. NSM smoke {{did not have a}} significant effect on the DNA content of the exposed cells (P less than 0. 95). Smoke from blends of NSM and tobacco caused changes in DNA content in proportion to the amount of tobacco in the mixtures. Condensate from <b>cigarettes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>tobacco</b> or blends of tobacco and NSM caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in DNA content of mammalian cell populations in culture, whereas equal weights of condensate from NSM alone or NSM containing nicotine did not cause significant changes (P less than 0. 05). NSM produces 28 % of the weight of condensate per cigarette in comparison with tabacco and would, therefore, be expected to be far less biologically active than tobacco. Filtered smoke from <b>cigarettes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>tobacco</b> caused significant (P less than 0. 001) changes in the DNA content of mammalian cells in culture. These changes were quantitatively similar to those caused by whole smoke suggesting that the gas phase of cigarette smoke is biologically more reactive than the particulate phase. The filtered smoke from the substitute smoking material NSM did not cause significant (P less than 0. 95) changes in DNA content of cultured mammalian cells. Filtered smoke from blends of NSM and tobacco caused changes in DNA content in proportion to the amount of tobacco in the mixture...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{review the}} {{strategies}} employed by overseas cigarette manufacturers operating in Thailand to obstruct the passage and subsequent enforcement {{of national public}} health legislation, specifically the ingredients disclosure provision of the 1992 Tobacco Products Control Act. Methods: Analysis of previously confidential tobacco industry documents relevant to non-compliance with the ingredients disclosure legislation. Results: Requirement for disclosure of ingredients <b>contained</b> in <b>cigarettes</b> <b>contained</b> in the <b>Tobacco</b> Products Control Act was identified by transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) {{not only as a}} significant threat to their operations in Thailand, but as a dangerous global precedent. Industry documents reveal a determined campaign to block, stall, or amend the proposed regulation during the legislative process. Industry representatives petitioned the Ministry of Health to revise the requirement from by brand disclosure to a more palatable by company submission. Strategies were adapted {{in the wake of the}} passage of the Act. Most significantly, the industry in concert with embassies in Bangkok threatened the Thai government with appeals to international trade bodies on the grounds of violation of international agreements. Industry documents also reveal that as submission of ingredient lists appeared unavoidable, leading companies operating in Thailand endeavoured to confound the disclosure requirement by disguising ingredients and reformulating brand recipes. Conclusions: The evidence presented highlights the importance of ingredients regulation and demonstrates how health policy can be transformed during its implementation. A greater understanding of trade agreements emerges as a priority for global tobacco control. 9 page(s...|$|R

In addition to these eight cigarette-design technologies was another proposed technology which involved the incorporation of a substitute for {{some or all of the}} tobacco in the cigarette filler. Despite considerable research and development (R&D) effort on various tobacco substitutes that indicated the replacements in most instances fulfilled the definition of a ‚Äòless hazardous‚Äô cigarette with regard to the chemical and biological properties of their mainstream smoke, tobacco substitute-containing cigarettes failed to attain consumer acceptability.
