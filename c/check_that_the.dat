25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to <b>check</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and <b>check</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|E

25|$|Experimentally it is {{seen that}} the masses of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons is very much lighter than the next lightest states; i.e., the octet of vector mesons (such as the rho meson). The most convincing {{evidence}} for SSB of the chiral flavour symmetry of QCD is the appearance of these pseudo-Goldstone bosons. These would have been strictly massless in the chiral limit. There is convincing demonstration that the observed masses are compatible with chiral perturbation theory. The internal consistency of this argument is further checked by lattice QCD computations which allow one to vary the quark mass and <b>check</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> variation of the pseudoscalar masses with the quark mass is as required by chiral perturbation theory.|$|E
25|$|A fully {{electronic}} kit is also {{easier to}} soundcheck than acoustic drums, {{assuming that the}} electronic drum module has levels that the drummer has pre-set in her/his practice room; in contrast, when an acoustic kit is sound checked, most drums and cymbals need to be miked and each mic needs to be tested by the drummer so its level and tone equalization can be adjusted by the sound engineer. As well, even after all the individual drum and cymbal mics are soundchecked, the engineer needs {{to listen to the}} drummer play a standard groove, to <b>check</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> balance between the kit instruments is right. Finally, the engineer needs to set up the monitor mix for the drummer, which the drummer uses to hear her/his instruments and the instruments and vocals {{of the rest of the}} band. With a fully electronic kit, many of these steps could be eliminated.|$|E

500|$|Leopold {{was embarrassed}} by {{complaints}} {{made by the}} British government about human rights abuses in the Congo Free State and dispatched a Commission of Inquiry to investigate {{the entirety of the}} Congo. This commission visited the Abir concession from 1 December 1904 to 5 January 1905 and, despite Abir's attempts to keep witnesses away, heard evidence of violence committed by Abir. This included the desolation of villages, murder, rape, hostage taking and excessive flogging. [...] Abir was the only commercial body mentioned by name in the report for brutality which said that the concession was [...] "the black spot on the history of Central African settlement". [...] The commission instigated limited reforms, laying down new interpretations of existing legislation which included a limit of 40 working hours per week for collectors, the option of paying taxes in commodities other than rubber and the removal of sentries from the villages. [...] Two months after this Leopold sent a Royal High Commissioner to Abir to <b>check</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reforms were being carried out, he was told that Abir had no intention of instituting any reforms. The commissioner established two deputy public prosecutors in the Abir concession but one investigated only missionaries and the second brought few cases against Abir men.|$|E
500|$|During the regal period, {{the king}} {{nominated}} two Quaestors {{to serve as}} his assistants, and after {{the overthrow of the}} monarchy, the Consuls retained this authority. However, in 447 BC, Cicero recorded that the Quaestors began to be elected by a tribal assembly that was presided over by a magistrate. It seems as though this was the first instance of a joint Patricio-Plebeian Tribal Assembly, and thus was probably an enormous gain for the Plebeians. While Patricians were able to vote in a joint assembly, there were never very many Patricians in Rome. Thus, most of the electors were Plebeians, and yet any magistrate elected by a joint assembly had jurisdiction over both Plebeians and Patricians. Therefore, for the first time, the Plebeians seemed to have indirectly acquired authority over Patricians. During the 4th century BC, a series of reforms were passed (the leges Valeriae Horatiae), which ultimately required that any law passed by the Plebeian Council have the full force of law over both Plebeians and Patricians. This gave the Plebeian Tribunes, who presided over the Plebeian Council, a positive character for the first time. Before these laws were passed, Tribunes could only interpose the sacrosanctity of their person (intercessio) to veto acts of the senate, assemblies, or magistrates. It was a modification to the Valerian law in 449 BC which first allowed acts of the Plebeian Council to have the full force of law, but eventually the final law in the series was passed (the [...] "Hortensian Law"), which removed the last <b>check</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Patricians in the senate had over this power.|$|E
