In particular, we examine gross domestic product (GDP) recessions and financial downturns (<b>credit</b> <b>contractions</b> and stock price declines) using data from 21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies and 21 developing Asian economies. We find, in general, recovery from a GDP recession in Asian economies is somewhat slower than in OECD economies. However, recovery from a financial downturn is not much different between Asian and OECD economies. We also find OECD economies have been more active and effective in using counter-cyclical policies than Asian economies in the face of GDP recessions and financial downturns.

The second essay studies the optimal Taylor-type monetary policy rules based on the model developed in the first chapter and find that with interest rate smoothing, 'leaning against the wind' can significantly dampen the procyclicality of financial distortions, and increase {{the welfare of the}} economy. The third chapter examines the role of households frugality in a financial crisis and finds that higher savings by more frugal households provide an important cushion for the fall in private investment funding. ...|$|R

I model and then test the bank's liquidity sharing mechanism using a new measure for bilateral bank holdings constructed from over 90, 000 holding company level linkages. I consider funding shocks originating from financial crises and analyze the resulting dynamics in lending at affiliate branches. Estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase in crisis exposure results in a 1. 5 % contraction in lending at branches outside of the crisis country. I find that greater liquidity constraints arise if banks also raise deposits in the crisis country which induces ad-ditional contractions in lending. However banks with non-depository assets in the crisis country face capital shocks that can distort lending incentives. Then using the model's prediction that greater deposit stability can amplify capital constraints while dampening liquidity constraints, I construct a triple differences identification strategy to show that <b>credit</b> <b>contractions</b> follow the geography of banking at both the micro bank and macro aggregate level.

40|$|Although firm {{financial}} policies {{were affected by}} a <b>credit</b> <b>contraction</b> during the recent financial crisis, the impact of increased uncertainty and decreased growth opportunities was stronger {{than that of the}} <b>credit</b> <b>contraction</b> per se. From the start of the financial crisis (third quarter of 2007) to its peak (first quarter of 2009), both large and investment-grade non-financial firms show no evidence of suffering from an exceptional systemic <b>credit</b> <b>contraction.</b> Instead of decreasing their cash holdings as would be expected with a temporarily impaired credit supply, these firms increase their cash holdings sharply (by 17. 8 % in the case of investment-grade firms) after the fall of Lehman. Though small and unrated firms have exceptionally low net debt issuance {{at the peak of the}} crisis, their net debt issuance in the first year of the crisis is no different from the last year of the credit boom. In contrast, however, the net equity issuance of small and unrated firms is low throughout 2008, whereas an impaired credit supply by itself would have encouraged firms to increase their equity issuance. On average, the cumulative financing impact of the decrease in net equity issuance from the start to the peak of the crisis is approximately twice the cumulative impact of the decrease in net debt issuance. The decrease in net equity issuance and the increase in cash holdings are also economically important for firms with no debt. ...|$|E

The empirical exercise shows that sizeable gross flows coexist at any phase of the cycle, even within narrowly defined regional units and bank size categories.

40|$|Abstract The recent {{financial}} crisis, sparked as {{a result}} of the subprime market in the United States, is regarded by many researchers as the most severe financial crisis to happen since the Great Depression. This crisis has raised the important issue of the spill-over effect of the financial crisis into other sectors of the economy. However, evidence of the effect on firms' behaviour with respect to their financing and investment decisions is limited, and the existing research has mainly concentrated on the publicly listed firms in the US. It is also evident from the findings of existing published studies that the majority of studies do not reach a unanimous conclusion (Alien and Carletti 2008; Bakke 2009; Duchin, Ozbas and Sensoy 2010; Leary 2009; Lemmon and Roberts 2010; Lin and Paravisini 2010 a). Further, the focus of the majority of the existing studies is very narrow with respect to the components of capital structure. As a result, it is not clear from the existing literature which component of the capital structure is more sensitive to <b>credit</b> supply <b>contractions</b> than any other. Moreover, accounting regulations, financial reporting requirements and institutional features are different between the US and the UK, which high!(gl 1 Js the need for more research in this area. In addition, no systematic investigation into the financing and investment decisions of private firms during the crisis has ever taken place in the UK. The main purpose of this study is, therefore, to investigate the financial and investment decisions of both private and public listed finns during the time of the recent financial crisis in the UK. More specifically, this study investigates whether shocks to the supply of credit affect firms' leverage and determines which components of capital structure are affected by <b>credit</b> supply <b>contractions.</b> Further, the study investigates how firms manage their finances during a crisis period. In other words, how firms minimize the effect of <b>credit</b> <b>contractions</b> by resorting to alternative sources of finance such as internal funds, net debt issues, net trade credits and net equity issues. The study also examines whether firms manage their dividend payouts to maintain their financial slack. Finally, the study investigates the effect of the credit crisis on firms' performance and investment decisions. To investigate these issues, the study adopts a comprehensive strategy which consists of three elements, namely, identification of exogenous credit crisis, the use of film fixed effects model and the use of firm level control variables. Data for the analysis are extracted from the FAME and the Datastream databases for the period 2004 - 2009. A total of 4973 private firms are extracted from the FAME database and 2039 public firms are extracted from the Datastream database. The fixed effects analyses highlight that the financial crisis has adversely affected the total debt ratios of both types of firms. This effect is most significant on the short-term financing channel (such as short-term debt and trade credit) in the sample of private firms; while it is the trade credit channel that is negatively affected by the credit crisis in the sample of public firms. The effect on long-term and short-term debt is statistically insignificant in the sample of public firms. There are also differences in the way both types of firm responded to the credit crisis. Private firms, for example, issued more equity and held cash in response to the credit shortage. These firms do not move to net debt issues and net trade credits; nor do they adjust their dividend payout policies during the crisis period. The results further reveal that public firms use more internal funding and repurchase equity in response to the credit drought. These firms also reduced dividend payout to preserve their financial slack. In addition, public firms do not change to net debt issues and net trade credits in response to the credit supply shocks. Moreover, the results reveal that the performance and investment of both types of firm are adversely affected by the credit crisis. This highlights that the inability to obtain external credit and the relative lack of substitution towards alternative sources of finance have negatively affected the performance and investment of both types of firm. Further, in the private firms' sample, the increase in cash holdings and decline in investment suggest that funds raised through the equity issue may have been used to fmance the cash holdings of these firms. In the public firms' sample, decrease in cash reserve, dividend payout and investment in tangible assets suggests that internal funds may have been used to fmance the equity repurchases. Overall, the results suggest that financial and investment policies of private and public firms are sensitive to the credit supply shocks. 11 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

In the financial reform case, results indicate that households with greater exposure to the financial system reduced their saving rate after the reform.

To investigate the macroeconomic dimensions of gross credit flows, the paper studies the cyclical behavior of aggregate credit flows and documents three key cyclical facts. First, excess credit reallocation is countercyclical: for any given rate of change of net credit, gross flows are larger in a recession than in a boom. Second, gross credit flows are highly volatile, with a cyclical volatility which appears more than {{an order of magnitude}} larger than GDP volatility. Third, <b>credit</b> <b>contraction</b> is more volatile than credit expansion.
