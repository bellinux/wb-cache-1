50|$|Users can {{download}} new applications (through WAP) which {{are stored in}} a folder named 'Collections'. However, Nokia included three applications. 'World clock II' allows users to view time zones across the world; the graphical user interface highlights the <b>current</b> <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> yellow, and allows users to navigate, left or right, across the world, showing the city at {{the centre of the}} time zone. 'Converter II' is an excellent application for converting anything from currencies, grams, pounds, and so forth. Through the 'Options', users can customise the conversions to suit their needs; this is especially useful when currencies alter in value. The final application is a translation tool ('Translator'). For example, if a search query is 'help', then the application will show five translations (English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian). The problem is that the phone is limited to 2 MB of applications regardless the size of the Multimedia Card or the internal memory.|$|E

Most municipalities - despite originally supporting <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> unification at their annual meetings - responded to the government initiative with overt resistance, leading to a stand-off where Hamlets ran clocks at their preferred time and schools and airports frequently operated on another. Ultimately Okalik and the government backed down and the historic three <b>time</b> <b>zones,</b> Eastern <b>Time</b> <b>Zone</b> for the Qikiqtaaluk, Central <b>Time</b> <b>Zone</b> for the Kivalliq and Mountain <b>Time</b> <b>Zone</b> for the Kitikmeot have continued in effect.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Suicide is a {{major cause}} of death in the USA and worldwide. There is a puzzle over the {{influence}} of sunlight on suicides that dates back to 1897 : On the one hand, lack of sunlight is linked to seasonal affective disorder, and thereby more suicides. And yet curiously, the suicide rate peaks in spring/summer and midday. This paper sheds light on this debate, identifying the separate role of sunlight, as opposed to cultural influences on suicides. I compare the suicide rates of counties along the three major time zone lines in the USA. Using a random effects panel regression, I show that a short move to the west side of any time zone line significantly inflates the suicide rate by about 10 %. Beyond the scientific value for epidemiology, these results have economic ramifications for location choices, and raise questions about <b>current</b> <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> placements...|$|E
40|$|Console, some overall improvements, {{including}} BREAKING CHANGES. The PHAR file is {{now also}} a console. When installed, the console {{is available from}} the executable "roscon". BREAKING CHANGES: Response::getArgument() is renamed to Response::getProperty() (Note: Request::getArgument() is still valid). Response::getArgument() is left issuing an E_USER_DEPRECATED notice, and will be removed in a later release. Message::getAllArguments() is removed in favor of IteratorAggregate implementation that returns an ArrayObject. For most intents and purposes, {{you should be able to}} just search&replace "->getAllArguments() " with an empty string (that will implicitly call getIterator()). If you require the arguments as a "real" array, you can replace "->getAllArguments() " with "->getIterator() ->getArrayCopy() ". Message::__invoke() without arguments is now a shortcut for getTag() instead of getting all arguments. Util::changeMenu() is now renamed to Util::setMenu() and always returns the Util object itself. ResponseCollection::__invoke() without arguments (or NULL) is now a shortcut for getting the iterator of the current response, instead of for seeking to the last response. Replace "() " with "(- 1) " or "->end() " to achieve the old effect. ResponseCollection::getLast() is removed. To get the last response, you can instead use array access (or offsetGet()) with "- 1 " as the offset. Or simply search&replace "->getLast() " with "->offsetGet(- 1) ". ResponseCollection::getArgumentMap() is renamed to ResponseCollection::getPropertyMap(). All Query::ACTION_* constants are renamed to Query::OP_*, and shortened (GREATHER_THAN is now GT, etc.). New Util methods: getMenu() (serves the same purpose as previously Util::changeMenu() with an emptry string) getAll() count() (makes Util an implementation of Countable, reports the number of items at the current menu) prepareScript() appendScript() Message now implements Countable, reporting the number of arguments (on COUNTER_NORMAL) or words (on COUNT_RECURSIVE). Util::get() now uses RouterOS' "get" command, unless it returns an empty !done response (as it does for RouterOS versions prior to 6. 0), in which case it automatically fallbacks to a print with a query. Util::escapeValue() and Util::parseValue() now support associative arrays (introduced in RouterOS 6. 2). Util::escapeValue() now correctly converts DateTime objects to DateInterval objects relative to UNIX epoch time in UTC. Previously, the <b>current</b> <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> was used instead of UTC. Util::add() and Util::set() /Util::edit() now support flags as values with a numeric key. Util::filePutContents() now behaves correctly when the underlying Client has enabled streaming of responses and/or when the contents is in a stream. Responses in ResponseCollection can now be getted or seeked to a value relative from the end by supplying a negative offset. ResponseCollection can now be searched by argument values, if you first designate an argument name with the new ResponseCollection::setIndex() method. ResponseCollection can now produce a sorted response collection based on user defined criteria using the new ResponseCollection::orderBy() method. Util::find() now always returns a comma separated list when used without arguments (as opposed to ";" separated, in more recent RouterOS versions). Response receiving now resets if an empty sentence is received, instead of throwing an exception. New Communicator::seekableStreamLength() method, used internally by Util::filePutContents(). Doc fixes (Notably: Clarified the acceptability of seekable streams as argument values, which has been present for a long time, but never documented). CS fixes...|$|E

50|$|A unique {{feature of}} Boktai is that {{before a game}} is started, the player is {{prompted}} to set their <b>current</b> <b>time</b> and <b>time</b> <b>zone.</b> The game can then determine when the sun will rise/set, and will simulate {{the position of the}} sun inside the game. This way, the player has an advantage during the daytime because, according to lore, vampires cannot be exposed to sunlight. Sunlight also affects the world around the main character. A good example is the Solar Tree. This tree is affected by all the darkness of the Immortals, and can be cured by playing in sunlight. The game also simulates times of day by putting bird chirp sound effects in the morning, and giving the outdoor environment a soft orange glow around sunset.|$|R
50|$|The {{shift to}} the <b>current</b> Central European <b>Time</b> <b>zone</b> took place on 16 May 1940. The German {{occupiers}} ordered the clock to be moved an hour and forty minutes forward. This time was kept in summer and winter throughout 1941 and 1942. It was only in November 1942 that a different Winter time was introduced, and the time was adjusted one hour backwards. This lasted for only three years; after the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945, Summer time was abolished for over thirty years, so during those years, standard time was 40 minutes ahead of the original Amsterdam Time. As at 2017, the Netherlands {{is in line with}} Central European Time (GMT+1 in the winter, GMT+2 in the summer, which is significantly different from Amsterdam Time).|$|R

It was first aired on KFQD Radio (where Rivers was program director) in Anchorage, Alaska on April 25, 1980, immediately after an attempt to rescue the American hostages in Tehran failed. Rivers later wrote in Billboard Magazine, [...] "...the phones lit up like a Christmas tree. We logged more than 20,000 calls in three days...and they were 97 percent positive." [...] Because of the song’s popularity in Australia and New Zealand, EMI Records called Rivers to discuss a possible recording contract and tour.|$|R
