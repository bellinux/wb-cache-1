5000|$|While {{working on}} {{reflexivity}} journal entries {{it is important}} to make certain that notes written in journals are different from the data. The use of italics, bolding words, and adding brackets will assist in showing distinctions between data and journaling. Researchers should write their reflexivity notes fully avoiding abbreviations. This will assist the researcher {{in the final stages of}} analysis and through the process of data complication and reduction. Auerbach & Silverstein (2003) suggest keeping a log of concerns with the research, theoretical framework, central research questions, goals, and major issues to help focus on the coding process.

Managers (n 233) read a business scenario in which they were asked {{to make a decision about}} whether to implement a development program. They were then exposed to one of nine experimental treatment conditions (evaluation report type reported program impact level). The report types included utility analysis, <b>critical</b> <b>outcome</b> technique, and anecdotal evaluation reports. Results were varied at three impact levels (low, average, and high). Findings of the study showed that managers perceived utility analysis and <b>critical</b> <b>outcome</b> technique reports as almost equally useful in decision making; however, the anecdotal evaluation report was found to be significantly less useful than either of the other two report types. There was no effect of the reported program impact level on the perceived usefulness of the evaluation reports for decision making. Furthermore, there was no interaction between report type and impact level on the perceived usefulness of the reports for decision making. These findings show that managers prefer information about the financial results of HRD interventions to anecdotal information, regardless of the reported level of impact.

These outcomes are based on the following needs identified by DOE-HQ, RL and other customers of the Laboratory. Our Energy Research customer desires relevant, quality and cost effective science. Our Environmental Management customer wants technology developed, demonstrated, and deployed to solve environmental cleanup issues. To ensure the diversification and viability of the Laboratory as a National asset, RL and HQ alike want to increase the Science and Technical contributions of PNNL related to its core capabilities. RL wants improved leadership/management, cost-effective operations, and maintenance of a work environment, which fosters innovative thinking and high morale. RL and HQ alike desire compliance with environment, safety and health (ES and H) standards and disciplined conduct of operations for protection of the worker, environment, and the public, As with all of Hanford, DOE expects contribution of the Laboratory to the economic development of the Tri-Cities community, and the region, to build a new local economy that is less reliant on the Hanford mission, as well as enhancing the status of the Laboratory as a valued corporate citizen of the Northwest Region.

40|$|In past {{research}} we have demonstrated how methodologies {{used in the}} training of performers can both encourage whole-brain learning and answer {{to the demands of}} South Africa’s current educational paradigm, outcomes-based education (OBE). OBE is a needs-driven, outcomes-driven and competency-orientated pedagogy, which aims at incorporating learners as active agents within the learning process as opposed to the previous content-driven, teacher-orientated approach to education (Coetzee 2004). Our research was prompted by the constant need for our Drama departments to validate their existence in the light of changing funding structures for the arts, governmental and institutional demands for measured outcomes and our institutions’ emphasis on whole-brain learning as the preferred pedagogical approach to education and training.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the extent to which young {{children}} in three Grade R classes in the Eastern Cape Province were exposed to developmentally appropriate opportunities to achieve the <b>Critical</b> <b>Outcomes</b> as outlined in the South African National Curriculum Statement. The research took the form of a case study. Semi-structured interviews and observations were used to collect data. Respondents included children, their parents, Grade R practitioners and the school leadership. The findings tentatively showed that this set of parents perceived their role in providing for their children’s developmental needs as separate to that of the GR practitioners. They seemed to see their roles as helping their children to develop social and emotional competence only, and that the GR practitioners provided, in addition to this, literacy and numeracy teaching to their children. In contrast, the three GR practitioners believed that parents were responsible also for promoting literacy, numeracy and life skills. There seemed therefore to be a lack of clarity of specific teacher and parent views of their roles. The researcher found, however, that the children seemed to be given few developmentally appropriate opportunities for planned and structured activities which enabled them to explore the <b>Critical</b> <b>Outcomes,</b> for example, working together, solving problems, using technology. The teaching methodology used by the GR practitioners during the observation periods, seemed to a large extent, to be based in 'talk and chalk' in the plenary grouping. It did not seem to enable the implementation of the curriculum and especially of the <b>Critical</b> <b>Outcomes</b> in a developmentally appropriate way. In addition, the environment in which children learned was not observed to be developmentally appropriate for relevant education to take place. Too many children were crowded into the available space, while learning equipment and materials were lacking. Any competences that young children in these three GR programmes achieved were therefore possibly learned incidentally, rather than deliberately through planned activities. In addition, GR classes in this study were not observed to be supported within the schools to deliver competent curriculum activities to the children. The study makes suggestions to meet some of these challenges. These include improving the understanding of curriculum guidelines of all role players in the three schools, enabling the management teams and especially parents to take a stronger support and monitoring role, and providing and using materials and equipment to promote the use of the Critical Out comes as methods for teaching and for learning. ...|$|E
