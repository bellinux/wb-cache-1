This paper {{examines}} non-canonical uses of Tswana <b>applicative</b> verb <b>forms</b> {{that support}} the hypothesis of a prototypical relationship between the syntactic role of object and the pragmatic role of focus. In its canonical use, the applicative suffix of Tswana {{can be defined as}} licensing the presence of a direct object representing a participant that cannot figur {{in the construction of the}} same verb in its non-derived form. One of the non-canonical uses of <b>applicative</b> verb <b>forms</b> examined in this paper involves no change in the valency of the verb: in Tswana, as in other Southern Bantu languages, the use of the <b>applicative</b> <b>form</b> of the verb may simply indicate the focalization of a locative complement or adjunct. This non-canonical use of <b>applicative</b> verb <b>forms</b> must be related to other facts of Tswana, and more generally of Bantu languages, suggesting that in Bantu syntax the immediate post-verbal position, grammaticalized as the obligatory position of the objects of transitive verbs, is primarily a focus position. 1...|$|R
40|$|Term {{rewriting}} {{system is a}} helpful tool for implementing functional programming languages. We focus upon a transformation of term {{rewriting system}}s called currying. Currying transforms a term rewriting system with symbols of arbitrary arity into another one, which contains only nullary symbols with a single binary symbol called application. Currying in single-sorted case is explored in [1] but currying in typed case remains as a problem. This paper first proposes currying of order-sorted term rewriting systems. Then, we prove that compatibility and confluence of order-sorted term rewriting systems are preserved by currying. 1 Introduction Currying of term rewriting systems(TRSs, for short) is a transformation from a TRS of `functional' form to another one of `applicative' form. Terms of functional form are constructed from function symbols of various arities and variables, like f(x; 2; 3). Terms of <b>applicative</b> <b>form</b> consist of variables, constants and a binary symbol called [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A filosofia deleuziana é mais conhecida como uma criação contínua de dispositivos maquinais, cujo objetivo é transformar o esqueleto figurativo no qual as formas e os modelos aplicativos vêm se sedimentar. A metáfora geológica não é, por isso mesmo, meramente aleatória. Ela tem a ver com um encontro real entre as possibilidades de movimentos criadores de dobras e as dobras mesmas como relevos formais. Pode-se supor que a primeira dessas formas geradoras, na filosofia de Deleuze, seja o simulacro. No quadro deste artigo, pretendemos retomar a análise do simulacro nos dois textos fundamentais de Deleuze sobre Platão e sobre Lucrécio. The {{philosophy}} of Deleuze {{is best known}} as a continuous creation of machinic apparatuses aimed at transforming the figurative conception in which <b>applicative</b> <b>forms</b> and models sediment. The geological metaphor is thus not merely arbitrary. It is tied to a real encounter between the possibilities of creative movements of folds and the very folds considered as formal reliefs. One can thus reasonably suppose that, in the {{philosophy of}} Deleuze, simulacrum is the first of these generating forms. In this article, we will try to follow how Deleuze analyzes simulacrum in his two fundamental essays about Plato and Lucretius...|$|R

25|$|Applicative {{order is}} not a {{normalising}} strategy. The usual counterexample is as follows: define Ω = ωω where ω = λx.xx. This entire expression contains only one redex, namely the whole expression; its reduct is again Ω. Since {{this is the only}} available reduction, Ω has no normal form (under any evaluation strategy). Using applicative order, the expression KIΩ = (λx.λy.x) (λx.x)Ω is reduced by first reducing Ω to normal form (since it is the rightmost redex), but since Ω has no normal <b>form,</b> <b>applicative</b> order fails to find a normal form for KIΩ.|$|R

It has turned out that theories with self-applications provide a natural setting for studying notions of abstract computability, especially from a proof-theoretic perspective. This article is concerned with the study of (unramified) bounded applicative theories which have a strong relationship to classes of computational complexity. We propose new applicative systems whose provably total functions coincide with the functions computable in polynomial time, polynomial space, polynomial time and linear space, as well as linear space. Our theories can be regarded as applicative analogues of traditional systems of bounded arithmetic. We are also interested in higher type features of our systems; in particular, it is shown that Cook and Urquhart's system PV # is directly contained in a natural applicative theory of polynomial strength. ...|$|R

For Auerbach the great attraction of the biblical text is precisely his realism, his ability to portray facts pertaining to human daily life at any time. In this sense he recognizes the historicity of this narrative type, and influenced by typological analysis of Tertullian, introduces the concept of Figure. The events narrated in the Old Testament prefigure, according Auerbach, what the New revealed. And here lies the notion of mutual padding that occurs in the biblical text and that restricts itself to allegorizing approach and present in Prosperity Theology of the Old Testament, which became {{the main component of}} the religious breakdown in evangelical circles. When speaking of Figure, Auerbach points for inclusion. Includes the Old Testament in the New and vice versa. Also includes one who welcomes the biblical text, his identification. The inclusion nonetheless rhetoric usually only given in the pulpit and the dialogical stance becomes hermeneutics: the reader / listener shall be noticed in the biblical account. In a culture that values the sensations this identification process by figuring that catapulted also reaches the recipient of the text in its <b>applicative</b> <b>form</b> constitutes a natural way to exercise homiletic. O presente artigo procura apresentar a contribuição de Erich Auerbach para o exercício da hermenêutica bíblica a partir da modernidade. Para Auerbach o grande atrativo do texto bíblico é justamente o seu realismo, sua capacidade de retratar fatos que pertencem ao cotidiano das pessoas em qualquer tempo. Nesse sentido ele reconhece a historicidade desse padrão narrativo, contudo, influenciado pela análise tipológica de Tertuliano, introduz o conceito da Figura. Os acontecimentos narrados no Velho Testamento prefiguram, segundo Auerbach, o que o Novo revelará. E aqui reside a noção de preenchimento mútuo que ocorre no texto bíblico e que restringe por si só a abordagem alegorizante e veterotestamentária presente na Teologia da Prosperidade, que se tornou o principal componente do esgotamento religioso no meio evangélico. Ao falar de Figura, Auerbach aponta para a inclusão. Inclui o Velho no Novo Testamento e vice-versa. Inclui também aquele que acolhe o texto bíblico, pela sua identificação. A inclusão deixa de ser somente retórica usualmente dada no púlpito pela postura dialogal e torna-se hermenêutica: o leitor/ouvinte passa a se perceber no relato bíblico. Numa cultura que valoriza as sensações esse processo de identificação catapultado pela figuração que atinge também o destinatário do texto em sua forma aplicativa se constitui num singular caminho para o exercício homilético...|$|R

The fact that higher-order synchronization invokes substitution seems to be the main problem. The reason is that it renders standard first-order proof techniques circular in the higher-order case, and this situation is difficult to deal with. Moreover, some techniques that allow us to cover strong forms of bisimulation equivalence on higher-order calculi seem to fail for the corresponding weak <b>forms.</b> <b>Applicative</b> simulation equivalence on -calculi poses similar problems and our starting point is that Howe has invented a general and elegant technique for solving them.
