2500|$|The early {{applications}} of CPT mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical {{measurements of the}} total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the conical tip (the [...] "tip friction") and friction generated by the rod string. A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil cohesive strength in the 1960s. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather pore water pressure data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). Pore water pressure data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this piezometer data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using screwed-in anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a more <b>continuous</b> <b>profile</b> of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20cm but as small as 1cm.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} psychophysiological responses and cognitive performance after a single bout of artificial gravity, in order to investigate its use as a potential holistic countermeasure for long-duration human space flight, considering mental health. Methods: Sixteen male participants were exposed to two different hypergravity protocols in a randomized order, one providing a constant + 2 Gz environment for 30 min, the other providing participants for five times with repeated 3 -min intervals of + 2 Gz and rest, respectively. EEG was recorded prior, during and after AG. In addition, self-reported mood and cognitive performance was assessed before and after AG exposure. EEG data were analyzed using standardized brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Results: Beta- 1 EEG activity (12 – 18 Hz) was decreased in the left middle frontal gyrus after the <b>continuous</b> <b>profile.</b> Participants’ motivation decreased after continuous artificial gravity, while perceived physical state was increased. The intermittent profile did not induce any changes in the observed parameters. Cognitive performance was not affected by either of both profiles. Conclusion: The <b>continuous</b> <b>profile</b> induced neurophysiological changes, which are considered with negative affect and withdrawal related motivation, according to the model of frontal asymmetry. This notion was further confirmed by decreases in self-reported mood after continuous AG. Therefore, the <b>continuous</b> <b>profile</b> would not be appropriate for the human space flight program. Intermittent AG did not induce any psychophysiological changes and might therefore provide a more appropriate approach as a countermeasure for further investigations...|$|E

40|$|The {{half-tone}} lithography using pixilated chromium masks in {{a projection}} stepper is an established technology in microoptics fabrication. However, the projection lithography tool is comparably expensive and the achievable lateral resolution is typically limited. By using pixel diffraction effects, binary and <b>continuous</b> <b>profile</b> lithography with submicron resolution {{can be installed}} on a conventional mask aligner. To achieve this goal the control of both, the angular spectrum of the illumination and the mask features is essential. We used a novel micro-optics based illumination system referred as "MO Exposure Optics System" in a SUSS MicroTec MA 6 mask aligner for the dedicated shaping of the angular illumination distribution. In combination with an adapted lithography mask {{the formation of a}} desired intensity distribution in the resist layer is possible. A general mathematic model describes the relation between the angular spectrum of the mask illumination, pixel size and pitch in the mask, proximity distance and propagated field, which also includes special cases like Talbot imaging. We show that a wide range of different micro-optical structures can be optimized by controlling the light diffraction in proximity lithography. Parameter settings were found for submicron binary pattern up to <b>continuous</b> <b>profile</b> structures with extensions up to several tens of microns.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{different issues}} related to high performance networked storage systems. ^ First, it introduces a new benchmark tool referred to as storage performability evaluation kernel module (SPEK) for evaluating performability of block-level storage systems. Since it runs at kernel level and eliminates skews and overheads caused by file systems, SPEK is highly accurate and efficient. It allows a storage architect to generate configurable workloads to a system under test and to inject different faults into various system components. Available performances under different workloads and failure conditions are dynamically collected and recorded over a spectrum of time. ^ Second, this thesis introduces a new caching structure to improve server performance by minimizing data traffic over the system bus. The idea is to form a bottom-up caching hierarchy in a networked storage server. The bottom level cache is located on an embedded controller that {{is a combination of}} a network interface card (NIC) and a storage host bus adapter (HBA). Storage data coming from or going to a network are cached at this bottom level cache and meta-data related to these data are passed to the host for processing. This new cache hierarchy is referred to as bottom-up cache structure (BUCS) in contrast to a traditional CPU-centric top-down cache. Such data caching at the controller level dramatically reduces bus traffic and leads to great performance improvement for networked storages. ^ Third, this thesis proposes a unified, low-overhead framework (ULF) to support <b>continuous</b> system <b>profiling</b> and optimization based on a specifically designed embedded board. ULF provides a unified interface to integrate various existing profiling tools and optimizers, and helps to easily build future tools. ULF uses an embedded processor to offload tasks of post-processing profiling data, which reduces system overhead caused by profiling tools and makes ULF especially suitable for <b>continuous</b> <b>profiling</b> on production systems.
