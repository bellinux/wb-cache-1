50|$|<b>Contribution</b> is {{different}} from gross margin in that a <b>contribution</b> calculation seeks to separate out variable costs (included in the <b>contribution</b> calculation) from fixed costs (not included in the <b>contribution</b> calculation) {{on the basis of}} economic analysis {{of the nature of the}} expense, whereas gross margin is determined using accounting standards. Calculating the <b>contribution</b> margin is an excellent tool for managers to help determine whether to keep or drop certain aspects of the business. For example, a production line with positive <b>contribution</b> margin should be kept even if it causes negative total profit, when the <b>contribution</b> margin offsets part of the fixed cost. However, it should be dropped if <b>contribution</b> margin is negative because the company would suffer from every unit it produces.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} how to promote {{two types of}} knowledge <b>contribution</b> tasks. The authors focus {{on the role of}} supervisor and coworker support on motivation, and their effects on two different <b>contribution</b> tasks. Motivating employees to contribute knowledge is quite challenging. While previous studies have tried to understand how to promote knowledge <b>contribution,</b> few have differentiated between knowledge <b>contribution</b> tasks. Design/methodology/approach – Information technology support was chosen as the context of this study, and data were collected from system administrators within a Fortune 500 company via a web-based survey. Findings – Results show the differential effects of two forms of motivation on different <b>contribution</b> tasks, and supervisor support is positively associated with intrinsic motivation. Specifically, while intrinsic motivation is positively associated with challenging knowledge <b>contribution,</b> external motivation is positively related to mundane knowledge <b>contribution</b> and negatively related to challenging knowledge <b>contribution.</b> Originality/value – This study contributes to the current literature by providing a deeper theoretical understanding of knowledge <b>contribution</b> tasks, and contributes to practice by offering suggestions on how to better motivate employees within organizations and promote different knowledge <b>contribution</b> tasks...|$|R
