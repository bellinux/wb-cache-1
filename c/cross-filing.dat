5|$|On March 18, {{two days}} before the filing deadline, Nixon filed in both the Republican and Democratic {{primaries}} under California's <b>cross-filing</b> system. Voorhis also filed in the two major party primaries. Under <b>cross-filing,</b> if the same candidate won both major party endorsements, he would be effectively elected, with only minor party candidates to stand against him. Day advanced the $200 (the current equivalent of $2,230) for Nixon's filing fees, later noting that he had great difficulty being reimbursed.|$|E
5|$|With {{no serious}} {{challenge}} from Republican opponents, Nixon won an overwhelming {{victory in the}} Republican primary, with his <b>cross-filing</b> rivals, Boddy, Douglas, and Desmond, dividing {{a small percentage of}} the vote but running well ahead of the two fringe candidates.|$|E
5|$|Both Douglas and Nixon {{announced}} their candidacies in late 1949. In March 1950 Downey withdrew from a vicious primary battle with Douglas by announcing his retirement, after which Los Angeles Daily News publisher Manchester Boddy joined the race. Boddy attacked Douglas as a leftist {{and was the}} first to compare her to New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who was accused of being a communist. Boddy, Nixon, and Douglas each entered both party primaries, a practice known as <b>cross-filing.</b> In the Republican primary, Nixon was challenged only by cross-filers and fringe candidates.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} January 1950, a {{subcommittee}} of the California Republican Assembly, a conservative grassroots group, endorsed former Lieutenant Governor Frederick Houser (who had lost narrowly to Downey in 1944) over Nixon for the Senate candidacy by a 6–3 vote, only to be reversed by the full committee, which endorsed Nixon by 13–12. Houser eventually decided against running. Los Angeles County Supervisor Raymond Darby commenced a Senate run, but {{changed his mind and}} instead ran for lieutenant governor. Darby was defeated by incumbent Lieutenant Governor Goodwin Knight in the Republican primary. Knight had also been considered likely to run for the Senate, but decided to seek re-election instead. Actor Edward Arnold began a Senate run, but dropped it in late March, citing a lack of time to prepare his campaign. Nixon was opposed for the Republican nomination only by <b>cross-filing</b> Democrats and by two fringe candidates: Ulysses Grant Bixby Meyer, a consulting psychologist for a dating service, and former judge and law professor Albert Levitt, who opposed [...] "the political theories and activities of national and international Communism, Fascism, and Vaticanism" [...] and was unhappy that the press was paying virtually no attention to his campaign.|$|E

Shell, then Mary Hosking (born 1927) of the Kern County Republican Women's Association, worked for the nomination of her future husband. In the same election, two other conservatives, including Howard Jarvis, the future father of California Proposition 13 (1978), challenged liberal U.S. Senator Thomas H. Kuchel in the primary. Kuchel easily prevailed to gain renomination. He had initially succeeded Nixon in the Senate in 1953. The 1962 elections were the first in California in which <b>cross-filing</b> across party lines had been abandoned.|$|E

40|$|The deep indexed China Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Patent Database was {{established}} by the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) of PR China. The purpose of creating this database was mainly to meet the need of patent examination. The database has already been put {{to use in the}} patent examination department in SIPO since April 2002. The Chinese version of the database covers TCM related patent applications published from 1985 to current in China. It contains over 19, 000 bibliographic records and over 40, 000 TCM formulas. In order to present this database to WIPO, an English demo version was created and opened to the world through the WIPO gate. There are 29 search fields in the database that fall into four categories: bibliographic information, subject index terms, uses/effects, TCM formulas. Rewritten titles and abstracts provide users with more searchable information. The system was built with multiple search features: quick search, advanced search, TCM formula search, and search history tracing function. Moreover, two special features created in the system are very useful for improving searching efficiency: <b>cross-file</b> search based on TCM dictionary and TCM similarity search. The <b>cross-file</b> search enables users to locate a specific TCM in the TCM dictionary file and then <b>cross-file</b> search that name in the patent bibliographic file for relevant records. TCM similarity search enables users to do one-stop searching easily for complex search queries.

2500|$|Levitt ran {{twice for}} the Republican {{nomination}} for the United States Senate. [...] He ran in California in 1950, on an anti-Catholic platform. [...] He finished sixth out of {{sixth in the}} primary, behind the winner, Congressman Richard Nixon, three <b>cross-filing</b> Democrats, and another fringe candidate. [...] In 1960, Levitt, running unsuccessfully for the Senate from New Hampshire, telegraphed Pope John XXIII {{and asked him to}} clarify whether Senator John F. Kennedy, a Catholic who was seeking the Democratic nomination for President, owed political allegiance to the Vatican or to the United States. [...] According to Levitt's research, some 150 principles of the Roman Catholic Church conflicted with the Constitution. [...] There is no record of any reply by the Pope.|$|E
2500|$|Running as a Republican, Warren {{was elected}} Governor of California on November 3, 1942, {{defeating}} the incumbent governor, Culbert Olson, a liberal Democrat. Thanks to <b>cross-filing,</b> he won all the 1946 primaries and was nominated {{as a candidate}} by both the Republican and Democratic parties, the only California governor to have done so. He was re-elected with over 90% of the vote against minor candidates. He was elected to a third term (as a Republican) in 1950, becoming the first person elected governor of California three times. Warren {{is the only person}} who has been sent to office in three consecutive California gubernatorial elections. An amendment passed in 1990 sets a limit of two terms for governor. (In 2010, Jerry Brown became the second person to be elected three times, in 1974, 1978, and 2010; Brown was elected to a record fourth term in 2014.

5|$|As was {{usual in}} California at the time, both Nixon and Voorhis <b>cross-filed</b> {{in the other}} party's primary, a {{practice}} Voorhis had long adopted.

5000|$|That same year, the Democrats, {{with funding}} from oil millionaire Edwin Pauley, filed a ballot {{initiative}} to abolish <b>cross-filing.</b> In an attempt to defeat this initiative, the Republican-controlled legislature proposed a competing measure, retaining <b>cross-filing,</b> but requiring candidates to list their party affiliation on all ballots.

5000|$|Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman criticized Zetterberg's {{performance}} in the race, stating that Zetterberg did not appear {{actively involved in the}} race, nor did he spend enough money on campaign necessities such as posters and stickers [...] Nixon would use similar techniques two years later in his Senate campaign against Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. This time, the Democrats focused attention on his actions and coined the sobriquet [...] "Tricky Dick" [...] for Nixon. With Nixon running for the Senate, Zetterberg ran again for the House, this time <b>cross-filing</b> and winning the Democratic nomination, but was defeated in the general election by Republican Patrick Hillings by a 60% to 40% tally. <b>Cross-filing</b> was abolished in California in 1959.|$|E
50|$|In American politics, <b>cross-filing</b> (similar to {{the concept}} of electoral fusion) occurs when a {{candidate}} runs in the primary election of not only his own party, but also that of one or more other parties, generally in the hope of reducing or eliminating his competition at the general election.|$|E
5000|$|In 1974, Thompson cross-filed in {{both the}} Republican and Democratic parties for governor, a {{practice}} then allowed in Georgia but not used by previous candidates during the state's long period of Democratic hegemony.

After the election, the state law permitting <b>cross-filing</b> was repealed in the Busbee administration. Thompson had considered running once again for U.S. Representative or for lieutenant governor but instead filed for governor. He expected to face then Lieutenant Governor Lester Maddox of the Atlanta metro area, a former governor known nationally for his past appeals to segregation.
