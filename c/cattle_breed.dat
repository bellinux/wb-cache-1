5|$|The Limousin <b>cattle</b> <b>breed</b> {{has been}} popular in France {{for more than}} two centuries because of its meat qualities and the breed's {{production}} efficiency. Since the early 1990s scientists have quantified these breed characteristics in comparisons with other breeds, and identified a natural variant of the myostatin gene found in Limousins which has a significant influence on them. The myostatin gene is found in all mammals and influences the production of a protein that controls muscle development. Variants of the gene produce proteins that are less effective at controlling muscle development, which results in increased muscle mass.|$|E
40|$|Information about genetic {{diversity}} and population structure among <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> {{is essential for}} genetic improvement, understanding of environmental adaptation as well as utilization and conservation of <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds.</b> This study investigated {{genetic diversity}} and the population structure among six <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> in South African (SA) including Afrikaner (n= 44), Nguni (n= 54), Drakensberger (n= 47), Bonsmara (n= 44), Angus (n= 31) and Holstein (n= 29). Genetic diversity within <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> was analyzed using three measures of genetic diversity namely allelic richness (AR), expected heterozygosity (He) and inbreeding coefficient (f). Genetic distances between breed pairs were evaluated using Nei’s genetic distance. Population structure was assessed using model-based clustering (ADMIXTURE). Results of this study revealed that the allelic richness ranged from 1. 88 (Afrikaner) to 1. 73 (Nguni). Afrikaner cattle had {{the lowest level of}} genetic diversity (He= 0. 24) and the Drakensberger cattle (He= 0. 30) had the highest level of genetic variation among indigenous and locally-developed <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds.</b> The level of inbreeding was lower across the studied <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds.</b> As expected the average genetic distance was the greatest between indigenous <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> and Bos taurus <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> but the lowest among indigenous and locally-developed breeds. Model-based clustering revealed some level of admixture among indigenous and locally-developed breeds and supported the clustering of the breeds according to their history of origin.

Because of necessity to determinate genetic profiles of <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> in Croatia using new analytical methods, the ratio of dominant allelic polymorphic variants of beta-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) and kappa-casein (κ-CN) is defined. The share of beta-lactoglobulin B variant is dominant in all investigated <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> (> 52. 9 %). Kappa- casein allelic variant A is dominant in selected <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> (60. 7 - 76. 4 %), while the share of B variant is significantly more presented in autochthonous <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> (48. 2 - 84. 1 %).

40|$|Not {{only the}} {{biodiversity}} of wild species, {{but also the}} diversity in livestock is declining rapidly: Out of 6. 300 registered livestock breeds in the world 1. 250 are endangered or already extinct. In Germany 16 out of 32 <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> are endangered, while {{three of the most}} popular <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> make up 92 % of the more than two million herd-book cows. Due to their adaptation to local conditions on first sight many rare and endangered <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> appear to be well suited for organic farming systems, but the percentage of rare breeds on organic farms is not much higher than on conventional ones. Council Regulation (EC) No 1804 / 1999 on livestock production in organic farming recommends to encourage biological diversity and to favour the use of breeds which are already adopted to the local conditions. This paper summarises a study on the motivations of organic farmers for keeping rare and endangered <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds,</b> and on which role breeding issues and livestock biodiversity play for organic farming organisations and controlling agencies. The main reasons for keeping rare <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> were good fodder utilization, low susceptibility to diseases, good adaptation to local conditions, but above all a personal relation to a specific breed. Conservation aspects and breed-specific subsidies were of lower importance. Nevertheless, husbandry of rare <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> should be economically viable. Unfortunately most organic farming organisations and controlling agencies hardly touched on breeding and choice-of-breed aspects in their advisory work; they more or less shared the view that the issue was of minor importance for organic farms. The paper concludes with a vision under which conditions rare <b>cattle</b> <b>breeds</b> could be better integrated into organic farming systems and on how organic farming could contribute to the in-situ conservation of livestock genetic resources...|$|R

The ABBA continued to grow during the 1960s and 1970s. Its headquarters, Brahman House, Rockhampton (the former AMP Building), was officially opened on 20 August 1971 by the Association's patron Mr Edgar Hudgins of Hudgins Ranch, Texas, USA; making it the first beef <b>cattle</b> <b>breed</b> association in Australia to own its own building. By 1971 there were 26,900 purebred Brahmans and 57,800 Appendix registered Brahmans in Australia. During the early 1970s the ABBA's membership increased dramatically, exceeding 900 in 1972. With the increase in membership, cattle registration also increased dramatically, which in turn increased the genetic supply available to the commercial industry. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI) research underpinned the growth by demonstrating the biological basis for the Brahmans adaption.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of tropically-adapted Brahman stock revolutionized the beef cattle industry in northern Australia. It transformed struggling enterprises into efficient and profitable ones and contributed {{billions of dollars}} to domestic and export income. In 2000 a Meat and Livestock Australia project assessed the contribution to the Australian economy by Brahman genetics. Analysis of the economic return on investment for the Australian beef industry from 1970 to 2000 found that Brahman and Bos indicus infusion delivered an additional individual on-farm benefit of $9170 per annum. About 40,000 Australian cattle producers gained from this additional profit in each of those 30 years. Brahman and Brahman-infused cattle accounted for 90 per cent of the genetic improvement in the Australian industry. The cumulative on-farm return since 1970 from investment in Bos indicus genetics amounted to $10.2 billion of a total on-farm return to the national beef industry from all forms of technology of $11 billion. In 2013 ABBA comprises over 1200 members and is the largest beef <b>cattle</b> <b>breed</b> association, by membership, in Australia. Currently, a little over 50% of the Australian beef cattle herd has Brahman blood, while about 11 per cent of the herd is pure-bred. There are about 110,000 Brahman bulls above the Tropic of Capricorn, that is, about 70% of bulls in that region.|$|E
