40|$|To {{examine the}} {{dissemination}} of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) within cattle groups, dairy calves on two farms utilizing different calf-rearing practices were exposed to a traceable STEC strain. Test strain dissemination differed significantly between farms, with a higher prevalence being associated with group penning. Pen floors and calf hides may be the main environmental mechanisms of transmission. Dairy <b>calf</b> <b>husbandry</b> represents a control point for reducing on-farm STEC prevalence...|$|E
40|$|Abuse of {{antibiotics}} {{is an increasing}} commonly feature in the media. Widespread preventive use {{of antibiotics}} without diagnostics in meat <b>calf</b> <b>husbandry</b> is a major public health concern. In this study, we compare a “trial and error” method, comprising of a first choice antibiotic, followed by a second and third choice (as recommended by the WHO), with a method which utilizes an antibiotic resistance test to first identify the best antibiotic out of first, second or third choice alternatives using decision tree analysis. Data were collected from farms with a known calf herd problem along with antibiograms from those herds. Samples were analysed for resistance to antibiotics against calf pneumonia on a herd level, rather than for resistance against specific antibiotics. Resistance tests were performed on batch samples composed {{of at least three}} diseased animals. A deep nasal swap was taken. In nasal swaps only ++ or +++ growth in all 3 samples were used for diagnosis. Other growth of bacteria was considered as contamination. A comparison of resistance rates across a range of antibiotics between farms with known calf pneumonia and calf diarrhoea issues was performed. The decision tree analysis presented provides strong support in favour of an evidence- based approach to antimicrobial treatment by using an antimicrobial resistance test, providing an advantage of 58 % per meat calf against the “trial and error” method, giving a financial gain of some CHF 320. 09 under Swiss economic circumstances...|$|E
40|$|For Salmonella typhimurium from {{humans in}} England and Wales, the {{incidence}} of multiple resistance more than doubled over the 8 -year period 1981 - 8 and, over the next 2 years, increased by a further 7 %. From 1981 to 1988 both resistance and multiple resistance also increased significantly in S. virchow and although multiple resistance did not increase over the next 2 years, the overall incidence of resistance has continued to rise. In 1990 the majority of S. typhimurium from cattle were multiply-resistant and the occurrence of such resistance has quadrupled since 1981. Multiple resistance has also increased in S. typhimurium from pigs and, to a lesser extent, from poultry. In contrast, multiple resistance has remained uncommon in the poultry-associated serotype S. enteritidis. For S. virchow, multiple resistance was common in a phage type frequently associated with poultry meat imported from France. The continuing use {{of a range of}} different antimicrobials in <b>calf</b> <b>husbandry</b> has been an important factor in promoting the emergence of multiply-resistant strains of S. typhimurium in cattle. In contrast, multiple resistance has remained rare in those serotypes associated with poultry, where the use of such antimicrobials has been less intensive. It is hoped that recent recommendations discouraging, in veterinary medicine, the prophylactic use of antibiotics with cross resistance to those used in human medicine will result in a reduction in the occurrence of multiresistant strains in food animals and subsequently in humans...|$|E
30|$|Diarrhoea prevalence, Cryptosporidium and Giardia {{shedding}} {{prevalence and}} the respective 95  % exact confidence intervals were estimated for calves at the herd level. Shedding prevalences were estimated for Cryptosporidium and Giardia based on microscopy-positive animals. To investigate how diarrhoea and pathogen shedding varied among individual calves, calf-level data {{were used to}} assess the correlation between age and Cryptosporidium or Giardia shedding intensities using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and to evaluate the associations between age groups and calf diarrhoea or Cryptosporidium or Giardia shedding using univariable logistic regression models. Variables hypothesized as risk factors were then evaluated for association with calf diarrhoea and Cryptosporidium and Giardia shedding at the herd level using univariable logistic regression models, including herd management practices (e.g. moving bomas and manure management); <b>calf</b> birthing and <b>husbandry</b> practices; veterinary and ethnoveterinary practices; water sources for herds and households; mixing of herds; and herd size and distance from water sources, villages, protected areas and road networks. Variables associated with calf diarrhoea and Cryptosporidium or Giardia shedding in univariable models (P[*]≤[*] 0.20), potentially confounding variables and biologically plausible interactions were then evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models. Final parsimonious models were selected by comparing Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) among competing nested and non-nested models. The final model fit was evaluated by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests and graphical residual diagnostics (Hosmer and Lemeshow 1989). For multivariable models, adjusted odds ratios with 95  % confidence intervals were estimated to assess the strength of the association between each risk factor and calf diarrhoea or shedding status. All statistical tests were performed with R statistical software (R Core Development Team 2013, Vienna, Austria).|$|R
40|$|Bacteria with {{antimicrobial}} resistance {{can be transferred}} from animals to humans and may compromise antimicrobial treatment in case of infection. To determine the {{antimicrobial resistance}} situation in bacteria from Swiss veal calves, faecal samples from 500 randomly selected calves originating from 129 farms were collected at four big slaughterhouses. Samples were cultured for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp. and Campylobacter sp. and isolated strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents by the minimal inhibitory concentration technique using the broth microdilution method. From 100 farms, data on farm management, animal husbandry and antimicrobial treatments of the calves were collected by questionnaire. Risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance were identified by logistic regression. In total, 467 E. coli, 413 Enterococcus sp. and 202 Campylobacter sp. were isolated. Of those, 68. 7 %, 98. 7 % and 67. 8 %, respectively, were resistant {{to at least one}} of the tested antimicrobial agents. Resistance was mainly observed to antimicrobials frequently used in farm animals. Prevalence of resistance to antimicrobials important for human treatment was generally low. However, a rather high number of quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter sp. were detected. External calf purchase, large finishing groups, feeding of milk by-products and administration of antimicrobials through feed upon arrival of the animals on the farm significantly increased the risk of antimicrobial resistance at farm level. Participation in a quality assurance programme and injection of a macrolide upon arrival of the animals on the farm had a protective effect. The present study showed that veal calves may serve as a reservoir for resistant bacteria. To ensure food safety, veal calves should be included in the national monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in farm animals. By improving farm management and <b>calf</b> <b>husbandry</b> the prevalence of resistance may be reduced...|$|E
