5|$|Great mullein {{has been}} used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat and {{breathing}} ailments. It has long had a medicinal reputation, especially as an astringent and emollient, as it contains mucilage, several saponins, <b>coumarin</b> and glycosides. Dioscorides recommended it for diseases of the lung {{and it is now}} widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included dyeing and making torches.|$|E
5|$|Like many ancient {{medicinal}} plants (Pliny the Elder describes {{it in his}} Naturalis Historia), great mullein was linked to witches, although the relationship remained generally ambiguous, and the plant was also widely held to ward off curses and evil spirits. The seeds contain several compounds (saponins, glycosides, <b>coumarin,</b> rotenone) that are toxic to fish, and {{have been widely used}} as piscicide for fishing.|$|E
5|$|Thelephoric acid {{is present}} in several Hydnellum species. This compound, derived metabolically from the shikimic acid pathway, {{inhibits}} the enzyme prolyl endopeptidase, which is involved in deteriorating certain neuropeptides that are believed to contribute to memory and learning. Hydnellum caeruleum and H.concrescens have several para-terphenyl derivatives named thelephantins (specifically, variants thelephantins I–N), some of which can inhibit the enzyme alpha-glucosidase. The compounds hydnellins A and B are terphenyls found in H. suaveolens and Hydnellum geogerirum. The chemicals responsible for the fragrant anise-like aroma of H.suaveolens {{have been identified as}} <b>coumarin</b> and para-anisaldehyde.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coumarins,</b> a {{well-known}} class of naturally occurring compounds, display a remarkable array of biochemical and pharmacological actions, {{some of which}} suggest that certain {{members of this group}} of compounds may significantly affect the function of various mammalian cellular systems. The development of <b>coumarins</b> as antioxidant agents has attracted much attention in recent years. <b>Coumarins</b> afford an opportunity for the discovery of new antioxidants with truly novel mechanisms of action. This review updates and expands the 2006 review by the same author. The review considers and incorporates the most recently published literature on <b>coumarins</b> as related to their antioxidant properties. A lot of <b>coumarins</b> have been identified from natural sources, especially green plants. These natural compounds have served as valuable leads for further design and synthesis of more active analogues. Beyond doubt, a deep understanding of the mechanisms of existing synthetic and natural <b>coumarins</b> will build the basis for the rational design...|$|R
5|$|When {{warfarin}} (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) {{is given}} {{during the first}} trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or <b>coumarin</b> embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, scoliosis, and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coumarins</b> are a {{large group}} of {{compounds}} that are naturally present in plant tissues and that exhibit a wide range of pharmacological properties. Analytical methods based on chromatographic techniques and conventional detectors are inadequate to accurately analyze <b>coumarins</b> in complex matrices such as plant extracts. In this article a new method based on a modified particle beam liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry interface is described. The method allows specific and accurate determination of several <b>coumarins</b> in biological matrices. An application regarding the analysis of 18 <b>coumarins</b> in the extract of Smyrnium perfoliatum L. is also reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{peroxidase}} catalyzed oxidation of indole- 3 -acetate is inhibited by {{naturally occurring}} <b>coumarins</b> such as scopoletin. This inhibition {{is due to}} the preferential reactivity of the <b>coumarins</b> with the peroxidase compounds I, II, and III. In view of the possible growth regulatory role of <b>coumarins</b> in plants, the mechanism of oxidation of scopoletin by horse-radish peroxidase has been investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{cytotoxicity}} against HepG 2 {{cell line}} has been determined in the MTS and LDH assay for the six <b>coumarins,</b> {{some of which have}} been determined in previous study to have platelet antiaggregatory activities and to act as cyklooxygenase I inhibitors. Three of the <b>coumarins</b> did not decrease HepG 2 cells viability at 30 μM concentration after 48 h of exposure. None of the other three <b>coumarins</b> caused decrease in viability under 79 % under identical conditions. Further, for all the <b>coumarins,</b> the important physicochemical properties determining the behaviour in biological systems have been calculated using the ADMET Predictor. The software has predicted four <b>coumarins</b> to have suitable drug-like properties (zero global risk) and the other two with the lowest risk in the ADMET Risk scale range. These two <b>coumarins</b> were identical with the <b>coumarins</b> showing certain cytotoxicity in the in vitro assays. Cytotoxicity in vitro has been also determined for the representative of the flavones' derivatives group the 3 -hydroxyflavone. The 3 -hydroxyflavone led to the decrease of HepG 2 cells viability observed in MTS assay up to 80 %, whereas no cytotoxicity has been observed in LDH assay. This may be explain by the cytostatic and not cytotoxic effect of 3 -hydroxyflavone. Thus, the flavone derivative shall be further investigated [...] . ...|$|R

25|$|Ancient {{texts and}} archaeological {{excavations}} show {{the use of}} perfumes {{in some of the}} earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or <b>coumarin,</b> which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics alone.|$|E
25|$|Basil is most {{commonly}} used fresh in recipes. In general, it is added at the last moment, as cooking quickly destroys the flavor. The fresh herb can be kept {{for a short time}} in plastic bags in the refrigerator, or for a longer period in the freezer, after being blanched quickly in boiling water. The dried herb also loses most of its flavor, and what little flavor remains tastes very different, with a weak <b>coumarin</b> flavor, like hay.|$|E
40|$|<b>Coumarins</b> {{belong to}} the family of lactones having benzopyrone system that can be {{isolated}} from plants as well as total synthesis can be carried out in the laboratory. To date, many chemical reactions have been established {{that can be used to}} synthesize <b>coumarins</b> like Knoevenagel condensation, Perkin, Pechmann, Reformatsky and Wittig reactions. <b>Coumarins</b> have attracted considerable attention of medicinal chemists and pharmacologists in recent years as they have been demonstrated to bear many pharmacological activities like anti-inflammatory & analgesic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, analgesic & ulcerogenic, anticonvulsant, antihyperlipidemic, tyrosinase inhibitor and anti-parkinsonism activity. The aim of the present paper is to review the available information on 3 -substituted <b>coumarins...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Coumarins</b> show {{biological}} activity and are widely exploited for their therapeutic effects. Although {{a great number}} of <b>coumarins</b> substituted by heterocyclic moieties have been prepared, few studies have been carried out on <b>coumarins</b> containing pyridine heterocycle, which is known to modulate their physiological activities. We prepared and characterized three novel 3 -(pyridin- 2 -yl) <b>coumarins</b> and their corresponding copper(II) complexes. We extended our investigations also to three known similar <b>coumarins,</b> since no data about their biochemical activity was previously been reported. The antiproliferative activity of the studied compounds was tested against human derived tumor cell lines and one human normal cell line. The DNA binding constants were determined and docking studies with DNA carried out. Selected Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) descriptors were calculated in order to relate a set of structural and topological descriptors of the studied compounds to their DNA interaction and cytotoxic activity...|$|R
40|$|Interactions {{of several}} 7 -aminocoumarins with human serum albumin (HSA) were studied by using {{fluorescence}} spectroscopic technique and modeling studies. There {{is a large}} change in fluorescence spectral parameters like intensity, emission maxima and anisotropy for all aminocoumarins. There were two binding sites for cou- 1, 311 and a single binding site for other <b>coumarins.</b> The binding constant(s) are large for all <b>coumarins</b> reflective of a strong binding. These spectral studies show that structural variants at the third, fourth and seventh position affects binding. The probable location of these <b>coumarins</b> in domain Ii has been predicted based on modeling. The effect of structural modification on the efficiency of binding was obtained for various other <b>coumarins,</b> using modeling...|$|R
25|$|Many modern {{perfumes}} contain synthesized odorants. Synthetics {{can provide}} fragrances {{which are not}} found in nature. For instance, Calone, a compound of synthetic origin, imparts a fresh ozonous metallic marine scent that is widely used in contemporary perfumes. Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate source of compounds that are not easily obtained from natural sources. For example, linalool and <b>coumarin</b> are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from terpenes. Orchid scents (typically salicylates) are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match the fragrant compounds found in various orchids.|$|E
25|$|The RealThiol (RT) probe is {{the second}} {{generation}} reversible reaction-based GSH probe developed by the Wang group. A few key features of RealThiol: 1) it has a much faster forward and backward reaction kinetics compared to ThiolQuant Green, which enables real time monitoring of GSH dynamics in live cells. 2) only micromolar to sub-micromolar RealThiol is needed for staining in cell based experiments, which induces minimal perturbation to GSH level in cells. 3) a high quantum yield <b>coumarin</b> fluorophore was implemented so that background noise can be minimized 4) equilibrium constant of the reaction between RealThiol and GSH has been fine tuned to respond to physiologically relevant concentration of GSH. RealThiol {{can be used to}} perform measurements of glutathione levels in single cells using a high resolution confocal microscope, as well as be applied in flow cytometry to perform bulk measurements in high throughput manner.|$|E
25|$|William Perkin {{continued}} active {{research in}} organic chemistry {{for the rest}} of his life: he discovered and marketed other synthetic dyes, including Britannia Violet and Perkin's Green; he discovered ways to make <b>coumarin,</b> one of the first synthetic perfume raw materials, and cinnamic acid. (The reaction used to make the latter became known as the Perkin reaction.) Local lore has it that the colour of the nearby Grand Union Canal changed from week to week depending on the activity at Perkin's Greenford dyeworks. In 1869, Perkin found a method for the commercial production from anthracene of the brilliant red dye alizarin, which had been isolated and identified from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, simultaneously with purpurin, another red dye of lesser industrial interest, but the German chemical company BASF patented the same process one day before he did. During the next decade, the new German Empire was rapidly eclipsing Britain as the centre of Europe's chemical industry. By the 1890s, Germany had a near-monopoly on the business and Perkin was compelled to sell off his holdings and retire.|$|E
40|$|<b>Coumarins,</b> an old {{class of}} natural and {{synthetic}} benzopyrene derivatives, attract an intense interest because of their diverse pharmacological use. The biochemical properties and therapeutic applications of simple <b>coumarins</b> strongly depend upon the molecular structure of these compounds.

500|$|Warfarin is a {{derivative}} of dicoumarol, an anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled sweet clover. Dicoumarol, in turn, is from <b>coumarin,</b> a sweet-smelling but coagulation-inactive chemical found in [...] "sweet" [...] clover and tonka beans (also known as cumaru from which coumarin's name derives). The name warfarin stems from its discovery at the University of Wisconsin, incorporating the acronym {{for the organization}} that funded the key research, WARF for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the ending -arin, indicating its link with <b>coumarin.</b>|$|E
500|$|Dicoumarol was {{a product}} of the plant {{molecule}} <b>coumarin</b> (not to be confused with Coumadin, a later tradename for warfarin). <b>Coumarin</b> is now known to be present in many plants, and produces the notably sweet smell of freshly cut grass or hay and plants like sweet grass; in fact, the plant's high content of <b>coumarin</b> is responsible for the original common name of [...] "sweet clover", which is named for its sweet smell, not its bitter taste. They are present notably in woodruff (Galium odoratum, Rubiaceae), and at lower levels in licorice, lavender, and various other species. However, coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarin-like action, but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as 4-hydroxycoumarin, then further (in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde) into dicoumarol, in order to have any anticoagulant properties. Fungal attack of the damaged and dying clover stalks explained the presence of the anticoagulant only in spoiled clover silages; dicoumarol {{is considered to be a}} fermentation product and mycotoxin.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, {{numerous}} similar chemicals (specifically 4-hydroxycoumarins with a large aromatic substitutent at the 3 position) {{were found to have}} the same anticoagulant properties. The first drug in the class to be widely commercialized was dicoumarol itself, patented in 1941 and later used as a pharmaceutical. Karl Link continued working on developing more potent coumarin-based anticoagulants for use as rodent poisons, resulting in warfarin in 1948. The name [...] "warfarin" [...] stems from the acronym WARF, for Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation + the ending -arin indicating its link with <b>coumarin.</b> Warfarin was first registered for use as a rodenticide in the US in 1948, and was immediately popular. Although warfarin was developed by Link, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation financially supported the research and was assigned the patent.|$|E
