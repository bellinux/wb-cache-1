40|$|The <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper</b> Dalbulus maidis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), is an {{important}} corn pest in most of tropical and subtropical America. This leafhopper has a rich natural enemy complex of which parasitoids and pathogens are the most studied; knowledge on its predators is limited. We noted {{the presence of the}} native assassin bug Zelus obscuridorsis (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) predating diverse motile insects, including the <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper,</b> on corn plants cultivated in household vegetable gardens in San Miguel de Tucumán (Argentina); in order to verify its predatory actions, we exposed lab-bred individuals of D. maidis to adults of Z. obscuridorsis. The predators were starved for 24 h before trials in which the <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper</b> in different developmental stages were exposed. Zelus obscuridorsis is highly skilled in catching specimens in motion, but it was not able to prey on eggs. The predator was capable to catch and prey on nymphs and adults...|$|E
40|$|In one study, a {{suite of}} plants from the maize genus Zea L. (Poaceae) and the {{specialist}} herbivore Dalbulus maidis (DeLong and Wolcott, 1923) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) were {{used to test the}} hypotheses that anti-herbivore defenses are affected by plant life-history evolution and human intervention through domestication and breeding for high yield. The suite of Zea host plants included one Mexican commercial hybrid maize Zea mays ssp. mays L., a landrace variety of maize, two populations of Balsas teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis Iltis & Doebley), and perennial teosinte (Z. diploperennis Iltis, Doebley & Guzman). This suite of host plants includes three Transitions evident within the genus Zea: life history form perennial to annual life cycle evident between perennial teosinte and Balsas teosinte, domestication transition from wild annual to domesticated annual evident between Balsas teosinte and landrace maize, and; breeding transition from landrace cultivar to a hybrid cultivar. The transitions were correlated with differences in plant defenses, as indicated by <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper</b> performance. Results showed a performance gradient, suggesting a pattern in which plant defense is stronger in perennial than annual plants, Balsas teosinte than landrace maize, and in landraces than in hybrid maize. Furthermore, results suggested that domesticated maize would be the least defended, most suitable host for <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper.</b> In a second study, haplotype diversity was assessed to address structuring and interconnectedness among samples of <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper</b> collected in the southwestern region of Mexico to address microevolution. The geographic focus of the study was maintained within an area encompassing the presumed centers of radiation of Dalbulus and its host genus Zea, and of maize domestication. Samples were complemented with samples of <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper</b> sequences available at GenBank. Results revealed seven haplotypes from three host plants within Zea: perennial teosinte, Balsas teosinte, and maize. Furthermore, genetic differentiation was present and haplotype diversity appears to correlate with differences in genetic structure between perennial teosinte and maize. One haplotype was found to be present throughout all sites, which appears to parallel the spread of maize cultivation. As maize cultivation spread beyond its area of domestication, corn leafhoppers colonized perennial teosinte, further suggesting that subsequent decreases in maize cultivation in perennial teosinte habitat created a refuge where perennial teosinte- adapted haplotypes could persist. Altogether, my research suggests that the combination of historical expansion of maize cultivation expansion and the weaker anti-herbivore defenses associated within maize domestication appears to have favored genotypes particularly adapted for exploiting maize...|$|E

VIRLA Anagrus breviphragma Soyka 1955 is a wide distributed and polyphagous species that, in northern Argentina is a common egg parasitoid of the <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper</b> Dalbulus Maidis De Long & Wolcott. Considering {{the lack of information}} about this wasp and the economic significance of its hosts, the purpose of this contribution was to provide data of its biology. A. breviphragma culture was established in a climatic cell (25 ± 2 °C, 70 - 75 % RH and 14 L: 10 D h of artificial photoperiod). Data obtained from distinct matura-tion stages of the exposed host eggs were analyzed. The eggs-laying behavior was des-cribed. This wasp is solitary and proovigenic, without a preovipositional period. A. beviphragma parasitized eggs that were only 1 - 3 day-old, and was not able to mature in eggs containing advances embryos. In laboratory, the measured average of parasitims was 66. 5 %. The developmental time of A. breviphragma is around 16. 5 days, and fema-les reached the adult stage significantly faster than males. This species also developed faster in one-day-old eggs than in two-old, and in those of two-days-old faster than in three-days-old eggs. Adult longevity averages 5 days while few individuals surviving more than 12 days; females lived longer than males. The obtained sex ratio showed a predominance of melaes over males...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar a eficiência de inseticidas no tratamento de sementes no controle da cigarrinha-do-milho em viveiro telado. Sementes de milho foram tratadas ou não com inseticidas (imidacloprid, thiamethoxan, thiodicarb + zn, thiodicarb, {{carbofuran}}, carbofuran + zn e carbosulfan) e semeadas em vasos plásticos. Nas plantas, foram confinadas cigarrinhas sadias e avaliada a eficiência desses inseticidas no controle desse inseto, em diferentes intervalos de tempo e em períodos sucessivos. Os produtos imidacloprid e thiamethoxan foram os mais eficientes no controle da cigarrinha, proporcionando eficiência de controle de adultos de D. maidis igual ou superior a 70 %, até o trigésimo dia de avaliação, após 4 a 24 h de confinamento das cigarrinhas. This {{research was}} aimed at checking the efficiency of insecticide seed treatment on <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper</b> control, at greenhouse. Maize seeds were treated with insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxan, thiodicarb + zn, thiodicarb, carbofuran, carbofuran + zn and carbosulfan) and sowed on plastic pots. On those plants healthy leafhoppers were confined, and the efficiency of those insecticides on its control was evaluated, at different intervals of time and in successive periods. The insecticides imidacloprid and thiamethoxan were the most efficient to control the corn leafhoppers, and provided control efficiency of D. maidis adults equal or upper 70 % until the thirtieth day of evaluation, after 4 to 24 h of leafhoppers confining...|$|E
40|$|The {{phytosanitary}} {{importance of}} the <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper,</b> Dalbulus maidis (De Long and Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and the planthopper, Delphacodes kuscheli Fennah (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) lies {{in their ability to}} transmit phloem-associated plant pathogens, mainly viruses and mollicutes, and to cause considerable mechanical damage to corn plants during feeding and oviposition. Fungi, particularly some members of the Ascomycota, are likely candidates for biocontrol agents against these insect pests, but several studies revealed their failure to invade the insect cuticle possibly {{because of the presence of}} inhibitory compounds such as phenols, quinones, and lipids and also by the antibiosis effect of the microbiota living on the cuticular surface of the host. The present work aims to understand interactions between the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamao-Crivelli) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) and bacterial antagonists isolated from the cuticular surface of D. maidis and D. kuscheli. A total of 155 bacterial isolates were recovered from the insect's cuticle and tested against B. bassiana. Ninety-one out of 155 strains inhibited the growth of B. bassiana. Bacterial strains isolated from D. maidis were significantly more antagonistic against B. bassiana than those isolates from D. kuscheli. Among the most effective antagonistic strains, six isolates of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bacillales: Bacillaeae (after B. subtilis)), one isolate of B. mycoides Flügge, eight isolates of B. megaterium de Bary, five isolates of B. pumilus Meyer and Gottheil, one isolate of B. licheniformis (Weigmann) Chester, and four isolates of B. subtilis (Ehrenberg) Cohn were identified...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about how adults of the <b>corn</b> <b>leafhopper,</b> Dalbulus maidis (DeLong & Wolcott), and its {{congeners}} survive subfreezing temperatures at high elevations during the dry winter in Mexico. In the laboratory, duration of survival at- 5 ~ was measured for four Mexican Dalbulus species: D. maidis, D. elimatus (Ball), D. gelbus DeLong and D. quinquenotatus DeLong & Nault; and a closely related North American species, Baldulus tripsaci Kramer & Whitcomb. Adult leafhoppers eared under environmental conditions that simulated {{the beginning of the}} dry winter season during October in Mexico ('October-reared') were at least twice as tolerant of- 5 ~ than adults reared under environmental conditions that simulated the beginning of the wet summer season during June ('June-reared'). Dalbulus species found primarily at high elevations, uch as D. elimatus, were seven times more tolerant of- 5 ~ than D. quin-quenotatus, a species which overwinters at low to mid elevations on its Tripsacum hosts. October-reared D. maidis adults survived relatively short periods at- 5 ~ (LTs 0 = 8. 9 h) compared to October-reared D. elimatus adults (LTso = 42. 3 h). This suggests that in Mexico, D. maidis either overwinters inprotected habitats at higher elevations or it migrates to lower, frost-free regions. October-reared B. tripsaci adults, which overwinter in the egg stage, were intolerant of- 5 ~ (LTs 0 = 2. 6 h). A conditioning period for 1 h at + 5 ~ before and after exposure to- 5 ~ significantly improved survival for D. maidis. Super-cooling points (SCPs) were between- 23 and- 20 ~ indicating that mortality of these leafhoppers at- 5 ~ was due to cold shock injury rather than internal ice formation...|$|E
