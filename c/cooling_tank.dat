50|$|In {{dairy farming}} a bulk milk <b>cooling</b> <b>tank</b> {{is a large}} storage tank for cooling and holding milk at a cold {{temperature}} until it can {{be picked up by}} a milk hauler. The bulk milk <b>cooling</b> <b>tank</b> is an important milk farm equipment. It is usually made of stainless steel and used every day to store the raw milk on the farm in good condition. It must be cleaned after each milk collection. The milk <b>cooling</b> <b>tank</b> can be the property of the farmer or being rented to the farmer by the dairy plant.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the influence of procedures for hygienic milking and cleaning of dairy equipment and milk <b>cooling</b> <b>tanks</b> on the levels of total bacterial count (TBC). Mixed-effect models were used in order to model the structure of dependence between and within dairy farms. To this end, four bulk samples of milk were collected from each tank in eight properties for TBC analysis, employing the flow cytometry method. A questionnaire was applied in each property to assess the current situation of milking procedures on each production system that took part on this research, followed by training of employees in good agricultural practices in the production of milk and monitoring of the TBC measurements. Analysis of longitudinal data was the method employed, which focused on random effects models. The results showed that the handling procedures for milking and the cleanliness of the <b>cooling</b> <b>tanks</b> contributed to a further reduction in the levels of total bacterial count in raw milk <b>cooling</b> <b>tanks...</b>|$|R

40|$|A risk {{analysis}} for the installation of milk <b>cooling</b> <b>tanks</b> (250, 500 and 1, 000 L) on Brazilian rural properties was conducted in this study. The results showed that all investments had a return higher than the annual 12 % minimum rate of attractiveness. There was a direct relationship between tank size and investment profitability and an inverse relation between size and risk. The probability of achieving returns lower than the opportunity cost was highest for the smallest tank (42 %). In {{order to make the}} investment in small <b>cooling</b> <b>tanks</b> more attractive, the dairy industry incentives offered to farmers for supplying cooled milk could be increased. However, this approach might make investments in bulk milk collection by dairy companies infeasible. Thus, a recommendable strategy for a successful modernization of the Brazilian dairy sector?s inbound logistics would be to promote an increase in the volume of the milk produced per farm...|$|R

In 1957 the massage room was extended, wall radiators were installed, floors were re-tiled and modern lighting fixtures were added. Many of the original furnishings were also replaced at that time. Other changes to the building include the installation of whirlpool equipment in 1962 and air conditioning in 1971. The Superior closed in 1983 and the furnishings were sold at auction.|$|E
50|$|The clear fluid is then {{transferred}} to another <b>cooling</b> <b>tank</b> where it is retained for about 24 to 26 hours with temperature maintained at about 20 C. Then the fluid is transferred to stainless steel tanks for {{the first stage of}} fermentation and then to oak wood barrels for the malo-lactic fermentation process. This process takes a minimum of 6 months for red wine. Fermentation is facilitated by adding yeast (usually Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus in suitable proportion to the fluid being fermented. The fermentation process is done in controlled temperature of 13 - 15 C for a period of 15-20 days for white wine and at 25 - 28 C for 8-10 days for red wine. By this process sugar gets converted to alcohol and the wine is ready for distillation and filtration depending on the status of fomented wine;filtration is done with use of 0.45 micron filter and the wine is filled in bottles. The bottled wine is kept for aging for a minimum of 3 months in the case of red wine and 1-2 months in the case of white wine. It is only after this ageing that the wines are marketed.|$|E

40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the sector occurred in the early 1990 and the globalization of markets have presented a series of injunctions to the productive milk chain, particularly in the primary production stage, imposing to the organizations the need of a wide reformulation of their structures and strategies {{in order to keep}} such organisms themselves either active and competitive. This study aims to present the experiences of associative organizations of dairy farmers of six rural communities of the State of Minas Gerais, which have been adopting the system of purchasing and use of communitarian milk <b>cooling</b> <b>tanks.</b> The methodology consisted in the utilization of qualitative and quantitative research methods through an exploratory study, a descriptive approach and a comparative multicase study. The statistical analyses of frequency and distinguishers were used. It was found that that 82 % of the farmers interviewed stated that the need of installation of the communitarian tank was the chief reason for them to associate, which is highly justifiable, considering the transformations which have been occurring in that productive chain. Out of the motivational variables indicating the associative behavior which have most discriminated the communities it stand out the demand for the dairy plant, the power of bargain in milk price and in the purchase of inputs, the reduction of the transportation cost and the commitment to the MAPA guidelines. The results showed that the associative experiences of the dairy farmers in the purchasing of milk <b>cooling</b> <b>tanks</b> vary according to the participation of the local industry – whether a dairy plant whether an agricultural cooperative, as well as public bureaus. milking, associativism, expanding <b>tanks,</b> milk <b>cooling</b> <b>tanks.,...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the quality of}} raw milk from eight dairy property in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, stored in a <b>cooling</b> <b>tank,</b> in order to evaluate methods for determining somatic cell counts (SCC). The Somaticell® kit and a portable Direct Cell Counter (DCC) were compared {{with each other and}} with the MilkoScanTM FT+ (FOSS Denmark), which uses Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIS). Direct cell counter data were processed for somatic cell scores (log-transformed somatic cell count) and analyzed with the SAS®, Statistical Analysis System.

No significant difference was observed for comparison of means. The correlation between somatic cell scores was significant, that is, 0. 907 and 0. 876 between the MilkoScanTM FT + and the Somaticell® kit and Direct Cell Count (DCC) respectively, and 0. 943 between the Somaticell® kit and Direct Cell Count (DCC).

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study focused}} on {{isolating}} Pseudomonas spp. during milking process in ten dairy farms with manual and mechanical milking systems during dry and rainy seasons, and evaluating DNA homology and patterns of distribution between isolates, {{in order to identify}} main sources of milk contamination by Pseudomonas spp. A total of 167 isolates of Pseudomonas spp. were obtained from water, milkers’ hands, cows’ teats, teat cups, <b>cooling</b> <b>tanks</b> and raw milk. Bacteria of Pseudomonas spp. genus were isolated from 85 and 82 sampling points in dairy farms with manual and mechanical milking system, respectively. A significant difference (p= 0. 02) on Pseudomonas spp. isolation was observed among samples of surface of cows’ teats before and after pre-dipping, but no significant difference (p> 0. 05) was observed among milking systems or seasons. The possibility of the same Pseudomonas spp. patterns are distributed in different farms and seasons using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) technique was demonstrated. Milkers’ hands, surface of cows’ teats, teat cups and <b>cooling</b> <b>tanks</b> were associated with raw milk contamination with Pseudomonas spp. on farms with manual and mechanical milking system, showing that regardless of the type of milking system and season, proper hygiene procedures of equipment, utensils and workers’ hands are essential to avoid contamination of the milk and, therefore, improve milk quality...|$|R
