The larvae of the parsnip moth (Depressaria radiella), native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, construct their webs on the umbels, feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds.|$|E
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> <b>moth)</b> attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
50|$|Various Allium {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of the leek moth and onion fly {{as well as some}} Lepidoptera {{including}} cabbage moth, <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> (recorded on garlic), garden dart moth, large yellow underwing moth, nutmeg moth, setaceous Hebrew character moth, turnip moth and Schinia rosea, a moth that feeds exclusively on Allium species.|$|E

25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, <b>common</b> <b>swift,</b> ghost <b>moth</b> and large yellow underwing.|$|R

50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus apus) was {{the best}} {{candidate}} for research aimed at determining whether or not birds exhibiting USWS can sleep in flight. The selection of the <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> as a model stemmed from observations elucidating {{the fact that the}} <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> left its nest at night, only returning in the early morning. Still, evidence for USWS is strictly circumstantial and based on the notion that if swifts must sleep to survive, they must do so via aerial roosting as little time is spent sleeping in a nest.|$|R
50|$|The conifer <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> (Korscheltellus gracilis) is a <b>swift</b> <b>moth</b> {{considered}} a forest pest in {{eastern and central}} North America, from Canada south to North Carolina. Larvae feed primarily on roots of evergreen trees, and are weakly polyphagous, able to survive on deciduous trees (e.g. birches, Betula) but preferring balsam fir and red spruce. They penetrate bark, but lesions on roots are shallow. These wounds may, however, provide easy entry for pathogenic fungi and nematodes. K. gracilis {{has been shown to}} reduce survival on saplings, but adult trees have been found with more than 30 feeding scars on their roots. But trees that are weakened by air pollution or changes in soil chemistry may invite K. gracilis infestation. Adults can be found in woody areas between June and August. They are cryptically colored, but are active for 20-40 minutes each dawn and twilight, and occasionally come to light. In the conifer <b>swift</b> <b>moth,</b> courtship, mating, and egg laying occur during evening hours; only oviposition occurs in the morning. They are Exoporia, and females scatter eggs while in flight. It takes two years for the larvae to mature, so populations tend towards two-year cycles. Females emit pheromones to attract males, from organs on their hind wings.|$|R

50|$|Swifts are {{the fastest}} of birds. Larger species are amongst the fastest fliers {{in the animal}} kingdom, with the white-throated needletail having been {{reported}} flying at up to 169 km/h. Even the <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> can cruise at a maximum speed of 31 metres per second (112 km/h). In a single year the <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> can cover at least 200,000 km.|$|R
50|$|Heteroneura is {{a natural}} group (or clade) in the insect order Lepidoptera that {{comprises}} over 99% of all butterflies and moths. This is the sister group of the infraorder Exoporia (<b>swift</b> <b>moths</b> and their relatives), and is characterised by wing venation which is not similar or homoneurous in both pairs of wings.|$|R
50|$|Distinguishing {{the plain}} swift from the {{similarly}} plumaged <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> {{is much more}} difficult, although juvenile common can be easily eliminated due to its white throat. The plain is slimmer and appears longer winged than the common, and has scaly underparts, difficult to see except with excellent views.

40|$|During {{the spring}} 2015, {{a pair of}} Common Redstarts Phoenicurus phoenicurus {{successfully}} raised a five-chick brood in an artificial nest-box designed for and occupied {{by a pair of}} <b>Common</b> <b>Swifts</b> Apus apus in southern Sweden. The breeding was monitored by a nest-box camera, which recorded close interactions between the two species. The Common Redstarts initiated the breeding first and had young in the nest when the <b>Common</b> <b>Swifts</b> arrived and initiated breeding by laying their eggs in a nearby nest cup. The breeding overlapped by 15 days between the second and the fourth week of June when all five of the nestlings of the Common Redstart fledged. The <b>Common</b> <b>Swifts</b> raised two young which fledged in early August...|$|R
40|$|Many birds use {{a flight}} mode called undulating or flap-gliding flight, where they {{alternate}} between flapping and gliding phases, while {{only a few}} bats make use of such a flight mode. Among birds, flap-gliding is commonly used by medium to large species, where it is regarded to have a lower energetic cost than continuously flapping flight. Here, we introduce a novel model for estimating the energetic flight economy of flap-gliding animals, by determining the lift-to-drag ratio for flap-gliding based on empirical lift-to-drag ratio estimates for continuous flapping flight and for continuous gliding flight, respectively. We apply the model to flight performance data of the <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus apus) and of the lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae). The <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> is a typical flap-glider while-to {{the best of our}} knowledge-the lesser long-nosed bat does not use flap-gliding. The results show that, according to the model, the flap-gliding <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> saves up to 15 % energy compared to a continuous flapping swift, and that this is primarily due to the exceptionally high lift-to-drag ratio in gliding flight relative to that in flapping flight for <b>common</b> <b>swifts.</b> The lesser long-nosed bat, on the other hand, seems {{not to be able to}} reduce energetic costs by flap-gliding. The difference in relative costs of flap-gliding flight between the <b>common</b> <b>swift</b> and the lesser long-nosed bat can be explained by differences in morphology, flight style and wake dynamics. The model presented here proves to be a valuable tool for estimating energetic flight economy in flap-gliding animals. The results show that flap-gliding flight that is naturally used by <b>common</b> <b>swifts</b> is indeed the most economic one of the two flight modes, while this is not the case for the non-flap-gliding lesser long-nosed bat...|$|R
