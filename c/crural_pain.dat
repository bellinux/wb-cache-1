40|$|Background Legs burning for {{treating}} lumbar radicular pain {{are still in}} use nowadays in low socioeconomical environments. They are dangerous as the case we report shows clearly. Clinical case A 49 -year-old man came to our attention with severe flaccid paraparesis occurred 10 days before, almost immediately after he had immersed his legs in boiling water to treat his severe left lumbocrural pain. This {{was known to be}} due to a right L 3 / 4 herniated disk diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. At the examination he showed severe motor paresis and absent reflexes of his lower limbs, while <b>crural</b> <b>pain</b> was mild and sensation and urinary function were unaffected. The results of his neurologic examination led us to suspect an acute motor axon degeneration related to thermal shock. Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging, performed before the planned electromyogram as an exception to the established routine, showed instead a giant 5 - Ã— 5. 5 -cm, herniated disk compressing the dural sac at L 3. Conclusions Prompt surgical decompression led to rapid improvement. We discuss here the pathophysiology of this unusual case and point out how medieval practices {{for treating}} sciatica-like pain are not only unjustified from a medical viewpoint but also potentially dangerous...|$|E
