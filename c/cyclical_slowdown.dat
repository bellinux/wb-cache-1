40|$|A {{study of}} {{business}} cycles defined as sequences of expansions and contractions {{in the level}} of general economic activity does not require trend estimation and elimination, but a study of growth cycles defined as sequences of high and low growth phases does. Major <b>cyclical</b> <b>slowdowns</b> and booms deserve to be analyzed along with classical recessions and expansions, but the needed time series decomposition presents difficult problems, mainly because trends and cycles influence each other. We compare cyclical movements in levels, deviations from trend, and smoothed growth rates of the principal measures of aggregate economic activity – the quarterly real GDP and the monthly U. S. Coincident Index – using the phase average trend (PAT). Then we compare alternative trend estimates, deterministic and stochastic, linear and nonlinear, and the corresponding estimates of “cyclical components,” that is, series of deviations from these trends. We discuss how these measures differ in terms of the patterns, timing, amplitudes, and smoothness of the resulting estimates of U. S. growth cycles in the post-World War II period.

40|$|This paper reviews some of China’s high {{frequency}} economic indicators and our principal findings on their selection and use. Our {{aim is to}} develop a composite index of coincident indicators (CEI) which can be used to obtain timely information on the present state of the China’s economy and provide an appropriate measure to analyze China’s short-term macroeconomic dynamics. Notably, combining industrial production, retail sales, manufacturing employment, income of financial institutions, and passenger traffic volume works well as the method for dating business cycles for China. It shows that, over the past two decades, there was one marked recession which occurred in 1988 : 8 to 1989 : 12. In addition to this business cycle chronology we also develop a growth cycle chronology based on the deviations from trend of the CE which shows that there were four <b>cyclical</b> <b>slowdowns</b> since 1986. Whereas GDP growth lacks cyclical movements and appears to be dominated by trend and irregular movements, in contrast to GDP, CEI works well as a measure of cyclical dynamics and can contribute to the analysis of short term fluctuations of Chinese economic activity relative to its long term growth. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we try to}} {{interpret}} several important trends {{in the size of}} governments and government deficits in the OECD economies : the rapid increase in the public spending to GDP ratio in the 1970 s; the sharp rise in budget deficits and in debt-GNP ratios after 1973; and the early signs of a slowdown or reversal in the rise of the spending ratios in the 1980 s. We show that the rise in size of the government was importantly associated with the slowdown in output growth after 1973, {{as well as with the}} gradual adjustment of spending ratios to long-run values. These long-run values appear to depend on the political and institutional characteristics of the various economies (the ideological orientation of the government, the degree of wage indexation, and the average number of parties in the governing coalitions). As for budget deficits, we argue that much can be explained by normal <b>cyclical</b> factors (the <b>slowdown</b> in growth and the rise in unemployment after 1973), but that in addition, the size of the budget deficits has been related to political as well as economic characteristics of the countries. Deficit reduction requires political consensus, at least among the parties belonging to the governing coalition. We note that such consensus is harder to achieve in multi-party coalition governments and that the failure to reach a consensus on budget cutting can help to explain why countries with multi-party coalition governments have experienced particularly large increases in the debt-GNP ratio. ...|$|R
40|$|The Central, East and Southeast European (CESEE) economies will {{experience}} on average a minor rebound {{of economic growth}} to 1 % in 2010 which will speed up to 2. 5 % in 2011 and 3. 5 % in 2012. GDP growth will be higher in the CIS countries and in Turkey, about average in the Central European NMS and lower in the SEE countries and the Baltics. Growth is currently driven mostly by exports which should outweigh the dampening effects of the austerity measures. Whether the countries will actually benefit from the global trade recovery depends on their exchange rate regime {{and the strength of}} their industrial sector. Investment and household consumption will recover in the subsequent years. These are the main results of the new medium-term forecast for the region published by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw). Foreign demand only the fittest will profit from the trade rebound The mild improvement in the international environment has helped to uplift the mood among the CESEE exporters. In 2010, exports are likely to be the main growth driver throughout the region, in many cases contributing to an improvement in external balances. The latest data reveal a return to about 80 - 90 % of pre-crisis export levels. Transport equipment, metals, energy products, chemicals, machinery and equipment are currently among the region's most successful export goods. Countries with flexible exchange rate regimes and a stronger industrial base appear to be benefiting most from the current international trade rebound. They are expected to record growth above the regional average (yet still below pre-crisis levels). Growth patterns The previously overheated growth rates in excess of 7 % on regional average in 2007 were followed by a severe cooling-down to some 3. 5 % in 2008 and a steep drop to no less than - 6 % in 2009. We expect a minor rebound in the order of 1 % for the year 2010. In a rather optimistic scenario, our average forecasts predict a pick-up of growth to about 2. 5 % in 2011 and approximately 3. 5 % in 2012 (see Table). Growth is mostly driven by exports and regained competitiveness. In subsequent years, investment and household consumption will gradually pick up. In most countries of the region, previously postponed investments will be finally put into effect and household consumption will show signs of life after the crisis as well. Differentiation among country groups The CIS countries are expected to register the strongest performance over the forecast period. This upswing will be mainly driven by the recovery in global commodity prices (especially for oil and steel). The Central European new EU member states have improved their external competitiveness - via devaluation and/or cuts in employment. On account of their solid industries, they profit most from the ongoing recovery in global trade. However, their growth prospects are constrained by the anaemic growth performance in their main export market - the eurozone. Prospects for recovery are weakest in the Baltic States and the countries of Southeast Europe. Their general reliance on fixed exchange rates has prevented an improvement in external competitiveness. Furthermore, their weak industrial sectors remain an obstacle to export-led growth. Unemployment still on the rise Most CESEE countries have been recently shedding labour and unemployment is on the rise - a belated consequence of the crisis. In the Western Balkans, significant employment cuts have so far been mostly averted, but they might well come to the fore in the near future. Labour market deterioration - in tandem with the ongoing 'credit crunch' and austerity measures - is suppressing consumer demand almost everywhere (except in the CIS and Turkey). Medium-term challenges The recent surge in CESEE budget deficits reflects primarily the recession-induced shortfalls in tax revenues rather than a rise in expenditures. However, funding deficits under the current conditions is becoming costlier. The fiscal consolidation measures being envisaged might well increase the drag on domestic demand (first and foremost in the NMS). A permanent tightening of financial conditions and a sustained need for deleveraging will most likely result in slower capital accumulation in the years ahead. Furthermore, {{as a consequence of the}} crisis, persistently low employment levels might result in human capital losses. The slower growth will also have an impact on the region's long-term prospects of convergence. As a result of the crisis, the average CESEE country might lose close to a decade in the process of income catching-up. Special section on longer-term growth prospects The CEE economies are adjusting to the effects of the crisis in the West. Those adjustments are slowing down economic growth and suppressing the speed of convergence. Unless the 'old' EU starts growing faster than in the recent past, the long-term growth in the CEE countries will not be very spectacular either. The secular weakness of growth in the EU/euro area has its roots in the basic paradigms of EU economic policy-making. Not only does the acceleration of growth depend on changes in those paradigms, but the very preservation of the EU, which is exposed to ever stronger centrifugal forces, may also be at stake. It is in the best political and economic interests of the NMS to help avert such an eventuality, while helping to make the Union's architecture more resilient and conducive to faster growth. One issue relates to the way in which monetary policy has been defined and pursued in the euro area. It is argued that the principle 'one size fits all' on which this policy rests supports deflationary/stagnation tendencies in low-inflation/low-growth countries and bolsters booms/inflation in high-inflation/high-growth countries. Whereas Germany has fallen victim to this policy, in a number of other countries this policy fed credit and import booms. Diverging trends in unit labour costs, external competitiveness and external balances are the other side of the ECB single monetary policy. Germany has been running increasing external surpluses; its partners increasing deficits. Worse still, the German policy has supported this trend as it allegedly helps to reduce unemployment. The 'beggar-thy-neighbour' policy turns out to be harmful to Germany itself because it suppresses domestic demand more than it helps advance external surpluses. Weak overall growth in Germany is the result. The external surpluses mirror the spiralling debt of the external deficit countries. As that debt proves unserviceable, the German government is forced to take it over in order to save the country's financial institutions. The intensity of the centrifugal forces within the euro area (and generally in the EU) should be dampened by closer coordination of the member states' fiscal and wage policies. In particular, it may be useful to demand that growing labour productivity be matched by wages at the national level. In addition, it should be possible to institute 'excessive external surplus procedures' against countries that generate large net exports at the expense of cuts in domestic consumption. We also argue that, until the mechanisms are in place to limit the divergences in unit labour costs and external imbalances, it is advisable for the NMS to retain their own currencies and floating exchange rate regimes. The Stability and Growth Pact is also in need of modification. The 3 % fiscal deficit/GDP mark may prevent the efficient operation of automatic stabilizers that today are rightly considered vital under <b>cyclical</b> growth <b>slowdowns.</b> Furthermore, the Pact's insistence that in the medium term the budgetary positions should be close to balance or in surplus is not consistent with economic reality. Attempts to observe that requirement are doomed to failure whenever the private sector's propensity to save is larger than its propensity to invest in real (fixed) productive assets. Under balanced external accounts, a permanent fiscal deficit may be a secular necessity. Problems related to rising public debt may also need to be addressed. For the euro area these problems could be rendered far less serious than is often believed.

40|$|The {{dampening}} {{impact of}} the international <b>cyclical</b> <b>slowdown</b> on Austrian exports and business investment is being exacerbated by a decline in construction activity: in April and May, the sector's gross output fell by an inflation-adjusted 8 percent below the year-earlier level. Domestic manufacturing output held up well against the international <b>cyclical</b> <b>slowdown</b> until spring, but has since shown clear signs of weakening. In the second quarter, the production index was no higher than a year ago, having gained 6 percent {{during the first three}} months of the year. Exports and investment have also lost much of their previous momentum. Still more critical than in manufacturing, however, is the situation in the construction sector. In April and May, nominal output fell by 6 ½ percent year-on-year, or by 8 percent at constant prices. Particularly severe was the slump in residential construction (– 14 ½ percent); gross output also fell in civil engineering. The sharp downturn is confirmed by the labour market statistics: 14, 000 construction jobs were lost from the previous year in the second quarter, and unemployment edged up by 3, 000. Leading business climate indicators do not yet support hopes for an imminent turnaround. Industrial confidence has weakened further in the third quarter. Results from the regular WIFO business survey have pointed down for the fifth time in a row. Sentiment in the construction sector has taken a steep fall. Exports remained surprisingly strong from January to April, gaining 10 percent year-on-year. In May, however, they failed to reach the year-earlier level, a reversal that is broadly in line with the slowdown abroad and firms' more pessimistic judgement on export orders. Tourism is currently providing major support to overall activity. The summer season has taken an encouraging start, with gross revenues from May to July rising by 5. 2 percent from last year. Higher net earnings from cross-border tourism services are also largely responsible for an improvement in the current account. Consumer demand was still lively in the first quarter, but abated in the following period. Volume retail sales decelerated, while new car registrations declined. Wholesale trade was moreover affected by the slackening of exports and investment. Labour statistics for the trade sector, on the other hand, showing a net increase in the number of jobs and unemployment falling until mid-year, suggest a somewhat better situation. Labour market conditions overall are reflecting the <b>cyclical</b> <b>slowdown.</b> The year-on-year gains in employment (excluding people on parental leave and in military service) have narrowed to 0. 4 percent by August, the number of unemployed is up by 15, 300.

A major factor is the unabated increase in oil prices on world markets, which drives up inflation to a projected average rate of 3. 5 percent this year. The implicit squeeze in household real disposable income restrains the growth of private consumption. The business cycle downturn spreading from the USA to the other industrialised countries will weigh on growth of Austrian exports, industrial output and investment.

40|$|After {{slightly}} narrowing {{during the}} <b>cyclical</b> <b>slowdown</b> of 2001, the U. S. current account deficit widened in 2002, {{as it had}} over the previous decade. Two-thirds {{of the increase in}} the deficit last year was attributable to an increase in the deficit for trade in goods and services. In addition, net investment income receded as receipts from abroad declined more than payments on foreign investments in the United States. The record $ 503 billion U. S. current account deficit registered in 2002 was financed by continued high levels of private capital inflows and stepped-up foreign official purchases of U. S. assets. If economic activity picks up in the United States and in its major trading partners later this year, as most forecasters expect, the U. S. external deficit likely will widen as U. S. imports of goods and services rise by a greater amount than U. S. exports of goods and services. The decline in the dollar from early 2002 to date is unlikely to restrain the widening of the deficit by much, as it has been relatively small and its effects will be spread over a number of years.

Gross domestic product (GDP) growth has clearly revived {{in the second quarter of}} the current year and the industrial sector has emerged as one of the prime movers of the process. 9. 2 The recovery in the industrial sector is clearly discernible as corroborated by both the data on national accounts and the index of industrial production (IIP).

40|$|Much as expected, {{demand and}} output in Austria {{remained}} firm throughout 1990. The forecast for annual growth of real GDP is maintained at 4 ½ percent. Also, projections for other major variables are broadly confirmed by recent developments. Consumer price inflation will likely average 3 ¼ percent, unemployment is rising to almost 5 ½ {{percent of the}} dependent labour force and the current account remains in small surplus. Forward looking indicators like the inflow of orders to industry and survey data on business confidence signal a weakening of activity in 1991, {{in line with the}} international trend. Domestic demand will expand at a slower pace. The once-and-for-all boost to net disposable incomes and private consumption from the tax reform is levelling off. However, settlements in the autumn wage round broadly protect real wage gains against the impact of rising inflation and households may be ready to reduce their saving in view of the still encouraging prospects for income and employment. With output close to capacity limits and profits at record levels there are strong incentives for firms to step up capital spending. Yet, the danger of a recession abroad, the Gulf crisis and spreading fragility in financial markets have recently deteriorated the investment climate. WIFO survey results show clearly that entrepreneurs are turning more cautious in judging the business outlook. On the other hand, activity in the construction industry is gaining new momentum.

40|$|For {{the second}} {{month in a}} row, the regular WIFO {{business}} survey is pointing to a recovery in the Austrian manufacturing sector. This is consistent with an upturn in leading indicators in the USA and the EU. Still, no relief is as yet in sight for the construction sector and the labour market. According to forward-looking indicators, a business cycle turnaround may be imminent. In the USA, the purchasing managers index jumped in February, while in Germany the ifo index for the business climate has been trending up {{for the last couple}} of months. For the euro area, the GDP indicator developed by a group of European economic research institutes (Euroframe) suggests rates of growth of 1. 4 and 2. 0 percent, respectively, for the first and the second quarter. The main drivers of the rebound are declines in interest rates and oil prices as well as improved expectations in the USA and in Europe. At this early stage, negative shocks may jeopardise a still fragile recovery. If, however, the positive expectations are confirmed, Europe has managed to avoid a recession. In Austria also, the economy has probably reached the trough of the cycle. Business sentiment has improved for the second consecutive month in February. In particular, expectations for the near future have turned more optimistic. Incoming orders, the business outlook and production expectations have been given better ratings by industrial firms than over the last months. In the construction sector, sentiment has stabilised in civil engineering, brought about partly by the stimulus programmes launched by the federal and the state governments. No upturn is yet visible for building activity, notably for new-home building. Data on exports and production only go as far as the end of last year. As could be expected, they show declines, thereby confirming earlier survey data. On the labour market, no turnaround is as yet discernible. The <b>cyclical</b> <b>slowdown</b> and the crisis in the construction industry have worsened the situation, leaving more negative marks on the jobless than on the employment data: while unemployment rose by 38, 700 year-on-year in February, employment went down by 7, 300 over the same period. The difference is explained by the sizeable increase in labour supply, due inter alia to a net inflow of foreign workers and the rise in the statutory early retirement age. Contrary to expectations held in some quarters, inflation has not been boosted by the introduction of euro notes and coins early this year. Abstracting from price increases for seasonal goods (fruits, vegetables), consumer prices edged down from December. Apparently, dual price advertising, price surveillance and competitive pressure have all had a positive effect in this regard. With inflation having gained momentum in other western European countries, the Austrian rate is now clearly below the average for the euro area.

40|$|The {{economy in}} the euro area has turned around. While GDP stagnated {{during the second half}} of 2001, there are more and more signs that output will {{increase}} considerably in the first half of this year. All in all, the slowdown has not been very pronounced. One indication for this is that in 2001, the year of the downturn, unemployment remained more or less constant. The factors which led to the <b>cyclical</b> <b>slowdown</b> have turned around and now stimulate economic activity: Monetary policy has become expansionary, oil prices have dropped substantially, and there is a recovery in the rest of the world. Key interest rates in the euro area have remained unchanged since early November 2001. Real short-term interest rates are well below their historical average. Therefore, economic activity is stimulated by monetary policy. Until spring 2003, the ECB will raise key interest rates to the neutral level which should prevail when the output gap is closed and when inflation is at its target; this neutral rate lies between 4 and 4. 5 percent. Money growth has exceeded the reference value of 4. 5 percent for M 3 considerably for several months. This increase implies that the velocity of money shows an unusually large deviation from its trend. According to the judgment of the ECB, the demand for M 3 has become unstable only in the short run due to special factors. If this judgment is correct, money growth will slow down markedly in the coming months. As a consequence, velocity will return to its trend without an increase in inflation. This implies, however, that the expected slowdown of money growth should not be used as an indication that monetary policy is tight and needs to be loosened because the deceleration of M 3 growth is nothing but a normalization. Fiscal consolidation has been insufficient in several countries. Governments in Germany, France, Italy and Portugal should begin to pursue a strict consolidation course. Empirical evidence shows that countries that undertook credible consolidation strategies based on expenditure cuts did not experience cyclical downturns. If the governments of these countries were to dampen the increase in government spending, there would be room for a reduction of the tax burden and of budget deficits. This would improve the growth perspectives for the medium term. In 2001, wages in the euro area increased somewhat faster than in the previous years largely reflecting the improvement of the labor market situation due to the strong upswing. Also, employees tried to limit the reduction of real wages, which was the consequence of the higher than expected rate of inflation. In our forecast, wage increases will average about 3 percent both this year and next. This implies that there is room for an increase in employment although it is smaller than at the end of the 1990 s. Nevertheless, the development of wages does not imply a risk for price level stability. The leading indicators suggest that the European economy has reached its trough in the first quarter of 2002 and that the upswing is imminent. From spring on, real GDP will increase at a faster pace than potential output. On average, it will increase by 1. 7 percent in 2002. In the course of the coming year, the increase in production will gradually slow down. The upswing in the world economy will probably pass its peak in the first half of next year implying a less dynamic external demand for European products. Domestic demand will also lose some momentum. This is due to the fact that monetary policy will return to a neutral course and that the effects of the preceding easing will gradually fade. We expect real GDP to increase by 3 percent in 2003. [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the Bank’s spring projections, the growth of activity and employment has proved robust in the euro area and in Belgium {{in the first half of}} 2007. However, the external environment has become more uncertain, owing to the financial market turmoil, the appreciation of the euro and the rising cost of energy and agricultural raw materials. Maintaining its 2006 momentum, economic activity in Belgium remained buoyant during the first half of 2007, expanding at a rate of 0. 7 p. c. per quarter. GDP growth dropped to 0. 4 p. c. in the third quarter, confirming the hitherto moderate fall in the synthetic indicator of business confidence. The slower rate of expansion looks set to continue in the fourth quarter and in the first part of 2008. Overall, real GDP growth is projected to decelerate from 2. 9 p. c. in 2006 to 2. 6 p. c. in 2007 and 1. 9 p. c. in 2008. The vigour of the Belgian economy at the beginning of 2007 was due mainly to the boost from domestic demand. In particular, firms and households were still resolutely increasing their fixed capital investment at the time, as they had in the preceding years, while private consumption was expanding significantly. These two factors are expected to weaken at the end of the year and in 2008. Supported by the robust activity pace, net job creations increased in the first half of 2007. Employment is projected to grow by 1. 6 p. c. in 2007 and 1 p. c. in 2008, representing net cumulative growth of almost 115, 000 jobs in the two years. Taking account of the expected movement in the labour force, the decline in the unemployment rate which began in April 2006 should continue, bringing that rate down from an average of 8. 3 p. c. in 2006 to 7. 7 p. c. in 2007 and 7. 3 p. c. in 2008. Estimated on the basis of the HICP, overall inflation should fall from 2. 3 p. c. in 2006 to 1. 8 p. c. in 2007, before rising to 2. 9 p. c. in 2008. This profile mainly reflects the movements in energy prices. The underlying inflation rate is projected to increase slightly in 2007, rising from 1. 6 p. c. in the previous year to 1. 9 p. c.; it should remain at that level in 2008. The rise in 2007 is due solely to the movement in prices of processed food. Conversely, inflation is expected to remain subdued in the case of non-energy industrial products and services, being held down by the appreciation of the euro, global competition and the generally moderate movement in wages over the recent years. Reflecting modest growth in labour productivity, which stems from the marked expansion of employment in 2007 and the <b>cyclical</b> <b>slowdown</b> in activity in 2008, the rise in unit labour costs in the private sector is forecast to accelerate, from 1. 4 p. c. in 2006 to 2. 2 p. c. in 2007 and 2. 1 p. c. in 2008. Hourly labour costs are projected to rise by 2. 8 p. c. in 2007 and 3 p. c. in 2008, an increase comparable to the 2006 figure. According to the latest data, public finances should end the year 2007 with a deficit of 0. 1 p. c. of GDP. In 2008, the deficit is expected to rise to 0. 3 p. c. of GDP. In 2007, public finances are benefiting from the favourable economic conditions and the further decline in interest charges. However, the positive impact of these factors is likely to be considerably outweighed by the disappearance of non-recurring factors. In 2008, the budget deficit will grow, despite a further fall in interest charges. In 2007 and 2008, the public debt will maintain its downward trend, falling by around 3 p. c. of GDP per annum. By the end of 2008, the debt ratio is forecast to reach 82. 1 p. c. Belgium, macroeconomic projections, Eurosystem...|$|E
