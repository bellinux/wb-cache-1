40|$|In this study, combed {{ring spun}} and compact <b>spun</b> <b>cotton</b> yarns with {{different}} counts {{were selected from}} different textile mills to conduct singeing treatment. Yarn properties including hairiness, fineness, unevenness and tensile properties were tested after the treatment {{and the results were}} compared with those before treatment. Hairiness was greatly removed after singeing, especially for short hairs with length less than 3 mm. Compact ring <b>spun</b> <b>cotton</b> yarns showed higher tex values and lower weight loss than <b>combed</b> ring <b>spun</b> <b>cotton</b> yarns under the same counts. Coefficient of variation of yarns increased slightly after singeing treatment. The unevenness of yarn was divided into two parts: basic unevenness of yarn body and hairiness unevenness, to explain the worse yarn evenness after singeing treatment. In this way, the effect of singeing on yarn properties was investigated thoroughly so as to improve yarn quality with less hairiness and good evenness. ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, 100 % cotton {{knitted fabrics}} made from <b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> and <b>combed</b> pima <b>cotton</b> were dyed with {{reactive}} dye, with different dye concentrations. Colour properties such as CIE L*a*b* values {{as well as}} dyeing uniformity of the dyed fabrics were measured. The relationships between colour properties and the ultraviolet protection afforded by cotton knitted fabrics were investigated. Experimental results revealed that dye concentration {{is the most important}} factor. In addition, only L* values have a direct mathematical relationship with the ultraviolet protection factor; a* and b* values and dyeing uniformity were not found to have a significant correlation with ultraviolet protection factor values. Meanwhile, knitted fabric made from <b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre has better ultraviolet protection performance than fabric made from <b>combed</b> pima <b>cotton</b> fibre.

40|$|Child labor remains {{unresolved}} {{in developing}} countries. Japan shares the same unpleasant past. A {{substantial number of}} child workers were employed in industrializing Japan prior to World War II. Yet, this {{did not lead to}} a controversy issue in this country. This study, examining the case of the <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> industry, argues that there was no wage discrimination against child workers, which prevented serious problems concerning child labor. The <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> industry, established during the 1880 s, had driven the Japanese economy until the 1930 s. It continued recruiting a large number of unmarried young women, including children, from rural areas. The managers of this industry, however, always suffered a labor shortage because these young women were required as workers in various sectors such as agriculture or domestic service. <b>Cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> workers did not need either skills or stamina due to mechanization. Thus, children employed by <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> mills, as well as their elder co-workers, were expected to play primary roles in their workshops, and these child workers were offered as high wages as adult workers...|$|R
