60|$|Coming {{upon this}} {{ground of the}} civil list, the first thing in dignity and charge that attracts our notice is the royal household. This establishment, in my opinion, is {{exceedingly}} abusive in its constitution. It is formed upon manners and customs that have long since expired. In the first place, it is formed, in many respects, upon feudal principles. In the feudal times, it was not uncommon, even among subjects, for the lowest offices to be held by considerable persons,--persons as unfit by their incapacity as improper from their rank to occupy such employments. They were held by patent, sometimes for life, and sometimes by inheritance. If my memory does not deceive me, a person of no slight consideration held the office of patent hereditary cook to an Earl of Warwick: the Earl of Warwick's soups, I fear, were not the better for the dignity of his kitchen. I {{think it was an}} Earl of Gloucester who officiated as steward of the household to the Archbishops of Canterbury. Instances of the same kind may in some degree be found in the Northumberland house-book, and other family records. There was some reason in ancient necessities for these ancient <b>customs.</b> <b>Protection</b> was wanted; and the domestic tie, though not the highest, was the closest.|$|E

There was some reason in ancient necessities, for these ancient <b>customs.</b> <b>Protection</b> was wanted; and the domestic tie, thought not the highest, was the closest. The king's household has not only several strong traces of this FEUDALITY, but it is formed also upon the principles of a BODY CORPORATE; it has its own magistrates, courts, and by-laws. This might be necessary in the ancient times, {{in order to have a}} government within itself, capable of regulating the vast and often unruly multitude which composed and attended it. This was the origin of the ancient court called the GREEN CLOTH--composed of the marshal, treasurer, and other great officers of the household, with certain clerks. The rich subjects of the kingdom who had formerly the same establishments (only on a reduced scale) have since altered their economy; and turned the course of their expense from the maintenance of vast establishments within their walls, to the employment of a great variety of independent trades abroad. Their influence is lessened; but a mode of accommodation, and a style of splendour, suited to the manners of the times, has been increased. Royalty itself has insensibly followed; and the royal household has been carried away by the resistless tide of manners: but with this very material difference;--private men have got rid of the establishments along with the reasons of them; whereas the royal household has lost all that was stately and venerable in the antique manners, without retrenching anything of the cumbrous charge of a Gothic establishment. It is shrunk into the polished littleness of modern elegance and personal accommodation; it has evaporated from the gross concrete into an essence and rectified spirit of expense, where you have tuns of ancient pomp in a vial of modern luxury.|$|E

50|$|Up to 1830, {{political}} {{unrest in}} Argentina and Uruguay favoured the jerky producers of Pelotas. But with order restored in these countries, competition by Argentinian and Uruguayan jerky producers became a concern. The jerky industry of the Plata was {{favored by the}} superior quality of Argentinian and Uruguayan pastures, by their better seaports, and by their use of free labor, instead of slavery. Consequently, the regional elites soon started to demand <b>customs</b> <b>protection</b> for the gaúcho jerky against {{the product of the}} Rio de la Plata; on the failure of the Imperial government to address those concerns, political demands of greater autonomy, and ideas of a federal relationship towards the rest of Brazil were put forth.|$|E

The situation for the business was severely changed as the Norwegian iron works lost the last <b>customs</b> <b>protection</b> against Swedish iron. From a principled position, count Wedel voted for abandoning the levies on Swedish iron, even though he as an owner of several Norwegian iron works experienced a huge loss in the establishment of free trade. After he formally had taken over Moss Jernverk, count Wedel was noticed that the iron works still owed 50,000 riksdaler to the state, the standing loan from 1755 that was not paid down. After years of court proceedings, the Supreme Court of Norway ruled that the loan was valid, but not possible to terminate as long as the cannon foundry was kept functional.|$|E

40|$|In the {{economic}} {{cycle of the}} Czech Republic in the nineties {{the number of years}} of economic recession or stagnation was higher than the duration of economic growth.

Low <b>customs</b> <b>protection,</b> loose regulation of the entry of new economic agents on the market, high tax burden, high cost of loan capital exerted a high economic pressure on the corporate sector.

40|$|Moral hazard {{defines the}} {{situation}} when the rightful owners of scarce resources are hampered by their entrusted agents from allocating these resources {{as they see}} fit, the later ones speculating not only the ubiquitous asymmetry of information, but the limitations, as coming from various state regulations, that impede the free and as complete as possible design of contracts in markets. The modern business corporation {{is said to be}} a particular headquarter of moral hazard – on one hand, between shareholders and managers, on the other, between itself and third parties – all that due to the legal shield that the “limited liability”, as “unnatural privilege granted by the state”, gives, fuelling propensity to pure speculation, and thus sending capitalism to ruinous instability. In our article, armed with reasoning coming from the Austrian School inspired libertarian ethics of private property rights (a rigorously reconstructed extension of classical liberalism precepts), we tried to enable the idea that in the corporation organizational design there is, ipso facto, nothing to be seen as an abusive license, granted by the state, through “limited liability” facility. In the light of this reappraisal, the corporation, the one that “strictly acts in the free market”, and so respects the societal division of labour, third parties’ legitimate property rights, not abusing the privileging safeguards (such as monopoly, <b>customs</b> <b>protection</b> or public subsidies, that incite the corporate actors to adopt abusive behaviours), is considered a socially benign capitalist pivot...|$|E
