25|$|Peafowl produce loud calls {{especially}} in the breeding season. They may <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> when alarmed and neighbouring birds may call in a relay like series. Nearly seven different call variants {{have been identified in}} the peacocks apart from six alarm calls that are commonly produced by both sexes.|$|E
25|$|Calls are {{typically}} heard more frequently during the breeding season. However, {{the time of}} day can differ amongst species, as some are more vocal in the morning, others in the evening, and some are more vocal during the heat of midday. Some will <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> from their roosts. Frequency can vary between species and between individuals. One male brushland tinamou called every few minutes from dawn until dusk (over 500 calls daily). Some, in particular Crypturellus species, use regular call sites. Only a few possess an alarm call.|$|E

50|$|Birdwatchers visit Wonga Beach to {{see three}} {{uncommon}} bird species: Gould's bronze cuckoo, double-eyed fig-parrot {{and the beach}} stone-curlew. The last species is easily confused with the ubiquitous bush stone-curlew noted for its wailing <b>calls</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tasmanian nativehen has 14 {{separate}} calls, {{ranging from}} low grunts to high pitched alarm calls {{as well as}} a see-sawing duet performed in unison, rising to a crescendo of harsh screeching notes, It also <b>calls</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Warden and Senior Members are all {{trained as}} fire marshals; most also have “first aid {{appointed}} person” training. There is a Duty Senior Member on <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>nights</b> and weekends {{to deal with}} any emergencies while the Bursar's Office is closed.|$|R
50|$|Males <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> {{from beneath}} the surface of the soil. The call is a rapid series of 4-9 boops.|$|E
50|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is primary lower montane forest where it prefers forest clearings and forest and river edges. The altitudinal range is 1400 - 1540 m above sea level. Males <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> perched on leaves and stems some 1-3 m above the ground.|$|E
50|$|The male has {{a median}} subgular vocal sac. Males <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> from tree holes {{that are about}} 1 - 5 m meters above the ground. Males are able to adjust their call to the {{resonance}} frequency of the tree hole they call from.|$|E
50|$|Between 2011-2012 {{the band}} {{recorded}} an album <b>called</b> <b>At</b> <b>Nights,</b> and the mixing process went through 2013. The release date {{was set for}} January 2014. The Magic Shop, which was released as a free download few years earlier, was released on a CD by Musea Records in 2014.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{takes place}} between September and February. The male <b>calls</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> from among rocks {{or from the}} banks of streams in forests. The eggs are laid in {{underground}} nests in the muddy bank, and the developing tadpoles live {{on the bottom of}} the stream. They undergo metamorphosis when about 21 mm long.|$|R
50|$|Red Knott - Red {{is an avid}} birdwatcher who sleeps {{during the}} day so he can make bird <b>calls</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> He distrusts {{tourists}} of any kind, viewing them as threats to the natural ecosystem of Moon Lake. He dislikes Nancy due to her loud, inquisitive manner and the strange accidents that trail her.|$|R

5000|$|The {{yellow rail}} are very elusive and seldom seen. They {{generally}} <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> resembling {{the sound of}} two stones being clicked together [...] "tik-tik tik-tik-tik" [...] in repetition. When approached, {{they are more likely}} to rely on camouflage and escaping on foot through dense vegetation, rather than flushing.|$|E
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are montane {{primary and secondary}} tropical forest at elevations of 1200 - 1700 m above sea level. It typically occurs close to streams. Males <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> adjacent to small streams. The eggs are laid on leaves, and upon hatching, the tadpoles fall in to the stream.|$|E
50|$|The natural {{habitats}} {{of this species}} are pine-oak forest. The holotype was found <b>calling</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> from under a piece of bark on a large log in a small stream at 2160 m above sea level. The second specimen was found inside an arboreal bromeliad on a fallen oak tree at 2850 m asl.|$|R
50|$|Odontophrynus americanus {{is common}} {{throughout}} much of its range. It occurs in open grasslands and savannas. It is a fossorial species, but during the breeding season, these frogs are found at shallow, temporary ponds and flooded areas. Males can be heard <b>calling</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> from the edge of, or from within the water. The species tolerates substantial habitat disturbance and no significant threats have been identified.|$|R

5000|$|The {{breeding}} period {{coincides with}} the rainy season (December-March). Males <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> near temporary ponds and slow-moving streams. The call consists of a prefix and a [...] "whine" [...] component, and in some populations, a third [...] "squawk" [...] component. Foam nests are deposited {{on the surface of}} ponds.|$|E
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are lowland rainforests at elevations of 150 - 750 m asl. Adults range widely {{over the floor}} and herb stratum in areas of steep terrain, but breeding requires small, clear, rocky-bottomed streams. Males <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> sitting in low vegetation close to streams. The tadpoles live in torrents; they cling to rocks and feed on lithophytes.|$|E
50|$|Choerophryne exclamitans live in lowland hill forests at {{elevations}} of 750 - 1100 m {{above sea}} level. They {{have been observed}} on the upper leafsurfaces of shrubs or vines some 1 to 3 meters above the ground. Males <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> No significant threats to this species are known. It is moderately common but not known from any protected area.|$|E
50|$|Tornier's forest toad eats small {{invertebrates}} such as ants. Breeding {{takes place}} in the rainy season. Males advertise themselves to attract females by <b>calling</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> from low vegetation. While doing this they adopt a characteristic pose with all four limbs extended. Unlike most frogs, this species is viviparous. Internal fertilisation takes place and the eggs develop directly into juvenile frogs in the oviduct of the female. Up to thirty five offspring have been found developing in one female.|$|R
50|$|She is {{a middle}} class woman, who sells various goods {{during the day and}} works <b>at</b> a <b>call</b> centre <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> She acts as Jaiveer's sister, for which he pays her money.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{version is}} a ballad. The Cu bird has no feathers, so the barn owl and the hoot owl (tecolote) {{organize}} all the birds to donate a feather each to it; the hoot owl guarantees that the Cu bird {{will not be}} a [...] "traitor". However, once the Cu bird is dressed, it flies to better lands, and the other birds blame the hoot owl. This is why the latter <b>calls</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> to the Cu bird, Ticú-ticú, and why it cannot see during the day.|$|R
50|$|Males <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> {{while in}} {{vegetation}} about 1-2 metres above the ground, along streams, {{and also by}} ditches. When the weather is dry, a calling green bright-eyed frog has also been found up as high as 5 m. The calls are a combination of two inharmonious note types that include a long note repeated in short pulses and a shorter note consisting of three repeated notes.|$|E
50|$|Leptolalax kecil is a small-sized toad, {{similar in}} size to L. pluvialis. Males {{recorded}} were 19 - 21 mm in snout-vent length and one female was 25 mm. Male Leptolalax kecil <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> on the ground near streams. The call differs from those known in other species of Leptolalax: male emits only one short, clearly pulsed call at a time, in contrast to long, successive notes of other species.|$|E
5000|$|Noisy pittas call most {{frequently}} {{in the morning with}} a secondary peak in calling around midday. Calling declines in the afternoon before spiking again at dusk. They also <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> Seasonally, they call {{most frequently}} in the breeding season, with almost no calling between March and August. The call is usually repeated twice and consists of a sequence of three ascending notes, sometimes rendered as [...] "walk-to-work".|$|E

50|$|Leptolalax melanoleucus is a frog {{species in}} the family Megophryidae. It is endemic to Thailand, {{although}} it has a relatively wide distribution near the Burmese border from the Khlong Saeng Wildlife Sanctuary (the type locality) in the central peninsular Thailand northwards to the vicinity of Pilok in Thong Pha Phum District, southwestern mainland Thailand; {{it is expected to}} be found in Burma. The type collection consists of three males measuring 27 - 29 mm in snout-vent length and a single female at 33 mm SVL. Males can be found <b>calling</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> near small streams.|$|R
5000|$|When {{they are}} a couple days old, the chicks can make a buzzing sound that resembles an insect {{and a few days}} later, they can make a low barking call when disturbed. The call of this species is 2-5 sets of [...] "coo" [...] notes that are high-pitched, rapid and repetitive. There is a slight pause between each set. The {{phonetics}} are often written [...] "coo-coo-coo-coo, coo-coo-coo-coo, coo-coo-coo-coo, ...". Adults usually call during the day when breeding however they begin <b>calling</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> in the middle of summer.|$|R
50|$|The diet of this frog {{consists}} of ants, termites {{and many other}} tiny insects.It breeds in ponds, permanent pools or marshy areas and the males <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> several neighboring frogs making a chorus and producing a song that sounds like the sounds made by crickets. The call has a frequency of between 3 and 3.2 kHz, with a pulse rate of 14-20 pulses per second, and a duration of less than a second. Females lay small clutches of about 20 eggs.|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} unknown to science until the 1982, {{when it was}} {{discovered}} by State of Florida herpetologist Paul Moler while conducting surveys for the Pine Barrens Treefrog (Hyla andersonii). Relatively {{little is known about}} their reproduction and development. Males <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> during the summer nonths, often in areas where bronze frogs (Lithobates clamitans clamitans) also breed. Females lay several hundred eggs at a time on the surface of shallow, non-stagnant, acidic (pH 4.1-5.5) water during the spring and summer. Tadpoles metamorphose by the next spring.|$|E
50|$|The village boasts {{an array}} of flora and fauna. Most notable {{is a pair of}} red kites that lives near the village. Buzzards are seen {{everyday}} and nest by the river on tall trees. Tawny owls <b>call</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> and sparrowhawks roam through woodland. Wood pigeons, rock doves, herons and jackdaws are common. The latter are particularly adept at nesting in the chimneys of old cottages. Siskin are autumn visitors. Bullfinch and brambling can be seen. Grey wagtail can be seen fishing by the river.|$|E
50|$|This is a noisy {{bird with}} a wide {{repertoire}} of crackling, explosive, or trumpeting <b>calls,</b> often given <b>at</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{surveys of}} anurans in the Chapada Diamantina, a {{semiarid}} region in central Bahia, Brazil, we obtained new records of Strabomantis aramunha Cassimiro, Verdade and Rodrigues. The new records extend the geographic distribution of S. aramunha in about 200 km north and 75 km south {{in relation to}} the type locality (municipality of Mucugê, state of Bahia, Brazil). We observed males <b>calling</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> the Morro do Pai Inácio, municipality of Palmeiras. This new data is important, as in the original description the authors suggested the possibility of absence of advertisement call in the species. We also provide additions on color and morphometric data...|$|R
50|$|Lorie cannot accept it's {{over and}} {{believes}} it's just a lovers' spat {{that will ultimately}} result in marriage. She <b>calls</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> begging for another chance, but is refused. Though he denies any intention to see her, Ed checks up on Lorie and punches out {{a man who was}} harassing her. Feeling trapped, Ed entertains and eventually sleeps with Lorie again. He resolves to break it off the next day, but she calls throughout the night, phoning everyone she knows when he doesn't answer. Andie, Ed's daughter, convinces him to be harsh, and he informs Lorie that she needs to leave him alone or he'll change his number.|$|R
