40|$|This booklet {{documents}} garments {{made from}} found and discarded materials {{under the auspices}} of ketchupclothes from 2004 to the present day. It is estimated that some 350, 000 tonnes of clothes are assigned to landfill every year from the UK alone. This <b>catalogue</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> hopes to provide inspiration into what can be done with textile and clothing waste. It begins with approaches to different materials such as denim, leather and old t-shirts and progresses through a series of photoshoots that contextualise the clothes within a local, urban environment. It concludes with current developments by the author into pattern cutting and manufacturing process that have resonance for the wider adoption of recycling practices. All garments have been designed and manufactured by the author on industrial sewing machines. These include a lockstitch, overlocker and coverstitch machin...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a {{synthesis}} of examples of, recommendations to and solution proposals for future efforts to improve well-functioning borderless labour markets. The report synthesises {{the results of the}} cooperation on exchange of experiences and solution proposals, which the parties behind the GOLIN project (Cross-border Regional Optimal Solutions in Scandinavia) have executed in 2003 - 2005, supported financially by the Nordic Council of Ministers via the Regional Sector, the Labour Market Sector and the Strategic Pool. The main activities include three seminars and a final conference. GOLIN shall be regarded as both a <b>catalogue</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> and a process. During the final debate on the final seminar of the project in March 2005, attention was paid to the learning gained from the GOLIN project: {{that it is necessary to}} start from practice and not always merely from rules and regulations that the nature of bureaucracy is slow and reactive and therefore must be challenged actively, creatively and specifically that we must enhance our ability to make the problems political by means of strategic lobby wor...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{to construct a}} visual identity for the second hand shop Munufea, focusing on redesigning the logo, the facade {{as well as the}} interior of the shop. In this effort we have used the theory of science critical realism and semiotics {{in order to get a}} greater understanding of the elements we cannot observe. In this paper we have defined the shop’s problems and needs by conducting an interview with the manager, which include being anonymous, not attracting the desired target audience and not having a coherent visual identity. To get inspiration and further knowledge on second hand shops we have worked with design methods for developing a visual identity, ethnographic research of second hand shops in Copenhagen, and theory of shapes. This was supplemented by a study of theories and research on today’s consumer and an examination of the guidelines that Red Cross second hand shops have to follow. All this resulted in a <b>catalogue</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> for redesigning the visual identity of Munufea. The paper concludes that Munufea must focus on expressing their values through their visual identity, try to become more unique but still show they are a part of the Red Cross, and enhance the social elements of the shop...|$|E

The reference framework for the Security handbook is set out in the Council (Justice and Home Affairs) conclusions of 13. 7. 2001 on security at meetings of the European Council and other comparable events (10916 / 01 JAI 82) and the Joint Action 97 / 339 /JHA of 26. 5. 1997 regarding cooperation on public law and order and security (OJ L 147, 5. 6. 1997, p. 1). 2. With reference to the above and on the basis of input from the Member States as well as the work of an expert group, the Police Co-operation Working Party has drafted a security handbook, the role of which is to serve as guidelines and <b>catalogue</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> for the Member States when undertaking the task of providing security at international events such as meetings of the European Council. 12637 / 3 / 02 REV 3 WF/dp 1 DG H II EN 3.

40|$|This <b>catalogue</b> <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} in a joint effort by six organisations (Caritas Kampala, Uganda Rural Development (URDT), Sulma Foods, Africa 2000 Network (A 2 N), National Organic and Organic Denmark) in the project ECOSAF in Uganda. The approach has been quite a lot like action research, and Development in practice. The focus of this project (2013 - 2015) was Farmer Family Learning Groups (FFLG) as a method for developing long-term food security through social capital building. Furthermore, another project based on the FFLG approach but focusing on the formation of Marketing Associations (MAs) contributed to this booklet. This project was carried through in a joined effort between Sustainable Agricultural Trainers Network (SATNET), NOGAMU and OD. SATNET is an umbrella organization with 40 member organisations, and in the project, a number of MAs linked up to the organizations. This catalogue {{is a result of}} inputs from more than 40 external facilitators of FFLGs, four FFLG officers from the four organisations in ECOSAF, 21 Marketing Association officers, and staff members and volunteers from NOGAMU, SATNET and Organic Denmark. In the process we have worked together from each our context, and exchanged ideas on farmer group development, participation and monitoring. Our conceptual framework for and main ideas of participatory monitoring of change is presented in the beginning of this catalogue. The tool is in fact a number of tools and ideas, which all address one or more aspect of change, and give suggestions how they can be monitored in a group. We suggest concrete indicators and methods of monitoring them in a participatory way. They can be adjusted to other contexts. All FFLGs and MAs set goals and carry out activities to reach them. Many other groups of people and organisations set goals. It is relevant for all of them to monitor, and the meaningful focus and choice of methods must necessarily be defined and selected by the people who should use them. This catalogue offers a range of ideas which hopefully can inspire other groups. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{exhibition}} and <b>catalogue</b> continue <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> relating contemporary painting practice {{to that of}} photography, film and video first explored in “Sight Mapping” (output 4). The Kingston Turnpike consists of a pool of artists, internationally renowned in their field, who express a particular sensibility related to the fluid possibilities in current practice. The exhibition uses the film “Being John Malkovich” as a skewed theme, allowing unpredictable combinations of artists while functioning as {{a critique of the}} narrow, over-defined programming of much current curatorial practice. Sensuality, seduction, skill at handling material and the artist’s will to make something eccentric (perhaps traditional qualities of painting) are emphasised over concept and laborious contextualisation. Strba’s video projections, for example, thus become luminous painterly experiences, Akkerman’s serial self-portraits, by contrast, pieces of conceptual mischief...|$|R
