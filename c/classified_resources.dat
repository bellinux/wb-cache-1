50|$|Kazakhstan is world’s second ranked {{chromite}} producer, after South Africa. Production {{was centered}} in the Aqtobe region of northwestern Kazakhstan at the Khromtau complex. Chromite production was significantly expanding {{with the aid of}} Western investment. London-based Oriel Resources Plc acquired 100% of the Voskhod chromite project in February 2005 and, based on the positive results of a feasibility study, planned to fast-track development of the Voskhod project. Discovered in 1963, the Voskhod chromite deposit lies within the Khromtau District of the Aqtobe Region. Although surrounded by a group of existing mines, it had never been worked. The ore grade reportedly averages 48% Cr2O3 with concentrate upgraded to 57% Cr2O3. Production from Voskhod was expected to be 900,000 t/yr; production would begin in 2008 and continue for 14 years. The Voskhod Mine was projected {{to be one of the}} world’s leading suppliers of high-grade chromite. Oriel subsequently was awarded an extension to the Voskhod contract license area to include the Karaagash deposit which has, according to the former Soviet reserve classification system, C2 and P1 <b>classified</b> <b>resources</b> of some 7.8 Mt. Assuming positive results of a confirmatory drilling program, theses resources could extend mining beyond Voskhod’s projected 20-year life.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Social tagging is an {{innovative}} and powerful mechanism introduced with Web 2. 0 : it shifts {{the task of}} <b>classifying</b> <b>resources</b> from a reduced set of knowledge engineers to the wide set of Web users. Users of social tagging systems define personal classifications {{which can be used}} by other peers for browsing available resources. However, due to the absence of rules for managing the tagging process, and to the lack of predefined schemas or structures for inserting metadata and relationships among tags, current user generated classifications dop not produce sound taxonomies. This is a strong limitation which prevents an effective and informed resource sharing. For this reason researchers are modeling innovative recommender systems capable to better support tagging, browsing, and searching for new resources. This paper is a survey which discusses the role of tags in recommender systems: starting from social tagging systems, we analyze various techniques for suggesting content and we introduce the approaches exploited for proposing tags for <b>classifying</b> <b>resources,</b> considering both personalized and notpersonalized recommendation...|$|R

Significant amounts of zinc, copper and cobalt can also be produced. In summer 2005, a 50 000 ton demonstration plant was constructed to the mine site. A representative ore sample was mined, crushed to 80 %- 8 mm, agglomerated and built to a two-part heap (8 m high, 50 m times 80 m). Irrigation of the heap was started in August 2005. The pilot heap was inoculated with indigenous bacteria collected from the site. The amount of bacteria in the pregnant leaching solution has been in the range of 106 – 108 cells/ml. The bacteria involved are mesophilic and thermophilic ones. The start-up of the solution flow resulted soon in elevated temperatures of over 50 0 C in the pregnant leaching solution. The rise is due to the oxidation of the large quantity of pyrrhotite and pyrite in the ore. The elevated temperatures have also been maintained over the boreal winter conditions.

Service providers and registries currently use different vocabularies to <b>classify</b> <b>resources.</b> From the user point of view, a common topics vocabulary would enhance the ability to find related resources of interest. From the provider point of view, a common vocabulary would be an important step to facilitate the interoperability of existing resources and significantly increase the impact and reach to different user communities. Workshop participants, who also discussed use cases and how agreement on high-level terms would positively impact the different communities, included representatives of societies, networks, institutes, organisations, research infrastructures and projects, as well as BioMedBridges project partners and members of several ELIXIR Nodes.
