5|$|After Iso died in 1881, Kanō began {{training}} in Kitō-ryū with Iikubo Tsunetoshi (Kōnen). Iikubo was expert in kata and throwing, and fond of randori. Kanō applied himself thoroughly to learning Kitō-ryū, believing Iikubo's throwing techniques {{in particular to}} be better than in the schools he had previously studied. It is Iikubo who issued Kanō's only verified jūjutsu rank and teaching <b>credential,</b> namely a certificate of Menkyo (not Menkyo kaiden) in Nihonden Kitō Jūdō, dated October 1883.|$|E
40|$|<b>Credentials</b> are an {{indispensable}} means for service access control in electronic commerce. However, regular <b>credentials</b> such as X. 509 certificates and SPKI/SDSI certificates {{do not address}} user privacy at all, while anonymous <b>credentials</b> that protect user privacy are complex and have compatibility problems with existing PKIs. In this paper we propose privacy-preserving <b>credentials,</b> a concept between regular <b>credentials</b> and anonymous <b>credentials.</b> The privacy-preserving <b>credentials</b> enjoy the advantageous features of both regular <b>credentials</b> and anonymous <b>credentials,</b> and {{strike a balance between}} user anonymity and system complexity. We achieve this by employing computer servers equipped with TPMs (Trusted Platform Modules). We present a detailed construction for ElGamal encryption <b>credentials.</b> We also present XML-based specification for the privacy-preserving <b>credentials...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Credentials</b> {{are useful}} in many applications. For example, {{automated}} trust negotiation can be attained through the exchange of <b>credentials.</b> However, <b>credentials</b> endure all kinds of attacks during the transport while <b>credentials</b> bring {{us a lot of}} benefits. At the same time, how to store <b>credentials</b> is still a key problem to manage trust management systems. Good credential-storage design can greatly reduce much overhead, such as easy to search <b>credentials,</b> less storage space, high application convenience and so on. In this paper, we propose a new approach to hide <b>credentials,</b> which satisfies all requirements of common <b>credentials</b> and provides a higher security as well without affecting the <b>credentials</b> transferring efficiency. It aims at attaining little storage space and high security...|$|R

5|$|One way {{to advance}} {{emergency}} medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it. Without such recognition, {{it is difficult to}} set up training programs or recruit potential students, as they face the uncertainly of training to obtain a <b>credential</b> that may end up being useless to them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E
5|$|Other {{actions taken}} at the 1st General Council {{addressed}} women in ministry. The Pentecostals who founded the Assemblies of God had no objections to women being engaged in ministry. The Pentecostal belief in personal experience, Spirit baptism as empowerment for service, {{and the need for}} evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry. What concerned some Pentecostal leaders, such as Bell, were women exercising independent authority over men. The council therefore approved of the granting of credentials to female evangelists and missionaries while restricting the office of pastor to men, and it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings. By the fall of 1914, out of 512 <b>credential</b> holders, 142 were female missionaries and evangelists.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{resumed his}} {{first-class}} cricket career steadily against Queensland and South Australia. Lindwall gave his first indications of cricketing potential on a 38 degree {{day in the}} second innings of a match against Victoria. A day after suffering a mild malaria attack, Lindwall gave a spell of four overs which netted him three wickets, bowling at speeds not seen in Australia since Larwood. An innings of 134 not out in just 180 minutes against Queensland at the SCG underlined by cutting and driving exhibited his batting skill, and with a haul of 9/77 against South Australia further underlining his allround <b>credential.</b> Lindwall gained further attention when he turned out for New South Wales against the feted Australian Services team of Lindsay Hassett that had played in the 1945 Victory Tests in England. Lindwall's hostile bowling delivered three wickets in each innings, finishing with match figures of 6/95, leading Hassett to rate him as the best fast-bowling prospect in a decade. With 33 wickets for the season, Lindwall as selected for an Australian team tour of New Zealand under Bill Brown. He played in a Test against New Zealand, which was not awarded Test status until 1948. In a match in which Australia fielded seven Test debutants, Lindwall opened the bowling with state teammate Ernie Toshack. Lindwall had limited opportunities on a sticky wicket which favoured the slower bowling of O’Reilly and Toshack, who took eight and seven wickets respectively. He took 1/13 and 1/16 as Australia won by an innings and 103 runs. Lindwall made a duck in Australia's only innings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Privacy-preserving digital <b>credentials</b> are {{cryptographic}} {{tools that}} allow a user {{to prove a}} predicate about his/her identity or qualifications, without the verifying party learning additional information beyond the status of that predicate. The Identity Mixer (Idemix) [CL 01] is a framework providing such <b>credentials.</b> In Idemix, we can distinguish two types of credentials: (1) one-time show <b>credentials</b> which can be shown only once before unveiling the identity of their holder, and (2) multishow <b>credentials</b> which can be shown infinitely many times without the showings being linked to each other, or to the identity of their holder. In this paper, we {{bridge the gap between}} the two previous types of <b>credentials,</b> and extend Idemix to k-show <b>credentials</b> (for k> 1.) The k-show <b>credentials</b> we propose can be shown anonymously, but linkably, up to k times.

30|$|Ideally, a MANET must store <b>credentials</b> redundantly. Since {{the entire}} system is distributed, we cannot store all the <b>credentials</b> at a {{centralized}} server.

25|$|While medical {{transcription}} {{does not}} mandate registration or certification, individual MTs may seek out registration/certification for personal or professional reasons. Obtaining a certificate {{from a medical}} transcription training program does not entitle an MT to use the title of Certified Medical Transcriptionist. A Certified Healthcare Documentation Specialist (CHDS) <b>credential</b> can be earned by passing a certification examination conducted solely by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity (AHDI), formerly the American Association for Medical Transcription (AAMT), as the credentialing designation they created. AHDI also offers the <b>credential</b> of Registered Healthcare Documentation Specialist (RHDS). According to AHDI, RHDS is an entry-level <b>credential</b> while the CHDS is an advanced level. AHDI maintains a list of approved medical transcription schools. Generally, certified medical transcriptionists earn more than their non-certified counterparts. It is also notable that training through an educational program that is approved by AHDI will increase the chances of an MT getting certified and getting hired.|$|E
