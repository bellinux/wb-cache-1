To the surprise and admiration of their fellows, two officers, like insane artists trying to gild refined gold or paint the lily, pursued their private contest through the years of universal carnage.

5000|$|Fog {{is formed}} {{when the air}} cools enough that the vapour {{pressure}} encourages condensation over evaporation. In order for the air to be <b>cool</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> summer night, the sky must be clear, so excess heat can be radiated into space. Cloudy skies act like a blanket, absorbing and reradiating the heat, keeping it in. So if it is cool enough (and clear enough) for fog to form, {{it will probably be}} clear the next day. Winter fog is the result of two entirely different circumstances. Above the ocean or a large lake, air is typically more humid than above land. When the humid air moves over cold land, it will form fog and precipitation. (To the east of the North American Great Lakes, this is a common phenomenon, and is known as the [...] "lake effect.") In northerly climates, ice fog may form when the temperature drops substantially below freezing. It is almost exclusively an urban phenomenon, when the air is so cold that any vapor pressure results in condensation, and additional vapour emitted by automobiles, household furnaces, and industrial plants simply accumulates as fog.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper (Ushov, PRL, 80, 230, 1998), {{it has been}} claimed that the bare surface of a strange star can emit electron-positron pairs of {{luminosity}} ~ 10 ^{ 51 } ergs/s for about 10 s. If true, obviously, this mechanism may explain the origin of cosmic Gamma Ray Bursts. However, we point out that such a mechanism is unlikely to work because (i) if pair production really occurs the supposed pre-existing supercritical electric field will be quenched and this discharge process may at best release ~ 10 ^{ 24 } ergs of electromagnetic energy, and (ii) {{there is no way}} by which the trapped core thermal energy of few 10 ^{ 52 } ergs can be transmitted electromagnetically on a time scale of ~ 10 s or even on a much larger time scale.

40|$|The {{interstellar}} medium in star-forming galaxies is a multiphase gas in which turbulent support {{is at least}} as important as thermal pressure. Sustaining this configuration requires continuous radiative cooling, such that the overall average cooling rate matches the decay rate of turbulent energy into the medium. Here we carry out a set of numerical simulations of a stratified, turbulently stirred, radiatively cooled medium, which uncover a fundamental transition at a critical one-dimensional turbulent velocity of ~ 35 km/s. At turbulent velocities below ~ 35 km/s, corresponding to temperatures below 300, 000 K, the medium is stable, as the time for gas to cool is roughly constant as a function of temperature. On the other hand, at turbulent velocities above the critical value, the gas is shocked into an unstable regime in which the cooling time increases strongly with temperature, meaning that a substantial fraction of the {{interstellar medium}} is unable to <b>cool</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> turbulent dissipation timescale. This naturally leads to runaway heating and ejection of gas from any stratified medium with a one-dimensional turbulent velocity above ~ 35 km/s, a result that has implications for galaxy evolution at all redshifts.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{considered}} synchrotron as the emission mechanism for prompt Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). These works {{have shown that}} the electrons must <b>cool</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> timescale comparable to the dynamic time at the source in order to satisfy spectral constraints while maintaining high radiative efficiency. We focus on conditions where synchrotron cooling is balanced by a continuous source of heating, and in which these constraints are naturally satisfied. Assuming {{that a majority of the}} electrons in the emitting region are contributing to the observed peak, we find that the energy per electron has to be E≳ 20 GeV and that the Lorentz factor of the emitting material has to be very large 10 ^ 3 ≲Γ_ em≲ 10 ^ 4, well in excess of the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet inferred from GRB afterglows. A number of independent constraints then indicate that the emitters must be moving relativistically, with Γ'≈ 10, relative to the bulk frame of the jet and that the jet must be highly magnetized upstream of the emission region, σ_ up≳ 30. The emission radius is also strongly constrained in this model to R≳ 10 ^ 16 cm. These values are consistent with magnetic jet models where the dissipation is driven by magnetic reconnection that takes place far away from the base of the jet. Comment: 11 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|Self-gravitating protostellar discs are {{unstable}} to fragmentation if the gas can <b>cool</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{time scale}} that is short {{compared to the}} orbital period. We {{use a combination of}} hydrodynamic simulations and N-body orbit integrations to study the long term evolution of a fragmenting disc with an initial mass ratio to the star of M_disc/M_star = 0. 1. For a disc which is initially unstable across a range of radii, a combination of collapse and subsequent accretion yields substellar objects with a spectrum of masses extending (for a Solar mass star) up to ~ 0. 01 M_sun. Subsequent gravitational evolution ejects most of the lower mass objects within a few million years, leaving a small number of very massive planets or brown dwarfs in eccentric orbits at moderately small radii. Based on these results, systems such as HD 168443 [...] in which the companions are close to or beyond the deuterium burning limit [...] appear to be the best candidates to have formed via gravitational instability. If massive substellar companions originate from disc fragmentation, while lower-mass planetary companions originate from core accretion, the metallicity distribution of stars which host massive substellar companions at radii of ~ 1 au should differ from that of stars with lower mass planetary companions.

40|$|Nearly all {{globular}} clusters (GCs) studied to date show evidence for multiple stellar populations, {{in stark contrast}} to the conventional view that GCs are a mono-metallic, coeval population of stars. Building on earlier work, we propose a simple physical model for the early evolution (several 10 ^ 8 yr) of GCs. We consider the effects of stellar mass-loss, type II and prompt type Ia supernovae, ram pressure, and accretion from the ambient ISM on the development of a young GC's own gas reservoir. In our model, type II SNe from a first generation of star formation clears the GC of its initial gas reservoir. Over the next several 10 ^ 8 yr, mass lost from AGB stars and matter accreted from the ambient ISM collect at the center of the GC. This material must remain quite cool (T~ 10 ^ 2 K), but does not catastrophically <b>cool</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> crossing time because of the high Lyman-Werner flux density in young GCs. The collection of gas within the GC must compete with ram pressure from the ambient ISM. After several 10 ^ 8 yr, the Lyman-Werner photon flux density drops by more than three orders of magnitude, allowing molecular hydrogen and then stars to form. After this second generation of star formation, type II SNe from the second generation and then prompt type Ia SNe associated with the first generation maintain a gas-free GC, thereby ending the cycle of star formation events. Our model makes clear predictions for the presence or absence of multiple stellar populations within GCs as a function of GC mass and formation environment. Analyzing intermediate-age LMC clusters, we find evidence for a mass threshold of ~ 10 ^ 4 Msun below which LMC clusters appear to be truly coeval. This threshold mass is consistent with our predictions for the mass at which ram pressure is capable of clearing gas from clusters in the LMC at the present epoch.
