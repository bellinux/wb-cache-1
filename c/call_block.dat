This study proposes a mechanism that considers the real-time traffic information (e. g., traffic flow and vehicle speed) and the user behavior (e. g., call inter-arrival time and call holding time) to analyze the adaptable number of communication calls in the specific cell for channel allocation. In experiments about <b>call</b> <b>block</b> probabilities (CBP), this study simulated two cases that are the situations of the whole day and traffic accident. The simulation results show that all CBPs in the scenario of whole day are less than 21. 5 % by using the proposed mechanism, which is better than using the static channel allocation (SCA) mechanism.

40|$|A neural-network-based traffic {{management}} scheme for a satellite communication network is described. The scheme {{consists of two}} levels of management. The {{front end of the}} scheme is a derivation of Kohonen's self-organization model to configure maps for the satellite communication network dynamically. The model consists of three stages. The first stage is the pattern recognition task, in which an exemplar map that best meets the current network requirements is selected. The second stage is the analysis of the discrepancy between the chosen exemplar map and the state of the network, and the adaptive modification of the chosen exemplar map to conform closely to the network requirement (input data pattern) by means of Kohonen's self-organization. On the basis of certain performance criteria, whether a new map is generated to replace the original chosen map is decided in the third stage. A state-dependent routing algorithm, which arranges the incoming call to some proper path, is used to make the network more efficient and to lower the <b>call</b> <b>block</b> rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the scheme, which combines self-organization and the state-dependent routing mechanism, provides better performance in terms of <b>call</b> <b>block</b> rate than schemes that only have either the self-organization mechanism or the routing mechanism...|$|E

40|$|WLANs provide {{high speed}} {{services}} but the radio coverage is small and does not support good mobility performance as compared to cellular systems. In this thesis, an integrated network of GPRS and wireless LAN is presented and a handoff algorithm is proposed for the integrated network. Handoff {{is an important issue}} when considering mobility in an integrated wireless communication network. The objective of the algorithm is to achieve seamless network service coverage and maximum data transfer speed. Traditional cellular GPRS/EGPRS networks can provide good mobility performance but relatively low speed data service. In the proposed handoff algorithm, the mobile station can camp on the best serving access point based on its geographic position and moving speed. Accessing a WLAN network, if possible, has a higher priority than accessing GPRS/EGPRS cellular network. To achieve a comprehensive performance investigation, a simulation is implemented based on a large traffic load. Simulation results show the performance characteristics and functionalities of the algorithm that includes total throughput, call successful rate, <b>call</b> <b>block</b> rate, packet error rate, handoff rate and resource utilization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed handoff algorithm achieves higher throughput and call successful rate than the traditional cellular network.

From the results, we observed that as the end user satisfaction rate decreases as each of the service quality-based network performance indicators decreases and verse versa.

Hence, proper care should be taken while formulating any long term policy for end user satisfaction...|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{control and}} {{resource}} management are complex issues in wireless {{asynchronous transfer mode}} (WATM) due to broad range quality-of-services (QoS), limited bandwidth spectrum and susceptibility to error. In WATM, traffic control is essential {{in order to protect}} the network from congestion and to achieve realistic network efficiency in compliance with the QoS. Micro and pico cell sites are usually used in the WATM environment. Exchanging access point to the backbone network is thus common and this may contribute to connection rejections when channels are busy. The effect to QoS at call level is the high probability of handoff dropping if the targeted call site has no available channels. The objective of this project is to design a WATM system using virtual connection tree (VCT) architecture model that can give high QoS performance in terms of probability of call lost and handoff call drop and can provide connections of a bandwidth rate that will not jeopardize QoS requirements in terms of a bandwidth given to a connection which is not less than the set threshold bandwidth. All of these will be done in mathematical analysis. The design was initially started with a scheme called With Reserved Channel (WRC), which has reserved channels for handoff calls. A low probability of handoff dropping was obtained but a set back was found which involves the probability of new <b>call</b> <b>block.</b> Hence, an improvement had been made and it is called With Queuing and Reserved Channels (WQRC), which allows queuing of new incoming calls and reserved channels for handoff calls.

40|$|Abstract â€” Wireless {{local area}} {{networks}} (WLANs) are {{emerging as a}} popular technology {{for access to the}} Internet and enterprise networks. In the long term, the success of WLANs depends on services that support mobile network clients. Although other researchers have explored mobility prediction in hypothetical scenarios, evaluating their predictors analytically or with synthetic data, few studies have been able to evaluate their predictors with real user mobility data. As a first step towards filling this fundamental gap, we work with a large data set collected from the Dartmouth College campus-wide wireless network that hosts more than 500 access points and 6, 000 users. Extending our earlier work that focuses on predicting the next-visited access point (i. e., location), in this work we explore the predictability of the time of user mobility. Indeed, our contributions are two-fold. First, we evaluate a series of predictors that reflect possible dependencies across time and space while benefiting from either individual or group mobility behaviors. Second, as a case study we examine voice applications and the use of handoff prediction for advance bandwidth reservation. Using application-specific performance metrics such as call drop and <b>call</b> <b>block</b> rates, we provide a picture of the potential gains of prediction. Our results indicate {{that it is difficult to}} predict handoff time accurately, when applied to real campus WLAN data. However, the findings of our case study also suggest that application performance can be improved significantly even with predictors that are only moderately accurate. The gains depend on the applications â€™ ability to use predictions and tolerate inaccurate predictions. In the case study, we combine the real mobility data with synthesized traffic data. The results show that intelligent prediction can lead to significant reductions in the rate at which active calls are dropped due to handoffs with marginal increments in the rate at which new calls are blocked.

However, this issue can be mitigated {{by the use of}} streaming software. Software steaming is a means by which software can begin execution even while transmission of the full software program may still be in progress. Therefore, the application load time (i. e., the amount of time from when an application is selected for download to when the application can be executed) observed by the user can be significantly reduced. Moreover, unneeded software components might not be downloaded to the device, lowering memory and bandwidth usages. As a result, resource utilization such as memory and bandwidth usage may also be more efficient. Using our streaming method, an embedded device can support a wide range of applications which can be run on demand. Software streaming also enables small memory footprint devices to run applications larger than the physical memory by using our memory management technique. In this dissertation, we present a streaming method we <b>call</b> <b>block</b> streaming to transmit stream-enabled applications, including stream-enabled file I/O. We implemented a tool to partition software into blocks which can be transmitted (streamed) to the embedded device.
