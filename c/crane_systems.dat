40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} the design system for high efficiency gantry <b>crane</b> <b>system</b> using elevator and conveyor system. The basic concept {{for the proposed}} gantry <b>crane</b> <b>system</b> {{can be used with}} modification of the classical gantry crane instead of changing lots of them. However, the proposed <b>crane</b> <b>system</b> can reduce the cycle time more than the classical gantry crane. The high efficiency gantry crane can also improve the productivity of the container transportation job because of reducing cycle time. In order to achieve the effectiveness of the proposed design system, the loading and unloading capabilities are compared with the classical crane, and then these results show that the proposed <b>crane</b> <b>system</b> has better performances than the classical type.

A dynamic model of the overhead crane was developed, where the <b>crane</b> <b>system</b> is assumed as a lumped mass model. Under the mutual effects of the sway motions of the payload and the hoisting motion, the nonlinear behavior of the <b>crane</b> <b>system</b> is considered. A nonlinear control model-based scheme was designed to achieve the three objectives: (i) drive the <b>crane</b> <b>system</b> to the desired positions, (ii) suppresses the vibrations of the payload, and (iii) velocity tracking of hoisting motion. The nonlinear control scheme employs adaptation laws that estimate unknown system parameters, friction forces and {{the mass of the}} payload.

50|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1980s various railroads experimented with the RoadRailer concept to {{determine}} if the equipment would be durable enough to endure railroad use. The positive attributes of the RoadRailer were its exceptionally smooth ride, light weight and low capital costs to set up a rail yard. Since no flatcars were involved, no <b>crane</b> <b>systems</b> were needed to transfer the trailers between modes. In fact during one demonstration test a train of RoadRailers was broken {{down in the middle of}} an industrial street in Portland Oregon which happened to have track in the street, demonstrating the flexibility of the system. Another note was that a RoadRailer train did not have a caboose car which at the time was still required for freight trains. A box was designed with a yellow strobe light, and equipment for monitoring air pressure through the brake line was designed to be installed in the unused coupler of the last car. Later, as cabooses were phased out, railroads moved to their current use of a similar strobe to mark the end of the train (the so-called flashing rear-end device or FRED).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Gantry <b>crane</b> <b>system</b> is a {{mechanism}} in heavy engineering that moves payload such container from {{one point to}} another. Generally, experienced operators or experts are required to control manually the gantry position while minimizing the payload vibration or swing oscillation. Therefore, those manpower has to be trained in order to operate the gantry <b>crane</b> <b>system</b> safely and efficiently. Thus, to overcome this problem, a feedback control scheme has been utilized in the system. In this paper, PID and PD controllers are introduced for controlling the trolley displacement and the swing oscillation in the gantry <b>crane</b> <b>system.</b> PID controller is designed for tracking the desired position of the trolley whereas PD controller is implemented to minimize the payload oscillation. The PID and PD parameters are tuned by the auto-tuning method. Simulation results have demonstrated satisfactory response based on control system performances...|$|R
