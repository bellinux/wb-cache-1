25|$|Warner {{began the}} 2002 {{season as the}} Rams' starter, but he played poorly, {{throwing}} seven interceptions against only one touchdown as the team went 0–3. In the Rams' fourth game, this one against the Dallas Cowboys, Warner broke a finger on his throwing hand. Warner attempted to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>later</b> in the season, but his injury allowed him to play only two more games (both losses). In contrast to his 103.0 career passer rating entering the season, Warner posted a minuscule 67.4 rating in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Guiteau {{continued}} to prepare carefully, {{writing a letter}} in advance to William Tecumseh Sherman, the Commanding General of the U.S. Army, asking for protection from the mob he assumed would gather after he killed the President, and writing other letters justifying his action as necessary to heal dissension between the factions of the Republican Party. He went to the District of Columbia jail {{to ask for a}} tour of the facility where he expected to be incarcerated, but was told to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>later.</b> Guiteau spent the whole month of June following Garfield around Washington. On one occasion, he trailed Garfield to the railway station as the President was seeing his wife off to a beach resort in Long Branch, New Jersey, but decided not to shoot him then, as Lucretia, Garfield's wife, was known to be in poor health and {{he did not want to}} upset her.|$|E
25|$|Hoyos did {{not look}} any closer, but rushed to the station and took a special train to Vienna. He hurried to the Emperor's Adjutant General, Count Paar, and {{requested}} him to break the appalling news to the Emperor. The stifling protocol that characterized every movement in the Hofburg swung ponderously into action; Paar remonstrated that only the Empress could break such catastrophic news to the Emperor. Baron Nopcsa, Controller of the Empress's Household, was sent for, and he in turn sent for Countess Ida Ferenczy, Empress Elisabeth's favorite Hungarian lady-in-waiting, to determine how Her Majesty should be informed. Elisabeth was at her Greek lesson, and was impatient at the interruption. White to the lips, Ferenczy announced that Baron Nopcsa had urgent news. Elisabeth replied that he must wait and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>later.</b> The countess insisted {{that he must be}} received immediately, finally being forced to add that there was grave news about the Crown Prince. This account comes from Ferenczy herself and Archduchess Marie Valerie, to whom Elisabeth dictated her memory of the incident, in addition to the description in her diary.|$|E

60|$|Once more he <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>later</b> on, {{leading a}} woman by the hand. She too was in tights throughout, and like him she {{walked with a}} calm and {{powerful}} movement, but she seemed petty beside him.|$|R

500|$|The {{cause for}} dissent {{lies in the}} {{analysis}} {{and understanding of the}} techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to their understanding of those techniques. A close examination of the frescoes of the lunettes convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in [...] "buon fresco"; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state. In other words, Michelangelo did not work [...] "a secco"; he did not <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>later</b> and add details onto the dry plaster.|$|E
500|$|Lukather's {{approach}} to engineering his {{sound in the}} studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing {{a large number of}} takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: [...] "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd just move on. A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration to save you. It's always better to just surrender, and then <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>later</b> to give it a go with fresh ears." [...] Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.|$|E
500|$|On {{leaving the}} Army, Miller {{traveled}} to Nashville {{to begin his}} musical career. He met with Chet Atkins, who asked to hear him sing, loaning him a guitar since Miller did not own one. Out of nervousness, Miller played the guitar and sang a song in two different keys. Atkins advised him to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>later,</b> when he had more experience. Miller found work as a bellhop at Nashville's Andrew Jackson Hotel, and he was soon known as the [...] "singing bellhop." [...] He was finally hired by Minnie Pearl to play the fiddle in her band. He then met George Jones, who introduced him to music executives from the Starday Records label who scheduled an audition. Impressed, the executives set up a recording session with Jones in Houston. Jones and Miller collaborated to write [...] "Tall, Tall Trees" [...] and [...] "Happy Child." ...|$|E
50|$|Overdrive <b>came</b> <b>back</b> on {{the channel}} Viva Plus. Overdrive ran on Viva Zwei from 1998 to 2002, it <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>later</b> in 2002 on Viva Plus, and it lasted there until 2007, when Viva Plus shut down. As For 2Step and E-Beats, they were slated to have <b>come</b> <b>back</b> on Viva Plus, {{but the idea}} was later canceled.|$|R
60|$|Unprejudiced persons {{admitted}} that Lawyer Gooch received as big fees from these reyoked clients as {{would have been}} paid him had the cases been contested in court. Prejudiced ones intimated that his fees were doubled, because the penitent couples always <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>later</b> for the divorce, anyhow.|$|R
50|$|During the {{recording}} of Beyond Recognition vocalist Steev Esquivel temporarily left the band {{due to lack of}} focus due to drug addiction. He <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>later</b> when the band was not satisfied with their replacement vocalist. All of the tracks on the album still had Esquivel on lead vocals.|$|R
2500|$|The {{problem lies}} in the {{analysis}} {{and understanding of the}} techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to that understanding.

2500|$|Abu Bakr {{became the}} Caliph on 8 June 632 {{and he died}} on 23 August 634. He is {{considered}} by sunnis as {{the greatest of all}} the companions of Muhammad. Jubayr ibn Mut'im reported that a woman came and spoke to Muhammad about a matter. He asked her to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>later</b> some time. She said, [...] "Tell me if I come later and do not find you?" [...] Jubayr ibn Mut'im said that it seemed that she meant he may not be alive when she came back. He said, [...] "If you do not find me then go to Abu Bakr." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{target was}} {{exceeded}} in Victoria when 21,698 men enlisted in that month, {{the largest number}} from any state during the war. The campaign in New South Wales by contrast was disappointing for state leaders — especially so in light of interstate rivalry between the two neighbors. [...] It was suggested by the Premier of New South Wales, William Holman, {{that one of the}} reasons New South Wales was not meeting the targets was because the military authorities were not ready to accept the men at the time they offered to enlist and told them to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
50|$|Later on, {{while working}} out, Jillian {{found out that}} her players were not keeping up to her standards, thus sending her into a rage. She even {{went as far as}} kicking Amy C. out of the gym. But she <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>later,</b> and Jillian complimented her for her choice.|$|R

50|$|The {{hearing was}} held in late March-early April and had 49 {{witnesses}} testify between the 2 sides. A decision wasn’t made until June 2, 1949 when it was ruled that the Mayflower Doctrine was to be repealed. The FCC <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>later</b> that year with the Fairness Doctrine {{to act as a}} replacement of the Mayflower Doctrine.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{sociologist}} William Foote Whyte {{spent several years}} living in the North End, studying the social dynamics of the local gangs and bookmakers. His original plan was to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>later</b> and study the people's family and religious life, but health problems interfered. In 1943 he published a groundbreaking case study titled [...] which became a bestseller and a classic college text for students of sociology and anthropology. Years after the book's publication, Whyte revealed the identities behind the pseudonyms he had used in his study. Among them were Joseph A. Langone, Jr. and his wife Clementina, who appear in the book as Mr. and Mrs. George Ravello.|$|E
2500|$|As late as 1989, the {{association}} had only 350 members, {{but since then}} it has grown to about 700. [...] There used to be stronger restrictions on what could be sold. No non-art items such as flowers and even art forms such as still lifes and miniatures were not permitted. However, since then, these restrictions have been relaxed or eliminated. Since the market was founded in the 1950s, Colonia San Rafael has deteriorated and problems such as homelessness, prostitution and crime have become problems even though a police monitoring station was built just outside the park to combat these problems. The park proper has had rehabilitation work with evictions of homeless in the late 1990s and 2005, but neighbors complain that the homeless simply <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
