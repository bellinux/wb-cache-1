500|$|Laura Fries of Variety {{commented on}} the {{difference}} between this series and Law & Order and : [...] "By scrutinizing motive and intent, <b>Criminal</b> <b>Intent</b> utilizes a more personal style that sets it apart from its brethren.

In Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker wrote that Law & Order: <b>Criminal</b> <b>Intent</b> was the best series of the year from the Law & Order franchise and that while Law & Order suffered from tired, wooden performances from actors with poor chemistry, the acting on Law & Order: <b>Criminal</b> <b>Intent</b> was at [...] "the other end of the spectrum." [...] Both writers {{commented on the}} overpowering screen presence that D'Onofrio commands in the first episode: [...] "Criminal Intent so far is a one-man show with Vincent D'Onofrio at its center. [...] commands the most attention, tending to overshadow Erbe, who is reduced in the pilot to following Goren with an awe-struck look," [...] wrote Fries, while Tucker also stated, [...] "D'Onofrio is so eccentrically entertaining, even his costar Kathryn Erbe seems fascinated", but complained that Erbe's role was smaller than D'Onofrio's, which [...] "jibes with the subtle range she showed on [...] Oz and proves her professional generosity." [...] He also said Sheridan [...] "is similarly nonplussed and under-utilized," [...] but [...] "Vance is terrific , who makes defendants wither in the face of his elegantly reasoned cross-examinations." ...|$|E
