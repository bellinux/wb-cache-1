50|$|Force Unit Access (FUA) is an I/O write <b>command</b> <b>option</b> {{that forces}} written data {{all the way}} to stable storage. FUA write {{commands}} (WRITE DMA FUA EXT 3Dh, WRITE DMA QUEUED FUA EXT 3Eh, WRITE MULTIPLE FUA EXT CEh), in contrast to corresponding commands without FUA, write data directly to the media, regardless of whether write caching in the device is enabled or not. FUA write command will not return until data is written to media, thus data written by a completed FUA write command is on permanent media even if the device is powered off before issuing a FLUSH CACHE command.|$|E
5000|$|MTS uses keyword {{oriented}} <b>commands</b> and <b>command</b> <b>options.</b> The <b>command</b> verb (SIGNON, RUN, EDIT, ...) is {{the first}} keyword on the command line. Commands may start with an optional dollar-sign ($SIGNON, $RUN, $EDIT, ...). In batch jobs, following invalid commands and some other errors, MTS looks for the next line that starts with a dollar-sign ($) in column 1 as the next command to execute. All commands and most <b>command</b> <b>options</b> allow initial sub-string abbreviations (C for COPY, R for RUN, DEB for DEBUG, ...). MTS commands and most <b>command</b> <b>options</b> are case-insensitive.|$|R

50|$|TL-10 is {{specifically}} designed to engage boats displacing 500 tons or less, and when launched, the missile will first climb to enable the seeker to acquire targets, and then immediately descend down to sea-skimming cruise altitude during its flight. Like the anti-ship version of the C-701, TL-10 is also armed with a television seeker that is interchangeable with TL-6. However, unlike the C-701 guidance has an additional <b>command</b> <b>option</b> which enables the operator to alter the targets, TL-10 is a purely fire-and-forget weapon. Western sources have claimed that the Iranian anti-ship missile Kowsar which is manufactured by the Iran Aviation Industries Organization is based on TL-10 while the Nasr {{is based on the}} TL-6.|$|E
