40|$|AbstractAn {{unsteady}} Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes {{method is}} developed {{to account for}} sinkage and trim effects in the calculation of steadily advancing surface ship. Volume of fluid method (VOF) is devised {{for the treatment of}} free surface. The sinkage and trim were predicted by using dynamic mesh technology, and the motion of ship is controlled by six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) code. Predicted results for sinkage and trim and resistance at seven Froude numbers (from Fn= 0. 15 to Fn= 0. 45) were compared against experimental data, showing good agreement. A plenty of numerical simulations for resistance of ship model under different running attitudes are carried out. On these bases, the results of numerical simulation and the factors which affect ship resistance are analyzed, the formulas for calculating the ship resistance under different drafts and longitudinal trims and arbitrary drift-trim <b>coupled</b> <b>running</b> attitudes are deduced and validated. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|LecturePg. 27 - 38 A large, {{double ended}} drive {{synchronous}} motor experienced severe, limiting lateral vibration during commissioning {{of a major}} plant expansion. The motor driving a centrifugal compressor providing process air is decoupled during startup from a gearbox and steam turbine by a clutch. Steam generated by waste heat from the process drives the turbine under normal operation and the synchronizing clutch is engaged, reducing the motor load requirements. Excessive running speed (1 x) lateral vibrations came to light when the motor was run solo during field commissioning. Extreme sensitivity to small trim balance weight changes on the exciter end led to extensive field tests to identify {{the source of the}} problem. Rotordynarnic analyses and <b>coupled</b> <b>running</b> tests confirmed an overhang resonance, and revealed the only possible short term solution to be the addition of a third bearing on the motor shaft to control the overhang mode. Field installation of a 14 inch diameter tilting pad bearing, located on the clutch hub at the motor shaft end, was completed quickly to allow plant startup to proceed. In situ machining of the hub on the shaft, while the motor remained installed in the field, was required to assure proper journal shape and rapid project completion. This paper describes the process of problem identification, measurement/verification, rotordynarnic analyses, resolution, and field implementation. Before and after field vibration measurements are presented to illustrate the success of the solution and demonstrate the additional instrumentation required...|$|E

40|$|The Netherlands are {{carrying}} out the Delta programme to adapt their water management system to climate change and sea level rise. Adaptation needs a number of decisions regarding the way the Netherlands will organize [...] in the long -term [...] their flood protection system, their water supply {{and the distribution of}} this water over the different sectors and regions. To support these decisions quantative information is needed on the occurrence of different water levels with respect to floods, on the water supply and the occurrence of dry spells, on the water available and its quality needed for flushing polders, sectors as agriculture, drinking water, recreation etc etc. The only way to provide such information is by simulation, using combinations of hydrological and hydraulic models that are linked to sectoral models. Where all models are forced by climatic and sea level boundary conditions. The water management system in the Netherlands, situated within the Rhine Meuse Delta, depends on the fluctuations and rise in sea level, variations and trends in river flow, rainfall and evaporation. The delta has a highly complicated system of water distribution and the design levels for flood protection are {{among the highest in the}} world. Adaptation measures are implemented on relatively small scales. Therefore the questions asked to the results of the simulation models are increasingly detailed. This all puts substantial pressure on the level of functional and technical design of these models. It is therefore essential that these models are used in a consistent way. Even more so, many of these models cannot be run independently but should be linked to other models to solve the interactions between the different parts of the simulated (natural) system. For the deltaprogramme, a model is currenly assembled from the numerous modelling systems that occur in the Netherlands (the Detamodel). To support the building of this Deltamodel, in this Knowledge for Climate project we explore methods for linking different existing models within the spatial domain in and around The Netherlands. We investigated the chain of hydrological and hydrodynamic models needed in the Rhine/Meuse basin and the North Sea and the groundwater, water demand and distribution model (NHI) for The Netherlands. In addition, the necessary interaction between the hydrological models and land-use and nature models was investigated and a suitable structure for linking these has been proposed that is based on existing modelling systems that are developed and maintained at different research institutes in the Netherlands. In parallel the <b>coupled</b> <b>running</b> of a climate and air quality model has been worked on, resulting in detailed simulations of air quality in a changing climate. The focus is particularly on the technology, as we prepared a prototype of such a linked modelling system. It will be used later to facilitate the preparation of scenarios in the investigated areas (water, air quality, nature, land use). It will also support further research that can support the Netherlands adaptation planning. The first case studies that have been run using 30 years of ESSENCE data driving the entire modeling chain show that such diverse results as future habitat development in Lake IJssel and the coincidence of high flow in the Rhine and storm Surge in the North Sea can be obtained. We are convinced that by formalizing the model linkages in a data and modeling platform, we increase the consistency of the different scenarios...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{solution}} of the nonlinear BK evolution equation with the recently calculated <b>running</b> <b>coupling</b> corrections [1, 2]. Performing a numerical solution we confirm the earlier result of [3] (obtained by exploring several possible scales for the <b>running</b> <b>coupling)</b> that the high energy evolution with the <b>running</b> <b>coupling</b> leads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole-nucleus scattering amplitude, which is independent of the initial conditions. It is important to stress that the <b>running</b> <b>coupling</b> corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case, in particular leading to a considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the evolution with rapidity. We then concentrate on elucidating {{the differences between the two}} recent calculations of the <b>running</b> <b>coupling</b> corrections. We explain that the difference is due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the subtraction term, which arises when <b>running</b> <b>coupling</b> corrections are included. These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then use the complete <b>running</b> <b>coupling</b> kernel including the subtraction term to find the numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with the <b>running</b> <b>coupling</b> corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very large rapidity with the scaling function unaltered by the subtraction term...|$|R
