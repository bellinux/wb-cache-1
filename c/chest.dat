5|$|Although <b>chest</b> {{radiography}} is {{an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first <b>chest</b> radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a <b>chest</b> X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the <b>chest</b> was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E

5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, <b>chest,</b> neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the <b>chest</b> cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a <b>chest</b> tube is placed to rid the <b>chest</b> cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the <b>chest</b> cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the <b>chest</b> cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer to breathe out than to breathe in. <b>Chest</b> {{tightness}} may occur but is not common and {{may be caused by}} another problem. Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the <b>chest</b> with a stethoscope. A barrel <b>chest</b> is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without <b>chest</b> wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the <b>chest</b> wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the <b>chest.</b> Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped <b>chest</b> – is treated with an incision in the animal's <b>chest</b> to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a <b>chest</b> tube.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{collectors}} {{focus on}} finding genuine antique tansu. There are few workshops producing tansu {{in imitation of}} the classic antiques due to {{the high cost of}} materials and the very low prices of secondhand tansu. Larger <b>chests</b> are sometimes reduced in size, particularly futon <b>chests,</b> step <b>chests</b> and other <b>chests</b> with deep drawers [...] Some reproduction tansu have been reproduced in Korea using keyaki veneer.|$|R
5|$|The Shiva half has a flat {{masculine}} <b>chest,</b> {{a straight}} vertical <b>chest,</b> broader shoulder, wider waist and muscular thigh. He wears a yagnopavita (sacred thread) across the <b>chest,</b> which is sometimes {{represented as a}} naga-yagnopavita (a snake worn as a yagnopavita) or a string of pearls or gems. The yajnopavita may also divide the torso into its male and female halves. He wears ornaments characteristic of Shiva's iconography, including serpent ornaments.|$|E
5|$|The third {{mechanism}} {{occurs when}} the <b>chest</b> is compressed from front to back, causing it to widen from side to side. The lungs adhere to the <b>chest</b> wall because of the negative pressure {{between them and the}} pleural membranes lining the inside of the <b>chest</b> cavity; thus when the <b>chest</b> widens, they are pulled apart. This creates tension at the carina; the airway tears if this tensile force exceeds its elasticity. This mechanism may be the cause of injury when the <b>chest</b> is crushed. Most TBI are probably due to a combination of these three mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than <b>chest</b> X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the <b>chest.</b> Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the <b>chest</b> can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|During the Daoguang Emperor's reign, China {{experienced}} {{major problems}} with opium, which was imported into China by British merchants. Opium {{had started to}} trickle into China {{during the reign of}} the Yongzheng Emperor, but was limited to approximately 200 <b>chests</b> annually. By the time of the Qianlong era, this amount had increased to 1,000 <b>chests,</b> 4,000 <b>chests</b> by the Jiaqing era and more than 30,000 <b>chests</b> during the Daoguang era.|$|R

5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree on his <b>chest</b> and back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters {{a little boy with}} a similar tree painted to his <b>chest</b> and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his <b>chest</b> and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the <b>chest</b> wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the <b>chest</b> wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the <b>chest</b> wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided <b>chest</b> pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the <b>chest</b> increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E

50|$|Treasure <b>chests</b> {{provide a}} means for the player to obtain items without paying for them in stores. In some cases, these <b>chests</b> contain items that cannot be {{purchased}} at stores. <b>Chests</b> may be locked, requiring a key of some sort. For certain games, keys can only be used once, and the key is destroyed during its use. For other games, having {{a particular type of}} key means that the player can open any of the <b>chests</b> with a matching lock.|$|R
