40|$|The US <b>Corporate</b> <b>Average</b> <b>Fuel</b> Economy (CAFE) {{regulation}} mandates, {{subject to}} a civil penalty, producers to achieve a certain fleet <b>average</b> <b>fuel</b> economy on sales of new passenger cars. Analysing the incentive effects of CAFE, we find that it affords differential tax treatment to car models with identical fuel economy, and therefore differential incentives for improvements. In fact, the incentives may be negative for producers that specialize in small or large models. This casts doubt over the environmental merits of fleet averaging. Moreover, product-mix taxes can be abused by exploiting the specialization patterns of domestic and foreign firms. <b>Corporate</b> <b>Average</b> <b>Fuel</b> Economy (CAFE); GATT; Trade and Environment; Trade Dispute...|$|R

5000|$|According to the <b>Corporate</b> <b>Average</b> <b>Fuel</b> Economy {{standard}} (CAFE) regulation, {{which was}} enacted in 1975, every seller of automobiles in the US had to achieve by 1985 a minimum sales-weighted <b>average</b> <b>fuel</b> efficiency of 27.5 {{miles per gallon}} (MPG). This standard had to be achieved for domestically produced and imported cars separately. Failure to meet the prescribed standard incurred a penalty of $5 per car per 1/10 of a gallon that the <b>corporate</b> <b>average</b> <b>fuel</b> economy fell below the standard. The first idea about {{the environmental impact of}} the CAFE regulation can be obtained by examining its effects on the <b>average</b> <b>fuel</b> efficiency of domestic and foreign firms; these effects are largest for the domestic production of US manufacturers, whose <b>corporate</b> <b>average</b> <b>fuel</b> efficiency would be lower by 1.2 MPG in the absence of CAFE standards. CAFE standards also lead to approximately [...] fuel consumption savings per year. Contrary to the CAFE standards, gasoline taxes affect not only new but also used cars, so that {{there is no reason to}} expect any substitution towards less fuel efficient used cars when taxes are raised. Small tax increases are insufficient to induce fuel cost savings of the same order of magnitude as CAFE.|$|R

This paper examines theoretically the effects of the program set up under AMFA.
