25|$|Steel blades are {{commonly}} shaped by forging or <b>stock</b> <b>removal.</b> Forged blades {{are made by}} heating {{a single piece of}} steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. <b>Stock</b> <b>removal</b> blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> processes. Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.|$|R

40|$|Aims: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to test if prices of <b>coal</b> firm <b>stocks</b> in the Chinese A-Share market {{fluctuate}} around a long-term trend. Study Design: Existence of a unit root implies that a macroeconomic variable is non stationary and a shock to the market may have imposed a permeant effect on the long-run trend. The variable will not be mean-reverting. To improve the test robustness, conventional unit root tests must be conducted in line with structural break tests. A comparison of the unit roots of stock prices of two coal producing and processing firms in China’s Shanxi Province may lead us to conclude whether the market is trend-reverting. Place and Duration of Study: The study used stock prices of two coal-related firms that come from Shanxi Province, China. The Shanxi Coking Co., Ltd registers in Lingfeng. The Shanxi Xishan Coal and Electricity Power Co., Ltd registers in Taiyuan. Data was the monthly prices. The data period was from August 1996 to July 2014 for the Shanxi Coking, and from July 2000 to October 2015 for the Shanxi Xishan Coal and Electricity Power. Methodology: The paper conducted a unit root test applying regular ADF and PP techniques. Also, it carried out a structural break test using the Perron test and the Zivot-Andrews test (Model C). Results: Tests suggest that prices of two <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> are stationary series and these two series contain a shift between 2007 and 2008. The <b>coal</b> <b>stock</b> market may be weak-form efficient. Conclusion: Dramatic coal price fluctuations in China have not produced an enduring effect on prices of the <b>coal</b> <b>stocks</b> examined in the study. The coal-electricity price linkage could account for the trend reversion of <b>coal</b> firm <b>stock</b> prices. Investors could profit to some extent from trading on coal equities. However, the paper suggests more and panel unit root tests for <b>coal</b> <b>stock</b> prices...|$|R

Present paper focuses on an effect of lapping plate geometry on finishing characteristics of the steel ball. It is found that Rcurved lapping plates constituting of V-groove have yielded greater <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> than flat ones. Experiments show that the <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> is dependent upon spin angle θ which is closely related to slipping distance of ball.

40|$|Fuzzy {{control is}} applied to the {{superfinishing}} in order to optimize the cutting ability of the stone. The finishing performance of vitrified bonded WA stone is regarded as the fuzzy goal. At the beginning of cutting, the stone is in the stage of cutting to get high <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> rate. But the cutting ability is decreasing as the finishing proceeds and is lost at the end of finishing, resulting in getting the smooth surface. A cutting resistance is used to monitor the cutting condition of stone. The cutting ability of stone is controlled by both the stone pressure and the amount of electricity for electrolytic in-process dressing. A water-solution type coolant and metal bonded diamond stone are used. The main results obtained are as follows. Fuzzy control makes it possible to give the optimized cutting ability to the diamond stone. In the first case, it is possible to get the large <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> following the smooth surface in a limited time. In second case, it is possible to minimize the finishing time in which the finishing performance intended in <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> and surface roughness is obtained.

25|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} occurs naturally within some environments {{as part of}} {{the rock}} weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from <b>coal</b> <b>stocks,</b> <b>coal</b> handling facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{miniaturization}} of {{semiconductor devices}} is advancing rapidly.

In our research, a flatness of 0. 1 µm has been achieved over an entire 12 " wafer surface by planarization with oscillation speed control type polishing. However, in addition it is necessary to increase the removal rate {{in order to reduce the}} polishing time. Although high rotational speed polishing is a solution to meet this requirement, the polishing characteristics change with the rotational conditions. Using a simulation program, we calculated that the <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> saturates as the rotational speeds of the wafer and polishing pad are increased beyond a certain point. Also, experimental results showed that at high rotational speeds actual <b>stock</b> <b>removal</b> is significantly less than that indicated by the simulation, and that too much slurry causes unnecessary etching...|$|R
