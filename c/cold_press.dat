40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{oxidative}} stability of <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> sunflower oil of high-oleic type was investigated, using Schaal–Oven test at elevated temperature (63 ± 2 °C).

To especially expressed increase in oxidative values, with very high values of the coefficient of determination occurred in samples of linoleic type of oils, <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> and refined, whereas these changes were much less observed in the sample of <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> sunflower oil of high-oleic type (R 2 ≥ 0. 99). The <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> oils of high-oleic and linoleic type, as well of refined sunflower oil of linoleic type were measured and the content of conjugated dienes and conjugated trienes. In the period of 14 days, the lowest increase in oxidative value and the lowest degree of conjugation into the conjugated diene and triene were determined in <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> sunflower oil of high-oleic type, indicating a significantly better oxidative stability of this type of oil compared to linoleic types...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTo {{develop and}} {{validate}} an image analysis method for quantitative analysis of γ-oryzanol in <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> rice bran oil.

ConclusionsThe TLC-densitometric and TLC-image analysis methods provided a similar reproducibility, accuracy and selectivity for the quantitative determination of γ-oryzanol in <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> rice bran oil. A statistical comparison of the quantitative determinations of γ-oryzanol in samples did not show any statistically significant difference between TLC-densitometric and TLC-image analysis methods.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{characterize}} and compare <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> and fully refined winterized corn oils. Free fatty acidity (FFA), peroxide (PV) and p-anisidin (p-AV) values, saponification number, total carotenoid and phenolic contents of <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> corn oils were higher than that of the refined winterized corn oils. Linoleic and oleic acids (approximately 53 - 54 % and 30 - 31 %, respectively) were detected as the major fatty acids in both oil samples. Fifteen different sterols with a majority of β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol were quantified in both oil samples. Although phenolic compounds were not quantified in the refined winterized oil samples, some flavonoids (hesperidin, rutin) and phenolic acids (gallic, syringic, rosmaniric and trans-ferulic) were detected in the <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> oil samples. This study concludes that <b>cold</b> <b>pressed</b> corn oils could be superior in terms of bioactive compounds but still need some quality improvements for sensory attributes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Selective Laser Sintering could {{manufacture}} high complex {{metal parts}} in short time but with high porosity and low strength. The components from <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> have excellent performance with uniform organizational structure, high size precision, and high density. It, however, could not form high complex parts {{because of the}} difficulties of bag manufacture. So {{it will be a}} good method to combine Selective Laser Sintering and <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> to make complicated metal parts. In this paper, the specimens of stainless steel were made by the combined Selective Laser Sintering and <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> forming route. And the simulation of <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> was carried out by finite element method and Drucker-Prager-Cap constitutive model in ABAQUS/Explicit computer program. The property of metal powder was measured by experiments. The effects of bag on <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> have been discussed. It is different from the <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing</b> of metal powder that the bag has little influence on both shape and size of the specimen. The results of simulation show a good agreement between the experimental results and the calculated results. The simulation can give a useful direction to dimension and shape designs of the combined forming of Selective Laser Sintering and <b>Cold</b> Isostatic <b>Pressing...</b>|$|R

50|$|A study {{designed}} {{to test the}} positive physiological effects of humour, the relationship between being exposed to humour and pain tolerance in particular, was conducted in 1994 by Karen Zwyer, Barbara Velker, and Willibald Ruch. To test the effects of humour on pain tolerance the test subjects were first exposed to a short humorous video clip and then exposed to the <b>Cold</b> <b>Press</b> Test. To identify the aspects of humour which might contribute {{to an increase in}} pain tolerance the study separated its fifty six female participants into three groups, cheerfulness, exhilaration and humour production. The subjects were further separated into two groups, high Trait-Cheerfulness and high Trait-Seriousness according to the State-Trait-Cheerfulness-Inventory. The instructions for the three groups were as follows: the cheerfulness group were told to get excited about the movie without laughing or smiling, the exhilaration group was told to laugh and smile excessively, exaggerating their natural reactions, the humour production group was told to make humorous comments about the video clip as they watched. To ensure that the participants actually found the movie humorous and that it produced the desired effects the participants took a survey on the topic which resulted in a mean score of 3.64 out of 5. The results of the <b>Cold</b> <b>Press</b> Test showed that the participants in all three groups experienced a higher pain threshold, a higher pain tolerance and a lower pain tolerance than previous to the film.

50|$|Juice Press is {{best known}} for its cold-pressed juice, which is made by {{pressing}} fruits and vegetables under high pressure until juice trickles out. This is a more time-consuming and labor-intensive process, using more fruits and vegetables, than a blade-driven method. A 16-ounce bottle of juice can contain between 3 and 6 pounds of produce. From midnight to 9 am every morning, a combination of Norwalk <b>cold</b> <b>press</b> machines and Goodnature machines pulverize and press the next day's inventory of juice, so that all juices are fresh for that day. The Norwalk Hydraulic Press was designed by early juicing and raw food advocate Dr. Norman W. Walker in 1934, to extract the nutrient-rich liquid from fruits and vegetables. The company avoids high-pressure processing (HPP), so that each bottle of fresh juice has a shelf life of two to four days, shorter than juices made using HPP, which can remain on the shelf for more than three weeks.|$|E
