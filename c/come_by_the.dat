5|$|Without the Austrian {{reinforcements}} {{the defenders}} of Toulon were outnumbered and outflanked, coming under sustained attack by French troops directed by 24-year-old artillery officer Captain Napoleon Bonaparte. On 17 December, French troops seized the high ground over {{the city and the}} allies were forced into a chaotic withdrawal. As Hood's ships removed the garrison and more than 14,000 refugees from the city, boat parties led by Sir Sidney Smith attempted to destroy the French fleet and dockyards with fireships. These efforts were only partially successful: fifteen ships of the line and five frigates survived the conflagration to form the nucleus of the French Mediterranean Fleet in the war to <b>come.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> evening of 18 December Toulon was firmly in Republican hands.|$|E
5|$|They found {{albatross}} chicks {{and seals}} to eat, {{but despite the}} relative comfort of the island compared to the small boat, they still urgently needed to reach the whaling station at Husvik {{on the other side}} of the island to fetch help for the men on Elephant Island. It was clear that McNish and Vincent could not continue, so Shackleton left them in the care of Timothy McCarthy camped in the upturned James Caird, and with Worsley and Crean made the hazardous trip over the mountains. McNish took screws from the James Caird and attached them to the boots of the men making the journey to help them grip the ice. He also fashioned a crude sledge from driftwood he found on the beach, but it proved too clumsy to be practical. When Shackleton's party set off on 18 May 1916, McNish accompanied them for a few hundred yards but he was unable to go any further. He shook hands with each of the men, wished them good luck and then Shackleton sent him back. Putting McNish in command of the remaining men, Shackleton charged him to wait for relief and if none had <b>come</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of winter to attempt to sail to the east coast. Once Shackleton's party had crossed the mountains and arrived in Husvik, he sent Worsley with one of the whaler's ships, Samson, to pick up McNish and the other men. After seeing the emaciated and drawn McNish on his arrival at the whaling station, Shackleton recorded that he felt that the rescue had come just in time for him.|$|E

25|$|Olympus Mons is an {{unlikely}} landing location for automated space probes {{in the near}} future.

25|$|Many {{women were}} {{forced out of}} their modest ways of life {{due to lack of}} space and privacy in the {{internment}} camps. For example, at Hastings Park, women and children were housed in an area that was previously used for livestock. Prisoners were forced to share one animal stall per family and personal space was very hard to <b>come</b> <b>by.</b> <b>The</b> partitions were made of the five-foot stall walls and flimsy pieces of fabric.

Besides the beach and ocean, it offered dancing and billiard rooms to the visitors of its more than 400 rooms, and for years it was the northern-most attraction in Ocean City.
