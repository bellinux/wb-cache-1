5|$|According to Herodotus, only 43,000 Persians {{survived the}} battle. The number who died, of course, {{depends on how}} many there were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by Herodotus' reckoning. Herodotus <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> the Greeks as a whole lost only 159 men. Furthermore, he <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> only Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians died, since {{they were the only}} ones who fought. Plutarch, who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 Greek {{casualties}}, while both Ephorus and Diodorus Siculus tally the Greek casualties to over 10,000.|$|E
5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{are called}} to the Excelsis Dei private nursing home in Worcester, Massachusetts in order to {{investigate}} a nurse's claim that she was raped by an invisible entity. Severely bruised, Michelle Charters (Teryl Rothery) <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> she knows who was responsible and names the attacker as Hal Arden, an elderly resident of Excelsis Dei. When questioned, Arden admits that he made sexual overtures to her, but <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> it was harmless {{and that he is}} too elderly to have done anything.|$|E

Stans attempts to drown in a tub of scalding water, but is rescued by the hospital staff and subsequently is disfigured due to the hot water. Stans again <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> the mysterious figure will not let him die.|$|E

50|$|The Prime Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, {{offered his}} sympathies to the wounded and <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> {{the attack was}} a provocation. The main {{opposition}} leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu also <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the attack was a provocation. In a statement after the bombing, HDP chairman Selahattin Demirtaş <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the attack intended to destabilise the south-east and also <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Hezbollah and ISIL forces had entered Turkey.|$|R
5|$|Imperator totius orientis (commander-in-chief of {{the entire}} East): only the Augustan History <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> Odaenathus was conferred with this title; the same source also <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> he was made an Augustus (co-emperor) {{following}} his defeat of the Persians. Both claims are dismissed by scholars. Odaenathus {{seems to have been}} acclaimed as Imperator by his troops which is a salutation reserved for the Roman emperor; this acclamation might explain the erroneous reports of the Augustan History.|$|E

50|$|On 26 December, Prime Minister Erdoğan <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Akkaş had disgraced the {{judiciary}} by issuing {{such a statement}} and <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the HSYK had committed a crime by refusing the government's demands to notify senior ministers of investigations. He <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> had he had the right, he would have 'tried' the HSYK himself, but <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the people would {{have the right to}} judge. A day later, the Turkish Council of State voted down the government's demands, with Erdoğan subsequently issuing a statement saying 'what needs to be done will be done, and then you will see' and <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> the judicial changes proposed in the 2010 constitutional referendum had been a mistake. Several pro-government ministers <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the judicial setback was the last open attack against the AKP by the Gulen Movement.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, the Eurypontid King of Sparta Eudamidas III, son of Agis IV, died. Pausanias, the Greek writer, <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> Cleomenes had him poisoned. In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} his position against the ephors, who {{were opposed to}} his expansionist policy, Cleomenes recalled his uncle Archidamus V from his exile in Messene to ascend the Eurypontid throne, {{but as soon as}} Archidamus returned to the city, he was assassinated. Cleomenes' involvement in the plot is unclear, since ancient sources contradict each other: Polybius <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> Cleomenes ordered the murder, but Plutarch disagrees.|$|E

Kritschgau <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for {{the activities of the}} military–industrial complex. Mulder dismisses these claims until Scully tells him Kritschgau told her that she was given cancer to make him believe.|$|E
5|$|Several urban legends exist {{regarding}} the chariot sequence. One <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> a stuntman died during filming, which Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, and another states that a red Ferrari {{can be seen}} during the chariot race. The book Movie Mistakes claims this is a myth. Heston, in a DVD commentary track for the film, mentions that a third urban legend <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> he wore a wristwatch during the chariot race, but points out that he wore leather bracers up to the elbow.|$|E

When one student interjected that she was Palestinian, the students <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> Klocek began to shout and throw the material on their stall at them, at which point students from a neighboring exhibit, the United Muslims Moving Ahead got involved. They <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> Klocek began shouting profanities at them and told them that their religion was based on terror.
