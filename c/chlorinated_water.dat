All three analyses indicated the same trends. For the detection of E. coli in raw waters LTLB was better than MMGM at 18 - 24 h, but MMGM was better at 48 h with waters containing small numbers of coliform organisms; for raw waters with greater numbers of organisms, both media performed equally well. Analysis of a subset of samples read at both 18 and 24 h indicated that the superiority of LTLB over MMGM with raw waters disappeared by 24 h. For <b>chlorinated</b> <b>waters,</b> LTLB yielded more positive gas reactions at 18 - 24 h, but fewer of these were E. coli than with MMGM; at 48 h MMGM was clearly better than LTLB for total coliform organisms including E. coli [...] especially if the numbers were small.

40|$|Introduction: Different {{by-products}} in <b>chlorinated</b> drinking <b>waters,</b> including cloroform, brominated trihalomethanes and halacetones, {{are causing}} concern over human health, {{due to their}} potential carcinogenicity. Epidemiological studies have reported exceeding risks for bladder, colon and rectum cancers in subjects living in areas where <b>chlorinated</b> drinking <b>waters</b> are distributed in comparison with subjects living in areas where no <b>chlorinated</b> drinking <b>water</b> is used. However, up to now, major difficulties in assessing past-exposure do not allow to formulate final conclusions. An Italian association on cancer research has recently granted a study with the aim to evaluate the relationship between <b>chlorinated</b> drinking <b>water</b> consumption and the incidence of bladder and colon-rectum cancers {{in the province of}} Modena (Northern Italy). Methods: This study has an ecological design: the units are the 47 municipalities in the province of Modena and the outcomes the incidence rates of bladder (IX-ICD: 188), colon (IX-ICD: 153) and rectum (IX-ICD: 154) cancer, observed in these areas in 1988 - 94 as reported by Modena Cancer Registry. To evaluate each municipality exposure, information on the main characteristics (disinfection treatment, source and quality) of drinking waters were collected asking local waterworks managers to fill in a questionnaire. As in the mountainous municipalities many little springs represent the watersource, many waterplants are operative inside each unit (overall, more than 200 waterplants were identified). In this case municipality exposure was evaluated by combining information collected by each waterwork. A municipality was considered exposed if in 1980 - 90 drinking waters were disinfected with chorine. Hierarchical Bayesian methods were applied to calculate smoothed standardized incidence rates (SIRs), relative risks (RRs), and 95 % CI. Results: The overall incidence of bladder, colon and rectum cancer in Modena in 1988 - 1994 was 24. 6, 30. 5 and 15. 8 (x 104) respectively. Spatial differences were observed mainly for bladder cancer. In subjects living in areas supplied in 1980 - 1990 by <b>chlorinated</b> drinking <b>waters</b> in comparison with subjects living in areas supplied by untreated drinking waters an increased risk for bladder cancer (RR = 1. 17; 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 37) was observed, while no differences were evidenced for colon (RR = 1. 07; 95 % CI: 0. 96 - 1. 24) and rectum (RR = 1. 02; 95 % CI: 0. 90 - 1. 16) cancer. Ecological covariates, including population density and % of subjects living in the same house in period 1980 - 1990 in each municipality were included in the model. Conclusion: Nevertheless the difficulties in determining past-exposure and the weaknesses of the study design (ecological fallacy), this study suggests, in accordance with literature data, an exceeding risk for bladder cancer in subjects living in areas where <b>chlorinated</b> drinking <b>waters</b> are supplied...|$|R
40|$|Risk issues become {{complicated}} when {{scientific evidence}} concerning a potential environmental exposure is equivocal; particularly when many {{argue that the}} public health benefits of a policy action outweigh any potential negative health effects. <b>Chlorinated</b> drinking <b>water,</b> and <b>chlorinated</b> disinfection byproducts (CDBPs) that are formed during the disinfection process, represent a useful case-study for examining these complications. We conduct a media analysis of <b>chlorinated</b> drinking <b>water</b> stories in the Canadian print media from 1977 to 2000. We examine media presentations of science compared to framings by scientists, regulators, the chlorine industry, water utility representatives, and non-governmental organizations of the CDBP issue based on key informant interviews. We argue {{that there are two}} main framings of the debate, each of which are powerful in constructing risk perceptions. On the one hand, many frame the debate as a 'voluntary' risk: we choose chlorine disinfection to protect against microbial risks with a possible adverse consequence of that protection. On the other hand, others frame the issue as an 'involuntary' risk: chlorine disinfection was a 'choice' imposed by public health and water utility officials; a choice that carries a potential cancer risk, and alternative disinfection technologies are advocated. We demonstrate these different frames by examining metaphorical constructs of water, chlorine and cancer contained within them.
