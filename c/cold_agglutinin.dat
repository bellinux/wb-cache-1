40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Cold</b> <b>agglutinins</b> and cryoglobulins are {{uncommon}} {{in the same}} patient as observed in our case. CASE REPORT: A 74 -year-old patient suffered repeated episodes of hemolytic anemia for one year and had hepatitis C anti-virus antibodies. Mixed cryoglobulinemia was found at levels which increased during episodes of acute hemolysis in addition to anti-I <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinins.</b> Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed identical oligoclonal <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinins</b> and cryoglobulins. DISCUSSION: Unlike mixed cryoglobulinemia, <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinins</b> are not known to occur subsequent to hepatitis C infection. The identical immunoglobulins observed in our patient suggest a common origin. Chronic anti-I <b>cold</b> oligoclonal <b>agglutinins</b> are rarely observed and could be an intermediary step towards monoclonal lymphopathy as has been described in prolonged hepatitis C infection...|$|R

50|$|Agglutinin {{might also}} be {{associated}} with diseases of which the most common is an autoimmune disease known as <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinin</b> disease. In <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinin</b> disease, the body produces agglutinins or antibodies that coagulate erythrocytes and lyse them at room temperature or lower. Under normal circumstances, the lifespan of erythrocytes is 120 days after which they are degraded by the spleen. In individuals that have <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinin</b> disease, the lifespan of erythrocytes is shortened. The rate of erythrocyte production by the bone marrow {{is lower than the}} rate of destruction, thus, individuals with <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinin</b> disease develop a form of anemia. A body might produce agglutinins to attack the erythrocytes due to allergies to foods, inhalants, chemicals and infections. A person suffering from this condition will likely have cooler body parts such as fingers, nose, and ears attacked more often than warmer areas such as armpits https://web.archive.org/web/20100227012138/http://www.caringmedical.com/conditions/Cold_Agglutinin_Disease.htm.|$|E

40|$|Williams et al. (1) in a {{study of}} {{monoclonal}} IgM <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinins</b> noted that antisera to different <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinins</b> possessed specificity not only for antigenic determinants unique to the individual proteins but also for determinants that were shared by <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinins</b> from a number of individuals. This phenomenon of shared or cross-idiotypy among immunoglobulins with similar specificity also has been demonstrated for human proteins with anti- 7 -globulin activity (2) and among rabbit (3, 4) and mouse (5) antibodies to streptococcal group carbohydrates. In most instances the proteins exhibiting cross-idiotypic reactions had similar, but not necessarily identical, combining sites, and the idiotypic determinant shared by them was associated with the combining site (2, 5 - 8). Support for the structural similarity of antibodies with similar specificity and shared idiotypy has been provided by recent findings showing that IgM <b>cold</b> <b>agglutinins,</b> anti-y-globulins (9, 11), or rabbit antibodies to streptococcal group C carbohydrate (7) have strikingly similar heavy and/or light chains.
