500|$|The post-colonial Anglo-Indian dish chicken tikka masala was {{apparently}} invented in Glasgow {{in the early}} 1970s, while balti cuisine was introduced to Britain in 1977 in Birmingham. In 2003, there were roughly 9000 restaurants serving Indian cuisine in Britain. The majority of Indian restaurants in Britain are run by entrepreneurs of Bangladeshi (often Sylhet) and Pakistani origin. According to Britain's Food Standards Agency, the Indian food industry in the United Kingdom was worth £3.2 billion in 2003, accounting for two-thirds of all eating out, and serving about 2.5 million British customers every week. Indian restaurants typically allow the diner to combine base ingredients — chicken, prawns or [...] "meat" [...] (lamb or mutton) — with curry sauces — from the mild korma to the scorching phall — {{without regard to the}} authenticity of the combination. The reference point for flavour and spice heat is the Madras curry sauce (the name represents the area of India where restaurateurs obtained their spices, rather than an actual dish). Other sauces are sometimes variations on a basic curry sauce: for instance, vindaloo is often rendered as a fiery dish of lamb or <b>chicken</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Madras sauce with extra chilli, rather than the Anglo-Indian dish of pork marinated in wine vinegar and garlic, based on a Goan Portuguese dish carne de vinha d'alhos.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{near the}} main plaza is the {{municipal}} market, {{which is a}} traditional place to enjoy local culinary specialties.

The Hmong shaman reads Walt's personal character, when in real life he would communicate with the spirit world. In the film the shaman himself does a sacrifice of a <b>chicken</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner that Schein and Thoj say is [...] "in dramatic ceremonial fashion," [...] when in real life an assistant would do this [...] "perfunctorily." [...] The authors said that the hu plis ceremony done {{in honor of the}} baby has an incorrect spatial layout, that the clothing and grooming of the Hmong gangs is not correct, and [...] "the obsequious making of offerings on doorstep" [...] are not accurate. While Thao himself cleans dishes, Schein and Thoj add that he would not do this alone because he is in a house with other female family members. Schein and Thoj also add that there is [...] "inconsistent use of the two Hmong dialects within one family." [...] They also argue that members of a Hmong clan would not show aggression towards a member of a fellow clan and that they would not rape a member of their own clan, like the gang in the film rapes Sue. Sharon Her, a Hmong writer from New York, argued that the film had [...] "confusion of Asian customs" [...] and that [...] "Hmong people do not use favors as a method of atonement nor do they endlessly shower individuals with gifts out of gratitude." ...|$|E
