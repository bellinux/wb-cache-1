50|$|The optical {{transfer}} function (OTF) of an optical system such as a <b>camera,</b> <b>microscope,</b> human eye, or projector specifies how different spatial frequencies are handled by the system. It is used by optical engineers to describe how the optics project light from the object or scene onto a photographic film, detector array, retina, screen, or simply the next item in the optical transmission chain. A variant, the modulation {{transfer function}} (MTF), neglects phase effects, but {{is equivalent to the}} OTF in many situations.|$|E
50|$|The pupil {{function}} or {{aperture function}} describes how a light wave is affected upon transmission through an optical imaging system {{such as a}} <b>camera,</b> <b>microscope,</b> or the human eye. More specifically, it is a complex function of the position in the pupil or aperture (often an iris) that indicates the relative change in amplitude and phase of the light wave. Sometimes this function {{is referred to as}} the generalized pupil function, in which case pupil function only indicates whether light is transmitted or not. Imperfections in the optics typically have a direct effect on the pupil function, it is therefore an important tool to study optical imaging systems and their performance.|$|E

30|$|The {{anatomical}} {{characteristics of}} original bamboo, such as vascular bundle density, proportions of cell types were measured {{according to the}} methods presented in the past research papers [8 – 10]. Anatomical samples from the middle portion of internodes were sliced into cross-sections of 10  ×  10  mm × culms wall thickness ×  30  μm (thickness of parallel to grain). Followed by, the cross-sections of bamboo culms were projected under a digital <b>camera</b> <b>microscope</b> (OLYMPUS DP 20). The vascular bundle density was determined by counting the vascular bundle numbers on the cross-section images per mm 2. The proportions of cell types were calculated in a line, which was crossed from inner side to the epidermis, i.e. by counting the numbers of grids covering the fiber, parenchyma and vessel cells on the coordinate paper in the line. Six replicates were carried out for each portion samples.|$|E

The {{main source}} for {{lubricant}} oils is mineral oils, but {{the source of}} mineral oils are depleting {{from day to day}} and it is also a major cause for environmental pollution in the world. This aim of research is to introduce vegetable oil as an alternative source of lubricant oil in industrial applications. In this study, we measured the physical properties of Jatropha, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and empty fruit bunches. All experiment were done according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) condition, method B and with the use of four-ball tribotester, CCD <b>camera,</b> <b>microscope</b> and viscometer to obtain results. The test oils were measured of their coefficient of friction, wear, viscosity and flash temperature parameter.

40|$|The {{restricted}} {{mass and}} power budgets of landed science missions present {{a challenge to}} obtaining detailed analyses of planetary bodies. In situ studies, whether alone or as reconnaissance for sample return, must rely on highly miniaturized and autonomous instrumentation. Such devices must still produce useful data sets from a minimum of measurements. The great desire to understand the surfaces and interiors of planets, moons, and small bodies had driven the development of small, robotic techniques with ever-increasing capabilities. One {{of the most important}} goals on a surface mission is to study composition in many geological contexts. The mineralogical, molecular, elemental, and isotopic content of near-surface materials (regolith, rocks, soils, dust, etc.) at a variety of sites can complement broader imaging to describe the makeup and formative history of the body in question. Instruments that perform this site-to-site analysis must be highly transportable and work as a suite. For instance, a <b>camera,</b> <b>microscope,</b> spectrophotometer, and mass spectrometer can share several components and operate under a parallel command structure. Efficient use of multiple systems on a small rover has been demonstrated on the Mars Pathfinder mission...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} how morphological biosignatures (i. e., features related to life) might {{be identified with}} an array of viable instruments within the framework of robotic planetary surface operations at Mars. This is the first time such an integrated lab-based study has been conducted that incorporates space-qualified instrumentation designed for combined in situ imaging, analysis, and geotechnics (sampling). Specimens were {{selected on the basis of}} feature morphology, scale, and analogy to Mars rocks. Two types of morphological criteria were considered: potential signatures of extinct life (fossilized microbial filaments) and of extant life (crypto-chasmoendolithic microorganisms). The materials originated from a variety of topical martian analogue localities on Earth, including impact craters, high-latitude deserts, and hydrothermal deposits. Our in situ payload included a stereo <b>camera,</b> <b>microscope,</b> Mossbauer spectrometer, and sampling device (all space-qualified units from Beagle 2), and an array of commercial instruments, including a multi-spectral imager, an X-ray spectrometer (calibrated to the Beagle 2 instrument), a micro-Raman spectrometer, and a bespoke (custom-designed) X-ray diffractometer. All experiments were conducted within the engineering constraints of in situ operations to generate realistic data and address the practical challenges of measurement. Our results demonstrate the importance of an integrated approach for this type of work. Each technique made a proportionate contribution to the overall effectiveness of our "pseudo-payload" for biogenic assessment of samples yet highlighted a number of limitations of current space instrument technology for in situ astrobiology...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hypoxia-induced factors (HIF) {{has a role}} in {{angiogenesis}} {{and regulate}} tumorigenesis of cancer cell. The HIF is the best-identified mechanism that shows imbalance between consumption and oxygen supply in progressing tumor. This study of HIF- 2 α expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) aimed to investigate the relationship of HIF- 2 α and pathology characteristics related to its clinical correlation. Methods: Fifty-eight samples of OSCC and adjacent tissues were fixed in paraffin for microarray preparation. The tissue array then was stained using primary antibody HIF- 2 α (NB 100 - 122) and autoprobe II ABC universal staining kit. Each tissue sample was captured using <b>camera</b> <b>microscope,</b> and images were analyzed with Photoshop 6. 0 using the CMYK method. A {{statistical analysis was performed}} with the two-tailed t-test, Kaplan–Meier and log-rank test using Prism for Windows version 5. 0. Results: The samples of the non-cancerous matched tissues (NCMTs) paired with their OSCC samples showed HIF- 2 α overexpression with significance difference p <  0. 0001. Although no significant difference was found between HIF- 2 α expression and overall survival rate, cancer-specific survival rate, and disease-free survival rate, the HIF- 2 α expression showed statistical significance for overall cancer stages with p =  0. 013. In addition, patients with high HIF- 2 α expression tended to develop recurrence within 2 years compared to the low expression group. Conclusion: HIF- 2 expression has complicated roles in different cancer types, including OSCC. Our study indicated that HIF- 2 α overexpression can serve as a good biomarker for cancer status for all tumor stages and may predict an early recurrence within two years...|$|E

40|$|Research about {{composition}} of superior nutrients, growth parameters, and best method to maximize production of biomass sea phytoplankton, Chlorella vulgaris, Dunaliella salina, and Spirulina sp. has been performed. The nutrients was named as MSSIP which were consist of following compositions: urea fertilizer, Arschat-M nutrient, Fe:Co:Ni metal ions (6 : 3 : 9 : 6 : 3). Methods used were identification {{and analysis of}} sea phytoplankton. Determination of optimum growth condition, pure culture, and mass culture were using local raw materials-based engineered nutrients or MSSIP (M. Sjahrul-Syahruddin Kasim-Indah Raya-Paulina Taba). Determination of product density of sea phytoplankton biomass, analyses of carbohydrate content, and lipid biomass were done by using haemocytometer and microscope, Luff Schrol method, and soxhlet method (n-hexane as solvent), respectively. Morphology of phytoplankton was identified by using a digital <b>camera</b> <b>microscope,</b> SZ 60 /sZ 60 - 61. Furthermore, to understand the effect of metal ions, Fe, Co, and Ni added into MSSIP nutrient, identification of nutrient before and after culturing process were done using XRF-Thermo-Fisher. The results showed that Chlorella vulgaris, Dunaliella salina, and Spirulina sp. were suitable as raw materials to produce biofuel. Those three phytoplankton contained 0, 3095 g/L, 0, 3782 g/L, and 0, 3325 g/L biomass, 32, 49 %w/w, 31, 58 %w/w, and 29, 81 %w/w carbohydrates; and 25, 95 %w/w, 26, 82 %w/w and 24, 53 %w/w lipid, respectively. Best optimum condition of culture were salinity of 30 - 35 %, temperature of 20 - 30 °C, pH of 8 - 9, initial density of 2. 5 x 104 cell/mL, light exposure of 40 watt, and continuously aerated with CO 2. Based on our study, sea phytoplankton, Chlorella vulgaris, Dunaliella salina, and Spirulina sp. have a high potency as source of bioethanol and biodiesel...|$|E

[Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]When investigating the composition and dynamics of the atmosphere's particulate matter, particle shape is an important parameter by which classification and possibly identification of particles may be achieved. Spherical droplets, cuboidal crystals typical of marine aerosols, and the wide variety of morphologies assumed by ice crystals, are examples where the determination of shape may be used in combination with size spectra measurements to provide experimental data upon which theoretical models of macroscopic and microscopic physical behavior of clouds and aerosols may be developed and tested. A specific example involves the study of ice microphysics and the behavior of droplets and ice crystals which can occur simultaneously within clouds. The radiative properties of these mixed-phase clouds can be radically dependent upon the relative proportions and size spectra of the two phases [Prabhakara et al., 1993]. There are several commercially available instruments designed to measure the size spectra of atmospheric particles, the FSSP - Forward Scatter Spectrometer Probe, (Particle Measurement Systems Inc. Boulder CO.), being perhaps the most widely used in alrbome platforms [Knollenberg, 1981; Dye and Baumgardner, 1984]. However, these instruments cannot provide information relating to particle shape. Other techniques, based on recording the silhouettes of particles traversing a light sheet [Knollenberg, 1970], or which record impact pits left by particles on deformable film [Amott et al., 1994], or based on holographic imaging of particles [Lawson and Cormack, 1995], or which allow visual examination of ice crystals impacting onto an optical window in front of a video <b>camera</b> <b>microscope</b> [Amott et al., 1995], are capable of discerning particle shapes. However these methods require particle-by-particle post-flight image examination to extract visual shape information, a process that can be laborious. Furthermore, in general they are unable to resolve the shapes of the smallest micrometre-sized particles which the FSSP often indicates are present in ice or mixed-phase clouds and which can have an important bearing on the cloud radiative properties...|$|E
40|$|In {{the pursuit}} of {{defining}} {{the next generation of}} manned lunar explorations, NASA is working with {{the development of a new}} infrastructure that will allow prolonged stays on the lunar surface. A key science activity during these missions will be the collection and analysis of lunar rocks. Currently, NASA is building habitat mock-ups for the Moon to attempt and test the best living and working conditions. While incorporating a focus on living quarters and hygiene areas, the needs of workshops and laboratories have only been briefly addressed as yet. The purpose of this project was to explore the possibilities for geosciences on the Moon and to set the stage for the integration of a geosciences module in a lunar habitat mock-up. The challenge was to develop a tenable systems concept view on how lunar geosciences will be conducted during longer stays on the Moon and how the related logistics chains should be. In the second instance, the appropriate lunar geosciences hardware was designed, taking into account the needs of the geologists as well as the constraints of the lunar environment and the exploration conditions. The first part of the research consisted of a broad investigation of the prospective processing of geosciences on the Moon in terms of the whole chain from identification of the samples, selection, protection, labelling, transportation, storage, examination to deliverance back to Earth. Information has been gathered through literature reviews, study visits and user interviews. On that base, three concept solutions were presented: The first is a glove box to be placed inside of the lunar habitat or a pressurised vehicle. This glove box is equipped with an analytical instrument as a combination of a <b>camera,</b> <b>microscope</b> and Raman spectroscope. Samples are brought into the glove box via a specially developed transfer container, which easily connects to the glove box. The second concept consists of a semi-automatic robot that is placed outside of the habitat. By scanning the collected samples it can create virtual representations to be reviewed by a geologist on a touch based computer screen inside the habitat. If the geologist finds a sample particularly interesting, requests of further analytical procedures could be sent to the robot. The third concept consists of a bag for storing rock samples. The aim with this sample bag is to protect and organise the collected samples...|$|E

50|$|A back-illuminated sensor {{contains}} the same elements, but arranges the wiring behind the photocathode layer by flipping the silicon wafer during manufacturing and then thinning its reverse side so that light can strike the photocathode layer without {{passing through the}} wiring layer. This change can improve the chance of an input photon being captured from about 60% to over 90%, with the greatest difference realised when pixel size is small, as the light capture area gained in moving the wiring from the top (light incident) to bottom surface (paraphrasing the BSI design) is proportionately smaller for a larger pixel. BSI-CMOS sensors are most advantageous in partial sun and other low light conditions. Placing the wiring behind the light sensors {{is similar to the}} difference between a cephalopod eye and a vertebrate eye. Orienting the active matrix transistors behind the photocathode layer can lead to a host of problems, such as cross-talk, which causes noise, dark current, and color mixing between adjacent pixels. Thinning also makes the silicon wafer more fragile. These problems could be solved through improved manufacturing processes, but only at the cost of lower yields, and consequently higher prices. Despite these issues, early BI sensors found uses in niche roles where their better low-light performance was important. Early uses included industrial sensors, security <b>cameras,</b> <b>microscope</b> <b>cameras</b> and astronomy systems.|$|R
