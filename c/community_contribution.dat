25|$|Islam's holiest month, Ramadan, is {{observed}} through many events. As Muslims must fast {{during the day}} during Ramadan, mosques will host iftar dinners after sunset and the fourth required prayer of the day, maghrib. Food is provided, at least in part, {{by members of the}} community, thereby creating daily potluck dinners. Because of the <b>community</b> <b>contribution</b> necessary to serve iftar dinners, mosques with smaller congregations {{may not be able to}} host the iftar dinners daily. Some mosques will also hold suhoor meals before dawn to congregants attending the first required prayer of the day, fajr. As with iftar dinners, congregants usually provide the food for suhoor, although able mosques may provide food instead. Mosques will often invite poorer members of the Muslim community to share in beginning and breaking the fasts, as providing charity during Ramadan is regarded in Islam as especially honorable.|$|E
