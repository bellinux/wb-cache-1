40|$|The goal of {{the article}} is {{analysis}} {{of the world and}} domestic tendencies of capital taxation and justification of directions of improvement of capital taxation in Ukraine. The study was carried out with division of taxation of human and material capital. Taxation of human capital in Ukraine is moderate, compared to OECD countries, however, its main load lies on employers, unlike in OECD countries, where it is distributed proportionally between employers and employees. Taking into account a high level of shadow income of the citizens, {{it is too early to}} perform this re-distribution in Ukraine, that is why it is expedient to reduce rates of the single social contribution by employers, at the same time increasing the level of natural resources taxation, which, in Ukraine, is one of the lowest in the world. Ukraine, compared to OECD countries, is characterised with a higher level of profit taxation, which has a negative impact on increasing own capital and restoration of fixed assets. Taking into account tendencies to reduction of both standard and implicit rates of profit tax abroad, we offer to develop a mechanism of reduction of the implicit profit tax rate through improvement of the mechanism of <b>charging</b> <b>depreciation</b> and strengthening regulating effects of the profit tax on profit in the context of restoration of the fixed assets.

These hypotheses are tested using 150 British companies from the years 1880 / 81, 1889 / 90 and 1899 / 01.

Gradually there was a change of approach to interpretation of the concept "depreciation". Within the French school allocated concept of broad and narrow depreciation, two options of a covering of depreciation expenses were offered, research of influence of fiscal policy on depreciation was conducted. The German school connected <b>charge</b> of <b>depreciation</b> with depreciation of property and need of formation of a sinking fund. Within maneuvers of Anglo-American school considered that depreciation has to be charged at the expense of profit in the sum only approximately equal to wear. Within domestic scientific thought, two main schools adhering to various opinions were allocated. For elaboration of uniform approach during the Soviet period in accounting there were accounts "Sinking fund", "Depreciation of fixed assets" that allowed to track a special-purpose character of use of a sinking fund.

An analysis of available studies and statistics was complemented with research and interviews carried out by experts based in countries under study.

There are clearly a number of obstacles to international comparisons, factors whose distorting influence can only be assessed and controlled {{on the basis of}} detailed knowledge of the units of comparison (supply areas, municipalities, regions, states). Prominent among these are different tariff structures with fixed and variable components, the allocation of costs for new connections, accounting and invoicing procedures, taxes and <b>charges,</b> <b>depreciation</b> of assets and the fiscal and liquidity effects, provisions and reserves, subsidies and cross-subsidies as well as differences in the quality of services rendered. Plausible as the relevance of these factors for international comparisons of water prices may be, data and information which would meet the requirements of a systematic comparison of costs and prices of water supply services are nevertheless not currently available in the Member States investigated. Through this project, a number of shortcomings in existing international comparisons of water prices were revealed and recommendations were reached on possible improvements of such comparisons.
