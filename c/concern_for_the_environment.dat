5|$|Prince Sadruddin had a {{taste for}} culture, {{including}} music, art and literature. He was a familiar figure at music festivals and other cultural events, both in Europe and overseas. His <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> was complemented by his enjoyment of the outdoors; he was a keen skier and an accomplished sailor. While still at Harvard in 1953, Prince Sadruddin became the founding publisher of the Paris Review, which was established {{with the aim of}} bringing original creative work to the fore. Every year the Review awards the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction (established by his father) for the best short story that it published in the past year.|$|E

25|$|Parrish's <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> {{dates back}} to the 1950s when Los Angeles’ severe smog, and the reason for it, worried her. In 1979, she and her then-husband, Richard Bach, built an {{experimental}} home in southwest Oregon using 100% solar power - no cooling or heating systems ― only solar power to prove it could be done.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} was {{undertaken}} with careful <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> including monitoring by specialized consultants, since the region has a rich archeological heritage. Among the hundreds of caverns in the region, the one at Lapa Vermelha stands out. Located 2.7km (1.6mi) from the airport, the oldest female cranium in the Americans was discovered there, dated at roughly 12 thousand years old. Confins is certified by the ISO 9001 standard, covering ten processes in the administrative, operational, safety/security and maintenance areas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Concerns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> have {{prompted}} <b>the</b> formation of green parties, political parties {{that seek to}} address environmental issues. Initially these were formed in Australia, New Zealand and Germany but are now present in many other countries.|$|R

50|$|The report {{concludes that}} there are no <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> or human health. There is no need for further testing or risk {{reduction}} measures beyond those currently practiced. LAB was therefore de-classified and was removed from Annex 1 in the 28th ATP (Directive 2001/59).|$|R
25|$|Motorized {{bicycles}} using {{electric motors}} have also re-entered the market. Electrically powered bicycles use batteries, {{which have a}} limited capacity and thus a limited range, particularly when large amounts of power are utilized. This design limitation means {{that the use of}} the electric motor as an assist to pedal propulsion is more emphasized than is the case with an internal combustion engine. While costly, new types of lithium batteries along with electronic controls now offer users increased power and range while reducing overall weight. Newer electric motor bicycle designs are gaining increasing acceptance, particularly in countries where increasing traffic congestion, aging populations, and <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> have stimulated development and usage.|$|E
25|$|Larger mammals include {{carnivores}} pumas, jaguars, ocelots, rare bush dogs, and foxes, and herbivores peccaries, tapirs, anteaters, sloths, opossums, and armadillos. Deer {{are plentiful}} in the south, and {{many species of}} New World monkeys {{are found in the}} northern rain forests. <b>Concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> has grown in response to global interest in environmental issues. Brazil's Amazon Basin is home to an extremely diverse array of fish species, including the red-bellied piranha. Despite its reputation as a ferocious freshwater fish, the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger. Biodiversity can contribute to agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries extraction. However, almost all economically exploited species of plants, such as soybeans and coffee, or animals, such as chickens, are imported from other countries, and the economic use of native species still crawls. In the Brazilian GDP, the forest sector represents just over 1% and fishing 0.4%.|$|E

2500|$|Stockholm {{is one of}} {{the cleanest}} capitals in the world. The city was granted the 2010 European Green Capital Award by the EU Commission; this was Europe's first [...] "green capital". Applicant cities were {{evaluated}} in several ways: climate change, local transport, public green areas, air quality, noise, waste, water consumption, waste water treatment, sustainable utilisation of land, biodiversity and environmental management. Out of 35 participant cities, eight finalists were chosen: Stockholm, Amsterdam, Bristol, Copenhagen, Freiburg, Hamburg, Münster, and Oslo. Some of the reasons why Stockholm won the 2010 European Green Capital Award were: its integrated administrative system, which ensures that environmental aspects are considered in budgets, operational planning, reporting, and monitoring; its cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 25% per capita in ten years; and its decision towards being fossil fuel free by 2050. Stockholm has long demonstrated <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> The city's current environmental program is the fifth since the first one was established in the mid-1970s. In 2011, Stockholm passed the title of European Green Capital to Hamburg, Germany.|$|E

30|$|Since {{the white}} grub larvae are subterranean, the damage {{prediction}} {{is difficult and}} their management has always been problematic. The control of white grub larvae in India mainly depends on application of chemical insecticides. However, the control efficacy was not satisfactory because of quick development of insecticide resistance. With more <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and human safety, environmentally friendly control strategies for L. lepidophora control are urgently needed to replace the highly toxic chemical pesticides.|$|R

2500|$|Following the 1987 federal election, Richardson was {{appointed}} Minister for the Environment and the Arts, {{a position in}} the outer ministry in the Third Hawke Ministry. In January 1988, he was elevated to cabinet and took on the additional responsibilities of Sport, Tourism and Territories. As the Hawke government sought to claim the 'green agenda' against the growing influence of the Australian Greens and the Wilderness Society, Richardson's period as Environment Minister was notable for the Federal Government intervening in Tasmanian state planning issues and blocking the Wesley Vale pulp mill. As Minister for the Environment, Richardson also advocated for and was successful in inscribing the Daintree Rainforest and surrounding areas on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1988, and a protected status for Kakadu National Park, prior to inscribing Stage 2 of Kakadu NP on the World Heritage List in 1987. Some media commentators speculated that Richardson's motives for these moves were driven, not by a <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> and heritage of the lands, but by purely political motives: ...|$|E
2500|$|Authors at Spirou {{could only}} {{go so far}} in expressing {{anything}} resembling politics within the magazine, and so the author of Gaston generally stuck to a gentle satire of productivity and authority. [...] However, the pacifism and <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> that formed the basis of Franquin's politics and would be expressed much more bluntly in Idées noires were already surfacing in Gaston (and Spirou et Fantasio). [...] Very occasionally, Franquin stepped over the mark, as in an uncharacteristically angry strip where Gaston uses a toy Messerschmitt plane to strafe the whole office in protest at their (real life) appearance in the magazine's modelling column (while building the model, he says: “… and now, the swastikas. They are very popular amongst retards”). [...] Outside of Spirou however, Franquin had a free rein, and used Gaston in promotional material for diverse organisations such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In the former, activists scare whales away from whalers by plucking the dreaded gaffophone. [...] For the latter, Franquin produced a gut-wrenching sequence where Gaston is beaten and tortured and forced to watch M'oiselle Jeanne raped in front of him, before being sent to a prison camp. In the penultimate frame he faces capital punishment which the punters hope [...] "serves as an example". Awaking in a sweat, Gaston shouts at the reader that [...] "although this was a nightmare, it's happening right now around the world", urging membership.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs {{a result}} of the global fuel crisis of the early 1970 s, coupled with <b>concerns</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> <b>the</b> use of biofuel has been on the {{increase}} in many regions throughout the world. At present, a total of approximately 30 billion (30 × 109) liters of biofuel are utilized worldwide annually, although most countries rely hugely on the first generation biofuel. The limitations of the first and second generation biofuel gave rise to current interest in algae as a promising alternative to these conventional biofuel sources. Algal biomass could provide a lion׳s share of the global transport fuel requirements in future. The present review highlights some important developments in, and potentials of algaculture as a major biomass resource of the future. However, the major constraint to commercial-scale algae farming for energy production is the cost factor, which must be addressed adequately before its potentials can be harnessed...|$|R
