5|$|As a Postelsia alga grows, its stipe thickens in {{the same}} manner as a tree's trunk. The cells beneath the epidermis, called the meristoderm, divide rapidly to form rings of growth, again, like a tree. However, the greater {{flexibility}} of Postelsia stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences. Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself. However, the stipe is very much more suited to the <b>coastal</b> <b>habitat,</b> as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action. Such an environment would cause the inflexible, woody tree to break.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Jurassic, Europe was a dry, {{tropical}} archipelago {{at the edge}} of the Tethys Sea. The fine limestone in which the skeletons of Compsognathus have been found originated in calcite from the shells of marine organisms. Both the German and French areas where Compsognathus specimens have been preserved were lagoons situated between the beaches and coral reefs of the Jurassic European islands in the Tethys Sea. Contemporaries of Compsognathus longipes include the early avialan Archaeopteryx lithographica and the pterosaurs Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Pterodactylus antiquus. The same sediments in which Compsognathus have been preserved also contain fossils of a number of marine animals such as fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and marine mollusks, confirming the <b>coastal</b> <b>habitat</b> of this theropod. No other dinosaur has been found in association with Compsognathus, indicating that these little dinosaurs might in fact have been the top land predator in these islands.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that magma, {{in the form of}} flood basalt, poured onto the surface in what is now called the Siberian Traps, for thousands of years, contributing to the environmental stress that led to mass extinction. The reduced <b>coastal</b> <b>habitat</b> and highly increased aridity probably also contributed. Based on the amount of lava estimated to have been produced during this period, the worst-case scenario is the release of enough carbon dioxide from the eruptions to raise world temperatures five degrees Celsius.|$|E
500|$|Horner {{thought he}} had found the {{mechanism}} driving this evolution, elaborating on ideas he had developed even before he had investigated Landslide Butte. The animals were living on a narrow strip on the east-coast of Laramidia, bordering the Western Interior Seaway and constrained in the west by the [...] high proto-Rocky Mountains. During the Bearpaw Transgression sea levels were rising, steadily reducing the width of their <b>coastal</b> <b>habitat</b> from about [...] This led to stronger selection pressures, the severest for Achelousaurus that lived during the phase that the coastal strip was at its narrowest. The lower number of individuals that the smaller habitat could have sustained constituted a population bottleneck, making rapid evolution possible. Increased sexual selection would have induced changes in the sexual ornamentation such as spikes, horns and bosses. A reduced environmental stress by lower sea levels on the other hand, would be typified by adaptive radiation. That sexual selection had indeed been the main mechanism would be proven by the fact that young individuals of all three populations were very similar: they all had two frill spikes, a small nasal horn pointing to the front, and orbital horns in the form of slightly elevated knobs. Only in the adult phase did they begin to differ. According to Horner, this also showed that the populations were very closely related.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> are {{diverse and}} vary {{in the extent}} to which they are shaped by physiographic processes, such as wave action, wind, tides and {{sediment}} availability, and the relative influence of terrestrial and marine environments, e. g. tidal inundation versus groundwater levels. Coastal systems usually comprise mosaics of habitats that are functionally interdependent: for instance, saltmarsh may form behind a barrier island or shingle ridge that itself may also support a dune system; or estuaries may include a range of habitats that ultimately depend on sediment supply from the catchment and the mixing of fresh and saline waters. Coastal grazing marsh is a man-made, largely freshwater habitat, occurring landward of intertidal and <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> and protected from them by natural or man-made structures. Whilst grazing marsh and other <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> are not strictly functionally interdependent, there are significant conflicts between protecting grazing marsh and allowing landward movement of <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats...</b>|$|R

[...] In 1998 this plant was designated as an endangered species by the United States government, the major threat to its survival being continuing land development from an expanding human population and associated habitat loss.

2500|$|Behaviors of {{hatchlings}} {{differ from}} that of adults. [...] After a hatchling emerges from the sand, it immediately goes out to sea. Hatchlings use {{the light of the}} night sky to find their way into the ocean. However, in many areas with coastal development, the hatchlings become confused from false light and sometimes move in the wrong direction to their deaths; this is not as much of a problem for Galápagos green turtles due to lack of development in the islands. Importantly, the hatchlings emerge at night to be protected from predators. They quickly move out to sea and swim for up to 24 hours to be far removed from shore and the predators in that area. They spend many years in the open ocean before entering the <b>coastal</b> <b>habitat</b> for the maturation period as juveniles. [...] This period of maturation lasts from 10 to 20 years; black sea turtles usually spend time along the coasts of the Baja California peninsula and the connecting bays, lagoons, and channels that provide excellent forage and protection.|$|E

40|$|To {{quantify}} the ecological effects of predator populations, {{it is important}} to evaluate how population-level specializations are dictated by intra- versus inter-individual dietary variation. <b>Coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> contain prey from the terrestrial biome, the marine biome and prey confined to the <b>coastal</b> region. Such <b>habitats</b> have therefore been suggested to better support predator populations compared to <b>habitats</b> without <b>coastal</b> access. We used stable isotope data on a small generalist predator, the arctic fox, to infer dietary strategies between adult and juvenile individuals with and without coastal access on Iceland. Our results suggest that foxes in <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> exhibited a broader isotope niche breadth compared to foxes in inland habitats. This broader niche was related to a greater diversity of individual strategies rather than to a uniform increase in individual niche breadth or by individuals retaining their specialization but increasing their niche differentiation. Juveniles in <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> exhibited a narrower isotope niche breadth compared to both adults and juveniles in inland habitats, and juveniles in inland habitats inhabited a lower proportion of their total isotope niche compared to adults and juveniles from <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats.</b> Juveniles in both habitats exhibited lower intra-individual variation compared to adults. Based on these results, we suggest that foxes in both habitats were highly selective with respect to the resources they used to feed offspring, but that foxes in <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> preferentially utilized marine resources for this purpose. We stress that <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> should be regarded as high priority areas for conservation of generalist predators as they appear to offer a wide variety of dietary options that allow for greater flexibility in dietary strategies.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of organic material from one coastal environment to another can increase production in recipient habitats {{in a process}} known as spatial subsidy. Microorganisms drive the generation, transformation, and uptake of organic material in shallow coastal environments, but their significance in connecting <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> through spatial subsidies has received limited attention. We address this by presenting a conceptual model of coastal connectivity that focuses on the flow of microbially mediated organic material in key <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats.</b> Our model suggests {{that it is not the}} difference in generation rates of organic material between <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> but the amount of organic material assimilated into microbial biomass and respiration that determines the amount of material that can be exported from one coastal environment to another. Further, the flow of organic material across <b>coastal</b> <b>habitats</b> is sensitive to environmental change as this can alter microbial remineralization and respiration rates. Our model highlights microorganisms as an integral part of coastal connectivity and emphasizes the importance of including a microbial perspective in coastal connectivity studies. © 2016 The Authors.
