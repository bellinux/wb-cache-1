Honda revised the vehicle's name from NS-X to NSX before final production and sale. The NSX went on sale in Japan in 1990 at Honda Verno dealership sales channels, supplanting the Honda Prelude as the flagship model. The NSX was sold under Honda's flagship Acura luxury brand starting in November 1990 in North America and Hong Kong.Upon its official release, the NSX design concept showcased Honda's technology, and measured only 1170 mm in height, making it only 141.3 mm taller than the Ford GT40, an extreme GT racing car designed and funded solely to win at LeMans. The Japanese car maker's race track innovations and competitive history were further exemplified on the road by the NSX's ultra-rigid, ultra-light all aluminium monocoque chassis and front and rear double wishbone suspension, with forged control arms connected to forged alloy wheels. The car additionally boasted the world's first {{production car}} engine with titanium connecting rods, forged pistons, and ultra high-revving capabilities - the redline was at a lofty 8,300 rpm - all traits usually associated with track and race engineered motor cars. The NSX exterior had a dedicated 23-step paint process, including an aircraft type <b>chromate</b> <b>coating</b> designed for chemically protecting the aluminium bodywork and a waterborne paint for the base coat to achieve a clearer, more vivid top color and a smoother surface finish.|$|E

40|$|The anti-corrosion {{properties}} {{of a novel}} double strand conductive polymer coating on aluminum alloys in salt environments as a possible replacement for chromium conversion coatings was investigated. The conductive coating consisted of a double helix backbone structure of polyaniline wrapped with an esterified polyacrylic acid strand. This polymer complex offers advantages over other conductive polymer systems in material stability and processability. The polymer is soluble in single organic solvents and was sprayed onto square AA 7075 -T 6 and AA 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy samples. ^ The coatings were investigated for corrosion protection properties using cyclic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and long term exposure in aggressive salt environments. The polymer coated samples were tested against two commercial chromate conversion coatings and uncoated alloy samples. The cyclic polarization tests show a two order of magnitude lowering of the corrosion current over the uncoated samples, a one order of magnitude lowering of I corr over {{the second type of}} <b>chromate</b> <b>coating</b> and a one order of magnitude higher I corr over the first type of <b>chromate</b> <b>coating.</b> Impedance results show a two order of magnitude higher impedance at low frequencies over the uncoated and equivalent performance for both types of chromate coatings. ^ EIS and cyclic polarization tests of the conductive state (green colored) versus a non-conductive state (blue colored) of the polymer coating shows that the electrically conductive state is more effective than the insulating state for corrosion protection. This data indicates that the electro-active nature of the polymer coating plays a role in the protection of the alloys. After two months exposure in a. 5 N NaCl solution, {{there is no evidence of}} pitting at the alloy surface for the polymer coated samples under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, indicating a change in the typical corrosion mechanism for aluminum alloys. ^ The molecular structure of the polymer coating may offer the ability to chelate with the aluminum oxide layer, the metal layer or reaction products.

Corrosion resistance of the prepared coatings were compared by immersion tests and by potentiodynamic methods.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In recent years, the suspected carcinogenic and toxic effects of hexavalent chromium have caused great concern, resulting in the imposition of stringent environmental and workplace regulations in the metal finishing industry. This has lead {{to the search for}} suitable alternatives to the chromate formulations. In this investigation molybdate, cerium and permanganate-based solutions have been examined as to their suitability as possible replacements for chromate conversion coatings on zinc-alloy electrodeposits. Investigations have primarily concentrated on producing passive surfaces from molybdate-based immersion processes. The novel conversion coatings have been examined using scanning electron microscopy to elucidate the coating morphologies. Analysis of the molybdate-based coatings has been undertaken to characterise and determine the composition using molybdenum K-edge EXAFS (extended X -ray absorption fine structure) studies. The corrosion behaviours of the treated surfaces have been assessed using neutral salt spray (fog) corrosion tests and electrochemical methods utilising the linear polarisation technique. Findings indicate that simple molybdate, cerium and permanganate-basecdo ating treatments only achieve, at best, corrosion protection by means of a barrier effect, as a result hindering the dissolution processes, thus providing modest improvements to the formation of white and red corrosion products compared with the 'as-plated' zinc-alloy deposits. However, certain molybdate-based treatments, utilising a permolybdate species, appeared to possess additional corrosion resistant behaviours, possibly associated with an inhibition or retarding of the cathodic reactions. Consequently, superior corrosion performances were apparent for a number of the permolybdate coatings in comparison with the simple molybdate treatments, achieving performance characteristics more comparable to a <b>chromate</b> <b>coating,</b> although still at a reduced level of protection. Specific permolybdate coatings were deemed to be capable of providing enhanced corrosion performances, other than by acting solely as barriers to corrosion...|$|E

40|$|Chromate {{conversion}} coatings {{have been}} the most widely used technique to enhance the corrosion resistance of aluminum alloys. However, concerns over the highly toxic and carcinogenic nature of the hexavalent chromium ion have cast serious doubts on the future use of these coatings. The Department of Defense and industry {{is in the process of}} attempting to replace chromates, but has yet to find an alternative as inexpensive, easy to use, and most importantly as effective as chromates. ^ A potential replacement for <b>chromate</b> <b>coating</b> is a coating based on the titanate ion. Elemental titanium possesses a number of similarities to elemental chromium in that both have multiple valence states, good passive layer formation, and a low passivation potential; making it an ideal candidate for the titanate ion to replace the chromate ion. The similarity in the passive regions for chromium and titanium can be seen in their Pourbaix diagrams. For a different aluminum alloy, 2024 -T 3, titanate replacement of chromate has been shown to be effective. ^ This process has failed to be applied successfully to Al 6061 -T 6 and Al 7075 -T 6 in previous attempts. The main cause suspected for coating failure was the formation of fluoride precipitates. In an attempt to address the precipitation problem a post conversion treatment was added and the influence of rinse duration after conversion coating was examined. ^ For this study, on Al 6061 -T 6 successful coatings could be applied with the introducing of a post treatment step which not only imparted titanium on the surface but also significantly thickened the aluminum oxide layer. Whether this coating can be considered a conversion coating or a sealed anodized coating is unclear at present, however it is clear that the coating provides long duration protection from salt water and also includes a mechanism which allows for continued reactivity. The most likely cause for this reactivity is inclusion of titanate in the coating. Attempts to coat Al 7075 -T 6 were not successful and it is most likely due to cracking of the coatings formed. ...|$|E

The trivalent chromium films formed on 7075 -T 6 or 2024 -T 3 aluminum, when tested in 5 -percent NaCl salt spray, provided corrosion resistance {{in excess of}} 96 hr. When a post-treatment of peroxide or permanganate solution was applied, corrosion resistance for both alloys almost reached 336 hr and sometimes exceeded this value. In most cases, only a 10 -min immersion was necessary at 25 "C to obtain a corrosion-resistant film. Trivalentchromium-treated aluminum served as an effective base for an epoxy paint primer. Anodized aluminum was afforded excellent corrosion resistance, comparable to dichromate, by sealing in dilute basic chromic sulfate solution and post-treated with peroxide.

In this paper, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used in combination with other techniques to investigate the role played by the pH of the chromate bath on the properties of the chromate film formed on Alclad 2024 aluminium alloy.
