5000|$|In {{other common}} law legal systems, recharacterisation usually {{refers to the}} risk that a title {{transfer}} arrangement could be treated instead as the grant of a security interest. If a transaction is recharacterised in this manner, {{there is a risk}} that the transaction may be void if it has not been registered under applicable registration laws. The title transfer arrangements that are perceived to be vulnerable to recharacterisation are transfers of margin (such as a title transfer under an English Law ISDA Credit Support Annex as collateral for a derivatives transaction), or transactions which involved an actual transfer of securities backed by cash (such a stock loan or repo transaction). Retention of title clauses may also sometimes be recharacterized in this manner. Security interests which are expressed as fixed charges are sometimes recharacterised as floating charges. However, in most common law systems, there is a resistance to recharacterisation transactions of this nature, and the law generally provides that the parties own characterisation of the transaction should be applied unless there are strong <b>countervailing</b> <b>reasons</b> to recharacterise.|$|E
40|$|For {{many women}} {{experiencing}} motherhood {{for the first}} time, the message they receive is clear: mothers who do not breastfeed ought to have good reasons not to; bottle feeding by choice is a failure of maternal duty. We argue that this pressure to breastfeed arises in part from two misconceptions about maternal duty: confusion about {{the scope of the}} duty to benefit and conflation between moral reasons and duties. While mothers have a general duty to benefit, we argue that this does not imply a duty to carry out any particular beneficent act. Therefore, the expectation that mothers should breastfeed unless they have sufficient <b>countervailing</b> <b>reasons</b> not to is morally unwarranted. Recognising the difference between reasons and duties can allow us to discuss the benefits of breastfeeding and the importance of supporting mothers who wish to breastfeed without subjecting mothers who bottle feed to guilt, blame and failure...|$|E

It may be easy to bring to mind a handful of prominent collaborations, but most law review articles seem to be written by one author (notwithstanding their lengthy acknowledgment footnotes, suggesting that even single-author works are shaped by the insights and input of multiple scholars). And while it is true that legal scholars often collaborate on their practically oriented works, scholarly articles might not be well suited to collaboration...|$|R
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explore the {{possibility}} that a selective deportation of a same-gender partner who has overstayed her visa constitutes an outrageous case under the AADC test. Its modest goal is to discourage the INS from ever pursuing such a strategy, knowing that there are probably many who believe that same-gender overstays, even if civilly united in Vermont, are not the ideal candidates for 2 ̆ 2 suspect class 2 ̆ 2 status under U. S. constitutional law. That notwithstanding, common sense and sound doctrine suggest that, despite the many anti-gay and anti-immigrant decisions handed down over the last twenty years, the Court will not hesitate to halt egregious government conduct when the plaintiff is being deprived of equal rights and there is no legitimate <b>countervailing</b> <b>reason</b> to justify the discrimination. In the hypothetical mass deportation of same-gender overstays, this Article applies such an approach while breathing life into the as-yet-unidentified 2 ̆ 2 outrageous 2 ̆ 2 exception test created by the AADC Court...|$|R

It will turn out that (1) under most circumstances ethical but upsetting geoscience research is morally permissible, (2) revising this research in response to upset-induced external interference is morally impermissible in the absence of strong <b>countervailing</b> pragmatic <b>reasons</b> and attempts to reduce upset, and (3) potentially upsetting geoscience research ought to be communicated truthfully and tailored to each individual situation. These general propositions are applied to a case of ethical but upsetting research that we ourselves are currently involved...|$|R
40|$|Individuals {{are at risk}} of {{acquiring}} untreatable agents of infection when they travel to countries where antibiotic-resistant agents of infection are prevalent, and particularly when they travel for healthcare. Uncertainty with respect to the overall political and economic consequences seems to underlie the reluctance of public health authorities to issue relevant travel advisories. The conditions of choice, the act of choice and the consequences of choice can each be a primary focus of ethical appraisal of public health policy. The ‘value of choice ’ account provided by Scanlon draws attention to the value of the choices that individuals are given, and the potential for reasonable rejection of policies that do not give adequate emphasis to the conditions of individual choice. There is both instrumental and symbolic value in informing people of the risk of acquisition of antibiotic-resistant microbes associated with health tourism. We cannot reasonably reject a principle of actively informing unless there are insurmountable <b>countervailing</b> <b>reasons.</b> These reasons should be explicit and subject to review. If health tourism is a concern then we might also consider how best to facilitate alternative choices...|$|E
40|$|Many {{critics of}} bioenhancement go to {{considerable}} lengths {{to establish the}} existence of reasons against pursuing bioenhancements but do little to establish the absence of reasons in favor. This suggests that they accept what Allen Buchanan has called the conclusive reasons view (CRV). According to this view, our reasons against bioenhancement are obviously decisive, {{so there is no}} need to balance them against <b>countervailing</b> <b>reasons.</b> Buchanan criticizes the CRV by showing that the reasons most commonly adduced against bioenhancement are not decisive, or, at least, not obviously so. In this article, I suggest that both Buchanan and the authors to whom he is responding underestimate the strength of the case for the CRV. There are, I argue, harm-based reasons against bioenhancement that provide stronger support to the CRV than the reasons that have most often been adduced by critics of enhancement. However, I then argue that even these harm-based reasons are not obviously decisive. Thus, I ultimately agree with Buchanan about the falsity of the CRV, though I disagree with him about the reasons for its falsity. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2014.

40|$|In {{the article}} {{it is argued}} that, {{contrary}} to what prominent animal law scholars such as Gary Francione claim, we have decided to criminalize harm to animals primarily because {{we are concerned about}} the wellbeing of such creatures, not because doing so furthers some other human interest. I do so in four parts. Part I provides a brief historical analysis of animal cruelty laws that will show that, although many of these statutes were originally enacted as a way to protect private property, there has been a marked trend, specially in recent times, to punish animal cruelty regardless, and sometimes despite, the property interests involved. In Part II, the notions of harm, victimhood and consent will be explored in order {{to lay the groundwork for}} the claims that will be put forth in the remainder of the article. In light of the issues that animal cruelty statutes raise, particular attention will be paid to discussing John Stuart Mill’s and H. L. A. Hart’s conception of the “harm principle”. Part III examines five different theories that might be advanced in order to explain the interest that we seek to promote by punishing acts that are harmful to animals, namely: (1) protection of property, (2) protection against the infliction of emotional harm to those who have ties to the injured animal, (3) prevention of future harm to humans, (4) enforcement of a moral principle, and (5) protection of the animals themselves. In Part IV, I will try to explain why it is not necessarily the case, as many animal law scholars have argued, that because animal cruelty statutes allow for the infliction of harm to animals as a result of hunting, scientific and farming activities, the interest primarily sought to be protected by these laws is something other than the protection of animals. This argument is ultimately flawed because it is premised on a misunderstanding of the structure of criminal offenses in general and of anti-cruelty statutes in particular. Properly understood, the existence of privileges that allow people to infringe the prima facie norm against harming animals merely reveals that society (rightly or wrongly) believes that there are <b>countervailing</b> <b>reasons</b> that justify harming the interest sought to be protected by the offense, not that the prohibitory norm was not really designed to protect animals in the first place...|$|E
40|$|Economists {{typically}} {{are concerned with}} a price that equates supply and demand, {{but in many cases}} the price is below the market-clearing level and excess demand queued. Although it is sometimes difficult to measure excess demand in real market, we can infer excess demand when we have difficulty in making reservations for well-known restaurants or best plays. ^ Specifically, it is an interesting economic puzzle that carmakers accept excess demand often during the initial periods when new cars were introduced. In face of uncertain demand, carmakers have an incentive to specify relatively a high, not low inventory level during the initial periods. The reason is that the leftover inventory conveys information about an uncertain demand function and increases the informativeness of the inventory signals for newly introduced cars. Typical studies on inventory are also emphasizing that the firm has inclination to hold a relatively high inventory when the firm is facing high uncertainty in the market. Therefore, from the view of typical inventory theory, {{there is no reason for}} carmakers to hold relatively low inventories during the initial periods when demand uncertainty is relatively high. ^ This thesis introduces a <b>countervailing</b> <b>reason</b> for an initial relatively low inventory that depends on a consumption externality among consumers. We assume that consumers make their quality inference in part on the basis of past excess demand for the good. For example, often consumers are aware of the difficulty of making reservations or queues at well-known restaurants, long waiting list to take delivery of some cars, and long lines to enter the best plays. In such cases, they infer high quality. Thus, excess demand in the previous period can influence subsequent potential buyers 2 ̆ 7 purchasing behavior. It is then rational for a firm introducing a new product to adjust its initial production and price to increase the likelihood of excess demand in an attempt to influence potential consumers 2 ̆ 7 perception of quality and thus subsequent demand. We formally develop a model that demonstrates this result in the context of a market with demand and quality uncertainty. The model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions are tested using an extensive data set of inventories and sales for new luxury and sports cars over the past 15 years. The empirical results are consistent with the theory. ...|$|R
