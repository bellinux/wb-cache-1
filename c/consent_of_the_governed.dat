Locke advanced the principle of <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed</b> in his Two Treatises of Government. Government's duty under a social contract among the sovereign people was to serve the people by protecting their rights. These basic rights were life, liberty and property.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{there has}} never been a {{national}} political party called the Conservative Party.

Political divisions inside the United States often seemed minor or trivial to Europeans, where the divide between the Left and the Right led to violent polarization, starting with the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} custom {{to become a}} source of law, it must be {{approved}} by the competent legislator. Custom in canon law is not simply created by the people through their constant performance of a certain act, but it is the constant performance of a certain act, with the intention of making a custom, which is approved by the competent legislator, thereby acquiring the force of law. This is because of the Catholic ecclesiological teaching on the constitution of the Catholic Church, which states that Christ constituted the Church by divine delegation of power to the hierarchical authorities; the Church was not created by the <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed,</b> but by the direct will of Christ.|$|E

Creditors could not seize a wife's property to pay a husband's debts. Leading up to the passage of this law, in 1846, supporters issued a pamphlet, probably authored by Judge John Fine, which relied on its readers' familiarity with the United States Declaration of Independence to demand [...] "That all are created free and equal...", and that this idea should apply equally to the sexes. [...] "Women, as well as men, are entitled to the full enjoyment of its practical blessings". A group of 44married women of western New York wrote to the Assembly in March 1848, saying [...] "your Declaration of Independence declares, that governments derive their just powers from the <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed.</b> And as women have never consented to, been represented in, or recognized by this government, it is evident that in justice no allegiance can be claimed from them...

5000|$|The Ngoni {{had settled}} in {{northern}} Nyasaland in the early 1850s and brought the local peoples under their control. From the late 1870s, the Ngoni there had contact with Free Church of Scotland missionaries. Robert Laws first met the Ngoni Chief Mbelwa (referred to as Mombera in early writings) in 1879, and in 1881 he established Livingstonia Mission at Bandawe in <b>the</b> northwestern <b>of</b> Lake Nyasa. Over a period of years, Laws persuaded the Ngoni leader to cease raiding and the missionaries established themselves in his kingdom as educators and arbitrators in disputes. In 1885, a mission school was opened at Ekwendeni in <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> Ngoniland. By 1899, there were favourable signs that the Ngoni were ready to come under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protectorate administration. Dr. Laws advised Sharpe to be cautious and to manage <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> power with tact and dignity. Sharpe agreed to leave <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> imposition of administrative control to Laws: in 1904, after a severe famine in 1903, the time seemed right. At a ceremony at Ekwendeni in October 1904, the Ngoni leaders agreed to submit themselves to British rule, to accept a resident administrator and to pay taxes from 1906. However, Sharpe allowed the Ngoni a measure of self-government under a paramount chief, and this continued for several years after his departure. Sharpe's agreement with Mbelwa in 1904 showed that he now accepted that <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people <b>governed</b> could not be ignored. Before Sharpe extended the Hut tax to Mbelwa’s kingdom, he noted that almost no Ngoni from that area went to the Shire Highlands as seasonal workers, but after many went {{not only to the}} Shire Highlands, but also to Rhodesia and even South Africa. At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Sharpe was made a Companion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bath (CB) and in 1903 was created a Knight Commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order <b>of</b> St Michael and St George (K.C.M.G).

40|$|A central tenet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social {{contract}} {{is the individual}} 2 ̆ 7 s obligation to eschew force (with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> an inalienable right to self-defence) in return for collective security, with the state holding a monopoly on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> force. After centuries of repression and violent conflict 18 th century Enlightenment values sought to fundamentally recast the {{social contract}} and redress the power imbalance {{between the individual and}} the state. Given the preceding history the state was largely perceived as a malevolent force that acted for narrow interests against the common good. Enlightenment values asserted <b>the</b> pre-eminence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free, autonomous and self-reliant individual, with the secular state deriving its power/authority/legitimacy through <b>the</b> willing <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> those <b>governed.</b> <b>The</b> question <b>of</b> an appropriate balance between individual rights and social obligations remains a universal quandary. Does a culture that emphasises individual autonomy and self-reliance impact on the broader commitment to a peaceful and harmonious society? Does a libertarian culture inevitably engender some level <b>of</b> mistrust in <b>the</b> state and an associated lack of confidence in collective security? Where self-reliance extends to individual responsibility for personal safety (by providing the individual with the means and authority to resort to force), what are the implications for {{the nature and extent of}} interpersonal violence? For many years the United States has defined itself as an exceptional culturally advanced society that stands as a bastion for liberty against repressive foreign forces. Upholding the citizen 2 ̆ 7 s "natural" right to self-defence by enshrining a right to keep and bear arms in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is an integral part of this culture. For the same reasons the United States asserts an absolute right to take pre-emptive military action internationally against foreign adversaries in pursuit of its own self-defence. Domestically there is obvious dissonance between this self-image and <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> extraordinary levels of interpersonal violence, political polarisation, social alienation and economic inequity. These complex issues are bought into sharp contrast when we try to comprehend why American citizens regularly resort to indiscriminate large-scale violence against innocent civilians (such as mass shootings and occasional bombings). Is it simply because citizens have relatively unrestricted access to the means to effectively undertake such violence, or are there deeper issues about <b>the</b> real level <b>of</b> community commitment to a civilised society...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{mid-nineteenth century}} demands for greater colonial autonomy {{in the eastern}} Australian colonies and Cape of Good Hope (Cape Colony), in southern Africa, and how this was expressed through popular politics against convict transportation. It considers shifting conceptions of accountable governance and British loyalism expressed in public meetings, the press, petitions, pamphlets, election campaigns, and celebrations, and <b>the</b> methods <b>of</b> lobbying within <b>the</b> colonies and Britain to end convict transportation, and bring about settler self-government. Colonial opposition was stirred into action by an Order-In-Council of October 1848, passed at <b>the</b> instigation <b>of</b> Britain’s secretary for war and the colonies, the 3 rd Earl Grey, which designated the Cape Colony as a destination for ticket-of-leave convicts, and continued transportation to Van Diemen’s Land, and recommenced it to New South Wales. I argue that settler accusations of a ‘breach of faith’ by Earl Grey reveal not only a breakdown in trust in existing colonial governance, but also how the constitution was conceived as a fraternal pact <b>of</b> <b>consent,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>governing</b> structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family and male associationalism were writ large as the colonial state. This gave particular expression to concerns of emerging settler states soon to gain greater legislative autonomy through their own constitutions. I argue that anti-convict propaganda decrying convict depravity not only exhibited <b>the</b> persuasive power <b>of</b> abolitionist rhetoric, but also drew on vagrancy and <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> convict mobility across borders to advocate immigration restriction. I further contend that popular protest in mass meetings and boycotts exposed administrative difficulties faced by colonial governors in claiming legitimacy to govern, as well as anxieties over <b>the</b> rule <b>of</b> law; this was expressed in part in debates over mass movements as either threatening mobs, or as justifiable extra-parliamentary expressions of popular will. Although colonists took organisational cues from Chartists and the Anti-Corn Law League in Britain, I argue that <b>the</b> inclusive associationalism <b>of</b> various classes under <b>the</b> banner <b>of</b> popular constitutional loyalty to the British monarch was not merely tactical but also based on genuine affinities. The anti-convict movements in the Cape and Australian colonies saw <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> assertive settler patriotisms under the Crown that gave legitimacy to popular protest mediated through mass meetings and petitions. While these colonial patriotisms may have replaced <b>the</b> overt patronage <b>of</b> <b>governing</b> elites with emergent liberal politics, <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> settler capital undergirded settler self-government.

2500|$|While Locke {{spoke in}} the {{language}} of natural law, the content of this law was by and large protective of natural rights, and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred. Political philosopher Jeremy Waldron has pointed out that Locke's political thought was based on [...] "a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions." [...] To Locke, the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the Decalogue, Christ's teaching and exemplary life, and St. Paul's admonitions. Locke derived the concept of basic human equality, including the equality of the sexes ("Adam and Eve"), from , the starting-point of the theological doctrine of Imago Dei. One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free, governments need the <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>governed.</b> Thomas Jefferson, arguably echoing Locke, appealed to unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence, [...] "We hold these truths to be self-evident, {{that all men are created}} equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

These private rights were <b>of</b> various kinds. <b>The</b> actual cultivators or such of them as had been long settled on the land, had a right to retain possession; it was held unlawful to evict them while they paid the rent--a rent not in general fixed by agreement, but by <b>the</b> custom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood. Between the actual cultivators and the state, or the substitute to whom the state had transferred its rights, there were intermediate persons with rights of various extent. There were officers of government who collected <b>the</b> state's share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> produce, sometimes for large districts, who, though bound to pay over to government all they collected, after deducting a percentage, were often hereditary officers. There were also, in many cases village communities, consisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reputed descendants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first settlers <b>of</b> a village, who shared among themselves either the land or its produce according to rules established by custom, either cultivating it themselves or employing others to cultivate it for them, and whose rights in the land approached nearer to those of a landed proprietor, as understood in England, than those of any other party concerned. But <b>the</b> proprietary right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village was not individual, but collective; inalienable (<b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> individual sharers could only be sold or mortgaged with <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community) and <b>governed</b> by fixed rules. In mediæval Europe almost all land was held from the sovereign on tenure of service, either military or agricultural; and in Great Britain even now, when the services as well as all <b>the</b> reserved rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sovereign have long since fallen into disuse or been commuted for taxation, <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law does not acknowledge an absolute right of property in land in any individual; the fullest landed proprietor known to the law, the freeholder, is but a [...] "tenant" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crown. In Russia, even when <b>the</b> cultivators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil were serfs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landed proprietor, his proprietary right in the land was limited by rights of theirs belonging to them as a collective body managing its own affairs, and with which he could not interfere. And in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> countries <b>of</b> continental Europe when serfage was abolished or went out of use, those who had cultivated the land as serfs remained in possession of rights as well as subject to obligations. The great land reforms of Stein and his successors in Prussia consisted in abolishing both the rights and the obligations, and dividing the land bodily between the proprietor and <b>the</b> peasant, instead <b>of</b> leaving each of them with a limited right over the whole. In other cases, as in Tuscany, the metayer farmer is virtually co-proprietor with the landlord, since custom, though not law, guarantees to him a permanent possession and half the gross produce, so long as he fulfils <b>the</b> customary conditions <b>of</b> his tenure.|$|R
