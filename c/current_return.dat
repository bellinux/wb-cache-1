25|$|The key {{advantage}} of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because {{of the problems of}} return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by insulating the running rails from the <b>current</b> <b>return</b> should there be a leakage through the running rails.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s, {{the track}} and the rolling stock used on this line and the North London Line were changed to use a {{modified}} version of the BR standard third rail system, with the fourth rail (now bonded to the running rail used for returning traction current) left in place on the sections of line shared with LU Bakerloo line trains. North of Harrow & Wealdstone, now the limit of LU operation, the fourth rail has in most places been dropped onto the sleepers and remains bonded, thus leaving the resistance of the <b>current</b> <b>return</b> path unaltered. The fourth rail remains in the normal position from Queens Park to Kilburn High Road up platform, where a trailing crossover between those two stations is maintained in use to allow reversal of Bakerloo line trains unable to gain access to London Underground at Queens Park, due to planned work or other reasons. [...] The line is currently electrified (like all shared lines) using the standard compromise voltage of 660V.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in asset return modeling have shown evidence for time-variation {{not only in}} conditional variance, but also especially in conditional skewness and leverage effects. We develop a discrete time affine multifactor latent variable model of asset returns which allows for both stochastic volatility and stochastic skewness (SVS model). Importantly, we disentangle the dynamics of conditional volatility and conditional skewness in a coherent way. Our approach allows the distribution of <b>current</b> daily <b>returns</b> conditional on <b>current</b> volatility to be asymmetric. In our model, time-varying conditional skewness {{is driven by the}} conditional leverage effect and the asymmetry of the distribution of <b>current</b> <b>returns</b> conditional on <b>current</b> volatility. We derive analytical formulas for various moment conditions that we use for GMM inference. Applying our approach to several equity and index daily returns, we show that the conditional distribution of <b>current</b> daily <b>returns,</b> conditional on <b>current</b> volatility, is positively skewed and helps to match sample return skewness as well as negative cross-correlations between returns and squared returns. The conditional leverage effect is significant and negative.
