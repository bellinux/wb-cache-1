40|$|AbstractThis paper {{seeks to}} extend {{existing}} methods for decision making implementation {{in design and}} operation of global manufacturing networks, creating products in value added chains distributed over several manufacturing sites. The configuration of products, processes and resources in the network are subject of design decisions and is represented by <b>production</b> <b>master</b> data. Rapidly changing global market opportunities and competition force companies to continuously adapt their manufacturing network which causes increasing dependencies and complexity. Currently, design and decisions are carried out on a limited section of the production, which {{makes it impossible to}} consider dependencies in the network. This leads to risks in outcomes of decisions and to a suboptimal design for the manufacturing network as a whole. A solution to this problem can be found, when design and decisions are based on the overall manufacturing network. <b>Production</b> <b>master</b> data for <b>a</b> global manufacturing network is a challenge in terms of quantity and processing performance required. In this paper, an approach for applying Big Data techniques is described, highlighting the aspects of decision tasks, data access patterns, necessary data structures and handling of design scenarios. In case of manufacturing network design, Big Data enables overall system design, increasing validity of decisions, high performance and new analysis options for unexploited potential in the network. This approach is applicable to various decision processes within manufacturing concerning query, analysis and interaction with an overall manufacturing system...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{simultaneous}} {{measurements of}} CO 2 and CH 4 exchange in wetlands extending from subarctic peatlands to subtropical marshes, {{a positive correlation}} between CH 4 emission and net ecosystem production is reported. It is suggested that net ecosystem <b>production</b> is <b>a</b> <b>master</b> variable integrating many factors which control CH 4 emission in vegetated wetlands. It is found that about 3 percent of the daily net ecosystem production is emitted back to the atmosphere as CH 4. With projected stimulation of primary production and soil microbial activity in wetlands associated with elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration, the potential for increasing CH 4 emission from inundated wetlands, further enhancing the greenhouse effect, is examined...|$|R

Most prominent is the {{fabrication of}} miniaturized camera objectives for mobile phone applications done on wafer level. The required lens surfaces possess high sag and aspherical shape which leads to a challenging fabrication of the master stamp which consists of an array of identical convex or concave optical surfaces. We analyze the endurance of the stamp used in a step & repeat process for the fabrication of array-like structures used as master molds for UV-replication...|$|R
