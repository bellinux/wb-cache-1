5|$|Every finite {{group is}} {{isomorphic}} to a matrix group, as one <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{by considering the}} regular representation of the symmetric group. General groups can be studied using matrix groups, which are comparatively well understood, by means of representation theory.|$|E

5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> the Whole Room... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E

5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish <b>can</b> <b>see</b> ultraviolet and some <b>can</b> <b>see</b> polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum {{appears to be}} particularly important. Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.|$|E
5|$|First-person {{shooters}} are {{a type of}} three-dimensional shooter game, {{featuring a}} first-person point of view with which the player sees the action {{through the eyes of}} the player character.
