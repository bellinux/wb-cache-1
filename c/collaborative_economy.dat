5000|$|That joint {{statement}} of public policies for the <b>collaborative</b> <b>economy,</b> which integrates a Commons-oriented vision in such emerging paradigm, claimed that by privatizing {{certain aspects of}} the collaborative Commons model these companies created “severe inequalities and loss of rights”. The organization and participants at the event proposed the creation of favorable regulations for truly collaborative economic models, with measures like the funding of an incubator of new projects in the <b>collaborative</b> <b>economy,</b> including platform cooperativism, as well as the reassigning of public spaces for jointly managed working and manufacturing spaces. Embed in a wider framework of action research for the co-design of public policies, some of these policy proposals have been met with support by members of the Barcelona city government. Outputs from that process have resulted in specific measures like the incubation of new <b>collaborative</b> <b>economy</b> initiatives following a cooperativist model, or the possibility of new funding schemes for civic projects via transparent [...] "match-funding".|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : Knowledge-Based ServicesInternational audienceNowadays {{service sector}} is {{becoming}} more and more relevant in building successful <b>collaborative</b> <b>economies.</b> In this environment Virtual Enterprises (VEs) are forcing a change in the way traditional manufacturing systems are managed. Therefore measuring service performances plays an important role in turning company strategic goals into reality. Performance Indicators (PIs) consist in a supporting tool to assess service efficiency and effectiveness. Consequently, determining the most significant activities which need to be controlled and measured through proper PIs becomes essential. Within this paper, a PI Toolset is going to be presented and tested through industrial use case. The PI Toolset has been developed to support VEs in selecting significant activities, to manage governance processes and to support the design and implementation of specific PIs related to the precise use case objectives. Finally, a lesson learnt approach has been adopted so to stress strengths and weaknesses of both proposed methodology and tools...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the nature of {{internal}} diversity within liberal and <b>collaborative</b> market <b>economies.</b> Based on large scale comparative survey data, we assess the extent to which specific clusters of practices are associated with specific varieties of capitalism. Given that recent literature has pointed to internal diversity within specific national contexts, we explore the nature of internal diversity within both liberal and <b>collaborative</b> market <b>economies,</b> and what makes each variety of capitalism distinct. We find that more than one cluster of practices is indeed likely to be encountered in a particular national context, but that this diversity was bounded: {{only a limited number of}} alternative paradigms are likely to emerge and persist. The survey findings not only shed light on the nature of this internal diversity, but also reveal the fact that liberal and collaborative markets remain distinct, with the rights accruing to employees being more deeply embedded in a wide cross section of firms within the latter...|$|R

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] socio-economic crisis of 2008 persists in creating a need for structural change and radical transformation by applying systemic thinking and holistic approaches to design solutions. This paper presents {{a part of a}} PhD research that questions those limits with regards to economic failures of income distribution among social entrepreneurs in co-working spaces. The argument focuses on exploring the potential for introducing alternative solutions where design can cut across traditional models and lead to economic transformations through new service models. Complementary currency systems structurally diversify monetary eco-systems and act as a mechanism for territorial and social cohesion. Strategic design is summoned here to focus on a new currency through the development of an integrated and resilient service system, a model for activating idle capabilities of community members into innovative collaboration opportunities. On-field research encompassing interviews, survey and persona design methods have been conducted with members of the Impact HUB social business network. The analysis of existing collaborative service models serves as an enabling action platform for service innovation to take place, driven by bottom-up behaviour changes towards social innovation. This research sets the stage to open up possibilities for empowering professionals and capacity building approaches to be implemented in emerging <b>collaborative</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R

50|$|Some of the {{key issues}} the materiality-turn {{addresses}} relate to: the entanglement of material and social elements in practices (Orlikowski, 2007); the problem of ethics in a complex world {{and the issue of}} control and moral delegations in a more and more digital world (Dale, 2005; Introna, 2013); materiality and regulation in a post-crisis economy (Wasserman and Frenkel, 2011); the temporal, spatial and material dimensions of legitimacy, institutional logics and legitimation which remain a key issue for managers and citizens (Jones, 2013); or the new modalities of collaboration involved in the rising <b>collaborative</b> <b>economy,</b> among others. The material turn is therefore not just philosophical and ontological discussions, but fundamentally about what is happening in organizations and societies.|$|E

40|$|<b>Collaborative</b> <b>Economy</b> {{became the}} buzzword {{used to refer}} to all kinds of online {{platform}} based business models in the recent years. Yet there is no consensus on a working definition for these platforms and robust evidence is lacking on their costs and benefits to society – a precondition for good policy. To foster a clear and balanced regulatory environment and provide regulatory guidance to Member States on EU law application, the European Commission recently published the 'European Agenda for the Collaborative Economy' where the importance of further research and the need for monitoring the <b>collaborative</b> <b>economy</b> to identify obstacles and problems were stressed. This paper at hand takes stock of the existing knowledge on the <b>Collaborative</b> <b>Economy</b> in order to suggest a forward looking agenda to strengthen the scientific evidence base for the development of policies that maximise the benefits and minimise the costs for all the stakeholders involved. It emphasises the need for developing a clear, commonly agreed conceptualisation of the <b>collaborative</b> <b>economy</b> that would allow for better tailored policy interventions to the various facets of the concept. It presents knowledge gaps and research proposals, notably on the monitoring metrics and indicators; the online trust mechanisms and impact of digital labour market platforms on labour markets and social security systems.

40|$|Temporary urban {{spaces are}} gaining even more footing and {{acceptance}} {{on the political}} agenda {{as a result of}} their potential for creating eventful, cultural and creative urban environments. This political focus on temporary urban space is an indication of general urban regulations and development tendencies characterized by cultural planning, leisure, <b>economy,</b> <b>collaborative</b> planning and an increased focus on everyday life. Particularly economic parameters related to leisure such as creativity, culture, urban life and experiences are highly prioritized on the urban municipal agenda, with temporary uses as a concrete development tool. An interesting dichotomy has also arisen between the use of temporary space as a tool for social planning by urban designers as opposed to the use of temporary spaces by politicians as a vehicle for economic gain through leisure spaces. This paper focuses on the phenomenon of Temporary Use as a city-political focus area now and in the future as well as the use of the temporary as a planning tool.

40|$|Marketing, advertising, and {{communications}} processes have changed to strategically capitalize on an increasingly digitally-transformed, technologically-empowered, globally-interconnected consumer, or what Service Dominant Logic {{refers to as}} actors that are resource-integrators. Put simply, customers are co-creators of value in the <b>collaborative</b> or sharing <b>economy,</b> and seek to actively {{reap the benefits of}} new knowledge growing at an exponential rate. However, developing models of customer behavior, especially the influence of a new kind of advertising based on the integrated use of television, web and social networks, is a challenge. Our study starts from a preliminary empirical observation of the impact of TV Cooking Shows on the variations of potential demand (queries on Google) and the purchase of branded/unbranded culinary products, used on the show. Neural networks (nns) were used to learn significant correlations, and resulted in an Operative Marketing 3. 0 model. This model clearly explicates this impact factor on the consumer purchasing process generated by a new mode of creating ICT-based communication. As a result, using these types of models businesses can more strategically plan the presence of products of interest on television programs designed according to M@SECI and M@BA (a pervasive smart-space model for online marketing) ...|$|R
