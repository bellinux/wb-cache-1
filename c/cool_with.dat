5|$|A dish {{native to}} the Gaza area is Sumaghiyyeh, {{consisting}} of water-soaked ground sumac mixed with tahina. The mixture is added to sliced chard and pieces of stewed beef and garbanzo beans and additionally flavored with dill seeds, garlic and hot peppers. It is often eaten <b>cool</b> <b>with</b> khubz. Rummaniyya is prepared differently depending {{on the time of}} the year and is made up of unripened pomegranate seeds, eggplant, tahina, garlic, hot peppers and lentils. Fukharit adas is a slow-cooked lentil stew flavored with red pepper flakes, crushed dill seeds, garlic, and cumin; it is traditionally made during winter and early spring.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1934 The {{object of}} this study was to compare the {{efficiency}} of a Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> <b>with</b> that of a 29 x 16 - 1 / 2 inch tubular surface cooler, as well as with that of two other coolers (tub cooler and sprinkler cooler). The cooling efficiency of a Hydro-Vac cooler was slightly lower than that of a 29 x 16 - 1 / 2 inch tubular surface cooler. The cooling efficiency of a sprinkler cooler was found to be higher than that of a tub cooler, but the cooling efficiency of either one of these two coolers was considerably lower than that of a Hydro-Vac cooler. When a Hydro-Vac cooler and a tubular surface cooler were thoroughly cleaned and sterilized there was no difference of' practical significance in the bacterial contamination of the milk by these two coolers. The flavor and odor of milk <b>cooled</b> <b>with</b> a tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or <b>with</b> a Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> was on an average slightly superior to the flavor and odor of milk from the same lot which was <b>cooled</b> <b>with</b> a tub <b>cooler</b> or <b>with</b> a sprinkler <b>cooler.</b> No difference was observed in the volume of cream forming on milk from the same lot when the milk was <b>cooled</b> <b>with</b> a tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or <b>with</b> a Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> or when it was not cooled. Cooling the same milk <b>with</b> a tub <b>cooler</b> produced a slightly greater cream volume than <b>cooling</b> <b>with</b> a tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or <b>with</b> a Hydro-Vac <b>cooler...</b>|$|R

25|$|Mayagüez has a {{tropical}} monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification Am). The city {{has the most}} extreme weather of the island.

Winter is usually quite dry and <b>cool,</b> <b>with</b> temperatures between 82°F (28°C) and 55°F (13°C). Summer is usually very hot and humid, with temperatures reaching 95°F (35°C), with heat index of up to 115°F.

25|$|The Loire river has a {{significant}} effect on the mesoclimate of the region, adding the necessary extra few degrees of temperature that allows grapes to grow when the areas to the north and south of the Loire Valley have shown to be unfavourable to viticulture. In addition to finding vineyards along the Loire, several of the river's tributaries are also well planted—including the Allier, Cher, Indre, Loir, Sèvre Nantaise and Vienne Rivers. The climate can be very <b>cool</b> <b>with</b> spring time frost being a potential hazard for the vines. During the harvest months rain can cause the grapes to be harvested under ripe but can also aid in the development of Botrytis cinerea for the region's dessert wines.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the eurozone's {{debt crisis}} caused Poles' {{interest}} to <b>cool,</b> <b>with</b> {{two out of}} five Poles opposed to entry. In March 2011, research by CBOS showed that 60% of Poles were against adopting the euro while 32% were supportive, a decrease from 41% in April 2010. Surveys {{in the first half}} of 2012 indicated that 60% of Poles were opposed to adopting the common currency. Public support for the euro continued to fall, reaching record lows in the CBOS polls from July 2012, where only 25% of those polled supported a switch to the euro. However, polls conducted by TNS Polska throughout 2012–2015 have consistently shown support for eventually adopting the euro, though that support depends on the target date (as revealed by the detailed data in the table below).|$|E

25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all <b>cool</b> <b>with</b> it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

30|$|These {{differences}} in the sensor responses could be caused by different designs between SRMs at KCC (<b>cooled</b> <b>with</b> liquid helium) and OSU (<b>cooled</b> <b>with</b> pulse tube). For instance, the KCC SRM pick-up coils may have narrower widths along the SRM track. Jackson et al. (2010) noted that the geometry of the superconducting shield in the “dry” SRM (<b>cooled</b> <b>with</b> pulse tube) {{is different from that}} in the conventional liquid He-cooled SRM, and the sensor response function is different accordingly. It is therefore critical to estimate the sensor response accurately for both types of SRM in order to successfully utilize the deconvolution. The narrow width of pick-up coils with narrow FWHM of KCC SRM sensor response is suitable for reconstruction of higher-resolution paleomagnetic signals with deconvolution.|$|R
