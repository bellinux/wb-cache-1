The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to relate the forms of prophetic speech used by Hosea, especially those connected with the covenant renewal liturgy, to the E traditions, pre-Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomic history. In so doing the author attempts to examine {{the nature of the}} role of the covenant mediator, the nature of prophetic continuity, and the origins of traditions so important to Hosea. This investigation, following methods of textual criticism, linguistic analysis, form-criticism, tradition and literary criticism, involves the isolation within the Book of Hosea of the covenant liturgy containing elements of a formula of preparation <b>for</b> <b>covenant</b> <b>renewal,</b> including (1) a threat of punishment and (2) a call to repentance and covenant renewal based upon the nature of the covenant God, Yahweh.

40|$|Conservation {{covenants}} {{have the}} potential to be powerful tools for protecting both ecological values and timber harvesting opportunities on lands dedicated <b>for</b> forestry purposes. <b>Covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry are among the most complex form of conservation covenants and must be carefully tailored to reflect ecological conditions and conservation objectives. In this report I evaluate the design of a <b>covenant</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry on Cortes Island, British Columbia. I assess both structural and ecological provisions of the covenant to determine whether covenants were a useful tool for conservation forestry in this case. Effective <b>covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry must include clear objectives, balance flexibility with rigour, adopt provisions to maximize compliance and include a monitoring program. In addition to regulating forest practices, <b>covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry should protect habitat at multiple scales, designate reserves, maintain structural complexity and ensure connectivity across the landscape. Careful consideration must also be given to how <b>covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry will incorporate societal values...|$|R

50|$|Progressive dispensationalists {{perceive}} a closer {{relationship between the}} Old Covenant and the New Covenant than do most traditional dispensationalists. One of the covenants which highlight {{the differences between the}} two views is the New Covenant. In the past, dispensationalists have had a variety of views with regard to the new covenant. Some dispensationalists, including Charles Ryrie and John F. Walvoord in the 1950s, argued for two new covenants: one new <b>covenant</b> <b>for</b> the Church and another new <b>covenant</b> <b>for</b> Israel. Other dispensationalists, including John Nelson Darby and John Master, argued <b>for</b> one new <b>covenant</b> applied only to Israel. And still other dispensationalists, including Cyrus I.
