40|$|Ventilation {{breakdown}} {{and narrow}} escapes occur at regular intervals, and sometimes these result in lethal outcomes. A ventilation breakdown in animal houses {{can cause a}} very rapid increase in air temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide concentrations inside the barn. The most severe narrow escapes occur in calf sheds (calves / beef), and houses for pigs and poultry. The {{most common cause of}} ventilation breakdown is power failure. Other causes can be failing control equipment and damaged fans. Ventilation breakdowns are most severe during summer time. According to a Swedish standard (SIS, 1992), the air temperature inside an animal house shall not exceed the outside air temperature with more than 4 ºC when it is 21 ºC outside. A limited increase of the temperature within a barn can cause a decrease in production. When the temperature exceeds an upper critical temperature a severe increase of the body temperature of the animals occur resulting in a lethal outcome. Heat stress in cows result in decreased milk production and a decrease in fertility. Hyperthermia is a common cause of death for poultry. Power failures in broiler houses are meant to be especially fatal. Pigs are meant to be especially sensitive to high temperatures since they not sweat, and not pant especially good. In directions from the Swedish Animal welfare Agency (DFS 2007 : 5) demands are present concerning emergency ventilation, and calf sheds (calves / beef), pig and poultry houses must be equipped with <b>alarm</b> <b>equipment</b> for excess temperature, power failure and failure concerning the <b>alarm</b> <b>equipment</b> etc. For making a summary of different brands and different models of <b>alarm</b> <b>equipment</b> available, information and pamphlets were collected from different companies. A number of equipments on the Swedish market fulfil relevant demands on <b>alarm</b> <b>equipment</b> for animal houses. A questionnaire was sent to producers with poultry, pigs and cattle in order to map the present state of alarm and emergency ventilation at Swedish farms. Totally 180 questionnaires were sent to farmers with poultry, pigs and cattle and the response rate was 72 %. The study showed that at the present time some types of alarms were missing in a number of barns. Presence of alarm was most frequent in poultry houses. Alarm for excess temperature and power failure were present in most houses with poultry. About two thirds of the poultry producers noted that they had alarm warning for <b>alarm</b> <b>equipment</b> failure. Among the pig producers about 30 % noted that they had alarm warning for excess temperature in the barn and about 20 % noted that they had alarm warning for power failure and stopped fans. For producers with cattle only a small fraction noted that <b>alarm</b> <b>equipments</b> were installed in the barns. Different systems for making responsible personnel aware of an alarm exist. Combinations of different methods were frequently used. Many producers have combinations of sound / light signals, alarms to the dwellings, and alarms to mobile phones, and some producers also have alarm going further on to a <b>central</b> <b>alarm</b> station e. g. SOS Alarm or Falk. Most of the producers (more than 80 %) noted that they tested the alarm with regularity. On farms with milk production and cattle, the emergency ventilation was achieved in far most cases by the help of manually opened doors and windows, and by the help of manually 10 started electric works connected to a tractor. On farms with poultry production the emergency ventilation was managed by the help of automatic systems to a great extent. On farms with pig production, emergency ventilation was managed to a great extent by the help of windows, doors and manually started electric works connected to tractors. The study showed that power failures occurred 1 - 5 times per year or more frequent at more than 90 % of 120 producers answering to the question. At none of the farms animals had died {{as a consequence of the}} power failures. About 70 % of those who answered noted that they had a plan for how the emergency ventilation should be organised in case of power failure. A number of measures can be taken to improve the systems. Some producer pointed out the problem with false alarms and automatic opening of inlets / outlets leading to unwanted low temperatures in the barn during winter time. Another producer mentioned problems with the ordinary telephone net during thunderstorms and suggested switching over to mobile phones. At some farms a number of persons were meant to be able to handle problems coming up. Natural air exchange with closed and to some extent open inlets / outlets (ventilation openings) were measured in five buildings without animals by the use of trace gas technology. Measurements were made during summer time since the driving force for natural ventilation is low due to small temperature differences during that time of the year. The air exchange rate was measured by the help of sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) spread inside the buildings. The air exchange rate was calculated from the rate of concentration change by time after stopping the supply of gas. Gas concentration was registered by the help of an infrared spectrophotometer. Measurements in conventional buildings showed ventilation rates far below minimum ventilation rates. In such buildings a considerable increase of the inside air temperature will take place if animals producing heat are present. Studies in a comparatively less airtight and not insulated building showed air exchange rates well above minimum ventilation rates. The ventilation rate increased by increased inlet area and increased wind velocity. In order to estimate the rate of change in temperature during a ventilation breakdown a simple calculation model was derived from building characteristics and animal heat production equations. Calculations were made for ventilation rates of 2 m 3 ·h- 1 ·m- 2 and 8 m 3 ·h- 1 ·m- 2 for barns housing different animals. Calculations show a considerable increase of temperature during the first 30 minutes after a ventilation breakdown. The increase in temperature is higher in a light building compared to a heavy building. The increase in temperature are also high in buildings with pigs weighing 90 kg and houses with almost finished broilers compared to barns with cows and houses with 15 laying hens per m 2 floor area. High temperatures during a ventilation breakdown can occur also at temperatures as low as 5 °C. In systems with much stored manure inside the buildings there is a risk for extremely high gas concentrations during a ventilation breakdown due to gases released from the manure. In calf sheds (beef barns) with tied animals an increase of temperature comparable to barns with dairy cows can be expected. When calves (beef) are housed on deep litter high gas concentrations may occur during a ventilation breakdown due to gases released from the litter. The studies point out that a very fast increase in temperature can occur at a ventilationbreakdown when openings between the barn and the outside air are small (inlet- /outlet openings). Calculations suggest that the temperature during unfavourable circumstances may increase up to 10 °C during less than 30 minutes. Thus, the time for arranging emergency ventilation may be very short...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Lead {{strontium}} zirconate titanate (PSZT) ceramic is as {{one kind}} of piezoelectric materials can convert between stress and electric. Because of high performance, low cost of PSZT material, this kind of material are widely researched [2, 3] and used in the areas such as electrical sensors, actuators, <b>alarm</b> <b>equipments</b> etc [1]. As the more widely applications of the PSZT material, improving its piezoelectric properties becomes more important [4]. In this paper, for improving the electrical properties of PSZT material, elements manganese (Mn) or cerium (Ce) is doped into the bulk PSZT material. It has been found that, when the doping amount of MnO 2 is 0. 15 wt%, the electrical properties are improved to: tgδ= 0. 0095, kp= 0. 634, d 33 = 611 pC/N and ε= 2523.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of the technical infrastructure at CERN relies {{on the quality of}} the definition of numerous and heterogeneous data sources. In 2006, we introduced the MoDESTI* procedure for the Technical Infrastructure Monitoring** (TIM) system to promote data quality. The first step in the data integration process is the standardisation of the declaration of the various data points whether these are <b>alarms,</b> <b>equipment</b> statuses or analogue measurement values. Users declare their data points and can follow their requests, monitoring personnel ensure the infrastructure is adapted to the new data, and control room operators check that the data points are defined in a consistent and intelligible way. Furthermore, rigorous validations are carried out on input data to ensure correctness as well as optimal integration with other computer systems at CERN (maintenance management, geographical viewing tools etc.). We are now redesigning the MoDESTI procedure in order to provide an intuitive and streamlined Web based tool for managing data definition, as well as reducing the time between data point integration requests and implementation.

40|$|One of {{the quickest}} means of tsunami {{evacuation}} is transfer to higher ground soon after strong and long ground shaking. Ground shaking {{itself is a}} good initiator of the evacuation from disastrous tsunami. Longer period seismic waves {{are considered to be}} more correlated with the earthquake magnitude. We investigated the possible application of this to tsunami hazard alarm using single-site ground motion observation. Information from the mass media is sometimes unavailable due to power failure soon after a large earthquake. Even when an official alarm is available, multiple information sources of tsunami alert would help people become aware of the coming risk of a tsunami. Thus, a device that indicates risk of a tsunami without requiring other data would be helpful to those who should evacuate. Since the sensitivity of a low-cost MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) accelerometer is sufficient for this purpose, tsunami <b>alarm</b> <b>equipment</b> for home use may be easily realized. Amplitude of long-period (20  s cutoff) displacement was proposed as the threshold for the alarm based on empirical relationships among magnitude, tsunami height, hypocentral distance, and peak ground displacement of seismic waves.
