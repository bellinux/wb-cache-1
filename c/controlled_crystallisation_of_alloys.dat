40|$|Glass {{ceramics}} are {{materials that}} are cooled from the melt {{in the form of}} a glass, and then heat treated to induce <b>controlled</b> <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> the glass. Heterogeneous nucleation is carried out at a temperature to maximise the nucleation rate (common nucleating agents include TiO 2 and ZrO 2), and the temperature is then raised sufficiently to cause the nuclei formed to grow rapidly. Glass ceramics are strong, reasonably tough, transparent to IR radiation, have a low coefficient of thermal expansion, a high resistance to thermal shock and a low thermal conductivity, which makes them very useful in domestic applications such as cookware and cooker hobs. The most common glass ceramic system is LAS (Li 2 O-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2), but others include MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2, Na 2 O-BaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2, and Li 2 O-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2. ...|$|R

A pre-treatment step to induce <b>controlled</b> <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> the amorphous powder as well as a fast sintering procedure for green compacts, were also performed as a comparison. Finally, the previously stated thermal pre-treatment of the amorphous product was coupled to an extensive mechanical activation performed by wet planetary/ball milling.

40|$|Active {{pharmaceutical}} ingredients (APIs) {{are frequently}} {{delivered to the}} patient in the solid-state {{as part of an}} approved dosage form (tablets, capsules, etc.). Understanding and controlling the solid-state chemistry of APIs is therefore an important aspect of the drug development process. APIs can exist in a variety of distinct solid forms, including polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, co-crystals and amorphous solids. Each form displays unique physicochemical properties that can profoundly influence the bioavailability, manufacturability, stability and other performance characteristics of the drug. Most APIs are purified and isolated by crystallisation from an appropriate solvent during the final step in synthetic process. The main objective <b>of</b> a <b>crystallisation</b> process is to produce crystals with desired properties such as particle size distribution (PSD), shape and purity. All pharmaceutical dosage forms must be produced in uniform units, and good content of uniformity is only possible when the size of the active component is carefully controlled.

40|$|Fenofibrate {{was chosen}} as the drug of {{interest}} in this study because of its poor water-solubility, highly unstable amorphous state and unpredictable crystallisation behaviour. The <b>crystallisation</b> behaviour <b>of</b> amorphous fenofibrate is essential information that primarily corresponds to the physical stability of solid dispersion formulations. This project aims to probe how to <b>control</b> the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> amorphous fenofibrate, enhance its aqueous solubility and improve its physical stability by using electrospun polymer blend matrices. A range of characterisation technologies including MTDSC, ATR-FTIR, PXRD, SCXRD, SEM, TEM, HS-PLM, nano-TA and ss-NMR were used to characterise the physicochemical properties <b>of</b> both the <b>crystallisation</b> process <b>of</b> fenofibrate, and fenofibrate solid dispersions. The amorphous fenofibrate was crystallised using heterogeneous nucleation techniques, including surface disruption and impurity addition (talc). The presence or absence of an open top surface (OTS) was found {{to be one of the}} key factors which dictated the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> the amorphous fenofibrate into specific polymorphs. The use of thermal treatment in addition to OTS was able to finely tune the selectivity <b>of</b> the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> fenofibrate to form I or/and form IIa. The use of a low percentage of talc as heterogeneous nuclei resulted in the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> the new fenofibrate polymorph III. The polymer blend fibres prepared by electrospinning were phase separated solid dispersions that improved the aqueous solubility of the fenofibrate in comparison to the fenofibrate crystals. The drug-polymer and polymer-polymer miscibility were found to be the key parameters that affected the physical stability of the incorporated amorphous drug and the phase separation in the formulations. Additionally, the in situ phase separation of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers in the blends led to modified drug release. The drug release rate could be fine-tuned by altering the ratio of the polymers. The new knowledge generated by this work relates to the following areas: 1) an improved understanding of the crystallization process of fenofibrate and its polymorphic control; 2) the use of polymer blend matrices in electrospun fibres that leads to the stabilization of amorphous drugs when they are incorporated in those fibres; and 3) the modification of the drug release profiles via the use of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer blend matrices for electrospinning...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{the most}} powerful technique for structural determination of proteins, a vital research tool, enabling insight at the atomic level, of the three dimensional structure of key protein receptors for potential drug compounds. To be successful, single, high quality crystals of the compound in question are required. Current methods to produce crystals involve frustratingly long timescales, extensive trial and error using large amounts of material, and have no guarantee of success. Polymorphic compounds add another level of frustration, requiring the thermodynamic <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> in order to overcome Ostwald’s rule of stages, which considers crystallisation from bulk solution to be under kinetic control with metastable polymorphs often crystallising initially. These factors have led to what is currently referred to as the “bottle-neck” <b>of</b> protein <b>crystallisation,</b> an acute problem motivating the rapid development <b>of</b> protein <b>crystallisation</b> techniques. This thesis aims to alleviate the bottle-neck found in protein crystallisation by exploring protein crystallisation using microemulsions; a technique, which until now, has only been successfully applied to the thermodynamic <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> for small compounds, such as 5 -methyl- 2 -[(2 -nitrophenyl) amino]- 3 -thiophenecarbonitrile (commonly known as ROY) and glycine. Through the application of several different surfactant systems for the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> model protein, Lysozyme, this thesis explores the use of microemulsions with the aim of producing high quality single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments. Numerous, large, high quality, single crystals of Lysozyme were successfully grown using a TritonX- 100 / 1 -hexanol surfactant system in which an anti-solvent, mixed microemulsion method was applied. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was effectively used to confirm formation of microemulsions and led to the determination of droplet sizes using generalised indirect Fourier Transform (GIFT) analysis. X-ray diffraction experiments showed single crystals grown from microemulsions to have a high internal order, with the resultant data sets of a publishable quality and of a comparative quality to data sets collected from crystals grown using standard vapour diffusion crystallisation techniques. This thesis demonstrates, for the first time, that microemulsions can be successfully used to produce high quality, single crystals of the protein, Lysozyme, shining light on this novel technique as a potential means of relieving the bottle-neck <b>of</b> protein <b>crystallisation.</b> Future directions <b>of</b> this work include exploring the robustness <b>of</b> the microemulsion <b>crystallisation</b> technique with other proteins such as insulin, glucose isomerase and albumin. Expanding this novel technique to the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> membrane proteins may be initially explored through the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> a 25 residue, membrane spanning part of the M 2 protein of the influenza virus. This would provide an interesting starting point due to the proteins’ biological importance as a target of anti-influenza drugs. ...|$|R

40|$|Subject of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} infuence of variabel parameters of the porcelain firing process in the dental laboratories on metal-porcelain bond-strength. The base-metal alloy Wirbond SG was veneered with the porcelain Vita Omega 900 and the metal-porcelain bond strength was tested with the crack-initiation-test according to SCHWICKERATH (210 specimens) and statistically analysed. Several specimens were examined with SEM and EDX-analysis. The following parameters were tested: -	temperature of oxide-firing -	reduced temperature of the opaque-dryingtime -	layering without any opaque-layer -	layering with merely on opaque-layer -	sintering of opaquer with increased firing temperatures -	use of glycering instead of modelling liquid for the opaquer -	layering of the opaquer with increased thickness -	firing of the body-porcelain with stepwise increased or decreased firing temperatures -	multiple firings of the body-porcelain In general, all measured bond-strength values surpass two third of the bond-strength values publicated in the relevant literature. The bond-strenhth values of all test-series exceeded the demanded minimum value of 25 MPa and can be regarded as clinically safe. The results can be summarized as follows: -	no increased bond-strenth could be achieved whith oxidation firings -	close attention has to be paid to the drying temperature of the opaque, the instructions of the manufacturer are decisive -	if nessecary, it is possible to abstain from the opaque or to sinter the porcelain with a single opaque-layer without a decrease of bond-strength -	layering the opauque with increased thickness has no negative effect on porcelain bond-strength -	use of glycerin as modelling fluid does not effect the porcelain bond-strength -	increased temperatures of the opaque-firing does not increase the porcelain bond-strength -	firing of the body-porcelain with increased or decreased temperatures does not effect the porcelain bond-strength substantially. Only if the body-porcelain is fired with temperatures of 100 °C above the manufactorer instructions, an significant increase of porcelain-bond-strength was measured -	this behavior of the porcelain Vita Omega 900 can be explained by its microstructure with <b>controlled</b> <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> leucite without a temperature-dependent change of the tec-value -	multiple or corrective firings increase the porcelain bond-strength with a significance in the case of 3 corrective firings -	below the chromiumoxide layer on the metall-surface, an area with decreased chromium-concentration (tracer-zone) exeeds up to 2 - 2, 5 µm into the bulk metall...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to realise the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> using surface topography. Calcium carbonate crystallisation was primarily used as this is a model system for crystallisation studies. The first experimental chapter involves the precipitation of calcium carbonate on a plasma-treated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PPDMS) substrate. Exposure to atmospheric air-plasma results in oxidation of {{the surface of the}} poly(dimethylsiloxane), causing a superficial silica-like (SiOx) surface layer to form. Cracks in this surface, which arise because of its rigidity compared to the underlying bulk, were found to act as effective nucleation sites for calcium carbonate precipitation. Crystals were often observed only at the cracks and were absent elsewhere on the substrate. The surface chemistry was altered using a carboxylate terminated alkylthiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM), formed from the monomer 16 -mercaptohexadecanoic acid. The presence of this monomer on the PPDMS substrate caused a significant increase in crystal population and enhanced the localising effect of the cracks. Further <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> was achieved by varying the initial ion ratio (Ca 2 +:CO 32 -) and by the presence of magnesium ions in solution. The substrate also proved effective at causing the localised precipitation of other inorganic materials: strontium carbonate, barium carbonate, manganese carbonate, basic copper carbonate and calcium oxalate. Through the application of contact masks or a tensile stress during plasma-treatment, it was possible to control the distribution of the cracks across the surface and therefore pattern the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> calcium carbonate. The second research chapter is a quantitative analysis of the system discussed in the first chapter. Here, an image analysis software, ImageJ, was used to obtain data from electron micrographs of the PPDMS substrate after crystallisation. Calcium carbonate had been precipitated on the PPDMS substrate once the surface chemistry had been modified using a variety of differently terminated alkylthiol SAMs. The research revealed that not only is it possible to control crystal populations at the surface features, but also the crystal polymorph. In the third research chapter, silicon wafers that had been spincoated with reduced-graphene oxide were used as substrates for calcium carbonate precipitation. Interestingly, the vast majority of crystals that had formed on these wafers were aragonite, a metastable phase of calcium carbonate. In order to understand why this was so, a series of investigations followed that were aimed at elucidating if it was a topographical effect or due to the presence of impurities. The data suggested that the large proportion of aragonite was due to topographical effects. The final research chapter involved cleanroom microfabrication techniques common to the semiconductor industry to construct surface structures on silicon wafers that were used as substrates. Crystallisation was locallised to these features, proving {{that it is possible to}} design surface topographies that can be used to <b>control</b> <b>crystallisation...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} amino-acid derived bis-urea gelators were synthesised, {{some of which}} show strong {{gelation}} {{in a wide variety}} of solvents. The gels were probed at the molecular, microscopic and macroscopic levels to gain insights into the gelation behaviour observed. Mixtures of different gelators also result in gels, some of which show different fibre morphologies and X-ray powder patterns to the pure gelators. The series was extended to include fluorescent 1 - and 2 -pyrenylalanine derived gelators and the fluorescence behaviour of the gels in solution, the gel state, in mixed gels and with the addition of anions was investigated. Tetrabutylammonium-acetate was found to disrupt urea-hydrogen bonding leading to the break-down of the gels, a process which was followed by NMR spectroscopy, rheometry and fluorescence spectroscopy. Two gelators were used to template the formation of porous polymers which SEM and gas adsorption studies show reflect the different fibre morphologies observed in the gels. The use of supramolecular gels as a medium for <b>controlling</b> the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical compounds was developed. Proof of principle for the growth of a wide range of pharmaceutical compounds from a variety of different gels was demonstrated. The supramolecular nature of the gels was exploited by using anions to break down the gels in order to recover the crystals. Comparison of crystals grown from gels with those grown from solution highlighted a number of differences in crystal form, habit and stability. Gelators which mimic the chemical functionality of the drug compound being crystallised were synthesised.

The build-up of a fouling layer can reduce plant efficiency by a considerable extent resulting in higher energy demand, carbon footprint, {{and cost of}} operation. Traditional fouling mitigation methods are effective, but require maintenance downtime and use of hazardous chemicals. This project is aimed at exploring a novel approach in mitigating fouling through the addition of porous silica particles, which can help <b>control</b> the <b>crystallisation</b> process <b>of</b> calcium sulphate. Silica particles are a practicable alternative to traditional methods due to their low cost of production, tractability, and low environmental impact. The <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> calcium sulphate is investigated using two primary experiments. The first experiment investigates the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> calcium sulphate inside a batch crystalliser. The progress <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> is tracked online by measuring the variation of the solution’s electrical conductivity in time, while the final crystal size distribution is measured externally using laser diffraction. The crystallisation process is modelled using the population balance equation, which considers {{the evolution of the}} crystal size distribution in time in the presence of nucleation, growth, agglomeration, and breakage. The model is solved numerically using the method of classes. Experiments show that porous particles can reduce the crystallisation induction time by enhancing the rate of homogeneous nucleation. Comparison between porous particles of various pore diameters and silica nanoparticles reveal that the pore volume is the significant parameter in nucleation enhancement (more so than pore diameter or surface area). Furthermore, gas sorption measurements showed a decrease in available pore volume, indicating that pores are blocked during crystallisation. Population balance modelling suggests that the confined space of the pore increases nucleation by increasing the frequency of collision between free ions. Pore deactivation is modelled through heterogeneous nucleation. The surface chemistry of the particles was functionalised to further enhance the pores’ effect on nucleation. Amine functionalisation was observed to decrease the nucleation induction time by 26...|$|R
40|$|The redox {{sensitivity}} of Ce and Eu anomalies in zircon has been clearly demonstrated by experimental studies, and these may represent {{an important tool}} in the exploration for porphyry Cu deposits which {{are thought to be}} derived from oxidised magmas.

40|$|<b>Control</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> is hugely {{important}} {{in many areas}} of science and technology. The size of crystals can often be crucial in how they perform. In addition the polymorphism of crystals is just as important, especially for the pharmaceutical sciences, where unexpected changes in polymorphism can spell disaster for certain drugs. With these requirements in mind, we have demonstrated that microemulsions can be used to offer thermodynamic <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation,</b> not just with regards to polymorphism of organic crystals, but also to the synthesis of certain inorganic compounds. The polymorphism of glycine was first investigated in an attempt to grow all three polymorphs (α-, β- and γ-) at room temperature and pressure. The most stable of these, γ-glycine grows 500 times more slowly than the next most stable form, α-glycine. Using microemulsions made up with the surfactant AOT, the continuous oil phase heptane and a nanoconfined aqueous glycine solution, all three polymorphs of glycine were crystallised by adding methanol dropwise under varying conditions. Non-ionic surfactant systems were also investigated, using combinations of the surfactants Span 80 /Tween 80 and Span 80 /Brij 30. Using the Span 80 /Brij 30 system, the most stable form, γ-glycine, could be formed predominantly by mixing an aqueous glycine microemulsion with an aqueous methanol microemulsion. This proved that Ostwald’s Rule of Stages could be circumvented in order to obtain the most stable polymorph. Following this, microemulsions were used to demonstrate that inorganic crystalline materials could be synthesised in microemulsion droplets- again at room temperature and pressure. Hydroxyapatite, known as a component of natural bone, was made using Triton X- 100 / 1 -hexanol/cyclohexane microemulsions via two methods, firstly via direct addition of reactants, then again via mixed microemulsion methods. Subsequent analysis showed that the final product showed excellent correlation with bought-in hydroxyapatite (reagent grade), with regards to purity and crystallinity. Finally the synthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles was reported. These set of experiments brought both challenges of controlling polymorphism and synthesising materials together. Rutile – the most stable of polymorph of titanium dioxide – was synthesised as the predominant polymorph from the microemulsions. Electron microscopy studies were able to track the particle size growth between 2 and 13 nm at various times up to 18 hours after mixing the reactant microemulsions. ...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the food}} industry, <b>controlling</b> <b>crystallisation</b> {{is a key}} factor {{governing}} food structure, texture and consumer appeal, with some foods requiring the promotion <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> in a <b>controlled</b> manner (e. g. chocolate) and others a check (e. g. in honey). Sonocrystallisation is the application of ultrasound energy to control the nucleation <b>of</b> a <b>crystallisation</b> process. The use of power ultrasound provides a non-invasive approach to producing crystals with desired properties. Sonocrystallisation facilitates process control, primarily by modulating crystal size distribution and morphology. This paper details the governing mechanisms of sonocrystallisation. Proven and potential applications of the process in foods, including chocolates, honey, fats and frozen foods are reviewed. Challenges of process adoption such as scale-up are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Solubility {{phenomena}} (i. e. dissolution and precipitation reactions) are the physicochemical {{basis of}} numerous biological processes. These include, for instance: • gas solubilities in respiratory and photosynthetic processes; the solubility of volatile anaesthetics; • the crystallisation, both in biologically controlled and pathological processes, of biogenic minerals {{in a variety}} of body fluids; the resorption of mineralised tissue; • the accumulation, due to their higher solubility, of lipophilic substances, such as pesticides, in liquid fat contained, e. g. in adipose tissue or human milk; • the incorporation of metal ions such as strontium (including the radioactive 90 Sr isotope) in bone, by co-precipitation and solid-solution formation. Since Sr stabilises bone apatite crystals (i. e. decreases solubility), it may retard the resorption of the calcified matrix and thus have therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of osteopenic disorders [1]. In dental enamel, a combination of strontium and fluoride was reported to be more effective in stabilising the apatetic structure than each element alone [2]. This results in an improved crystal resistance to degradation by bacterial acids and hence may be useful for the prevention of dental caries [3]. All of these solubility phenomena are governed by the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics. The human body is essentially an isothermal system (a notable exception, related to gout, has been reported in the literature – see below). Thus, the pertinent in vitro measurements have almost always been performed at 37 _C. However, reactions in body fluids are complicated by the presence of organic complexing agents which affect the speciation of metal ions (i. e. their distribution among these complexes). Computer speciation modelling of biofluids, which has a long history [4], has also to be considered in the modelling of solubility equilibria. The presence of organic macromolecules such as proteins provides templates or matrices which <b>control</b> the <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> biogenic minerals and modify their morphologies. The mineral phase in organic/inorganic composites (such as teeth or bone) may form nanosized crystals, which exhibit unusual dissolution and crystallisation behaviour [5]. A new biomineralisation mechanism invoking liquid precursors and their importance for normal and pathological biomineralisation processes has been proposed [6]. These and other aspects of normal and pathological biomineralisation processes have been reviewed recently [7]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bulk glass-forming alloys {{have emerged}} {{over the past}} fifteen years with {{attractive}} properties and technological promise. A number <b>of</b> <b>alloy</b> systems based on lanthanum, magnesium, zirconium, palladium, iron, cobalt and nickel have been discovered. Glass-forming ability depends on various factors like enthalpy of mixing, atomic size and multicomponent <b>alloying.</b> A number <b>of</b> processes is available to synthesise bulk metallic glasses. The crystallisation behaviour and mechanical properties <b>of</b> these <b>alloys</b> pose interesting scientific questions. Upon <b>crystallisation</b> many <b>of</b> these glasses transform to bulk nanocrystals and nanoqua-sicrystals. A detailed study of the structure and the <b>crystallisation</b> behaviour <b>of</b> glasses has enabled the elucidation of the possible atomic configuration in liq-uid alloys. Their crystallisation behaviour can be exploited to synthesise novel nanocomposite microstructures and their mechanical properties can be enhanced.

40|$|Crystallisation, {{morphology}} and miscibility {{of polypropylene}} (PP) and linear {{low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) blends were studied by polarised optical microscopy connected to a computer with digital image processing and analysis. In particular the effects of LLDPE and its melt flow index (MFI) on the kinetics <b>of</b> PP <b>crystallisation</b> was investigated through establishing a relationship between nucleation density, spherulitic growth rate and overall crystallisation growth rate. All the blends contained 20 % by mass of PP and the LLDPEs used were of the similar grades. The <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> PP was <b>controlled</b> to occur isothermally at temperatures where LLDPEs were in molten state. It was found that, the PP crystallised as open-armed diffuse spherulites, similar to those observed in the miscible blends, suggesting that the PP and the LLDPE may be miscible at some temperatures. The nuclei density, spherulite growth rate and overall <b>crystallisation</b> rate <b>of</b> PP decreased significantly in the blends, indicating that the LLDPE retarded <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> PP, possibly due to various reasons such as the dilution of PP by LLDPE (LLDPE as a solvent in molten state), hindrance of viscous LLDPE to the PP crystallisation front, and decreased supercooling degree because of the miscibility between the PP and LLDPE. This provided further evidence that the PP and the LLDPE could be miscible at crystallisation temperatures selected. In addition, the spherulite growth rate of PP decreased with a decrease in MFI of LLDPE while the MFI of LLDPE had negligible effect on the nuclei density, showing that the diffusion process <b>controlled</b> overall <b>crystallisation</b> rate when the nucleation density were similar for blends with various MFI. This further confirmed that PP and LLDPE were miscible at elevated temperatures since the more viscous LLDPE (lower MFI) reduced the <b>crystallisation</b> rate <b>of</b> PP at a greater degree...|$|R

However, Co concentration in the alpha-Fe(Co) was the same as the remaining amorphous phase. Based on the 3 DAP analysis, the phase volume fraction has been estimated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

The crystalline phase consisted of a nanocrystalline solid nickel and molybdenum solution with a face-centred cubic (FCC) lattice with a high density of chaotically distributed dislocations and high microstrain value. The scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) showed that two particle structures were formed: larger cauliflower-like particles and smaller dendriteshaped ones.
