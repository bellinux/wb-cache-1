Our study reveals that an organelle band provides a physical barrier between the two spindles. The loss of a single protein, JAS, from this organelle band leads to its disruption and a random movement of the spindles.

Elevated levels of PTTG 1 {{were found to be}} associated with many different tumor types that might be involved in late stage tumor progression. However, the role of PTTG 1 in early stage of tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we utilized the adenovirus expression system to deliver PTTG 1 into normal human fibroblasts to evaluate the role of PTTG 1 in tumorigenesis. Expressing PTTG 1 in normal human fibroblasts inhibited cell proliferation. Several senescence-associated (SA) phenotypes including increased SA-Î²-galactosidase activities, decreased bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and increased SA-heterochromatin foci formation were also observed in PTTG 1 -expressing cells, indicating that PTTG 1 overexpression induced a senescent phenotype in normal cells. Significantly, the PTTG 1 -induced senescence is p 53 -dependent and telomerase-independent, which is distinctively different from that of replicative senescence. The mechanism of PTTG 1 -induced senescence was also analyzed. Consistent with its role in regulating sister-chromatid separation, overexpression of PTTG 1 inhibited the activation of separase. Consequently, the numbers of cells with abnormal nuclei morphologies and <b>chromosome</b> <b>separations</b> were increased, which resulted in activation of the DNA damage response. Thus, we concluded that PTTG 1 overexpression in normal human fibroblasts caused chromosome instability, which subsequently induced p 53 -dependent senescence through activation of DNA-damage response pathway...|$|R

Acentric spindle positioning and cortical polarity are two major factors involved in asymmetric cell division, {{both of which are}} thought to depend on the dynamic interaction between myosin II and actin filaments. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), encoded by the Mylk 1 gene, could directly phosphorylate and activate myosin II. To determine whether MLCK was required for oocyte asymmetric division, we specifically disrupted the Mylk 1 gene in oocytes by Cre-loxP conditional knockout system. We found that Mylk 1 mutant female mice showed severe subfertility. Unexpectedly, contrary to previously reported in vitro findings, our data showed that oocyte meiotic maturation including spindle organization, polarity establishment, homolo-gous <b>chromosomes</b> <b>separation,</b> and polar body extrusion were not affected in Mylk 1 fl/fl;GCre+ females. Follicular development, ovulation, and early embryonic development up to compact morula occurred normally in Mylk 1 fl/fl;GCre+ females, but deletion of MLCK caused delayed morula-to-blastocyst transi-tion. More than a third of embryos were at morula stage at 3. 5 Days Postcoitum in vivo.

In the absence of Plk1 function, bipolar spindle formation does not occur and cells arrest in prometaphase owing to Spindle Assembly Checkpoint activation. Plk1 function may be important for relieving the inhibitory checkpoint signal.

30|$|Chromosome {{instability}} (CIN) {{is considered}} {{as an important}} factor promoting tumorogenesis (He et al. 1998; Shen et al. 2002; Wajed et al. 2001). In colon cancer and invasive endocrine tumor cells induced by APC mutation, CIN is very distinct (Rubinfeld et al. 1996). In the mitosis, a vital function of microtubule is {{to participate in the}} formation of spindle and divide equally the chromosome between the two daughter cells. APC protein, positioning in centromere, spindle and centrosome directly, takes part in the normal spindle arrangement in equatorial plate, centromere stability and regulation of the connection between spindle microtubule and chromosome. A study by Aoki et al. (2007) showed that APC mutation would induce error <b>separation</b> of <b>chromosome.</b> In the embryonic stem cell and intestinal polyp cells of mice, the truncated APC mutation may cause chromosomal aberration and non-integer value, thus leading to the chromosome instability. Fodde (2003) found that in the HCT 116 cell strain of human colon cancer cells expressing the overall length APC, although the C terminal domain of APC (including microtubule binding domain) could be expressed, the none-integer chromosome was also developed. Moreover, in HCT 116 cell, the expression of APC N terminal domain may affect the interaction between centromere and microtubule to induce CIN. Therefore, APC was thought to affect the centromere function and <b>chromosomes</b> <b>separation</b> through its interaction with microtubule. The results of this study indicated that there were APC gene mutations in the occurrence process of ameloblastoma, which mainly manifested as point mutation. Thereby, the amino acid at individual site changed in APC. If this change affected the structure and functions of APC protein, the stability of APC protein complex would be affected to change the degradation of complex to Î²-catenin and promote occurrence of certain malignant phenotype (invasiveness and metastasis) in ameloblastoma.|$|R

50|$|Generally speaking, {{the cell}} cycle {{regulation}} of meiosis {{is similar to}} that of mitosis. As in the mitotic cycle, these transitions are regulated by combinations of gene regulatory factors, cyclin-Cdk complex and the APC. The first major regulatory transition occurs in late G1, when the Start of meiotic cycle is activated by Ime1 instead of Cln3/Cdk1 in mitosis. The second major transition occurs at the entry into metaphase I. The main purpose of this step is to make sure that DNA replication has completed without error so that spindle pole bodies can separate. The event is triggered by the activation of M-Cdk in late prophase I. Then the spindle assembly checkpoint examines the attachment of microtubules at kinetochores and APCCdc20 can initiate the metaphase I.The special <b>chromosome</b> <b>separation</b> in meiosis, homologous chromosomes separation in meiosis I and chromatids separation in meiosis II, requires special tension between homologous chromatids and non-homologous chromatids for distinguishing microtubule attachment and it relies on the programmed DNA double strand break (DSB) and repair in prophase I.

On the other hand, the meiotic recombination checkpoint also makes sure that meiotic recombination does happen in every pair of homologs.|$|E

DNA profiling by FACS showed that JADE1S depletion facilitated rates of G1-cells accumulation in synchronously dividing HeLa cells. The depletion of JADE1S protein in asynchronously dividing cells decreased the proportion of cytokinetic cells, and increased the proportion of multi-nuclear cells. The data demonstrated that JADE1 negatively controls cytokinesis, presumably by contributing to cytokinesis delay. JADE1 down-regulation increased number of multi-nuclear cells indicative of failed cytokinesis, while JADE1S moderate overexpression augmented the number of cytokinetic cells indicative of cytokinetic delay. Inhibition of Aurora B kinase by specific small molecule drugs resulted in the release of JADE1S-mediated cytokinetic delay and allowed progression of abscission. Since Aurora B is a key regulator of the NoCut, JADE1S is likely to regulate cytokinesis at the abscission checkpoint control.JADE1S but not JADE1L or HBO1 was found in centrosomes of dividing cells throughout the cell cycle, and neither of these proteins was found in cilia. In contrast, another study reported JADE1 localization to the cilia and centrosome. The study did not communicate on JADE1 isoform specificity. Centrosomes are the cytoskeleton nucleation centers.

Chromosomes duplicate prior to cell division when forming new skin cells for reproduction. After meiotic cell reproduction the four daughter cells have half the number of chromosomes that the parental cell originally had. This is the haploid amount of DNA, often symbolized as N. Meiosis is used by diploid organisms to produce haploid gametes. In a diploid organism such as the human organism, most cells of the body have the diploid amount of DNA, 2N. Using this notation for counting chromosomes we say that human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (2N = 46) while human sperm and eggs have 23 chromosomes (N = 23). Humans have 23 distinct types of chromosomes, the 22 autosomes and the special category of sex chromosomes. There are two distinct sex chromosomes, the X chromosome and the Y chromosome.

PF 4 -Cre/survivinfl/fl mice harbored normal platelet counts with megakaryocytes that reached ploidy states comparable with those of control littermates. The CD 41 + cells within these animals showed little excision but increased annexin V staining, implying that survivin is required for survival of megakaryocyte progenitors in vivo. In contrast, megakaryocytes in which survivin was excised ex vivo showed robust excision and an increased degree of polyploidization.
