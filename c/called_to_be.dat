25|$|In the meantime, two {{separate}} vigilante groups, the Merchants Committee and the Citizens Committee, {{began to call}} for immediate action to rid the town of the bunco men. Several hundred people attended the latter organization's meeting at Sylvester Hall, too many for the facility to accommodate.

25|$|The {{movement}} {{more than}} doubled in size with the conversion of Sidney Rigdon, a former Campbellite minister, who led several congregations of Restorationists in Ohio's Western Reserve area, causing hundreds of his adherents to follow him into Mormonism. A fiery orator, Rigdon was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Smith's spokesman, and immediately became one of the movement's leaders. By 1831 the church's headquarters were established in Kirtland, Ohio, and Smith urged the membership to gather there or to a second outpost of the church in Far West, Missouri (see below).|$|E

25|$|Secular Franciscans are <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{bearers of}} peace in their {{families}} and in society The renunciation {{of the use of}} violence, characteristic of the followers of Francis, does not mean the renunciation of action. Peace is the work of justice and the fruit of reconciliation and of fraternal love. While acknowledging both the personal and national right to self-defense, they should respect the choice of those who, because of conscientious objection, refuse to bear arms. However, the brothers and sisters should take care that their interventions are always inspired by Christian love.|$|E
25|$|The Riverview College Observatory {{was built}} in 1909, and was {{established}} by the distinguished Jesuit astronomer and seismologist, Edward Francis Pigot (1858-1929), who ordered {{a complete set of}} seismographs from Göttingen.

Another distinguished Jesuit seismologist and astronomer, Fr Thomas Burke-Gaffney, became assistant-director of the Observatory in 1946 and director from 1952. His studies of seismic aspects of nuclear explosions garnered worldwide attention and he served as vice-president of the Royal Society of New South Wales.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Lord Liverpool in April 1827, Canning was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Prime Minister. The more conservative Tories, including Sir Robert Peel, withdrew their support, and an alliance was formed between the liberal members of the late ministry and the Whigs. The post of Chancellor of the Exchequer was offered to Palmerston, who accepted it, but this appointment was frustrated by some intrigue between the King and John Charles Herries. Palmerston remained Secretary at War, though he gained {{a seat in the}} cabinet for the first time. The Canning administration ended after only four months on the death of the Prime Minister, and was followed by the ministry of Lord Goderich, which barely survived the year.|$|E

25|$|James D. Demarest {{continued}} as pastor {{of both the}} Monsey Church and the Ramapo, New Jersey church for many years. With many more churches than trained pastors, it was commonly the case that pastors would oversee multiple congregations, rotating among them on successive Sundays. One of the deacons at Monsey {{toward the end of}} the Rev. James D. Demarest's pastorate was John Yeury de Baun, born in Monsey in 1827. In 1852, when de Baun was 25 years old, he was accepted by Classis Hackensack as a student in theology, under the tutelage of Demarest and the Rev. Abram Van Houten. During the period of , Van Houten took over the pastorate of Monsey from Demarest, until de Baun had completed his studies in theology in 1855 and <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the pastor of both the Ramapo, New Jersey and the Monsey churches. De Baun preached alternate Sundays at Ramapo, New Jersey and Monsey until 1860, when he accepted a call to pastor the churches in Hackensack and English Neighborhood, New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|In early October 1793, as the French {{were about}} to launch a new offensive, Canclaux was {{suspended}} from command of the Army of the Coasts of Brest and du Bayet was also removed from his post. The dismissals were {{brought about by the}} scheming of Charles-Philippe Ronsin who convinced the minister of war Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte that Canclaux and du Bayet were responsible for the lack of success. A protégé of Bouchotte, Léchelle was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> commander-in-chief of the Army of the West on 30 September. He had been promoted to general of division at about the same time. The new army took over the troops of the Army of the Coasts of La Rochelle, which was formerly led by Jean Antoine Rossignol, plus the Army of Mayence. On 6 October Rossignol went to command the Army of the Coasts of Brest. Léchelle was officially in command from 6 October. He was with the La Rochelle division at first and Kléber served as the interim commander of the Nantes and Mayence divisions in his absence. Leaving the La Rochelle division in charge of Alexis Chalbos, Léchelle assumed command from Kléber on 9 October.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are a}} growing number of cases where {{existing}} rails and infrastructure, in service or not, are being <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> torn up for trails. Two cases of this are in New York State, against the Catskill Mountain Railroad in Kingston, New York, and the Adirondack Scenic Railroad in Old Forge, New York. In Connecticut, the not-in-service section of track on the Valley Railroad has been proposed by locals to be converted to trail. Though perceived by residents to be, as it has not carried a train since the 1960s, the railroad has never been formally abandoned. The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection acquired the line from Penn Central in 1969, and subsequently signed a long-term lease with the railroad. The railroad has been continually working to bring this section of the line back into service. Both Departments strongly support the preservation of the line, and have provided support to the railroad with property encroachment from abutters and the provision of railroad ties. All three of these examples are heritage railroads, which serve to protect the history of the railroad. Their primary revenue is tourist operations, so rail traffic is seasonal; though all three have been granted rights to carry freight, should customers show interest.|$|E
