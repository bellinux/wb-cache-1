50|$|The SCC is {{essentially}} {{an updated version of}} the SIO, with more internal logic to allow it to directly implement a number of common data link layer protocols. To start with, the SCC included a hardware implementation of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC), which allowed it to <b>check,</b> <b>flag</b> and reject improper data without the support of the host computer. Higher-level protocols included BiSync, HDLC and SDLC. HDLC is better known in its implementation in the modem-oriented LAPM protocol, part of V.42. By moving the implementation of these protocols to hardware, the SCC made it easy to implement local area networking systems, like IBM's SNA, without the need for the host CPU to handle these details.|$|E
30|$|Once pairing {{process is}} complete, {{authentication}} module returns result values to a relevant module. The results values are module ID, the creation {{time of the}} results value, module name, module version, and <b>checked</b> <b>flag.</b> They are encrypted with a manufacturer’s public key before being transmitted. If authentication successes, <b>checked</b> <b>flag</b> has “Permitted”; if authentication fails, it has “not permitted”. Authentication module saves result values. After that, if the same module is inserted, the module <b>checks</b> <b>checked</b> <b>flag</b> of the result values, and, if “not Permitted”, it makes an authentication request again.|$|R

With the three cars running nose-to-tail on lap 194, Rahal passed Mears going into turn one to take the lead. Down the Long Pond straight, Sullivan slips by Mears as well, and {{set his sights on}} Rahal. In turn two, Sullivan passes Rahal with ease, and pulls out to a sizable lead. Heavy traffic on the final lap allowed Mears to close up, but Sullivan held off the challenge at the <b>checked</b> <b>flag</b> to win. Rahal finished third, blowing his engine as he crossed the finish line.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} pre-race ceremonies {{were held}} with the showing {{of the national}} colors along with the invocation service from a local minister. One of country music's top ten recording artists of 2006, Taylor Swift, sang the national anthem prior to the racing event. The green flag was officially waved at 2:35 p.m. and the <b>checked</b> <b>flag</b> was waved at approximately 5:49 p.m. After this race, Colombian native Juan Pablo Montoya and Australian driver Marcos Ambrose would temporarily become the foreigners that would consistently make the racing grid for all the future NASCAR Cup Series races along with limited degrees of success by Scottish IndyCar driver Dario Franchitti.|$|R

50|$|Another {{effective}} way of implementing synchronization is by using spinlocks. Before accessing any shared resource or piece of code, every processor <b>checks</b> a <b>flag.</b> If the flag is reset, then the processor sets the flag and continues executing the thread. But, if the flag is set (locked), the threads would keep spinning in a loop and keep <b>checking</b> if the <b>flag</b> is set or not. But, spinlocks are effective only if the flag is reset for lower cycles otherwise {{it can lead to}} performance issues as it wastes many processor cycles waiting.|$|R
5000|$|Thus {{an obvious}} {{way to handle}} signals is for signal {{handlers}} to set a global flag and have the event loop <b>check</b> for the <b>flag</b> immediately {{before and after the}} select (...) call; if it is set, handle the signal {{in the same manner as}} with events on file descriptors. Unfortunately, this gives rise to a race condition: if a signal arrives immediately between <b>checking</b> the <b>flag</b> and calling select (...) , it will not be handled until select (...) returns for some other reason (for example, being interrupted by a frustrated user).|$|R

The practice of documenting {{the location of the}} peak may serve as delta <b>check</b> <b>flags</b> in SPEP samples. Methods: We report on the inconsistent finding on two tests performed about three months apart. The inconsistency was discovered due to recognition of the change in the location of the monoclonal immunoglobulin on protein electrophoresis. Results: Repeat testing with a third specimen revealed that the first test was run on a wrong specimen. Conclusion: Recording the location of the monoclonal spike is recommended to serve as an additional âdeltaâ check.

The competing pilots are military and civilian pilots from around the world. Aero GP is the only international, televised event where aeroplanes race simultaneously. Aero GP officially started in 2005 in Slovenia. From there it has travelled to several countries in Europe and Middle East. Instead of the <b>checked</b> <b>flag</b> pattern, Aero GP judges its participants on the basis on points won in individual events and hence, there is no clear winner till the end.|$|R

40|$|Imagine {{having a}} single Web portal where all public surface {{transportation}} weather observations are collected, quality checked and {{made available to}} the transportation community, the weather enterprise and even individual users. After several years of investing in system design, implementation and testing, the U. S.

Clarus, which means “Clear ” in Latin, is the USDOT’s prototype surface transportation weather data management system. The Clarus System uses state of the art algorithms to quality check atmospheric and pavement observations from both fixed and mobile platforms. Data contributors can receive information on the health of their environmental sensor station (ESS) networks as well as the calibration of individual sensors.

40|$|Since 2008, the Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO) keeps {{installed}} a thermosalinometer (TSG) on board of R/V J. M. Navaz that operates on Galician coastal waters. Weekly, it covers {{the area between}} Vigo and Muros {{in the framework of}} an harmful algal bloom monitoring. High resolution and quality coastal data are very important in order to develop accurate behavior models. The TSG continuously measures the sea subsurface salinity, temperature, and fluorescence along the ships tracks. The classical approach to distribution maps is performing objective analysis of the collected data and assumes errors associated to coastal features. Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVA) allows the spatial interpolation of data over an adaptable mesh grid, taking into account coastlines and inlets, but also advection constraints. Calculations are optimized and rely on a finite element resolution and the software allows optimizing the analysis parameters, checking for duplicates and performing quality controls. The results of performing and compare DIVA and objective analysis show slight differences that can be appreciated between the inner part of the inlets and the open sea areas. The relative length of the whole data set allows considering also monthly, seasonal and annual variability. These climatological results, that will be updated systematically, can be useful not only for scientific research but also for coastal management activities. All this products, together with quality <b>check</b> <b>flags</b> and metadata information, give added value to the original TSG measures and that will allow a future reuse of data...|$|R

50|$|Busy-waiting is {{effective}} for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems. The use of shared memory and an atomic test-and-set instruction provides the mutual exclusion. A process can test-and-set on a location in shared memory, {{and since the}} operation is atomic, only one process can set the flag at a time. Any process that is unsuccessful in setting the flag can either go on to do other tasks and try again later, release the processor to another process and try again later, or continue to loop while <b>checking</b> the <b>flag</b> until it is successful in acquiring it.
