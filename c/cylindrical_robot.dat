40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for minimizing the travel effort of a mobile robot navigating in an unknown environment along a graph constructed on-line by the robot. The graph, called a roadmap, represents the free configuration-space of the robot, and the travel effort {{is measured by}} the length of the path traveled by the robot during the search. The algorithm, called Roadmap-A, strives to minimize the travel effort by combining features of the classical A and local graph-search algorithms. A user-specified parameter determines the relative emphasize on the two approaches, where = 0 corresponds to A while = 1 corresponds to local-search. We study the performance of the algorithm on roadmaps generated bya <b>cylindrical</b> mobile <b>robot</b> navigating in an unknown environment, using a potential-field roadmap construction method. However, Roadmap-A is general and can be used by any on-line roadmap construction method. We study the performance of Roadmap-A for various values of on simulated environments, and indicate how to best choose for a given class of environments...|$|R

The fuzzy adaptive law ensures the stability, convergence of the controlled outputs, and "boundedness" of adaptation parameters.

40|$|Abstract — Microrobots {{can make}} a great impact in medical {{applications}} such as minimally-invasive surgery, screening and diagnosis of diseases, targeted therapy and drug delivery. Small-sized bio-inspired robots can mimic flagellar propulsion mecha-nisms of microorganisms for actuation in microfluidic environ-ments, which are dominated by viscous forces. Microorganisms propel themselves {{by means of the}} motion of their flagella such as rotation of rigid helices or travelling planar waves on flexible tails similar to whipping motion. Here, we present characteriza-tion of swimming of onboard-powered autonomous <b>robots</b> inside <b>cylindrical</b> tubes. <b>Robots</b> consist of two links, head and tail, con-nected with a revolute joint. Rigid helical tails of the swimmer robots are made of steel wires with 12 different configurations of helical radius and pitch. From experiments forward linear veloc-ity of robots and angular velocities of the links are measured, and compared with the mathematical model, which is based on the resistive force theory. Results indicate that the motion of the swimmer inside channels can be predicted by means of the resis-tive force theory reasonably well...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the Abbott Liquid-Liquid Extraction Station {{was a result of}} the need for an automated system to perform aqueous extraction on large sets of newly synthesized organic compounds used for drug discovery. The system utilizes a <b>cylindrical</b> laboratory <b>robot</b> to shuttle sample vials between two loading racks, two identical extraction stations, and a centrifuge. Extraction is performed by detecting the phase interface (by difference in refractive index) of the moving column of fluid drawn from the bottom of each vial containing a biphasic mixture. The integration of interface detection with fluid extraction maximizes sample throughput. Abbott-developed electronics process the detector signals. Sample mixing is performed by high-speed solvent injection. Centrifuging of the samples reduces interface emulsions. Operating software permits the user to program wash protocols with any one of six solvents per wash cycle with as many cycle repeats as necessary. Station capacity is eighty, 15 ml vials. This system has proven successful with a broad spectrum of both ethyl acetate and methylene chloride based chemistries. The development and characterization of this automated extraction system will be presented...|$|R

First, we outline the fundamental {{properties of the}} Newton-Euler formulation of robot dynamics from the view point of parameter identification.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a pose-sensing system for soft robot arms integrating {{a set of}} macrobend stretch sensors. The macrobend sensory design in this study consists of optical fibres {{and is based on}} the notion that bending an optical fibre modulates the intensity of the light transmitted through the fibre. This sensing method is capable of measuring bending, elongation and compression in soft continuum robots and is also applicable to wearable sensing technologies, e. g. pose sensing in the wrist joint of a human hand. In our arrangement, applied to a <b>cylindrical</b> soft <b>robot</b> arm, the optical fibres for macrobend sensing originate from the base, extend to the tip of the arm, and then loop back to the base. The connectors that link the fibres to the necessary opto-electronics are all placed {{at the base of the}} arm, resulting in a simplified overall design. The ability of this custom macrobend stretch sensor to flexibly adapt its configuration allows preserving the inherent softness and compliance of the robot which it is installed on. The macrobend sensing system is immune to electrical noise and magnetic fields, is safe (because no electricity is needed at the sensing site), and is suitable for modular implementation in multi-link soft continuum robotic arms. The measurable light outputs of the proposed stretch sensor vary due to bend-induced light attenuation (macrobend loss), which is a function of the fibre bend radius as well as the number of repeated turns. The experimental study conducted as part of this research revealed that the chosen bend radius has a far greater impact on the measured light intensity values than the number of turns (if greater than five). Taking into account that the bend radius is the only significantly influencing design parameter, the macrobend stretch sensors were developed to create a practical solution to the pose sensing in soft continuum robot arms. Henceforward, the proposed sensing design was benchmarked against an electromagnetic tracking system (NDI Aurora) for validation...|$|R
