The general principle of proportionality therefore requires that a measure is both appropriate and necessary, and as such the European Court of Justice to review both the legality of a measure, but also to some extent the merit of legislative and administrative measures. Therefore, the general principle of European Union law of proportionality is often considered as the most far-reaching {{ground of judicial review}} and of particular importance in public law cases. However, because the proportionality concept potentially concerns the merits of a measure, European judges may defer to the choice of the authority which has adopted the measure, or make what are frequently political decisions. In Fedesa the European Court of Justice explained that [...] "it must be states that in matters concerning the common agricultural policy the Community legislature has the discretionary power which corresponds to the political responsibilities given to it by... the Treaty.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to develop a method for {{assessing}} Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) according to various criteria, and to develop recommendations to improve statements and the EIA procedure. To develop a method to assess report quality, the most significant current methods were examined. Their advantages and disadvantages were analyzed and, as a result, the most appropriate method structure was defined – a control list with quality criteria. To determine the quality criteria of an EIA, the effective basic principles of the EIA were formulated based on sources in the literature. During the study, the three most significant elements of a quality EIA were defined. These have been incorporated into the method developed in this project as the most significant criteria. As a result, a systematic method to assess an individual EIS was developed. The method includes quality criteria, which have been determined to be the most significant as a result of an analysis of the efficiency of the EIA procedure. The method has been adapted to the planned amendments in the EIA directive, incorporating these criteria. The structure of the method adheres to another fundamental goal of the directive's amendments – to decrease the administrative load of the EIA procedure. It is anticipated that with the aid of this method, by assessing only the most important report elements in depth, that the time necessary for a <b>competent</b> <b>institution</b> to evaluate a report will be reduced...|$|E

As foreign trade relations developed, it was necessary toestablish a quality control system for wood-based panels. The development of the quality system started at the State Offi ce for Standardization and Metrology (SOSM). The Faculty of Forestry was intensively involved in all activities related {{to the establishment of}} the quality system, such as the establishment of testing laboratories, education, certifi cation, quality control, work in technical committees, and special activities were directed towards the implementation of technical regulations in wood technology practice. The system was fi rst introduced by the Order of obligatory certifi cation of particleboard panels for general use and construction (Offi cial Gazette “Sl. list” 61 / 83), based on laws of the former state. In accordance with the Order, in 1995 SOSM authorized the Faculty of Forestry for conducting the certifi cation of particleboards. The Ministry of Economy was also included {{in the development of the}} system in areas not covered by the Order and regulations under SOSM’s jurisdiction. In the field of wood-based panels, a respectable system was built by the end of 1998. The next step was the preparation of technical regulations with the implementation of harmonized European standards. However, for reasons beyond understanding, the system completely collapsed, and in early 2004 it practically ceased to exist. The Ministry of Economy and the Croatian Government abolished all decisions on quality control of wood-based panels, except the obligatorily certifi cation of particleboards performed by SOSM, and it stopped its activities in 2003.

40|$|Eritrea {{is a new}} and {{developing}} country in East Africa that was declared independent in May 1993. Since independence, Eritrea has been engaged in all-out efforts to rebuild its war-shattered social and economic infrastructure. One of the vital programs in the campaign for national rehabilitation {{has been in the}} field of education, which has mainly focused on training skilled personnel for such understaffed vocations as teaching, law, medicine and administration. A rapid improvement in educational facilities has been achieved. The University of Asmara, which was the only institution of higher education in the country, has been engaged in fulfilling the high level human resources that the country needs. Much like many other universities, the mission of the University of Asmara is the discovery, generation and dissemination of knowledge in the service of society. Therefore, the university has been expected to contribute as much as possible to face these challenges. In order to achieve its goals, the university has emphasized the need for reviewing the academic programs and the curriculum. Admission to the university is based on a national examination, which is called the Eritrean Secondary Education Certificate Examination (ESECE). Both the University of Asmara and the Ministry of Education are represented in the ESECE board whose task it is to provide guidelines for the routine activities of the ESECE and to forward fresh initiatives with the aim of developing the center into a strong and <b>competent</b> <b>institution.</b> The entrance examination, which usually lasts for three days, requires the candidates to take two compulsory examinations, English and Mathematics. Candidates also have to take at least three more elective subjects from Biology, Chemistry, Physics, General Science, Geography, History, Economics, Bookkeeping, Agriculture and general knowledge. The criterion for entrance to the university is based on the average grade point average for Mathematics, English and three other elective courses. Due to the high number of applicants for admissions to the university, the selection processes are usually highly competitive. Until 1994 about 10 % and from 1995 through 2002 about 19 % of the candidates were admitted to the university. The low percentage of students that pass the ESECE examinations justifies the need to investigate the quality of the ESECE During their stay at the university, students are provided with free education, free meals and free medical services. Dormitories are also provided freely to students coming from outside the central region where the university is located. However, in spite of all these free student services and the very competitive selection processes, the attrition rate at freshman level is about 35 % on average every year. The attrition rate for second year and above is about 15 %. These figures indicate that the attrition at the university is very high and results in a low proportion of graduates. Therefore, the high attrition rate at the university justifies the need to investigate the factors at student and department levels that influence the performance of students during their university career. This implies also that research on the predictive validity of the ESECE is very important. Based on the problems the University of Asmara encounters, the key problems addressed in this research are: (a) To what extent does the ESECE test the ability of students in a satisfactory way? (b) What are important factors that affect the students' performance levels at the university...|$|E

S razvojem vanjskotrgovinskih odnosa bilo je nužno uspostaviti sustav kontrole kvalitete drvnih ploča, a taj proces počinje u sklopu Državnog zavoda za normizaciju i mjeriteljstvo (DZNM). Pod ingerencijom DZNM-a provodi se edukacija, ovlašćivanje, osnivanje i rad tehničkih odbora (TO), donose se novi propisi te obavlja implementacija europskoga tehničkog zakonodavstva. Prema Naredbi o obaveznom certificiranju ploča iverica za opću uporabu i graditeljstvo (Sl. list 61 / 83), DZNM ovlastio je godine 1995. Šumarski fakultet za obavljanje poslova certifi ciranja ploča iverica. Ministarstvo gospodarstva također se uključilo u izgradnju sustava, pa je krajem 1998. godine na području drvnih ploča izgrađen respektabilan sustav kontrole kvalitete. Sljedeći korak bila je izrada tehničkih propisa i implementacija europskih normi. No tada slijede potezi zbog kojih dolazi do potpunog raspada sustava, koji početkom 2004. godine više praktički ne postoji. Ministarstvo gospodarstva i Vlada Republike Hrvatske ukidaju sve odluke o kontroli kvalitete drvnih ploča, osim obveznog certifi ciranja ploča iverica, koje je pod ingerencijom DZNM-a, a on prestaje raditi tijekom 2003. godine. Ministarstvo zaštite okoliša, prostornog uređenja i graditeljstva (MZOPUG) kao nadležna institucija preuzima 2005. godine potvrđivanje ploča iverica, a potom u tehničku regulativu za graditeljstvo uvodi europske norme za drvne ploče. No potvrđivanje ploča iverica i dalje se obavlja prema normama bivše države.
