40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this review {{was to provide a}} {{critical}} evaluation of medical literature on so-called ‘‘cardiac cephalgia’ ’ or ‘‘cardiac cephalalgia’’. The 2004 International Classification of Headache Disorders codes cardiac <b>cephalgia</b> to 10. 6 in the group of secondary head-aches attributed to disorder of homoeostasis. This headache is hardly recognizable and is associated to an ischaemic cardiovascular event, of which it may be the only mani-festation in 27 % of cases. It usually occurs after exertion. Sometimes routine examinations, cardiac enzymes, ECG and even exercise stress test prove negative. In such cases, only a coronary angiogram can provide sufficient evidence for diagnosis. Cardiac <b>cephalgia</b> manifests itself without a specific pattern of clinical features: indeed, in this headache subtype there is a high variability of clinical manifestations between different patients and also within the same patient. It ‘‘mimics’ ’ sometimes a form of migraine either accompanied or not by autonomic symptoms, sometimes a form of tension-type headache; on other occasions, it exhibits characteristics that can hardly be interpreted as typical of primary headache. Pain location is highly vari-able. When the headache occurs as the only manifestation of an acute coronary event, the clues for suspicion are a) older age at onset, b) no past medical history of headache, c) presence of risk factors for vascular disorders and d) onset of headache under stress. Knowledge of cardiac <b>cephalgia</b> is scarce, due to its rare clinical occurrence and to the scant importance given to headache as a symptom concomitantly with an ischaemic cardiac event...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Headaches are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} neurological disorder and among the most frequent symptoms in general practice. Headache disorder is a major public health issue and is a great burden for a person, health care system, and a society. Most people having headache do not ask for a specialized medical care and take analgesics without any control, which complicates the statistical analysis of the actual prevalence of <b>cephalgias</b> among the population. Aim: to reveal the prevalence of headache among the medical students and to draw {{their attention to the}} need for a differentiated approach to treatment. Materials and Methods: We conducted a survey of 146 students of Bukovynian State Medical University aged 19 to 26 years by using specially designed questionnaires. The type of headache was established by diagnostic criteria of the classification of the International Headache Society, 2003. Results: Our study has found that headaches bother 121 (82. 8 %) students. Among respondents periodic headache was observed in 71. 9 % (105 students). 16 (10. 1 %) students experienced chronic headaches that bothered them more than 15 days a month. Among girls the prevalence of headache was significantly higher than among men - 62. 1 % and 38. 9 % respectively. Among the students the most frequent headache (58. 7 %) was tension headache, 9. 1 % of respondents had migraine headache, 32. 2 % felt other types of headaches. According to ICHD II, infrequent episodic tension-type headache amounted to 71. 3 %, frequent episodic tension-type headache - 26. 2 %, chronic tension-type headache - 2 5 %. Because of headache 81. 7 % of students are forced to take analgesics: 65. 3 % - 1 - 4 times a month, 27. 6 % - 5 - 9 times per month, 7. 1 % - more than 10 times per month. The majority of students did not consult the doctor, and independently used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antispasmodics. Conclusion: By means of the research there was found a high prevalence of headaches among medical students. There was determined the prevalence of primary <b>cephalgias,</b> namely, migraine without aura and episodic tension-type headaches. There was shown a lack of awareness of students about the causes of headache reflected in inadequate symptomatic treatment in most cases...|$|R
40|$|All {{symptoms}} {{and signs of}} uncomplicated malaria are non-specific, as shared with other febrile conditions, and can occur early or later {{in the course of}} the disease. In endemic areas, the presence of hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and anaemia is clearly associated with malaria, particularly in children. Fever, <b>cephalgias,</b> fatigue, malaise, and musculoskeletal pain constitute the most frequent clinical features in malaria. Following single exposure to Plasmodium falciparum infection, the patient will either die in the acute attack or survive with the development of some immunity. Elderly individuals are prone to a more severe course of disease. The non-fatal P. vivax and P. ovale cause similar initial illnesses, with bouts of fever relapsing periodically, but irregularly over a period of up to 5 years. Renal involvement of a moderate degree is more common in mild falciparum malaria than initially suspected. The liver is also afflicted in mild disease, but organ damage is limited and fully reversible after parasitological cure. Whereas the cardiotoxic adverse effects of antimalarial chemotherapeutics are well known, clinically relevant cardiac involvement in humans is rare in severe disease and even rarer in uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Co-infection can aggravate malaria.

40|$|Headache is {{the most}} common somatic {{complaint}} in children and adolescents. The evaluation should include detailed history of children and adolescents completed by detailed general and neurological examinations. Moreover, the possible role of psychological factors, life events and excessively stressful lifestyle in influencing recurrent headache need to be checked. The choice of laboratory tests rests on the differential diagnosis suggested by the history, the character and temporal pattern of the headache, and the physical and neurological examinations. Subjects who have any signs or symptoms of focal/progressive neurological disturbances should be investigated by neuroimaging techniques. The electroencephalogram and other neurophysiological examinations are of limited value in the routine evaluation of headaches. In a primary headache disorder, headache itself is the illness and headache is not attributed to any other disorder (e. g. migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic <b>cephalgias).</b> In secondary headache disorders, headache is the symptom of identifiable structural, metabolic or other abnormality. Red flags include the first or worst headache ever in the life, recent headache onset, increasing severity or frequency, occipital location, awakening from sleep because of headache, headache occurring exclusively in the morning associated with severe vomiting and headache associated with straining. Thus, the differential diagnosis between primary and secondary headaches rests mainly on clinical criteria. A thorough evaluation of headache in children and adolescents is necessary to make the correct diagnosis and initiate treatment, bearing in mind that children with headache are more likely to experience psychosocial adversity and to grow up with an excess of both headache and other physical and psychiatric symptoms and this creates an important healthcare problem for their future life...|$|R

40|$|Frequent episodic tension-type {{headache}} (ETTH) is {{a serious}} medical problem that is primarily due to its high prevalence. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) whose efficiency {{is determined by the}} rapid and complete regression of <b>cephalgia</b> are primarily used to relieve an ETTH attack. One of the ways to enhance the effect of NSAIDs is their combination with agents that accelerate their absorption or potentiate their action, with caffeine in particular; however, the use of combination agents is limited by a risk for drug-induced headache. A step {{on the road to the}} design of effective and safe analgesics has been the development of the combination drug Novigan that contains ibuprofen (400 mg) and the spasmolytics pitofenone (5 mg) and fenpiverinium (0. 1 mg). Objective: to study the efficacy of Novigan versus ibuprofen 400 mg in relieving an ETTH attack. Subjects and methods. Fifty patients (mean age 37. 1 ± 10. 9 years) with frequent ETTH that met the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2 nd Edition, were examined. For relief of ETTH attacks, 30 patients used Novigan and 20 took ibuprofen in a dose of 400 mg. Results. There was a significant reduction in the intensity of <b>cephalgia</b> 49. 9 ± 35. 8 and 68. 2 ± 45. 9 min after drug administration in the Novigan and ibuprofen 400 mg groups, respectively (p = 0. 007).

The efficacy predictors were less pain intensity (p < 0. 001) and a shorter time after onset (p < 0. 001) in the ibuprofen 400 mg group at administration of the drug and only less pain intensity in the Novigan group at that moment (p = 0. 07). Conclusion. Novigan is a combination analgesic that rapidly and effectively relieves an ETTH attack, including that of high intensity, as well as extended ETTH attack...|$|E
40|$|Headache {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complaints}} of children and adolescents. The most often causes of <b>cephalgia</b> in children are primary headaches (mainly migraine and tension-type headache). Recently there has been a significant increase in prevalence of primary headaches, which can be due to the changes of children’s way of life. The lack of the strict recommendations on symptomatic and preventive treatment of primary headaches in children in Russia often leads to erroneous indications. Inappropriate treatment can result in migraine and tension-type headache course aggravation with the formation of chronic daily headache, development of medicine-induced headache and other undesirable side-effects. The literature review covers the questions of therapy of the main forms of primary headaches in children: migraines and tension-type headaches. In the first part of the article the issues of diagnostics, algorithm of treatment and non-medicinal methods of treatment of headaches are discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Tranylcypromine, {{a useful}} {{antidepressant}} agent, {{has been linked}} with a clinical syndrome of undetermined incidence characterized by exceedingly severe and prolonged headache. Associated phenomena may include paroxysmal hypertension, pallor, chest pain and collapse. This violent reaction {{does not seem to}} be related to age, sex, duration of treatment, or pre-existing cardiovascular disease; nor is it possible to predict in whom it will occur. The clinical picture may sometimes be quite similar to that produced by subarachnoid hemorrhage or by pheochromocytoma. The mechanism of action is not known, although it is possible that the syndrome may be due to an amphetamine-like effect; i. e., that tranylcypromine influences the adrenergic component of the reticular activating system. The occurrence of severe headache in the course of tranylcypromine therapy is an indication for immediate withdrawal of the drug. Tranylcypromine <b>cephalgia</b> should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis of sudden, violent and prostrating headache...|$|E
