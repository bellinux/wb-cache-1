In vitro digestion coupled with the Caco- 2 cell culture model was used to evaluate the bioaccessibility and cellular uptake of Bc from OFSP in the presence of pink grapefruit (pGF) or white grapefruit (wGF) juices. The addition of grapefruit juices significantly decreased the bioaccessibility, by up to 30 %, but not the cellular uptake of Bc from boiled OFSP. Lycopene, but more probably naringin, present in grapefruit juices was suspected to be responsible for the inhibitory effect of the citrus juices on Bc bioaccessibility. This inhibition was apparently due in part to competition for incorporation between Bc and naringin into mixed micelles during in vitro digestion.

Laboratory-scale experiments studied the effectiveness of crude seed extracts (CSEs) and purified proteins of Vigna unguiculata (VUP), Parkinsonia aculeata (PAP) and Voandzeia subterranea (VS) seeds, which are used traditionally for clarification of turbid water.

40|$|Citrus fruits {{are thought}} to have {{inhibitory}} effects on oxidative stress, thereby attenuating the onset and progression of cancer and cardiovascular disease; however, there are few reports assessing their effect on vascular remodeling. Here, we investigated the effect of drinking the juice of two different citrus fruits on vascular neointima formation using a cuff-induced vascular injury mouse model. Male C 57 BL 6 mice were divided into five groups as follows: 1) Control (water) (C), 2) 10 % Citrus unshiu (CU) juice (CU 10), 3) 40 % CU juice (CU 40), 4) 10 % Citrus iyo (CI) juice (CI 10), and 5) 40 % CI juice (CI 40). After drinking them for 2 weeks from 8 weeks of age, cuff injury was induced by polyethylene cuff placement around the femoral artery. Neointima formation was significantly attenuated in CU 40, CI 10 and CI 40 compared with C; however, no remarkable preventive effect was observed in CU 10. The increases in levels of various inflammatory markers including cytokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein- 1, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), IL- 1 β, and tumor necrosis factor-α in response to vascular injury did not differ significantly between C, CU 10 and CI 10.

40|$|Fibre-rich <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> {{are playing}} an {{increasing}} role in healthy nutrition, and consumers are regarding them, especially citrus juices of 100 % fruit content, as reliable sources of vitamin C. Nevertheless relatively few scientific {{data are available}} on vitamin C retention during the heat treatment of aseptically packed <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> made from <b>fruit</b> concentrates. Authors investigated this problem {{within the scope of}} OTKA T 014965 research project (Körmendy et al., 1998, 1999 a, 1999 b; Pátkai, 1998). Instead of separate case studies on different types of <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> and technologies, authors analysed the vitamin C content of model solutions with similar composition to real citrus juices as a function of temperature and duration of heat treatment and that of initial oxygen and ascorbic acid concentration. Based on the measured data, they elaborated kinetic relations and determined the reaction rate constants of vitamin C decomposition under the experimental conditions. By means of the calculated kinetic relations and reaction rate constants one can estimate the losses of vitamin C in the case of known parameters of the heat treatment, packaging material, oxygen and vitamin C concentration within the investigated domain. Results may promote technology and product development in the field of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juices...</b>|$|R
40|$|Naringinases has {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in recent years due to its hydrolytic activities which include the production of rhamnose, and prunin and debittering of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juices.</b> While this enzyme is widely distributed in fungi, its production from bacterial sources is less commonly known. Fungal naringinase are very important as they are used industrially in large amounts and have been extensively studied during the past decade. In this article, production of bacterial naringinase and potential biotechnological applications are discussed. Bacterial rhamnosidases are exotype enzymes that hydrolyse terminal non-reducing Î±-l-rhamnosyl groups from Î±-l-rhamnose containing polysaccharides and glycosides. Structurally, they are classified into family 78 of glycoside hydrolases and characterized by the presence of Asp 567 and Glu 841 in their active site. Optimization of fermentation conditions and enzyme engineering will allow the development of improved rhamnosidases for advancing suggested industrial applications. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Food group {{contributions}} to energy, carbohydrate, protein, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, calcium, iron, folate, zinc, vitamins A and C were evaluated for Canadian adults aged 18 [...] 65 years. Twenty four hour recall {{data from the}} 1997 [...] 98 Food Habits of Canadians survey were used. Mean nutrient intakes exceeded the RNI for all age-gender groups except, calcium for older women. Mean iron (women 18 [...] 49 years) and zinc (men and women 50 [...] 65 years) intakes were borderline. The differences in food group contribution to nutrient intake among smokers and non-smokers indicated that smokers generally obtained nutrients from foods higher in energy and fat and lower in other nutrients. Important food sources for individuals meeting the RNI for calcium were fluid milk and cheese. Important sources of folate were <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juices,</b> breads, and lettuce/cabbages/greens as were cereals and beef/veal for iron. Zinc sources were primarily other beef cuts or ground beef...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that oxidant/antioxidant imbalance triggers cell damage that in turn causes a number of lung diseases. Flavonoids are known for their health benefits, and <b>Citrus</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>juices</b> are one of the main food sources of these secondary plant metabolites. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of the flavonoid fraction of bergamot and orange juices, on H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress in human lung epithelial A 549 cells. First we tested the antioxidant properties of both extracts in cell-free experimental models and then we assayed their capability to prevent the cytotoxic effects induced by H 2 O 2. Our results demonstrated that both Citrus juice extracts reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species and membrane lipid peroxidation, improve mitochondrial functionality, and prevent DNA-oxidative damage in A 549 cells incubated with H 2 O 2. Our data indicate that the mix of flavonoids present in both bergamot and orange juices may be of use in preventing oxidative cell injury and pave the way for further research into a novel healthy approach to avoid lung disorders...|$|R
40|$|Naringinase has {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in recent years due to its hydrolytic activities which include the production of rhamnose and prunin and debittering of <b>citrus</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>juices.</b> Screening of fifteen marine-derived fungi, locally isolated from Ismalia, Egypt, for naringinase enzyme production, indicated that Aspergillus niger was the most promising. In solid state fermentation (SSF) of the agroindustrial waste, orange rind was used as a substrate containing naringin. Sequential optimization strategy, based on statistical experimental designs, was employed to enhance the production of the debittering naringinase enzyme. Effects of 19 variables were examined for their significance on naringinase production using Plackett-Burman factorial design. Significant parameters were further investigated using Taguchi’s (L 16 45) orthogonal array design. Based on statistical analysis (ANOVA), the optimal combinations of the major constituents of media for maximal naringinase production were evaluated as follows: 15 [*]g orange rind waste, 30 [*]mL moisture content, 1 % grape fruit, 1 % NaNO 3, 0. 5 % KH 2 PO 4, 5 [*]mM MgSO 4, 5 [*]mM FeSO 4, and the initial pH 7. 5.
