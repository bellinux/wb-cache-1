In 1971, the college began awarding associate degrees, and opened its doors in Hyde Park in the following year. From 1974 to 1979, the school built three residence halls, a culinary library, a <b>career</b> <b>planning</b> center, and a learning resources center. From 1982 to 1984, the American Bounty and Caterina de' Medici Restaurants and St. Andrew's Café opened. In 1984, the school's continuing education center (later named the J. Willard Marriott Education Center) opened, and the school improved its teaching kitchens and constructed an experimental kitchen and food laboratory. In 1990, the school opened a baking and pastry facility, named two years later as the Shunsuke Takaki School of Baking and Pastry. In 1993, the school opened its Conrad N. Hilton Library and began offering bachelor's degree programs. In 1995, the school's first branch campus opened, the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St. Helena, California. In 1998, the Student Recreation Center was opened.|$|E

40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Science) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. The prime {{objective}} of the <b>Career</b> <b>Plan</b> Tracker {{is to build a}} <b>career</b> <b>plan</b> that recommends <b>career</b> tasks given in the career-counseling framework called "The Serious Job Seeker". A unique <b>career</b> <b>plan</b> is generated for each individual user based on the individual user's skill set, personality type and background. A prominent part of the <b>career</b> <b>plan</b> includes recommendations of career task times for each recommended career task. Moreover, the <b>Career</b> <b>Plan</b> Tracker takes into account the various time restrictions the user may have in his life and generates a <b>career</b> <b>plan</b> for a schedule that is shorter than the recommended ideal schedule. For instance, the ideal schedule to complete the career acquisition process may require three to six months. Nevertheless, if a user has only two months, the user can still have a <b>career</b> <b>plan</b> built for just two months without losing much of the user???s chances in succeeding through the career acquisition process. The <b>Career</b> <b>Plan</b> Tracker categorizes this problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and uses a meta-heuristic algorithm called Simulated Annealing to solve it. The <b>Career</b> <b>Plan</b> Tracker is an android application developed for android devices. The backend of the application is hosted on a cloud service called Parse.

What leads high school students to those uncertain future plans? What mechanisms are involved in emerging those uncertain <b>career</b> <b>plans</b> ? This study attempts to answer these questions based on a questionnaire survey data collected from 1, 804 high school senior students in Tokyo. The analyses find : 1. general high school {{students are more likely to}} become "MUGYOSHA" than those at vocational high schools; 2. delayed decision about future plans lead to "MUGYOSHA"; 3. prospective "MUGYOSHA" students tend to have bad school records both in cognitive (academic) and non-cognitive (behavioral) aspects, and disregard good school records as important selection criteria for college admission and labor entry; 4. student'social backgrounds do not strongly relate with the emerge of "MUGYOSHA"; and 5. miscommunication with parents about their future discourages students to make clear <b>career</b> <b>plans.</b> Based on these findings, we argue that recent educational reform proposals in Japan, which try to mitigates entrance examination pressures on students, may lead to produce more students with uncertain <b>career</b> <b>plans</b> in future...|$|R
