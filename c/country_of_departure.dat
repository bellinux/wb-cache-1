Tensions between ambitions for mobility and imposed immobility are reflected in the way that Anglophone Cameroonians have started since the late 1990 s to refer to emigration in Pidgin as ‘bushfalling’. Bushfalling is the act of going out to the wilderness (bush) to hunt down meat (money) and bring back these trophies. On the basis of an ethnographic study of migration brokers, consulate officers, aspiring migrants and their families, as well as deported migrants, this research investigates what makes young Cameroonians migrate at all cost. The books argues that we can only come to understand dynamics of trafficking and bushfalling if we take seriously the perspectives <b>of</b> people in <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> as well as the plurality of regulatory dynamics that shape conditions <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b> By studying rather than presupposing the place of state, market and family actors within conditions <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> this study unravels how the phenomena of bushfalling and trafficking do not exist merely because individuals chose to migrate at all cost...|$|R

The aim has been to present and evaluate previous research on the migration to USSR and Soviet Karelia to find shortcomings, which can function as a point <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> for further studies. Previous research finds that the migration to the USSR was special, due to the strong political awareness of a not insignificant part of the migrants.

The theoretical approaches to class, gender, ethnicity and generation has consistently been connected to previous research to demonstrate how further studies can be constructed. However, the choice of these theoretical approaches also finds its foundation in the inherent advantages for study of social relations, the capability to categorize people, the inherent relation of power, and the connection to a person’s identity. As a result, I claim that the use of the concepts class, gender, ethnicity, and generation can create a bigger understanding of the migration process, about the migrants in both their <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> and the daily life of the migrants in their new home country...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{phenomenon}} of migration {{is one of}} the things which has had the greatest influence on the history of humanity, involving millions of people. Today men and women of all ages, mostly young people from economically disadvantaged areas of the planet, migrate from one continent to another, for economic, political or religious reasons. They move towards geopolitical areas which are economically and politically less troubled, leaving others where the living conditions are no longer possible. In some cases, it is a question of looking for better conditions of existence (economic causes); in other cases of mere survival (political and religious causes). Both for operational reasons and of interpretation, it is necessary to distinguish between the causes of expulsion and the consequent migration types. It is important to understand whether we are facing migration of a political or an economic nature, but it should be noted, also, that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between politics and economics. It is a movement that creates upheaval and irreversible processes in both the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> and destination. We are therefore facing a historical process of enormous importance that contributes to change the human geography and the international scene. We are facing two large economic and political areas: one of expulsion and another of attraction, with two very different types of living conditions. Every generation enjoys a condition of life and existence merely because it is born in one place rather than in another; an ascribed status that can even prevent attempts at all forms of mobility. A geographical area that is seeing its attractiveness increase is that of the EU; partly because of its colonial history, but also because of its geo-economic-political position, and also recently because of the upheavals following the fall of regimes in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East. </p...|$|R

We are critical of his theory. In our study, we adopted the mastering of the Chinese language as the measurement of human capital at the destination. Remarkably, mastering Chinese can help potential migrants make their decision regarding migration. Different from Chiswick's theory, other scholars operationalized the concept as whether one had visited his or her target country before and whether one had worked {{in his or her}} target country before (Massey [1999]). These factors apparently affect one's migration decisions when one is still in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> rather than effective only after one's arrival at the destination.

Since visa is demanded for border crossing, but not granted to persons who are assumed to be refugees, border crossing with false documents or by the use of human smugglers, is the only available way for asylum seekers to reach the states where their claims for protection may be examined.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study of}} identity formation in migrants of Japanese and Okinawan descent who relocate from countries of South America to mainland Japan and to the island prefecture of Okinawa, initially to seek economic advantage. The migrants, called Nikkeijin, are predominantly progeny of earlier migrants from Japan to South America. In a cross-generational sense, they are return migrants. The ethnographic study, based on field research conducted in two sites on the mainland and in Okinawa, compares Nikkeijin experience and attitudes as they interact with native Japanese. Because of their Japanese background, Nikkeijin benefit from privileged visa status; nonetheless, in Japan they are treated as foreigners, and their identity diversifies. Nikkeijin are found to construct simultaneous social fields in both the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> and the new environment. This situation may be recognized through the concept of transnationalism. I argue that Nikkeijin self-identity can be multiple and flexible, and does not necessarily coincide with social identity. An increasing and officially promoted diasporic consciousness among migrants of Okinawan descent would seem to produce a different ethnic response to any on the mainland and a greater potential for integration.

Why would they take this kind of risk yet again? Between 2007 and 2009, Sandra Gifford and I led a research project that included interviews with asylum seekers and refugees living in Indonesia, the last <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> for most people arriving here by boat. We discovered that asylum seekers and refugees don’t necessarily want to make Australia their home. They just want to have a home: a place where they can live in safety, support themselves with dignity, give their children a future through education, and belong. The knowledge that they had a realistic prospect of being resettled in a country that could fulfil these needs would have been enough to enable them to bear short-term insecurity. In fact, if these basic human needs could be fulfilled in Indonesia, they would have been happy to settle there. Unfortunately, neither a home in its true meaning nor the hope of one in the future can be found in Indonesia, or in most other countries in our region.

40|$|While {{many public}} figures {{and civil society}} members {{perceive}} irregular migration {{as the source of}} various problems that modern societies encounter nowadays, this paper argues that this form of migration is rather the output of an outdated international system. The latter tends to protect the modern societies by enforcing the borders of nation states and leaving the most disadvantaged individuals {{on the wrong side of}} state frontiers. Thus, irregular migration is a complex phenomenon that one needs to approach critically at both macro and micro levels, in order to understand its origins and find the means to address it. Warsan Shire, a Somali poet who tried to explain the migrant crisis that the Mediterranean region has been witnessing for decades said: “Nobody puts his or her kids on the boat unless the sea is safer than the land” (Van Heelsum, 2016). His quote clearly highlights two realities that are attributed to irregular migration. It first shows the immensity of the hardships in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> that oblige migrants to flee to another place where the living conditions are allegedly better. Second, it largely reflects strong aspirations among migrants to achieve their aim amidst tighter border controls and asylum policies that hosting countries impose to divert the migrant flows. In this research I aim to highlight how the aspirations shape and influence on the trajectories of migrants, by focusing on selected biographies of a diverse group of Syrian migrants who arrived in Norway. I explain how migrants react to various personal as well as other conditions that influence on them while they are experiencing different phases of (im) mobility...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} provide an estimate of the medical risks of body packing, describe predictors for hospital referral in detained body packers and provide an estimate for the prevalence of body packing in the Amsterdam area. From May 2007 to December 2008, we studied medical records of body packers immediately detained after arrival at Amsterdam Schiphol airport, hospital records of both detained body packers and self-referrers at two emergency departments of hospitals in Amsterdam and records kept by forensic physicians in charge of post-mortem examinations of all unnatural deaths in the area (years 2005 - 2009). In airport detainees, the hospital referral rate was 4. 2 % (30 out of 707 detained body packers), the surgery rate was 1. 3 %. Significant predictors of hospital referral were delayed production of drug packets after arrest, cigarette smoking and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b> The surgery rate in self-referrers was comparable to the rate observed in those referred from the detention centre to hospital (30 % vs. 31 %). In addition, from 2005 to 2009, 20 proven cases of lethal body packing were identified. Based on our data, it is estimated that minimally 38 % of all incoming body packers were missed by airport controls. The risk for lethal complications due to body packing is low on a population basis and comparable to other studies. This also applies for the hospital referral and surgery rates found in this study. Cigarette smoking has not yet been described in the literature as a potential predictor for hospital referral in detained body packers and therefore deserves attention in future research.

We use micro-economic data from a 2006 survey on 639 African migrants living in Johannesburg. Due to the diversity of the reasons for migration to South Africa and the regime change there, in addition to the traditional variables (income, household size in the host country, age, sex, education etc.) we consider the impact <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> conditions from the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin (war, conflict, persecutions), the regime change and political environment in the host country (access to democracy, restrictive migratory law) and subjective variables (perception of relative wealth, attachment to the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin) on remittances. The results highlight the importance <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> conditions and subjective variables as determinants of remittances. Having left one’s <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin due to violence or conflict has a negative effect on the probability of remitting but does not influence the amounts transferred, which depend more on the current situation of the migrant in the host <b>country</b> (income, size <b>of</b> family, etc.).
