5|$|The touch was {{originally}} meant to cure tuberculous <b>cervical</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> (commonly {{referred to as}} scrofula or the King's Evil), rheumatism, convulsions, fevers, blindness, goitre and other ailments. Since the reign of Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), however, the touch was applied only to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and the changes were minor; Elizabeth I {{made the sign of}} the cross above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, James I (r. 1603–1625), made stroking motions above the abscesses instead of actually touching them.|$|E
5|$|The royal touch (also {{known as}} the king's touch) {{was a form of}} laying on of hands, whereby French and English monarchs touched their subjects, {{regardless}} of social classes, with the intent to cure them of various diseases and conditions. The thaumaturgic touch was most commonly applied to people suffering from tuberculous <b>cervical</b> <b>lymphadenitis</b> (better known as scrofula or the King's Evil), and exclusively to them from the 16th century onwards. The disease rarely resulted in death and often went into remission on its own, giving the impression that the monarch's touch cured it. The claimed power was most notably exercised by monarchs who sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their reign and of their newly founded dynasties.|$|E

Forty-eight, 22, and 4 patients had histologically confirmed tuberculous, nonspecific, and malignant lymphadenopathy. Fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination alone could detect <b>cervical</b> tuberculous <b>lymphadenitis</b> in 37 patients (77 %).

2500|$|Up to 25% of {{patients}} with TB of the lymph nodes (TB lymphadenitis) will get worse on treatment before they get better and this usually happens {{in the first few}} months of treatment.

[...] With patience, two to three months into treatment the lymph nodes start to shrink again and re-aspiration or re-biopsy of the lymph nodes is unnecessary: if repeat microbiological studies are ordered, they will show the continued presence of viable bacteria with the same sensitivity pattern, which further adds to the confusion: physicians inexperienced in the treatment of TB will then often add second-line drugs in the belief that the treatment is not working.

MethodsTwo hundred and nineteen patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis, aged 14 years or more, who presented with a neck mass to the Department of Pathology, Ujjain Hospital, Ujjain, India were included in the study. The presenting clinical symptoms and signs were compared between men and women and with the cytology of fine needle aspirates from the lymph nodes.

One or more constitutional symptoms were present in 56. 6 % of patients on presentation. There were more men with clinical symptoms than women. Fever was the most common manifestation in both gender groups. Fever for more than 30 days, cough, weight loss, and night sweats were significantly more common in men.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic potential of immunohistochemistry using an antibody to the secreted mycobacterial antigen MPT 64, in abdominal and lymph node tuberculosis. Methods We used formalin-fixed histologically diagnosed abdominal tuberculosis (n = 33) and <b>cervical</b> tuberculous <b>lymphadenitis</b> (n = 120) biopsies. These were investigated using a combination of Ziehl-Neelsen method, culture, immunohistochemistry with an antibody to MPT 64, a specific antigen for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms. Abdominal and cervical lymph node biopsies from non-mycobacterial diseases (n = 50) were similarly tested as negative controls. Immunohistochemistry with commercially available anti-BCG and nested PCR for IS 6110 were done for comparison. Nested PCR was positive in 86. 3 % cases and the results of all the tests were compared using nested PCR as the gold standard. Results In lymph node biopsies, immunohistochemistry with anti-MPT 64 was positive in 96 (80 %) cases and 4 (12. 5 %) controls and with anti-BCG 92 (76. 6 %), and 9 (28 %) respectively. The results for cases and controls in abdominal biopsies were 25 (75. 7 %) and 2 (11. 1 %) for anti-MPT 64 and 25 (75. 7 %) and 4 (22 %) for anti-BCG. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of immunohistochemistry with anti-MPT 64 was 92 %, 97 %, 98 %, and 85 %, respectively while the corresponding values for anti-BCG were 88 %, 85 %, 92 %, and 78 %. Conclusion Immunohistochemistry using anti-MPT 64 is a simple and sensitive technique for establishing an early and specific diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection and one that can easily be incorporated into routine histopathology laboratories. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Infection with Mycobacterium bovis (Mb) {{predominantly}} causes <b>cervical</b> TB <b>lymphadenitis</b> (TBL). Raw milk {{is considered}} {{the main source of}} Mb infection and raw milk is a major food source for Afar pastoralists. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess Afar pastoralists' knowledge concerning cervical TBL and its treatment. Methods A community-based cross-sectional survey involving 818 interviewees was conducted in two districts of the Afar Region, Ethiopia. In addition, two focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in each of the study areas, one with men and the other with women. Results Of the 818 interviewees [357 (43. 6 %) females and 461 (56. 4 %) males], 742 (90. 7 %) reported that they had knowledge of cervical TBL, mentioning that swelling(s) on the neck resulting in a lesion and scar are common symptoms. However, only 11 (1. 5 %) individuals mentioned that bacteria or germs are the causative agents of TBL. Three interviewees and a male discussant mentioned drinking raw milk as the cause of TBL. A considerable proportion (34. 2 %) of the interviewees and almost all the discussants suggested herbal medicine as an effective treatment. Male study participants were 1. 82 times more likely to have overall knowledge of TBL than female study participants (adjusted OR, 1. 82; 95 % CI, 1. 32 to 2. 51, p Conclusion The pastoral community members in the study areas had little biomedical knowledge of the cause, the source of infection and the transmission route of cervical TBL. Furthermore, most community members believed that herbal medicines are the most effective treatment for TBL. Therefore, TB control programs in the Afar Region require the incorporation of public health education introducing current biomedical knowledge of the disease.

40|$|Objective: The annual {{incidence}} of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) cervicofacial lymphadenitis in otherwise healthy children is unexpectedly high (8 per million). It mostly arises as localized cervicofacial lymphadenitis. Previous research has suggested environmental {{risk factors for}} oral exposure to NTM and a temporal association with eruption of teeth. We studied 22 polymorphisms in relevant candidate genes, some related to periodontitis, in children with NTM lymphadenitis. We also tested for the most common mutation in IFNGR 1. Methods: We analyzed DNA from 81 Dutch children with NTM from a nationwide surveillance study and 215 community controls for 22 polymorphisms in CD 209, IL 1 B, IL 8, IL 10, IL 12 B, IL 12 RB 1, IL 18, PTX 3, TLR 4, TNF, VDR and SLC 11 A 1 by MassArray platform (Sequenom) and CONTING. We screened for 818 del 4 in IFNGR 1 by PCR and VspI restriction enzyme cleavage. Results: We found a positive association between NTM lymphadenitis and + 3953 TT in IL 1 B (OR 2. 9; 95 %-CI: 1. 2 - 7. 2). Furthermore, our results showed that - 592 C/A heterozygosity in IL 10 is linked to protection from disease (OR 0. 54; 95 %-CI: 0. 3 - 0. 95), but that other polymorphisms were unrelated to localized NTM disease. However, these associations were not robust to Bonferroni's correction for multiple testing. None of the children carried the IFNGR 1 818 del 4 mutation. Conclusions: Dominance of environmental factors over genetic ones and insufficient sample size might explain the fragility of this study's results. Nevertheless, the association between NTM lymphadenitis and 3953 C>T, a polymorphism previously linked to periodontitis, supports our hypothesis that oral exposure to mycobacteria during eruption of teeth {{plays a role in}} the etiology of <b>cervical</b> NTM <b>lymphadenitis.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
