[...] She {{developed}} real-time computer data systems to support satellite operations control centers (1964-1970) and oversaw {{the creation of}} the Landsat program (1970-1981), becoming an international expert in Landsat data products. In 1974 Valerie headed a team of approximately 50 people for the Large Area <b>Crop</b> <b>Inventory</b> Experiment (LACIE), a joint effort with NASA's Johnson Space Center, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. LACIE demonstrated the feasibility of using space technology to automate the process of predicting wheat yield on a worldwide basis. In 1976, she attended an exhibition that included an illusion of a light bulb that was lit, even though it had been removed from its socket. The illusion, which involved another light bulb and concave mirrors, inspired Thomas. Curious about how light and concave mirrors could be used in her work at NASA, she began her research in 1977. This involved creating an experiment in which she observed how the position of a concave mirror would affect the real object that it reflected. Using this technology, she would invent the illusion transmitter. On October 21, 1980, she obtained the patent for the illusion transmitter, a device that NASA continues to use today.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{principal}} objectives of the NASA AgRISTARS program is the inventory of global crop resources using remotely sensed data gathered by Land Satellites (LANDSAT). A central problem in any such <b>crop</b> <b>inventory</b> procedure is the interpretation of LANDSAT images and identification of parts of each image which are covered by a particular crop of interest. This task of labeling is largely a manual one done by trained human analysts and consequently presents obstacles {{to the development of}} totally automated <b>crop</b> <b>inventory</b> systems. However, development in knowledge engineering as well as widespread availability of inexpensive hardware and software for artificial intelligence work offers possibilities for developing expert systems for labeling of crops.

40|$|The {{liquidity}} {{positions of}} U. S. corn farms {{over the period}} 2002 – 2013 is examined using Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data and calculating the average annual working capital to gross revenue (WC/GR) ratio for farms within the 25 th percentile, median, and 75 th percentile. The relationship between liquidity and land ownership, farm size, and the composition and level of short-term farm asset and debts by category are compared across farms within the 25 th, 25 th– 75 th, and 75 th WC/GR ratio percentile. We find that, on average, farms in the 75 th WC/GR ratio percentile owned a greater portion of their operated acres and maintained both a lower and more consistent percentage of assets in <b>crop</b> <b>inventories</b> and a larger and variable percentage of short-term liabilities in accounts payable and term debt compared to farms in the 25 th percentile. Rapid declines in farm liquidity levels {{and the percentage of}} short-term assets in <b>crop</b> <b>inventories</b> for farms in the 25 th WC/GR ratio percentile between 2002 and 2013 highlights the importance of having other means to manage short-term debt obligations rather than selling <b>crop</b> <b>inventories</b> in times of falling output prices. The rise in short-term liabilities and corresponding decreases in short-term debt levels for farms within the 25 th– 75 th and 75 th WC/GR ratios during 2008 – 2013 indicates the importance of being able to pay off farm debt during periods of higher agricultural profits. The corresponding rise in short-term debt for farms in the 25 th percentile during this same time period should be a cause for concern going forward and, with the other results of this study, highlights the need to monitor both overall farm liquidity ratios and the allocation of short-term assets and debts within categories when evaluating and seeking to improve farm liquidity levels and financial performance...|$|R

With a return to normal weather, crop production should rebound. Higher crop prices, pushed up by lean <b>crop</b> <b>inventories,</b> may reward farmers for bringing larger crops to market.

40|$|The {{transactions}} and production files {{are used to}} create measures {{of the use of}} currency and <b>crop</b> <b>inventory</b> as well as changes in real capital assets, livestock, and net indebtedness for three ICRISAT villages in India's semiarid tropics. These asset data are used with income and consumption data to judge the goodness of fit of three models: complete markets or an equivalent set of institutions, exogenously incomplete markets, and endogenously incomplete mechanism design models with moral hazard. The risk sharing apparent in monthly/annual data is achieved by the buffer stocks of currency and <b>crop</b> <b>inventory,</b> and also by community institutions providing credit and insurance, but not at all by the purchase and sale of real capital assets and livestock. Still, by the more exact standards of full econometric tests and a priori plausibility none of the models seems to represent a satisfactory abstract picture. The complete markets model and permanent income/buffer stock model do move us in the right direction, consistent with the data, but are rejected over all. The private information model fits much of the consumption data reasonably well, but it suggests a community control over assets which, though receiving mild support in the data, deserves further consideration. Apparent in the data are salient facts which should be part of subsequent model construction. The relatively rich tend to be high users of <b>crop</b> <b>inventory,</b> and these and other such users of <b>crop</b> <b>inventory</b> are more likely to pass full insurance, permanent income, and private information model tests. The relatively poor tend to be high users of currency, but these and other such users of currency are more likely to fail private information if not other model tests. The villages display both barter and monetary exchange. While virtually all households have access to credit and insurance, the efficiency of the credit/insurance markets varies by land class, it is better for the larger land holders, and varies by village, it is worse for the more traditional village. These village economies also vary in their interaction with the larger national economy. (Copyright: Elsevier) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{approach}} for minimizing data loads associated with satellite-acquired data, while improving {{the efficiency of}} global crop area estimates using remotely sensed, satellite-based data. Results of a sampling unit size investigation are given that include closed-form models for both nonsampling and sampling error variances. These models provide estimates of the sampling unit sizes that effect minimal costs. Earlier findings from foundational sampling unit size studies conducted by Mahalanobis, Jessen, Cochran, and others are utilized in modeling the sampling error variance {{as a function of}} sampling unit size. A conservative nonsampling error variance model is proposed that is realistic in the remote sensing environment where one is faced with numerous unknown nonsampling errors. This approach permits the sampling unit size selection in the global <b>crop</b> <b>inventorying</b> environment to be put on a more quantitative basis while conservatively guarding against expected component error variances...|$|R

40|$|Today’s {{farmers and}} ranchers face an {{unprecedented}} risk environment. Extreme price volatility has impacted the cost of inputs for producers, {{as well as the}} prices they receive for farm commodities. Livestock producers face fluctuations forcing them to re-evaluate their business and marketing plans. Some face liquidation, due to declining profits stemming from high feed prices and reduced consumer demand. With a $ 1 per bushel swing possible in corn prices, feeder cattle prices could continue to be very volatile in the months to come (Feuz, 2011). At this point in the planting season there is still the potential to be short of corn, which means there could once again be a very tight corn supply to meet ethanol mandates, feeding needs and export demand. Input prices for producers also continue to fluctuate, including fuel and fertilizer. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, (first quarter 2011), farmers are seeing farm income and farmland values increase in 2011.
