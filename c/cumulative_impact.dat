40|$|This report {{assesses the}} {{potential}} for <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> of reasonably foreseeable future development in the shoreline jurisdiction that could result from development and activities over time under the King County Shoreline Master Program. The Department of Ecology's shoreline guidelines require local governments to evaluate and consider the <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> of reasonably foreseeable future development on the shorelines of the state (WAC 17 - 26 - 186 (8) (d)). Ecology’s Guidelines require a local government's Shoreline Master Program (SMP) to result in “ … no net loss of ecological functions and protection of other shoreline functions and/or uses. ” Master programs must contain policies, programs, and regulations that address adverse <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> and fairly allocate the burden of addressing <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> among development opportunities. The State’s objective in directing local governments to evaluate potential <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> is to ensure that, when implemented over time, the proposed Shoreline Master Program goals, policies and regulations will achieve this no net loss standard.

Site-specific environmental impact assessments are commonly assessed for mining projects; however, large-scale <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> of multiple mines that aggregate and interact in resources regions have had little attention in the literature and there are few examples where regional-scale mining impacts have been assessed on ecosystem services. The objective {{of this study is to}} quantify regional-scale <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> of mining on sediment retention ecosystem services. We apply the sediment delivery ratio model of Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs to calculate and map the sediment retention and export using a synthetic catchment model and a real case study under different mining scenarios in an Australian mining region. Two impact indices were created to quantify the <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> associated with a single mine and the interactions between multiple mines. The indices clarified the magnitude of impacts and the positive/negative impacts associated with regional-scale sediment retention and export. We found <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> associated with multiple mines’ interaction occurred but the influence of these interactions was relatively weak. This research demonstrated the potential for utilising ecosystem services modelling for the quantitative assessment of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts.</b> Such research provide decision-makers and planners with a tool for sustainable regional and landscape planning that balances the needs of mining and the provision of ecosystem services...|$|R

"Cumulative impacts" refers to the total harm to {{human health and the environment}} resulting from combinations of stressors over time. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> are creating three kinds of effects: degraded ecosystems (such as oceans and boreal forests), human diseases, and disproportionately burdened communities, which are the hallmark of environmental injustice. At the heart of the problem lie the modern risk-based regulatory systems of the U.

Alternative, precautionary regulatory approaches have been recommended but not yet widely implemented. Now some communities, planners and regulators are finding ways to supplement traditional risk-based approaches, using innovative new tools for assessment and decision-making in the face of <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts,</b> including indexes, mapping, and screening.

The method, presented here, is based on the working definition of <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts</b> adopted by Cal/EPA [1]: “Cumulative impacts means exposures, public health or environmental effects from the combined emissions and discharges in a geographic area, including environmental pollution from all sources, whether single or multi-media, routinely, accidentally, or otherwise released. Impacts will take into account sensitive populations and socio-economic factors, where applicable and to the extent data are available. ” The screening methodology is built on this definition as well as current scientific understanding of environmental pollution and its adverse impacts on health, including the influence of both intrinsic, biological factors and non-intrinsic socioeconomic factors in mediating the effects of pollutant exposures. It addresses disparities in the distribution of pollution and health outcomes. The methodology provides a science-based tool to screen places for relative <b>cumulative</b> <b>impacts,</b> incorporating bot...|$|R
