Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand. The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl, while the Mendips are largely Carboniferous limestone. Although sea level <b>changes</b> <b>since</b> the Pliocene led to changes in sea level and the laying down of vegetation, the peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E

5|$|The smooth toadfish (Tetractenos glaber) is {{a species}} of fish in the {{pufferfish}} family Tetraodontidae. It is native to shallow coastal and estuarine waters of southeastern Australia, where it is widespread and abundant. French naturalist Christophe-Paulin de La Poix de Fréminville described the species in 1813, though early records confused it with its close relative, the common toadfish (T. hamiltonii). The two are the only members of the genus Tetractenos after going through several taxonomic <b>changes</b> <b>since</b> discovery.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had {{a population of}} about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in the latter half of the 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs.

With this line-up the group recorded {{their first two}} studio albums (1983's Melissa and 1984's Don't Break the Oath), until 1985 when the band broke up due to musical differences. In 1993, four out of the five members of Mercyful Fate reunited to record the album In the Shadows, which was released the same year. During the 1990s, the band released four more studio albums and went through several line-up <b>changes.</b> <b>Since</b> 1999, Mercyful Fate have been on hiatus, but have reunited on occasion during the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the death}} of the monarch {{required}} fresh elections and, in the general election of 1830, Wellington's Tories lost ground to the Whigs under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, though the Tories still had the largest number of seats. With the Tories bitterly divided, Wellington was defeated in the House of Commons in November, and Lord Grey formed a government. Grey pledged to reform the electoral system, which had seen few <b>changes</b> <b>since</b> the fifteenth century. The inequities in the system were great; for example, large towns such as Manchester and Birmingham elected no members (though they were part of county constituencies), while small boroughs, known as rotten or pocket boroughs—such as Old Sarum with just seven voters—elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the rotten boroughs were controlled by great aristocrats, whose nominees were invariably elected by the constituents—who were, most often, their tenants—especially since the secret ballot was not yet used in Parliamentary elections. Landowners who controlled seats were even able to sell them to prospective candidates.|$|E
5|$|Cantharellus lateritius, {{commonly}} known as the smooth chanterelle, is a species of edible fungus in the Cantharellaceae family of mushrooms. A ectomycorrhizal species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several name <b>changes</b> <b>since</b> its first description by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The fruit bodies of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore-bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. The texture of the fertile undersurface (hymenium) of the caps is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known golden chanterelle, the hymenium of C.lateritius is much smoother. Chemical analysis has revealed the presence of several carotenoid compounds in the fruit bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} form of {{incremental}} backup consists of identifying, recording and, thus, preserving only those files that have <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the last backup. <b>Since</b> <b>changes</b> are typically low, incremental backups are much smaller and quicker than full backups. For instance, following a full backup on Friday, a Monday backup will contain only those files that <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> Friday. A Tuesday backup contains only those files that <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> Monday, and so on. A full restoration of data will naturally be slower, since all increments must be restored. Should {{any one of}} the copies created fail, including the first (full), restoration will be incomplete.|$|R

5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} work {{took place}} in the later part of the 15thcentury. It is thought that it began with the south arcade, followed by the north arcade and the addition of a clerestory. The rebuilding was probably complete by about 1525, although the north aisle may not have been completely re-roofed until the early 17thcentury. The west porch was probably started in the 14thcentury, and the upper two storeys added in the following century. The nave roof was repaired in 1615. During the civil war, while nearby Biddulph Hall was under siege, SirWilliam Brereton's Roundheads stabled their horses in the church. They damaged the medieval glass windows and removed some of the church furniture, including the organ. There have been few significant <b>changes</b> <b>since</b> that time. The church was restored during the 19thcentury by Anthony Salvin, and later, in about 1857, by George Gilbert Scott, who removed plaster from the walls and built a small gallery. During the Victorian era, the reredos and most of the stained glass were added.|$|E
5|$|NATO's 2004 Istanbul summit {{was also}} remarkably {{silent on the}} subject of nuclear weapons policy and non-proliferation, as opposed to pre-summit {{diplomacy}} and earlier post-Cold War NATO summits and contrary to the demonstrations going on in Istanbul. In June 2004, shortly before the summit, NATO issued two fact sheets on nuclear policy, portraying the developments within NATO in a favourable light in the run up to the 2005 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. In practice, no real <b>changes</b> <b>since</b> the end of the Cold War were implemented, as since the 1994 US Nuclear posture review the number of US nuclear weapons based in Europe remained unchanged, and as Cold War nuclear sharing arrangements dating back to the 1960s remained in force.

5|$|The Gentlemen's Singles' {{rules have}} {{undergone}} several <b>changes</b> <b>since</b> the first edition. From 1878 until 1921, the event {{started with a}} knockout phase, the All Comers' Singles, whose winner then faced the defending champion in a challenge round. The All Comers' winner was automatically awarded the title six times (1879, 1887, 1891, 1895, 1907, 1908) {{in the absence of}} the previous year's champion. The challenge round system was abolished with the 1922 edition. Since the first championships, all matches have been played at the best-of-five sets. Between 1877 and 1883, the winner of the next game at five games – all took the set in every match except the All Comers' final, and the challenge round, which were won with six games and a two games advantage. All sets were decided in this advantage format from 1884 to 1970. The lingering death best of 12 points tie-break was introduced in 1971 for the first four sets, played at eight games all until 1978 and at six games all since 1979.|$|E
