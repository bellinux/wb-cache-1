Science learning is the science process skills of observation, communication, <b>clarification,</b> <b>measure,</b> prediction, and summarize. PBL helping science education through observation, clarification, interpretation, prediction, implementation, planning a research, cooperation, critical thinking, and analytical. This research had purpose to understand the effect of PBL to the result of learning science VIII grade students of SMPN 1 Teras, Boyolali second semester of the 2015 / 2016 academic year. This research is kind of experimental research. Design of research used true experimental design that is Randomized Posttest Only Control Group {{by comparing the results}} of class learning with PBL and without it PBL. Study result of science class that using PBL had average score 81. 01 ± 5. 14 higher than class without PBL that only had average 77. 22 ± 5. 41. Based on hypothesis Independent Sample T-Test, the result of science learning had score Asymp. Sig value. 0, 005 < constant of 0. 05, so H 0 rejected and Ha accepted. It is said there are differences in class learning with PBL and without PBL. Thus it can be concluded there was an effect of PBL concern to result of learning science VIII grade students of SMPN 1 Teras, Boyolali second semester of the 2015 / 2016 academic year...|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is {{therefore}} to clarify the meaning of competition as it relates to wildlife and livestock in dryland Africa, particularly East Africa.d This article is organized into three parts. First, we argue that unclear notions of competition circulate as common understandings without clarification due in part to its historic importance in ecology. We discuss the need to use ecological understandings that define what we mean by competition within the context of characterizing livestock–wildlife competition. Second, we move from general principles of competition to a more refined vision of wildlife-livestock competition and trace the empirical complexities of competition as mediated through vegetative response, which are shaped by climatic variability and spatial scaling. Finally, we move toward an understanding of ‘exploitation competition’ and outline some of the implications of conceptual <b>clarification</b> for <b>measuring</b> wildlife–livestock competition.|$|R

Freeman made his conceptual <b>clarifications</b> about centrality <b>measures</b> in social network analysis in 1979 he exclusively focused on unweighted, symmetric, and connected networks without the possibility of self-loops. Even though a lot of articles have been published in the last years discussing network measures for weighted, asymmetric or unconnected networks, the vast majority of researchers dealing with social network data simplify their networks based on Freeman’s 1979 definitions before they calculate centrality measures. When dealing with weighted and/or asymmetric networks which can have self links and consist of multiple components, researchers are confronted with a lack of standardization.

40|$|We {{have studied}} silica {{precipitation}} from the hydrothermal solution by electrochemical coagulation method {{in the laboratory}} and Mutnovskoe field conditions. Coagulant {{was added to the}} solution from the dissoluble metal electrodes (steel, copper, aluminium) under passing direct electric current. We found treatment with aluminium electrodes to be the most effective. In these experiments silica and aluminium concentration in solution, solution pH were determined and electrodes voltage was recorded. Settling rates of the coagulated silica flakes and the time of solution <b>clarification</b> were also <b>measured.</b> Current strength, solution temperature and distance between the electrodes plates were changed in experiments. The theoretical functions expressing the dependence of silica concentration in solution on treatment duration and the quantity of electric energy consumed during the treatment were found. The rate of aluminium electrodes dissolving and amount of coagulant used for treatment were calculated. With the help of X-Ray analysis it was obtained the amorphous structure of material precipitated by the electric treatment. On the base of the experimental data we evaluated the parameters of pilot electrocoagulator necessary for treatment of 1 kg/s of hydrothermal separate flow...|$|R
40|$|Towards a {{linguistic}} modeling of writing models {{of high school}} learners writers Abstract Focusing on writing from a didactic aspect is to present it as a complex activity that requires the mobilization of much knowledge and a multitude of procedures. Writing represents a language phenomenon, it becomes a language in the fullest sense and a new order of language practices is established that some call it scriptural (Peytard 1970 Dabène 1987). Our purpose is to analyze the final product, {{the result of the}} editorial process (SC Thomas, 2000). In fact, we present the study and analysis of a corpus which presents the written productions of High school learners that reflect their actual skills. It is a question of observing the linguistic modeling required for the learners' written productions that rely on relevant parameters of semantics, cognitive psychology (Fayol, 1996) and the socio-cultural dimension (Dabène 1996). Do these processes, practiced by learners writers, provide a guarantee of success valuing a written production? We then examine the transposition of models mentioned in the written productions and configurations of writers with regard to their scripts. Finally, we conclude with the <b>clarification</b> of editorial <b>measures</b> offering insight into writing as a recursive activity evolving through the support models that require recurrences depending {{on the nature of the}} written production. Educational recommendations, based on all observations are advanced to locate the practical framework of learners/writers writing activities. Se focaliser sur l'écriture sous un angle didactique, c'est la présenter comme une activité complexe qui nécessite la mobilisation de nombreuses connaissances et une multitude de procédures. Nous présentons l'étude et l'analyse d'un corpus présentant les productions écrites des lycéens apprentis scripteurs afin de rendre compte de leurs compétences réelles. Il s'agit d'observer les modélisations linguistiques requises pour les productions écrites par des apprenants scripteurs. Nous examinerons ensuite la transposition des modélisations évoquées dans les productions écrites et les configurations des scripteurs à l'égard de leur écrit. Enfin, nous conclurons par la mise au point des dispositions rédactionnelles permettant d'entrevoir l'écriture comme une activité récursive en évolution constante à travers la prise en charge des modélisations qui requièrent des récurrences en fonction de la nature même de la production écrite...|$|R
