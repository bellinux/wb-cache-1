According to Duff, she wanted to [...] "try new things", but the image change [...] "just happened. It is not like a conscious <b>change.</b> <b>People</b> think it is so different because they have watched me grow up but that is just what happens in life." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Duff's new look as comprising [...] "dark mane, dental veneers, luxe and vampy fashions". In mid-2007, concurrent to {{the preparation of the}} radio release of [...] "Stranger", Duff was featured on the July covers of the magazines Us Weekly and Shape in a bikini, and on the August cover of Maxim accompanied by the declaration that she had gone [...] "from the queen of teen to breakout sex symbol". The Associated Press wrote that Duff's more provocative image would help her singles to garner mainstream radio play. Guy Zapoleon, a radio consultant and former programmer for Top 40 radio, explained that [...] "radio has a stigma about playing [...] acts, considering them teen and preteen in their appeal", and that Duff's provocative image would [...] "definitely {{have a positive effect on}} the attitude of programmers, who are mostly male, as Disney tries to mature her image". A bonus EP containing five bonus remixes was released exclusively to US WalMart stores as a package with the album.|$|E

Comic Relief {{released}} a story called Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan, in which Snape is played by Jeremy Irons. Alan Rickman appeared himself as Snape in a Harry Potter parody named [...] "Louis Potter and the Philosopher's Scone" [...] in Alistair McGowan's Big Impression show. In the Harry Bladder sketches in All That, Snape appears as Professor Chafe (portrayed by Jeremy Rowley), whose legs were badly chafed, causing him to be unnecessarily mean.

2500|$|The head of story, Don Hall, {{described}} the plot as {{a fairy tale}} [...] "twisted enough that it seems new and fresh", with a kingdom that is a modern city, a handsome prince that is a [...] "knuckleheaded playboy" [...] and {{a variation on the}} fairy godmother with Mama Odie. Co-writer Rob Edwards also said The Princess and the Frog was [...] "a princess movie for people who don't like princess movies". As the writers thought Tiana's character motivation of simply dreaming of having her own restaurant was not appealing enough, they expanded so it was her father's as well, with the extra philosophy of [...] "food bringing people together from all walks of life". Musker and Clements stated that while Tiana already starts as a sympathetic character, the events of the plot make her [...] "understand things in a deeper level" [...] and <b>change</b> <b>people</b> around her. Both protagonists would learn from each other— Naveen to take responsibilities, Tiana to enjoy life— as well as figuring from Ray's passion for Evangeline that the perfect balance is brought by having someone you love to share the experience. Tiana became the first African-American Disney Princess.|$|E
2500|$|In the Christian view, {{humankind}} {{was made}} in the Image of God and perfect, but the Fall of Man caused the progeny of the first Parents to inherit Original Sin. The sacrifice of Christ's passion, death and resurrection provide the means for transcending that impure state (Romans 6:23). The means for doing so varies between different groups of Christians, but all rely on belief in Jesus, his work on the cross and his resurrection as the fundamental starting point for a relationship with God. Faith in God is found in Ephesians 2:8–9 – [...] "For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast." [...] (New American Standard Bible; 1973). A recent alternative Christian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering. [...] Nonetheless the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the propitiatory sacrifice of Jesus' death on the cross. The Gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, and allows God to <b>change</b> <b>people</b> and instill in them a new heart after his own will, and the ability to do it. This is what the terms [...] "reborn" [...] or [...] "saved" [...] almost always refer to.|$|E

I am sure that your husband will be ready to do or say anything you wish; but if he shouldn't, Louise, you will receive him forgivingly, and make the first advance? It's a woman's right to make the advances in forgiving." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the Camden ferry. What exhilaration, <b>change,</b> <b>people,</b> business, by day.

And the ferry men--little they know how much they have been to me, day and night--how many spells of listlessness, ennui, debility, they and their hardy ways have dispell'd. And the pilots--captains Hand, Walton, and Giberson by day, and captain Olive at night; Eugene Crosby, with his strong young arm so often supporting, circling, convoying me over the gaps of the bridge, through impediments, safely aboard. Indeed all my ferry friends--captain Frazee the superintendent, Lindell, Hiskey, Fred Rauch, Price, Watson, and a dozen more. And the ferry itself, with its queer scenes--sometimes children suddenly born in the waiting-houses (an actual fact--and more than once)--sometimes a masquerade party, going over at night, with a band of music, dancing and whirling like mad on the broad deck, in their fantastic dresses; sometimes the astronomer, Mr. Whitall, (who posts me up in points about the stars by a living lesson there and then, and answering every question) --sometimes a prolific family group, eight, nine, ten, even twelve! (Yesterday, as I cross'd, a mother, father, and eight children, waiting in the ferry-house, bound westward somewhere.) ...|$|E
