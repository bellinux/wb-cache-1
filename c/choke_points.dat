Mine-laying operations were disrupted in April as the wing was assigned to support operations in Okinawa and participate in conventional bombing raids. Its rate of effort increased in May, when it conducted missions against harbors and other <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> around Honshu and Kyushu. The air-dropped minefields greatly disrupted Japanese coastal shipping.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{could only}} be valid if intelligence assessments were correct. To German intelligence, {{it seemed as if}} the RAF might be on the verge of collapse. The attacks on London, thus far, seemed to confirm the assumption. None of the Luftwaffe bomber formations had encountered the well organised, effective and ferocious defence that had characterised the battles in August 1940. If the German intelligence was correct, then by striking against vital <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> in London that the RAF would be forced to defend, the Luftwaffe had the opportunity to destroy the remaining RAF fighter forces. Not only would the attacks allow for the attainment of air superiority, they would eliminate a vital rail network, destroy shipping and supplies brought in from North America, and affect civilian morale by demonstrating London’s vulnerability to air power.|$|E

50|$|In {{military}} strategy, a <b>choke</b> <b>point</b> (or chokepoint) is {{a geographical}} feature on land {{such as a}} valley, defile or a bridge or at sea such as a strait, which an armed force is forced to pass, sometimes on a substantially narrower front and therefore greatly decreasing its combat power, to reach its objective. A <b>choke</b> <b>point</b> can allow a numerically inferior defending force to thwart a larger opponent if the attacker cannot bring superior numbers to bear.|$|R
25|$|Traditional {{military}} targets had primarily been fielded enemy forces and concentrations of supplies held in rear areas. After aerial bombardment became a possibility, tactical targets such as communications (supply and signal lines) and troop concentrations {{became the focus}} of bombing efforts. The industrial web theory instead targeted <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> and bottlenecks in an enemy's economic and industrial base, deep inside the interior of an enemy nation. If precision bombing could be used to destroy an industrial node with resulting paralysis of enemy industry, the particular node was given serious consideration as a target.|$|E

The TVA bill was passed in 1933 because reformers like Norris skillfully coordinated action at potential <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> and weakened the already disorganized opponents among the electric power industry lobbyists. In 1936, however, after regrouping, opposing river lobbyists and conservative coalition congressmen took advantage of the New Dealers' spending mood by expanding the Army Corps' flood control program. They also helped defeat further valley authorities, the most promising of the New Deal water policy reforms.|$|E

25|$|George, Walker, Kuter and Hansell {{provided}} the key concepts for the AWPD task force. George's vision {{was that the}} plan {{should not be a}} simple list of quantities of men and materiel—it should be a clear expression of the strategic direction required to win the war by use of air power. The main feature of the plan was the proposal to use massive fleets of heavy bombers to attack economic targets, the <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> of Axis industry. Hansell, fresh from a fact-finding mission to England in which he was briefed on British appreciations of German industrial and military targets, immediately became immersed in the job of target selection.|$|E
25|$|Road {{and bridge}} repair methods. There were {{several ways to}} keep traffic moving amid the {{destruction}} wrought by the bombers. Simple pontoon bridges were made of lashed together bundles of bamboo, topped by heavy wooden planking. Sturdier pontoon structures were made by tying wooden canal boats together – with camouflage measures to hide them during the day from aerial observation. Bridges were also built underwater to escape detection. As noted above, supplies, equipment and material was pre-stocked along roads, and near various <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> like ferry crossings so that repairs could be made quickly. Delayed action bombs caused special problems. Designated personnel were tasked with dismantling them, or watchmen kept them under observation- signaling all within blast distance to disperse when the bombs showed signs of detonating. Repairs were often done at night when the enemy aircraft would be less active.|$|E
5000|$|An {{investigation}} by the House Oversight Committee found that the Federal Deposit and Insurance Commission took {{a prominent role in}} Operation <b>Choke</b> <b>Point,</b> an interagency initiative to pressure banks to stop providing business services to industries such as payment processors, firearms sellers, payday lenders etc. As members of the FDIC’s Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion, CRL board member Wade Henderson pushed agency leadership {{to crack down on the}} payday lending industry—one of the industries targeted by Operation <b>Choke</b> <b>Point.</b> Additionally, according to emails uncovered by the Oversight investigation, Mark Pearce (former CRL president and current director of FDIC’s Division of Depositor and Consumer Protection), was exploring ways for FDIC to “get at payday lending.” The report found Pearce used his position to push for stringent regulations on the payday lending industry. [...] CRL praised efforts by Operation <b>Choke</b> <b>Point</b> to increase regulations on payday lenders.|$|R

500|$|Berbera, {{the capital}} of British Somaliland and its only major city and port, was the obvious {{destination}} of any invasion. As plans took shape for the blocking of Italian passage to the city, {{it became apparent that}} the border with Ethiopia was too long and open to be defended effectively. However, the rugged Somali countryside was impassable by vehicles, meaning that the British could stage a defense on the <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> of the two roads to Berbera, from Hargeisa and Burao. The Hargeisa road, the most direct route and the main route through the country, headed through a gap in the hills at a place called Tug Argan for the [...] "tug," [...] or dry riverbed, that ran before the line of hills. Unfortunately for the British, the gap was flat and open, meaning that a small force could not hold out for long. Despite these difficulties, three battalions of the five and a light artillery battery were stationed in the pass, with one battalion in reserve.|$|E
500|$|Dietrich {{knew the}} plan had flaws. The Germans had {{captured}} the same terrain {{during the summer}} of 1940 in three days. Now they were being asked to do it in winter in five days. The plan counted on bad weather to keep the Allied planes grounded. Dietrich only had one-quarter the fuel they needed; their plan counted on capturing Allied fuel depots and keeping to an ambitious timetable. Dietrich's assigned route (or Rollbahn) included narrow roads – in many places single-tracks – which would force units of the Kampfgruppe to tail each other, creating a column of infantry and armor up to [...] long. The roads would prevent the attackers from concentrating their forces in the blitzkrieg fashion which had served them so well in the past. The main roads designated for their use had many hairpin turns and traversed steep hillsides that would delay his already slow-moving towed artillery and bridging trains. Dietrich knew that a determined fight at one of these critical <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> by even a token U.S. force could seriously impede his schedule. When Hitler's operations officer Generaloberst Alfred Jodl gave him his orders, Dietrich yelled, [...] "I'm a general, not a bloody undertaker!" ...|$|E
5000|$|On April 8, 2014, the House Financial Services Committee held {{a hearing}} {{with the general}} counsels of the federal banking {{agencies}} regarding, among other things, Operation <b>Choke</b> <b>Point.</b> Committee members from both parties argued that Operation <b>Choke</b> <b>Point</b> is hurting lawful non-bank financial service providers by pressuring to eliminate access to the banking system and, in turn, the businesses unable to offer services to constituents. The FDIC’s Richard Osterman repeatedly asserted that Operation <b>Choke</b> <b>Point</b> is a Justice Department operation and the FDIC’s participation is limited to providing information and guidance upon request. Mr. Osterman also asserted that the FDIC is not attempting to prohibit banks from offering products or services to non-bank financial service providers operating within the law. Similarly, Amy Friend, of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), stated that the OCC wants to ensure that banks conduct [...] "due diligence and implement appropriate controls," [...] but that the OCC is not prohibiting banks from offering services to lawful businesses.|$|R

500|$|Glastonbury 2007 (20–24 June) was headlined by Arctic Monkeys, The Killers, and The Who on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Dame Shirley Bassey {{was also}} featured. [...] In 2007, over 700 acts played on over 80 stages and the {{capacity}} expanded by 20,000 to 177,000. This was the first year that [...] "The Park" [...] area opened. Designed by Emily Eavis, its main stage featured extra sets by several artists playing on the main stages including Pete Doherty and Gruff Rhys, whilst the BBC launched their new [...] "Introducing" [...] stage in the area. The festival had the largest attendance since {{the construction of the}} security fence, and the largest legitimate attendance to date: ticket allocation was raised by 27,500 to 137,500, which were charged at £145 and sold out in 1 hour 45 minutes. [...] As an extra precaution against touts (scalpers), purchasers had to pre-register, including submission of a passport photo which was security printed into the ticket. Continued periods of rain throughout much of the festival caused muddy conditions, though without the flooding of 2005, in part due to the new £750,000 flood defences. However this constant rain made the general conditions within the site worse than 2 years before and more like the mud plains of 1998. It was difficult to find anywhere to sit down that had not turned to mud and key <b>choke</b> <b>points,</b> such as the thoroughfare at the front right of the Pyramid stage, turned into a quagmire. Muddy conditions on the temporary roads {{on the periphery of the}} site led to delays for people leaving the site. On 25 June, when the vast majority of festival goers were attempting to leave the festival, cars in the western car parks took over nine hours to exit the site. There was no stewarding provision in these areas, no information was disseminated regarding the delays, no organised marshalling of traffic was undertaken by the festival organisers, and no provision of drinking water was made to people stranded in their vehicles. Verbal and physical violence was witnessed between festival goers. When cars were finally allowed to leave the site the surrounding roads were found to be clear. Reported crime was down from 2005 but the number of arrests were [...] "well up", after a proactive operation of the police and security on site. There were 236 reported crimes, down from 267 in 2005; of these, 158 were drug related (183 in 2005). 1,200 people required medical aid with 32 hospitalised, most of which were accidents caused by the mud.
