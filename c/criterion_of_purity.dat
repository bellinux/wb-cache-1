40|$|The {{techniques}} of agar immunoelectrophoresis and agar double diffusion {{were applied to}} the study of the antigenicity of β- and α 1 -lipoproteins separated by ultracentrifugation from normal human sera. The effects of delipidation were also investigated. It was shown that β- and α 1 -lipoproteins are antigenically distinct. For each class of lipoprotein studied, a single antigenic component was demonstrated. In some, but not all, preparations of α 1 -lipoprotein a second, small antigenic component was detected, and identified as albumin. Absorption with lipoprotein-free serum or albumin removed this component without changing the lipoprotein band. Delipidation did not affect the antigenicity of either β- or α 1 -lipoproteins. Immunoelectrophoresis, because of its high sensitivity and specificity, provides an additional <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>purity</b> for antigenic proteins in addition to the data that can be obtained from ultracentrifugal and free electrophoretic analysis...|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} evidence {{in favor of}} the protein nature of enzymes has accumulated {{to such an extent that}} this view is now widely accepted. The question as to whether the enzyme preparations are pure proteins is, however, much less certain. The problem is complicated by the difficulty of defining a pure protein. If homogeneity in the ultracentrifuge or electrophoresis cell is considered as a sufficient test of purity then many proteins, including several enzymes, have been obtained in pure form. If constant solubility be considered as the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>purity</b> then no protein, with the possible exception of trypsin (Kunitz, 1938) and chymotrypsinogen (Butler, 1940; Kunltz and Northrop, 1938) has been prepared in pure form. The earlier results with pepsin may be taken as an example. Thus this protein is homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge (Philpot, 1935) and in the electrophoresis cell (Tiselius, 1938; Herriott, Desreux, and Northrop, 1940), The earlier preparations of Northrop (1930) showed constant solubility in certain solvents but not in others. Steinhardt was unable to obtain a sample of constant solubility in dilute acid. In addition, Northrop (1933) found that some samples of crystalline pepsin contained nearly 50 per cent inert protein and that all samples contain more or less of another enzyme especially active on gelatin (Northrop, 1931).

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple preparation of guinea pig brain myelin, free of gross contamination by other cellular elements has been described. Electron microscopic {{evidence of the}} predominance of membranous (lamellar) forms {{was used as the}} <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>purity</b> of this fraction. The slight mitochondrial contamination of the myelin fraction was confirmed by its low succinic dehydrogenase activity. Quantitative bio-assay of the encephalitogenic activity of myelin showed it to have a higher specific activity than whole guinea pig brain. The low encephalomyelitic activity of the other subcellular constituents (nuclei and mitochondria) which were removed from myelin by ultracentrifugation in 30 per cent sucrose could be explained by a small amount of myelin contamination. A basic protein of high specific encephalitogenic activity has been isolated from myelin by methods previously applied to whole brain. Although the protein is similar to nuclear histones, the following facts point to certain significant differences. Nuclei prepared by a different procedure from the one developed for the isolation of myelin were found to be non-encephalitogenic. Although basic protein could be extracted readily from these nuclei by dilute HCl, the same extraction procedure yielded little extractable protein from whole myelin. Myelin which had been defatted by cold chloroform-methanol yielded a basic protein which was highly encephalitogenic. The evidence presented thus supports the view that there exists in myelin a new basic protein responsible for the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, which is distinctly different from nuclear histones. The possible relationship of this protein to myelin structure and function has been discussed...|$|E

The investigation was undertaken with a dual object in view: (1) To ascertain {{the nature of the}} physical or chemical changes occuring in the liquids on mixing and (2) To gain an insight into the relative suitability of the various physical properties for shewing the chemical changes which may have occured. The binary mixtures named below have been examined: (1) Toluene and m-Cresol. (2) Aniline and m-Cresol. (3) Aniline and Nitrobenzene. (4) m-Cresol and Benzene. (5) Toluene and benzene. (6) Nitrobenzene and m-Cresol. In each case the following five physical properties have been investigated: (1) Specific Gravity. (2) Refractive Index. (3) Heat of Mixing. (4) Specific Heat. (5) Magnetic Susceptibility, the liquids were purified very carefully, (constant boiling point and Specific gravity being the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>purity)</b> and mixtures were prepared covering the whole concentration range, from one pure component to the other. Specific gravities were measured with a 2 cc. pyknometer, refractive indices with a Pulfrich refractometer used with a temperature control, heats of mixing and specific heats by the method of mixtures, and magnetic susceptibilities with a modified form of Curie balance. From the refractive indices, specific and molecular refractivity, dispersion, molecular dispersion, and dispersive power were calculated. In all cases the results are tabulated and from the tables, curves are drawn in which the value of the physical property as ordinate is plotted against the composition expressed in moles % as abscissa.

40|$|Bovine seminal ribonuclease, a dimeric protein {{found to}} be {{homogeneous}} by several standard <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>purity,</b> is heterogeneous when analyzed by ion-exchange chromatography on (carboxymethy 1) cellulose. Three increasingly cationic subforms can be separated. The heterogeneity {{is due to the}} presence of two types of subunits, alfa and beta, which make up three isoenzymic dimers: alfa 2, beta 2, and alfa-beta. Deamidation reactions can convert the most cationic beta 2 subform into the alfa-beta subform, which in turn can be converted into stable alfa 2 subform. These conversions involve the hydrolysis of 2 mol of differentially labile amide groups per mol of protein. The ratios alfa 2 :alfa-beta:beta 2 are constant in all preparations of seminal ribonuclease tested; they are independent of the purification procedure {{as well as of the}} biological source of the enzyme (seminal plasma or seminal vesicles). These results indicate that deamidations occur in vivo before the protein is secreted from the seminal glands.

40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{continuation}} of the systematic survey of the solubilities, apparent dissociation constants, and thermodynamic properties of the amino acids, which for some time {{have been the subject of}} study in this laboratory (1). We are reporting the solubility in water of d-tyrosine, dl-tyrosine, diiodo-dl-tyrosine, dibromo-ltyrosine, and dichloro-/-tyrosine over a temperature range of from 0 ° to 50 °C.; and the apparent dissociation constants of dibromo-l-tyrosine and dichloro-/-tyrosine at 25 ° and 40 °C. From these data we have calculated the heats of solution of all of the above amino acids and the apparent heats of ionization of dibromo-l-tyrosine and dichloro-/tyrosine. Methods The technique employed for obtaining the solubilities of the amino acids was the same as described by Dalton and Schmidt (2). The concentrations of the amino acids in the saturated solutions were obtained by micro Kjeldahl determinations of nitrogen (3). The <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>purity</b> <b>of</b> the preparations were constant solubility after repeated recrystallization and constant solubility when there was a small excess and a large excess of the solid phase. For estimating the apparent dissociation constants, the solubilities of the amino acids were determined in aqueous solutions and in solutions containing varying amounts of sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. The hydrogen ion activities of the solutions were determined with the aid of the quinhydrone electrode. They are based on the value 1. 078 for the pall of 0. 1000 molar HC 1 (4), and on the assumption that contact potential differences were eliminated by the use of saturated potassium chloride.

40|$|The {{problem has}} its {{origin in the}} {{empirical}} nature of existing methods for the chemical determination of plant lignin. It is generally recognized that the apparent lignin content of plant tissues depends largely on the pretreatments employed, and on the method and conditions of final isolation of the lignin. By using various pretreatments and carefully regulating {{the conditions of the}} final determination of lignin, methods have been developed which give reproducible results on any given tissue. However, the apparent lignin content of any particular tissue may vary greatly, depending on the method used for its determination. Consequently, an investigation of more efficient methods for the removal of materials which interfere in the final isolation of lignin was indicated. In this connection, special {{attention has been paid to}} obtaining a lignin relatively free from nitrogen, and also, to the prevention of changes in the lignin itself during its isolation.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the purification of pyrrole- 2 -carboxylate (PCA) from human and rat urine indicates that previously reported mean values overestimate the correct quantity of free PCA {{by a factor of}} approximately three for rat urine and approximately five for human urine. Although several <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> <b>purity</b> were satisfied by a previous method, pyrrole-reactive impurities were still present in the final fractions. These impurities are separated from PCA by chromatography through an amino acid analyzer ion-exchange resin. With the corrected method, normal human values for endogenous urinary PCA in 16 individuals averaged 0. 51 μmol/day, with a range of 0. 20 - 1. 3 μmol and a SD of 0. 31 μmol. The probable source of human PCA is free hydroxy-L-proline, as inferred from the high value for PCA in the urine of a subject with hereditary hydroxyprolinemia, and from the threeto eightfold elevation in PCA excretion by two normal subjects after a large oral load of hydroxyl-L-proline. Subcutaneous administration of [2 - 14 C]PCA to a single human subject indicated almost complete conversion of the exogenous compound to derivatives, which are largely excreted in the urine.

Recently a method for titrating a B. anthracis immunizing antigen, based on this technique, was reported (Thorne and Belton, 1957). A culture filtrate containing a protective antigen produced a characteristic precipitation line with antiserum and the titer was defined as the highest dilution of sample which would give a visible reaction. Excellent correlation was found between the titers of cul-ture filtrates and their immunizing activities in rabbits. It seemed probable that the line observed in agar diffusion plates was a precipitate of pro-tective antigen and its specific antibody but this could be proved only by isolating the antigen component in a pure state and demonstrating its protective activity.

40|$|Tribe' and 'caste' {{have been}} a {{recurrent}} and hotly debated issue in Indian anthropology. There {{appears to be a}} consensus that originally flexible and fluid social compositions have been 'essentialised' into either 'caste' or 'tribe' categories (Deliege 1985; Cohn 1987), and that in fact a continuum exists, along which groups can be located according to their specific caste or tribal features (Ghurye 1943; Bailey 1960; Mandelbaum 1970). The present study contributes to this debate by providing innovative insights on the nature of 'tribe' and 'caste' in contemporary India. The study is an ethnographic and anthropological investigation of two divergent yet interrelated phenomena among the Ho and Munda 'tribal' groups of a forested area of Jharkhand, northern India: {{the emergence of a new}} 'caste' through the embracing of a Hindu reformist movement by some and the simultaneous revival of tribal essence and adherence to ancestral teachings and spiritual practices by others. Consistent with Srinivas' (1966) Sanskritisation theory, the devotees, or those who convert to the movement, adopt high-caste behaviours and introduce caste discrimination among agnates in the attempt to 'liberate' themselves from the forest as symbol of their 'backward' past. However, the investigation highlights a number of relevant exceptions. It is argued that a process of 'de-Sanskritisation' is taking place among those who retain ancestral practices. By reviving the ancestral notion of wilderness and mastery over forests, these - the rebels - remain faithful to the primordial link between spirits, land and people and continue their ancestors' fight against land and forest dispossession.

40|$|Silence, {{purity and}} {{sacrifice}} have been internalized as values of honorific motherhood for ages {{all over the}} world. But since {{the appearance of the}} second-wave feminism, and as part of the generalized fight-back against oppression, feminists came to reject these values which they think embody a male vision. They argue that motherhood is not innate but rather a cultural construct. In the Arab world as well as in western Africa, any simple questioning of the traditional maternal discourse is condemned. Still, there are serious female voices in the Arab world as well as in Africa who break the silence around maternal experience in literary works, as well as in films and paintings. This thesis aims to show that the male vision of ideal motherhood as shown in Ghassan Kanafani’s Um Saad (1969) and Mongo Beti’s Perpetua and the Habit of Unhappiness (1978) is based on an agenda that sustains patriarchy and that supports nationalism. These two novels define the ideal mother figure according to the <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> silence, <b>purity,</b> and sacrifice. The mother who doesn’t fit into these categories is viewed as an evil mother. In contrast, the thesis examines the rejection of the internalized patriarchal metanarrative of motherhood by 2 female authors: the Palestinian Sahar Khalifeh in The Door of the Courtyard (1999) and the Nigerian Buchi Emecheta in The Joys of Motherhood (1979).
