5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style {{is that he is}} able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> change.|$|E
5|$|Despite most {{games in}} the series taking place in {{different}} continuities, they do share certain elements. One of its defining traits is it being set in a contemporary urban environment, specifically modern-day Tokyo. Post-apocalyptic elements are a recurring feature in settings and narratives. This choice was originally made to set the game apart from other fantasy-based gaming franchises of the time, as modern day Tokyo was rarely seen in games as opposed to versions {{of it from the}} past. The Persona series takes place exclusively within this setting, spanning a single <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> mostly focusing on the exploits of a group of young people.|$|E

5|$|The {{influence}} of 19th- and 20th-century missionaries has both transformed and maintained aboriginal integration. Many {{of the churches}} have replaced earlier community functions, but continue to retain a sense of <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> community that unites members of aboriginal societies against the pressures of modernity. Several church leaders have emerged from within the communities to take on leadership positions in petitioning {{the government in the}} interest of indigenous peoples and seeking a balance between the interests of the communities and economic vitality.|$|E
5|$|Andronikos I was {{the last}} of the Komnenoi to rule Constantinople, {{although}} his grandsons Alexios and David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204. Nevertheless, Andronikos's role in the collapse of the empire is controversial; historians disagree over the extent to which his brief reign influenced events after his death. Andonikos's coup, together with his violent death, had weakened the dynastic <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely. Furthermore, his so-called 'anti-Latin' policy has been criticised by some historians as a failure, in view of the increasing hostility it caused towards Byzantium in the west. In particular, Andonikos's failure to prevent the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182 has been seen as especially significant, since henceforth Byzantine foreign policy was invariably perceived as sinister and anti-Latin in the west. It has even been argued that Andronikos's attempts to crush the aristocracy were damaging to the empire's military power, since the aristocracy had become indispensable to the defences of the state. On the other hand, his reforms in the provinces were both wise and beneficial to the internal health and prosperity of the empire.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance {{takes place in}} a <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> setting separate {{from the rest of the}} series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides. By the events of Path of Radiance, Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's Medallion, the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem. It is a bronze medallion said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused all the world but Tellius to be engulfed by the sea. To prevent the dark god being freed, war must be prevented in Tellius.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{the rest}} of England, much of English Mercia– Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire– was unusually stable in the Viking age. It did not suffer major attacks and it did not come under great {{pressure}} from Wessex. Mercian scholarship had high prestige at the courts of Alfred and Edward. Worcester was able to preserve considerable intellectual and liturgical <b>continuity</b> <b>and,</b> with Gloucester, became the centre of a Mercian revival under Æthelred and Æthelflæd that extended into the more unstable areas of Staffordshire and Cheshire. Charters show the Mercian leaders supporting the revival by their generosity to monastic communities. In 883 Æthelred granted privileges to Berkeley Abbey and in the 890s he and Æthelflæd issued a charter in favour of the church of Worcester. This was the only occasion in Alfred's lifetime when they are known to have acted jointly; generally Æthelred acted on his own, usually acknowledging the permission of King Alfred. Æthelflæd witnessed charters of Æthelred in 888, 889 and 896. In 901 Æthelflæd and Æthelred gave land and a golden chalice weighing thirty mancuses to the shrine of Saint Mildburg at Much Wenlock church.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Del Piero {{transferred}} to Juventus and {{played for the}} Torinese club for 19 seasons until being released {{in the summer of}} 2012. Although manager Giovanni Trapattoni insisted that he trained with the senior team, he initially played with the Primavera squad, which was coached by Antonello Cuccureddu, helping the Juventus Youth team to win both the 1994 Torneo di Viareggio, and the 1994 U-20 Scudetto. Del Piero made his Serie A debut against Foggia on 12 September 1993 under Trapattoni, as a substitute, and he scored his first goal in his next game against Reggiana on 19 September, after coming off the bench once again. On his full debut for Juventus, he netted a hat-trick against Parma. After his promising performances, Del Piero began to be deployed with more <b>continuity,</b> <b>and</b> he managed 14 appearances for Juventus that season between youth matches, league matches, the Coppa Italia, and the UEFA Cup, scoring 5 goals, which all came in Serie A, as Juventus finished the season in second place in the league.|$|E

5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.|$|E
5|$|Nier {{originated}} when Yoko and Shiba {{teamed up}} to create a third Drakengard game. As the project continued, it became more detached from the main <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> eventually developed into a spin-off. Despite what it became, Yoko has stated that he considers Nier to be the true Drakengard 3. After the release of Nier, Cavia closed down and was absorbed by AQ Interactive, then Yoko Taro left the company to pursue {{a wider range of}} projects. A stalled attempt to begin production of further games in the series at AQ Interactive was blamed by Shiba on a prevalent trend at the time for light-weight games for the general gaming community. Later, Yoko and Shiba came together again to create a proper second sequel to Drakengard, with the intention of creating a hard core RPG for the fanbase. Unlike the previous games in the series, Drakengard 3 was developed by Access Games, a developer whose noted games included Deadly Premonition, and brought in team members used to creating action games. During the run-up to Drakengard 3s release, both Yoko and Shiba expressed their willingness to continue the series on the PlayStation 4 if the latest game was enough of a success. Speaking in 2014 after the game's release, Yoko stated that the series was on hold due to lack of funds. A new Nier game was revealed to be in development at Square Enix and PlatinumGames.|$|E
