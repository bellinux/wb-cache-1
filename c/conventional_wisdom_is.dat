In 2005, GM Jonathan Rowson wrote that [...] "the <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> that White begins {{the game with}} a small advantage and, holding all other factors constant, scores approximately 56% to Black's 44%". International Master (IM) John Watson wrote in 1998 that White had scored 56% for most of the 20th century, but that this figure had recently slipped to 55%.

50|$|Self-perception theory (SPT) is {{an account}} of {{attitude}} formation developed by psychologist Daryl Bem.

The theory is counterintuitive in nature, as the <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>is</b> that attitudes determine behaviors. Furthermore, the theory suggests that people induce attitudes without accessing internal cognition and mood states. The person interprets their own overt behaviors rationally in the same way they attempt to explain others' behaviors.|$|E

Rather, a contrarian seeks opportunities to buy or sell specific investments when the majority of investors appear to be doing the opposite, to the point where that investment has become mispriced.
