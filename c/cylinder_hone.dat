40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to investigate the effect of <b>cylinder</b> liner <b>honing</b> angle on hydrodynamic lubrication between piston ring and cylinder liner. The Reynolds equation was solved in 2 D with periodic boundary conditions. An artificial surface texture was generated, based on a real surface measured with white light interferometry.

50|$|The term {{is derived}} from <b>honing</b> <b>cylinders</b> and holes. A flat {{workpiece}} surface is processed, hence the word flat; the word honing is used because the cutting speed is low compared to grinding. A fixed abrasive is used to provide accuracy and optical appearance of the surface finish. Sometimes it is also called fine grinding or surface grinding using planetary kinematics.|$|R

A study to investigate the effect of <b>cylinder</b> liner <b>honing</b> angle on hydrodynamic lubrication between piston ring and cylinder liner. Honing angles between 25 - 75 ° were investigated to find the effect of honing angle on film thickness. The plateau-honing is an ultra-finishing process as a result of two machining processes: rough honing with big size abrasive grains and finish honing with very small size abrasive grains to eliminate peaks {{on the surface of the}} piece. It is a very complex process depending on many parameters...|$|R

Shortly after seeing a painting by Franz Kline, Artschwager discovered Celotex, a rough-textured fiberboard used on ceilings as acoustic paneling, as a medium to enhance the load gesture. Handle (1962) was the breakthrough piece. A rectangle 4 feet wide and 30 inches high is crafted from a <b>cylinder</b> of <b>honed</b> and polished wood. Although three-dimensional like a sculpture, it hangs on the wall like a painting, only enclosing {{a view of the}} wall behind it. That same year, he directed his first combination work, using painting and Celotex sculpture (Portrait I and Portrait II). Also from 1962 Artschwager painted grey acrylic monochrome pictures, basing his images on black-and-white photographs, characteristically of modern buildings as shown in property advertisements, as in Apartment House (1964).|$|R
40|$|Honing is {{a process}} for {{finishing}} surfaces to obtain smooth surface. This process is used for final polish of inner parts such as engines cylinders. Optimizing this process {{has always been a}} big challenge for mass production of cylinder blocks of internal combustion engines. Honing process has some variable parameters, thus to get their optimum rates the automobile cylinders were tested. In this research, experiment design was done using Taguchi method and to make input constant parameters of the test consistence, cylinder was bored using boring machine and in the next phase, <b>cylinder</b> was <b>honed</b> according to the design of experiment. Abrasive particles were selected from the material of carbide silicone stone and the variable parameters considered in this test were tangential speed, grain size, and the number of tools course. In order to measure surface quality of each cylinder, roughness tester machine was used and surface quality considered as output parameters of machining. Then, the results of the test were studied and analyzed on software environment. According to the tests conducted, the optimum values of mesh stone of honing and optimum values of numbers related to the course number and rotation were identified on the best state...|$|R
50|$|In 1942, at {{the height}} of World War II, Bill Brodey was engaged in selling various tools and {{machines}} including Joseph Sunnen honing machines used for <b>honing</b> <b>cylinder</b> bores of engines. Torque wrenches were being imported and sold alongside of the honing machines because it was known that uneven torque tightening of engine cylinder head bolts would distort the cylinder bore. Bill and his friend Ernest Thornitt applied to the UK Ministry of Supply requesting permission to manufacture torque wrenches in the UK. Torque wrenches were much in demand for the manufacture of Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines and the UK Government was keen to manufacture in the UK wherever possible to reduce pressure on the Atlantic supply convoys. Consequently, permission was granted to 'The North Bar Tool Company' to start manufacturing torque wrenches in 'North Bar Place', Banbury in the United Kingdom. The address 'North Bar' gave the company its name and this was later contracted to 'Norbar'.|$|R

[20, 21] found the effect of surface smoothness and plateauness and theirs evolution during running-in tests. Then, they showed that ellipse patterns oriented at ring sliding direction contribute the most to reduce the friction coefficient using a reciprocating ring-liner tribometer. Grabon et al.

40|$|This is an Open Access article {{published}} by Sage and distributed {{under the terms}} of the Creative Commons Attribution 3. 0 Licence (CC BY 3. 0), [URL] topography is important as it influences contact load-carrying capacity and operational efficiency through generated friction, as well as wear. As a result, a plethora of machining processes and surface finishing techniques have been developed. These processes yield topographies, which are often non-Gaussian, with roughness parameters that alter hierarchically according to their interaction heights. They are also subject to change through processes of rapid initial running-in wear as well as any subsequent gradual wear and embedding. The stochastic nature of the topography makes for complexity of contact mechanics of rough surfaces, which was first addressed by the pioneering work of Greenwood and Williamson, which among other issues is commemorated by this contribution. It is shown that their seminal contribution, based on idealised Gaussian topography and mean representation of asperity geometry should be extended for practical applications where surfaces are often non-Gaussian, requiring the inclusion of surface-specific data which also evolve through process of wear. The paper highlights a process dealing with practical engineering surfaces from laboratory-based testing using a sliding tribometer to accelerated fired engine testing for high performance applications of cross-hatched <b>honed</b> <b>cylinder</b> liners. Such an approach has not hitherto been reported in literature...|$|R

40|$|Frictional at {{the piston}} ring/cylinder liner (PRCL) {{interface}} {{is the single}} most significant contributor to the mechanical loss in an internal combustion engine. The {{purpose of this study is}} to: (a) advance the understanding of the frictional loss phenomenon at the PRCL contact in internal combustion engines through correlation of the numerical models developed herein and previously obtained experimental results; (b) Examine methods of reducing the parasitic losses at the PRCL contact through the use of modified surfaces. Three mixed lubrication models of progressively increasing complexity are developed and used to investigate the tribological behavior of the PRCL contact. The first model utilizes a typical stochastic asperity contact model coupled with a cavitation enabled Reynolds equation. Lubrication regime transitions are investigated and compared to experimental results with good agreement. The second model utilizes a new, semi-deterministic approach to modeling the asperity contact pressure. It is shown that this method allows for more accurate prediction of friction in the case of non-Gaussian surfaces. The third model handles mixed lubrication using a fully deterministic approach, which allows the inclusion of surface modifications. Modified surfaces are shown to provide a significant (50 - 60 %) decrease in the average frictional loss over the cycle. Two approaches for the numerical synthesis of <b>honed</b> <b>cylinder</b> liner surfaces are then described and compared to measured surfaces with good agreement. Experiments conducted with a small engine dynamometer show reduced friction in the presence of laser modified surfaces. ...|$|R
