40|$|Abstract. In {{learning}} tasks, {{interaction is}} mostly about {{the exchange of}} knowledge. The interaction process shall be governed {{on the one hand}} by the knowledge the tutor wants to convey and on the other by the lacks of knowledge of the learner. In human-robot interaction (HRI), it is usually the human demonstrating or explicitly verbalizing her knowledge and the robot acquiring a respective representation. The ultimate goal in interactive robot learning is thus to enable inexperienced, untrained users to tutor robots in a most natural and intuitive manner. This goal is often impeded by a lack of knowledge of the human about the internal processing and expectations of the robot and by the inflexibility of the robot to understand open-ended, unconstrained tutoring or demonstration. Hence, we propose mixed-initiative strategies to allow both <b>to</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the interactive learning process as a bi-directional negotiation about knowledge. Along this line this paper discusses two initially different case studies on object manipulation and learning of spatial environments.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{observation}} of the paucity of comparisons between Northern and Southern squatting, this chapter analyzes the obstacles to such comparisons and tries to open pathways to develop a comparative research agenda beyond regional studies. Squatted settlements are bigger in the South, squatting policies are much more institutionalized in the South, forms of collective action diverge, and local contexts are extremely different. However, we believe that conceptual, methodological and contextual problems can be overcome by adopting a political economy approach emphasizing toleration and formalization policies as a common point of departure {{in order to address}} the puzzling question of persistence of illegal housing in both hemispheres. We identify three main reasons that explain the persistence of squats and slums in the 21 st century, not only due to policy failures. Firstly, public administrations <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> create illegality by planning the city for growth and attractiveness. Secondly, they strategically tolerate illegal housing to defend economic and political interests. Finally, both Northern and Southern squatters collectively organize to resist evictions and to survive in cities in times of crisis. Behind these common results, we argue that each research tradition can learn from the other and their synthesis <b>mutually</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> the improvement of our knowledge of illegality, informal housing and urban policies...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSince 2006, the gang-related homicide rate in Salinas, California, has quadrupled. As of 2009, the homicide rate associated with gang activity far exceeds that of much larger California {{cities such as}} San Francisco, San Jose, and even Los Angeles. This thesis examines this negative trend {{through the lens of}} counterinsurgency, since gangs exhibit many similarities, in structure and tactics, to insurgent groups. Accordingly, this thesis capitalizes on the diverse academic theories available to the study of counterinsurgencies. While the common narrative for an effective counterinsurgency campaign focuses on the importance of information dominance, there has been little research into component factors that might either promote or inhibit the flow of information that is also critical in combating the American street-gang phenomenon. In reality, gangs exist because of an information advantage bestowed upon them by the population. Thus, we postulate that two factors, information volume and information processing, <b>mutually</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> information dominance with respect to a counter-gang strategy. Through comparative analysis, our research suggests that improving relationships between the population and the government encourages more communication about gang activities. Additionally, improving communication structures within the government enhances information processing. Combined, these two factors reduce the gang's information advantage.

Such platelet aggregates are strengthened by fibrin-network formation triggered by tissue factor (TF). However, little is known about the role of TF in VWF-dependent thrombus formation under blood flow conditions. We evaluated TF in thrombus formation on immobilized VWF under whole blood flow conditions in an in vitro perfusion chamber system. Surface-immobilized TF amplified intra-thrombus fibrin generation significantly under both low and high shear flow conditions, while TF in sample blood showed no appreciable effects. Furthermore, immobilized TF enhanced VWF-dependent platelet adhesion and aggregation significantly under high shear rates. Neutrophil cathepsin G and elastase increased significantly intra-thrombus fibrin deposition on immobilized VWF–TF complex, suggesting the involvement of leukocyte inflammatory responses in VWF/TF-dependent mural thrombogenesis under these flow conditions. These results reveal a functional link between VWF and TF under whole blood flow conditions, in which surface-immobilized TF and VWF <b>mutually</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> mural thrombus formation, which is essential for normal hemostasis.

Most biological research, however, focuses on functionally defined sub-networks. Thus, {{it is important}} to know whether the sub-networks retain the same topology of the global networks, from which they derive. To address this issue, we have analyzed the protein-protein interaction sub-network that participates in the polarized growth of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and that is derived from the global network of this model organism. We have observed that, in contrast to global networks, the distribution of connectivity k (i. e., the number of interactions per protein) does not follow a power law, but decays exponentially, which reflects the local absence of hub proteins. Nonetheless, far from being randomly organized, the polarity sub-network can be subdivided into functional modules. In addition, most non-hub connector proteins, besides ensuring communications among modules, are linked <b>mutually</b> and <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the formation of the polarisome, a structure that coordinates actin assembly with polarized growth.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to address}} the {{relationship}} of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilms to the endogenously produced gas nitric oxide (NO) in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). While S. aureus biofilms are associated with recalcitrance and high severity in CRS, the naturally elevated NO gas is significantly lower in sinuses of CRS patients. However, the relationship of these 3 important factors in CRS aetiopathogenesis is poorly defined. To further clarify this host-microbe-environment (NO) relationship, this thesis first looks {{into the history of}} each factor, the roles they play in other disease processes, and the most recent clinical findings and applications in current literature. Building on this foundation, the projects emanating from this thesis hoped to fill in some gaps in knowledge of these 3 components, identifying that all are linked to disease manifestation, and that each can <b>mutually</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> CRS pathogenesis. The first project was designed to establish a clearer description of the relationship between NO and S. aureus biofilms. Utilizing S. aureus strains from CRS patients, these were grown as biofilms and exposed to various NO concentrations mimicking NO levels measured in healthy sinuses vs. CRS patients. We demonstrated the dualistic effects of NO on biofilm growth: increased at lower NO concentrations mimicking diseased sinuses, and anti-biofilm effects at higher concentrations similar to measurements in healthy sinuses. These findings became a stepping stone for the potential design of NO as a therapeutic agent in S. aureus-associated CRS. But first, further characterization of NO’s role on the host immune response was needed. The 2 nd and 3 rd projects aimed to define the host–NO relationship, focusing on the genes involved in NO regulation within the sinonasal mucosa. Because NO {{is considered one of the}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), major players of the innate immune response, genes involved in ROS/innate immunity were investigated. CRS patients, with or without polyps, were sub-classified as either with or without S. aureus biofilms, allowing a separate analysis of the role S. aureus biofilms play in the alteration of gene expression. The results showed that S. aureus biofilm presence associates with a significant difference in the certain gene expressions which have specific roles in NO regulation. This indicates that the microorganism may alter or <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> an impaired localized innate immune response in the sinuses, or alternatively favor growth in genetically susceptible individuals. Although the cause-effect timeline was not established, these results will serve as baseline for future gene and protein studies that will further increase our understanding of the NO-CRS pathophysiology. Lastly, building on the therapeutic potential of NO as an anti-biofilm agent, we aimed to design a suitable NO-based topical agent against S. aureus biofilms. The 4 th project tested a multitude of liposome-encapsulated NO formulations in-vitro with the best formulation tested for safety and efficacy in a sheep model of rhinosinusitis. These projects were designed with an aim for future clinical trials, to test a novel NO-based topical agent, which can be used as a safe and efficacious topical sinus rinse to benefit CRS patients.

It argues that forensic evidence, while popularly understood as firmly rooted in materiality, is inseparably technoscientific and cultural.

While focused on battery electric cars, renewable energy generation and smart grids, the paper has wider applicability {{to an understanding of the}} interplay between place, innovation and sustainability which suggests that diverse solutions are likely to be the characteristic solution rather than ubiquity and standardization. The paper argues, however, that the innovative business model, the deployment of electric vehicles, and the use of renewable energy systems, in this case largely based on wind power, while <b>mutually</b> supportive and <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> wider policy aims with respect to the reduction of carbon emissions, may still fail in the face of entrenched practices. At the theoretical level it is concluded that theorization of business models needs a broader perspective beyond the typical ‘value creation, value capture’ rubric to better understand the wider role such models have in meeting societal goals, and to understand the structural impediments to organizational and technical innovation...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of the knowledge-based economy requires strengthening the system of connections between universities and the business environment. The co-operation of universities with enterprises <b>contributes</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>to</b> both a growth of their competitiveness and innovativeness and to an enhanced attractiveness of university graduates on the labour market. According to employers, the competence of Polish university graduates that is most acutely missing {{is the ability to}} link theoretical knowledge with business practice requirements. The paper presents the principal form of possible co-operation of universities with business, including: co-operation in research, commissioning topics of diploma theses, co-operation in the field of traineeships and delivering university courses by business representatives as well as institutional foundations of such co-operation. The last element of the paper is the presentation of selected results of our own survey among the alumni of the Faculty of International and Political Studies of the University of Lodz concerning their evaluation of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the university from the perspective of attractiveness of graduates on the labour market and possible forms of co-operation with their former faculty. Alumni may constitute a bridge between academia and business. 31951126 Studia Edukacyjn...|$|R
40|$|White grubs became {{increasingly}} difficult pests in Nepal {{for the last}} few years. Their infestation has been reported throughout the country and magnitude of the problem has been widespread over the past years. In majority of the farming situation, control of these pests are largely abandoning {{because of the lack of}} control over their damages. In general, the management strategy depends primarily on the use of highly poisonous poor graded chemical pesticides. The use of bio-control agents in general and fungal based mycoinsecticides in particular are lacking in the country. The former practices have further aggravated the pest problem resulting in wider reluctances for the cultivation of major cereals as well as cash crops in upland farming. With a view to address these issues, an alternative control measures based on fungal antagonist with the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae in Nepal was sought since 2003 with the initiation and financial support of Helvetas/ Intercooperation through the coordination of Sustainable Soil Management Programme (SSMP-Nepal). The research was prompted by the serendipitous findings of M. anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana in Nepal from infected white grubs and soils during an exploratory study at Institute of Agriculture and Animal Sciences (IAAS), Rampur. Insect pathogenic fungi, M. anisopliae (green muscardine fungus) and B. bassiana (white muscardine fungus) were identified by a Swiss scientist, Dr Siegfried Keller for the first time in Nepal. With the hope of gearing up of the further works, research plans were drafted, collaborating organizations were identified, and financial supports were solicited and permitted. The research was intensively supported and monitored at various capacities by Dr Siegfried Keller, Senior Scientist, Agroscope FAL Reckenholz, Zurich, Prof. Dr Peter Nagel, University of Basel, Dr Dirk Ahrens, Germany and Dr Philip Kessler, Switzerland through their visits and electronic contacts. This thesis examines the effect of the indigenous insect pathogenic fungus M. anisopliae against white grubs in Nepal through a series of laboratory and field experiments. Each of the stages in the development and optimization of a mass production technique for the field assessment is discussed. Two kinds of initiatives such as exploratory initiatives and exploitation initiatives were undertaken during the study. Both groups of initiatives are interlinked and <b>mutually</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> each other. The former initiative includes the search of the indigenous insect pathogenic fungi from the soils and insects mainly from white grub prone areas of Nepal. The activities placed under the exploitation initiatives include development of the technology of production and application of insect pathogenic fungi as a means of white grubs control in particular and pest insects in general. In order to conduct the laboratory work, the Insect Pathology Laboratory with a modest level of facilities has been established within the premises of the Entomology Department of IAAS, Rampur of Tribhuvan University (TU). Several dozens of isolates of the insect pathogenic fungi M. anisopliae and more than half a dozen of B. bassiana were recovered from natural soil and diseased insects using a selective medium and the Galleria bait method (GBM). They have been maintained at IAAS, Rampur and as a security copy at FAL Agroscope Reckenholz, Zurich. Isolation, maintenance, mass production and efficacy tests with virulent strains of M. anisopliae were conducted. Identification of the damaging species of white grubs was one of the pre requisite for the development of effective control measures. Dynamics of the common beetle species were carried out through light traps and field sampling. They were later identified based on morphological grounds. A three-tired screening strategy: exploration of insect pathogenic fungi in the farmers’ field, pathogenicity assessment under laboratory conditions and its exploitation in farmer’s field in Chitwan, Nawalparasi, Tanahun and Parbat Districts of Nepal has been initiated. Exploratory study revealed that M. anisopliae is widely distributed in the Nepalese soils and in insects, however, with low density of B. bassiana. Selective medium has proved to be suitable medium for fungus growth and maintenance. Host passages are needed for retaining the virulence. Disease prevalence of M. anisopliae in grub cadaver was between 0 and 2...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with Human-Computer Interaction {{in the context of}} what we call “social television”: the recent embracement of television systems, internet technologies, and social services. The ultimate research goal of this thesis is the development of novel, appropriate interaction concepts to support social television users – located either in situ (mobile in the field) or at-home – dealing with both user-generated or authoritative (professional) contents. To develop concrete interaction concepts and to empirically validate their suitability, the present thesis puts a narrow focus on the event participation where spectators share the very same location and happening. Event participation is certainly a great way for many to get involved in a fun activity and to form a community. The so-called local-scope mass events – such as stadium -based sporting events – attract a large number of spectators to witness and experience the live atmosphere of something extraordinary in-situ. Moreover, the availability of a variety of event-related multimedia content – such as professional broadcasts and user-generated content – enables an even larger number of TV viewers to follow live happenings remotely at homes. Beside all inherent advantages that each type of the event participation offers, they suffer from several limitations. The monotony of a single (and thus restricted) viewing perspective, particularly in all-seater event venues, may potentially result in missing important moments, scenes and sub-events that occur out of the view of or far away from spectators. As another consequence of being physically restricted to a particular seat, social interaction of spectators is limited to nearby people. On the other hand, TV viewers following the event remotely require more immediate and less distracting interaction modalities at homes. Moreover, they may feel socially disconnected as there is less proper and immediate way to share their excitement, opinion, and support for their team which may mar event experiences. The present thesis aims at reducing these deficiencies by leveraging late technology trends, in particular mobile video sharing and body-centric sensing approaches. The contributions of the present thesis are placed alongside three main research directions. The first, in-situ experiences, explores how mobile user-generated content (particularly video) sharing in real-time can support the coconstruction of experiences during local-scope mass events. It particularly focuses on investigating the design requirements and guidelines for mobile systems supporting both multicamera viewing perspective and social interactions in-situ. Based on an iterative design process, it further contributes a set of novel interaction techniques for user-generated livevideo sharing which are then evaluated in two field studies. The results indicatethat the novel digital experience with live video on mobile devices enhances the overall event experiences in-situ. The second research direction, at-home experiences, looks at how viewers can interact with televisions in a less-distracting way, particularly while watching a live program. It focuses on device-less and body-centric interaction that goes beyond the traditional button-based remote control paradigm. In this light, two novel bodybased TV user interfaces are proposed supporting the whole body and hand-based inputs. The findings of a set of user studies confirmed that leveraging the human body as an interface for the television has various advantages – such as being omnipresent, device-less, and eyes-free – and thus can enhance the experience of TV watching activity in living room settings. Finally, the third research direction, home-field (connected) experiences, addresses how the gap between people participating the event in the field and following it from home can be bridged. The social patterns and preferences of TV viewers for watching – not only live coverage of mass events but also other main TV genres – with non-collocated people are initially examined. The analysis leads to a set of requirements that served as rationale for the design of interaction techniques to connect sport fans in both realms. This is achieved through sharing mobile live video sharing as well as implicit gestural information of viewers in front of the TV. An early user feedback evaluation reveals a great potential for <b>mutually</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the event engagement, potentially leading to more immersive and socially connected experiences during live sporting events...|$|R
