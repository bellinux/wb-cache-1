5|$|Overall <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> {{reconstruction}} {{was estimated}} at $2.5billion, which was estimated to take four years. The <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> repairing the damaged houses {{was estimated at}} $484.8million. Following the storm, workers made emergency repairs to the destroyed bridges and roads. The <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> rebuilding roads was higher than their damage cost due to planning for future flooding. Within a month, there were repairs to the power grid {{to a level of}} 550MW, or 91.7% of what it was before Mitch struck. Water companies restored water to 60% of Tegucigalpa within a month of the storm striking.|$|E
5|$|Fredericton {{was laid}} down by Marine Industries on 22 March 1941 and {{completed}} five months and 11 days later on 2 September 1941. The total <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> construction was about $600,000 CAN. She was commissioned for active duty on 8 December 1941.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> each {{ship was}} {{estimated}} at 1.168 billion rubles, almost four times the 322 million rubles for a Sverdlov-class cruiser. The ship {{was intended to be}} commanded by a rear admiral, with its executive officer, political officer and the heads of the gunnery and engineering divisions as captains 1st rank.|$|E
30|$|As {{operational}} costs, {{we consider}} all variable {{costs related to}} the distribution activities in the city. All in all, we can distinguish between the labour <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> the carriers, the <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> using the vehicles, and the <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> using DPs.|$|R
30|$|In summary, the {{relevant}} <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> the problem considered here must include all in-store replenishment processes after an item {{has reached the}} showroom. The decision-relevant costs can be separated into fixed and variable replenishment <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> direct and backroom replenishment, as well as inventory holding <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> items in the showroom and backroom.|$|R
50|$|Composite {{propellers}} are 100% recyclable and {{can help}} preserve the environment. Recycled propellers reduce material and energy <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> manufacturers allowing <b>for</b> lower <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> consumers.|$|R
5|$|The {{success of}} OPP did {{come at a}} <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> Dr Khan as his liberal views and {{self-help}} initiatives were questioned and criticized by certain interest groups. At two occasions, {{he was accused of}} blasphemy. However, all allegations against him were acquitted by the courts of law and cleared by independent religious scholars.|$|E
5|$|The {{wholesale}} price in UK {{is less than}} 5 pence per pill, however the RX system covers the <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> citizens. Canada and Mexico also have a similar cost, with average price of 4 cents per pill.|$|E
5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll clutching a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. Up to half of the $40,000 <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local program {{to raise money for}} community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large floodlights were installed on the bridge to discourage further damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{origin of}} <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> society is the long-term care by {{health care professionals}} and particularly institutionalisation, which corresponds to 2/3 of the total <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> society. The <b>cost</b> of living at home is also very high, especially when informal <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> the family, such as caregiving time and caregiver's lost earnings, are taken into account.|$|R
30|$|The <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> {{the camera}} system {{are similar to}} the camera <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> photogrammetry, at most $ 10, 000 for a camera, tripod and quality prime lens.|$|R
30|$|<b>Costs</b> <b>for</b> {{training}} personnel: <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> full-time, part-time {{and external}} training personnel {{for the period}} in which they were unable to work productively because they instructed apprentices.|$|R
5|$|According to Naman Ramachandran, {{the author}} of , most of Rajinikanth's philanthropic {{activities}} went unpublicised {{because he did not}} want them to be so. In the 1980s, when superstitious beliefs prevented a majority of people from donating eyes, Rajinikanth took the case of campaigning in support of corneal transplantation via television and public speeches. In 2011, Rajinikanth announced his support for the anti-corruption movement led by Gandhian Anna Hazare and offered his marriage hall, the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandapam, in Chennai free of <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> the India Against Corruption members to hold their fast. Rajinikanth's fan associations regularly organise blood donation and eye donation camps and distribute food during his birthday.|$|E
5|$|According to {{an early}} {{estimate}} by The Globe and Mail, 25,000 uniformed police officers, 1,000 security guards from Commissionaires Great Lakes, and several Canadian military forces were to be deployed during the summit. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) conducted Amalgam Virgo exercises on May 6 and 7 across the Greater Toronto Area using CF-18 Hornet jets, CH-124 Sea Kings, and CH-146 Griffon helicopters at low altitudes. The total <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> security at both the G8 and the G20 summits {{was determined to be}} , paid entirely by the federal Crown-in-Council, excluding the costs of any possible damage to local business.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{medications}} globally with an estimated 40,000 tonnes (50 to 120 billion pills) being consumed each year. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Aspirin is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world as of 2014 is 0.002 to 0.025 USD per dose. As of 2015 the <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> a typical month of medication in the United States is less than US$25.|$|E
50|$|As of 2017 {{building}} <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> {{wind power}} stations have become competitive with <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> natural gas power {{even without a}} subsidy. Wind power is cheaper than nuclear power.|$|R
25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} {{maintaining}} one entity for food service lowers <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> the University, {{which in turn}} lowers <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> students. Also, the fact that food service workers are not UC employees further lowers <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> the university. Furthermore, UCI notes the large investment Aramark is making is in dining infrastructure, which will outlast its current contract and support UCI's long-range development plan.|$|R
3000|$|Variable <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> direct {{replenishment}} are incurred {{for every}} delivered unit of an item. These are quantity-dependent <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> actual shelf-stacking and shelf-refilling activities per unit (e.g., positioning the delivered units, unpacking).|$|R
5|$|Community {{opposition}} did exist, {{mainly from}} residents of Ahwatukee. While the Maricopa Association of Governments had considered building a limited access parkway or arterials along the South Mountain Freeway's proposed route, the eight-lane freeway concept ultimately was {{pushed by the}} region's planners to meet the traffic needs at close to the same <b>cost.</b> <b>For</b> most of 2010, the Gila River Indian Community, Maricopa Association of Governments, City of Phoenix, ADOT and others discussed movement of the alignment to tribal land, but no agreements were reached.|$|E
5|$|Cumulative U.S. {{military}} expenditures {{throughout the entire}} Cold War amounted to an estimated $8trillion. Further nearly 100,000 Americans {{lost their lives in}} the Korean and Vietnam Wars. Although Soviet casualties are difficult to estimate, as a share of their gross national product the financial <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> the Soviet Union was much higher than that incurred by the United States.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, American bombers {{such as the}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-29 Superfortress were {{protected}} by long-range escort fighters such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang. These fighters could not match {{the range of the}} Northrop B-35 or Convair B-36, the next generation of bombers developed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The development <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> longer-ranged fighters was high, while aerial refueling was still considered risky and technologically difficult. Pilot fatigue had also been a problem during long fighter escort missions in Europe and the Pacific, giving further impetus to innovative approaches.|$|E
30|$|In step 1, {{the total}} <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> a single {{transport}} segment (per train / per barge / per truck) were calculated. Then the segment <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> a single container were worked out {{by dividing the}} total segment cost {{by the number of}} containers. In the final step, the total trip <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> a single container were calculated by adding the <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> all transport segments. In rail transport, each shunting process was considered as a new transport segment (the shunting segments consisted of: collection: siding -> shunting yard; mainline operation: shunting yard -> shunting yard; distribution: shunting yard -> siding).|$|R
50|$|The {{externalities}} of automobiles, as similarly {{other economic}} externalities, are the measurable <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> other parties except the car proprietor, such costs not being {{taken into account}} when the proprietor opts to drive their car. According to the Harvard University, the main externalities of driving are local and global pollution, oil dependence, traffic congestionand traffic accidents; while according to a meta-study conducted by the Delft University these externalities are congestion and scarcity costs, accident costs, air pollution costs, noise costs, climate change <b>costs,</b> <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> nature and landscape, <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> water pollution, <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> soil pollution and costs of energy dependency.|$|R
50|$|Required care {{is highly}} {{specialized}} and complex - including <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> acute, rehabilitative, emergency, primary mental health, home {{and long term}} care and adaptive equipment - resulting in substantial financial <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> governments.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, Grameen Bank {{started a}} new program, {{different}} from its traditional group-based lending, exclusively targeted to the beggars in Bangladesh. This program is focused on distributing small loans to beggars. The loans are completely interest-free, the repayment period can be arbitrarily long, and the borrower is covered under life insurance free of <b>cost.</b> <b>For</b> example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay back only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{assessed}} the F-22's cost to be $361million per aircraft, with $28billion invested in development and testing; the Unit Procurement Cost {{was estimated at}} $178million in 2006, based on a production run of 181 aircraft. It was estimated {{by the end of}} production, $34billion will have been spent on procurement, resulting in a total program cost of $62billion, around $339million per aircraft. The incremental <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> an additional F-22 was estimated at about $138million in 2009. The GAO stated the estimated cost was $412 million per aircraft in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In March 1996, the US General Accounting Office (GAO) {{stated that}} it was cheaper to buy HarrierIIPlus {{aircraft}} outright than to remanufacture existing AV-8Bs. The USN estimated the <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> remanufacture of each aircraft to be US$23–30million, instead of $30million for each new-built aircraft, while the GAO estimated the cost per new aircraft at $24million. Nevertheless, the program continued and, in 2003, the 72nd and last AV-8B to be remanufactured for the USMC was delivered. Spain also participated in the program, the delivery of its last refurbished aircraft occurring in December 2003, which {{marked the end of}} the AV-8B's production; the final new AV-8B had been delivered in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|The {{projected}} <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> {{the construction}} were projected at 9125 Million Dirhams, excluding <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> buying or acquiring land. {{but the final}} costs came to 10.800 MDH, which comes to 33,44 MDH per kilometer road ...|$|R
3000|$|Variable <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> backroom {{replenishment}} are incurred {{per unit}} refilled from the backroom to the showroom.

30|$|Access <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> institutions.|$|R
5|$|Initially, {{there was}} an {{intention}} to procure up to 400 aircraft for the Royal Navy and the RAF, but the development <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> the changes to accommodate the Spey turbofans meant that the per-unit price eventually ended up three times the price of an F-4J. Because the government then had a policy of negotiating fixed-price contracts, these costs could not be evened out by a large production run, which left the total order at 170.|$|E
5|$|Laying of tracks, signaling, {{power supply}} and other {{infrastructure}} {{was done by}} Baneservice. The <b>cost</b> <b>for</b> the entire section from Asker to Sandvika was NOK70 million.
