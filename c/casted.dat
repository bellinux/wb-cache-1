5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This <b>casted</b> doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E
5|$|Merchants {{engaged in}} a {{multitude}} of private trades and industries. A single merchant often combined several trades to make greater profits, such as animal breeding, farming, manufacturing, trade, and money-lending. Some of the most profitable commodities sold during the Han were salt and iron, since a wealthy salt or iron distributor could own properties {{worth as much as}} ten million cash. In the early Western Han period, powerful merchants could muster a workforce of over a thousand peasants to work in salt mines and marshes to evaporate brine to make salt, or at ironworks sites where they operated bellows and <b>casted</b> iron implements. To curb the influence of such wealthy industrialists, Emperor Wu nationalized these industries by 117 BCE {{and for the first time}} drafted former merchants with technical know-how such as Sang Hongyang (d. 80 BCE) to head these government monopolies. However, by the Eastern Han period the central government abolished the state monopolies on salt and iron. Even before this, the state must have halted its employment of former merchants in the government salt and iron agencies, since an edict of 7 BCE restated the ban on merchants entering the bureaucracy. However, the usurper Wang Mang (r. 923 CE) did employ some merchants as low-level officials with a salary-rank of 600 bushels. Another profitable industry was brewing wine and liquor, which the state briefly monopolized from 98 to 81 BCE, yet relinquished its production to private merchants once again (with alcohol taxes reinstalled). The official Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 CE) started a brewery business to help pay for his father's costly funeral, an act which was heavily criticized by his fellow gentrymen who considered this sideline occupation a shameful one for any scholar. Cinnabar mining was also a very lucrative industry.|$|E

500|$|Once {{copernicium}} is ionized, its chemistry {{may present}} several differences {{from those of}} zinc, cadmium, and mercury.

The fact that the 6d electrons participate more readily in chemical bonding means that once copernicium is ionized, it may behave more like a transition metal than its lighter homologues, especially in the possible +4 oxidation state. In aqueous solutions, copernicium may form the +2 and perhaps +4 oxidation states.

30|$|In {{separate}} investigations, both Chess et al. and Webb et al. {{noted the}} importance of a well-molded below-elbow plaster <b>cast</b> to prevent fracture displacement [7, 10]. The adequacy of <b>cast</b> molding has been quantified by the <b>cast</b> index, which is the ratio of the AP inner diameter of the <b>cast</b> divided by the lateral inner diameter of the <b>cast.</b> The normal index of a child’s forearm, based on anthropometric studies by Chess et al.

A poor <b>cast</b> index as been historically defined as greater than 0.79. While the quality of <b>cast</b> molding as seen on the lateral radiograph is quite important, we were unable to show a relationship between a higher <b>cast</b> index and a higher rate of initial <b>cast</b> treatment failure. We had 106 poorly molded <b>casts</b> (based on the <b>cast</b> index), of which 61 were in the above-elbow <b>cast</b> group and 45 were in the below-elbow <b>cast</b> group.

40|$|Purpose Plaster <b>casts</b> {{can cause}} burns. Synthetic <b>casts</b> do not. Composite plaster–synthetic <b>casts</b> {{have not been}} {{thoroughly}} evaluated. This study analyzed the temperature from plaster <b>casts</b> compared with composite <b>casts</b> {{in a variety of}} in vitro conditions that would simulate clinical practice. Methods A Pyrex cylinder filled with constant body temperature circulating water simulated a human extrem-ity. Circumferential <b>casts,</b> of either plaster or composite construction (plaster inner layer with outer synthetic layer), were applied to the model. Peak temperatures generated by the exothermic reactions were studied relative to the following variables: dip water temperature (24 C versus 40 C), <b>cast</b> thickness (16, 30, and 34 ply), and delayed (5 -min) versus immediate application of the synthetic outer layers. Peak temperatures from the all-plaster <b>casts</b> were compared with the composite <b>casts</b> of the same thickness. Finally, the relative <b>cast</b> strength was determined. Results Potentially dangerous high temperatures were measured only when 40 C dip water was used or when thick (30 - or 34 -ply) <b>casts</b> were made. <b>Cast</b> strength increased with increasing <b>cast</b> thickness. However, the presence of synthetics in the composite <b>casts</b> layers did not increase <b>cast</b> strength in every case. Conclusion When applying composite <b>casts,</b> the outer synthetic layers should be applied several minutes after the plaster to minimize temperature rise. Composite <b>casts</b> do not routinely generate peak temperatures higher than plaster <b>casts</b> of similar thickness. Because the skin of children and the elderly is more temperature-sensitive than average adult skin, extra care should be taken to limit the exothermic reaction when <b>casting</b> children and the elderly: clean, room temperature dip water, minimal required <b>cast</b> thickness, avoidance of insulating pillows/blankets while the <b>cast</b> is drying...|$|R

2500|$|Lower {{extremity}} casts {{are classified}} similarly, with a cast encasing both the foot and the leg to the hip {{being called a}} long leg cast, while a cast encasing the patient's foot, ankle and lower leg ending below the knee {{is referred to as}} a short leg cast. A walking heel may be applied for ambulation. These heels, when properly applied, elevate the toes and offer the wearer the advantage of keeping the toes out of the dirt and moisture of the street. [...] The walking heel provides a small contact patch for the cast and creates a fluid rocking motion during the stride and allows the cast to pivot easily in any direction. Similarly, a cast shoe/cast boot/cast sandal may be provided to the patient to be used during ambulation of the immobilized limb during convalescence (referred to as being weight bearing). [...] Additionally, a castshoe may be used to simply protect the patient's <b>casted</b> foot while helping to maintain a higher degree of hygiene by preventing the cast from directly contacting potentially dirty or wet ground surfaces. [...] Where the patient is not to walk on the injured limb, crutches or a wheelchair may be provided. The foot's under-sole portion of a leg cast may be extended terminating {{at the tip of the}} patient's toes, to create a rigid support which limits motion of the metatarsals in both weight bearing and non-weight bearing leg casts. [...] These are referred to as toeplates in the orthopedic discipline of medicine. This addition may be applied to further support and stabilize the metatarsals by limiting motion through a higher degree of immobilization, as well as protecting the toes from additional blunt force trauma. Typically leg casts which incorporate a toeplate are prescribed for injuries to the foot and metatarsals. [...] Ordinarily, a leg cast applied for the treatment of a stable ankle fracture would not use the toeplate design because there is no need to immobilize and limit the motion of the patient's toes.|$|E
2500|$|Mobility is {{severely}} restricted by the hip spica cast and walking without crutches or a walker is impossible because the hips cannot bend. There {{is a serious}} danger of falling if the patient in a hip spica cast tries to get upright to walk without assistance because they lack {{the ability to control}} their balance. Patients are normally confined to a bed or reclining wheelchair, or children's stroller. Children in spica casts can sometimes learn to get mobile by scooting around on skateboards, or pulling themselves across the floor. Some children even learn to walk by holding themselves up against furniture. A child in a spica cast must always be supervised and safety must always be considered when they are at a mobile phase of their healing to prevent reinjury or damage to the cast. Many spica casts have a spreader bar between the legs to help strengthen the cast and support the legs in the proper positions. It is important when moving the <b>casted</b> patient to not lift them by this spreader bar, as it may break and this could cause injury to the patient. To facilitate toileting or diaper changing and hygienic cleaning, an opening is created in the cast at the groin. The opening is normally referred to as the [...] "perineal opening". It is formed either during cast application or after cast application by cutting the hole with the cast saw. The opening must then be petalled or lined to keep this area of the cast clean and dry. Because the hips cannot bend, using a toilet is difficult, if not impossible. It is therefore necessary for the patient to either use a diaper, bedpan, or catheters to manage bodily waste eliminations. Bathing must be done by sponge baths. Hair may be shampooed by using plastic wash basins under the head. To shampoo wash the hair of a child, the child can be lifted and placed on a kitchen counter top and their head held over the kitchen sink.|$|E

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note in our study group, that the above-elbow <b>casts</b> appear to have had worse <b>cast</b> molding than the below-elbow <b>casts,</b> at least when comparing the <b>cast</b> index. The most probable explanation for this phenomenon is that the orthopedic residents performing the reductions and applying the <b>casts</b> have less variables to consider when applying a below-elbow <b>cast.</b> The ability to place a good mold on a below-elbow <b>cast</b> is facilitated by not dividing the <b>casting</b> physician’s attention between the mold at the fracture and the antecubital crease in the above-elbow <b>casts.</b> Although a difference between 0.8 and 0.77 (that found between the above-elbow <b>cast</b> and below-elbow <b>cast</b> groups, respectively) is statistically significant, the clinical significance may be argued. However, because the standard deviation for both groups was less than 1 %, it implies that a mean of 0.8 would place {{at least half of the}} above-elbow <b>cast</b> group in a poor mold based on historic controls, whereas a mean of 0.77 implies that many more in the below-elbow <b>cast</b> group have at least an acceptable mold. The inability to keep the <b>cast</b> index statistically similar between the two <b>cast</b> type groups (although not enough to predict treatment failure) may diminish our ability to confirm that below-elbow <b>casts</b> can maintain reductions equal to above-elbow <b>casts,</b> since the former appear to have been better molded than the latter.|$|R
