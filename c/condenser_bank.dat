Reductions in post-transient impact pressure are about 5 : 1 in the larger facility. Corresponding reduced electron number densities (about 2 x 10 to the 13 th power per cu cm) are noted. A new 125 -microsec pulse-forming network power source produced no major differences in impact pressure compared to the crowbarred <b>condenser</b> <b>bank</b> used earlier. Comparing a puff gas feed of the arc chamber with a new 10 -msec steady gas feed also shows no major difference in impact pressure for 125 -microsec powering...|$|E
40|$|Power {{supply for}} plasma control has been {{developed}} from <b>condenser</b> <b>bank</b> with ignitron for pulse tokamak plasma to PWM inverter with IGBT for steady tokamak plasma. Quaternion, four-dimensional hypercomplex number is good at describing three-dimensional rotation. Utilizing {{the performance of the}} quaternion rotation,we analyze three-phase power electronic circuit for the tokamak plasma control of equilibrium and stability. By further introduction of biquaternion concept, we can deal with phasor of each phase of three-phase AC similarly. But, we have to multiply the rotation operator from the left-hand side and from the right-hand side by using the conjugation. We try to verify the merits beyond the multiplication inconvenience from both sides. Not only symmetrical three-phase AC (positive sequence) but also negative sequence and zero sequence can be dealt with. Concerning quaternion power of three-phase AC, we can obtain the similar result as the one in pq theory. Quaternion can divide three-dimensional vector. The capability is utilized to develop matrix converter strategy based not only on Venturini method but also on space vector method in more detail...|$|E

The ions were produced by low pressure discharges between coaxial transparent-for-particles electrodes consisting of thin metal rods, supplied from 6. 5 - 55 μF <b>condenser</b> <b>banks</b> charged up to 30 - 35 kV. The measurements of mass- and energy-spectra of ions were performed {{by means of a}} Thomson spectrometer. Under appropriate gas conditions it was possible to observe the beams of deuterons of the average energy of several dozen keV, of the maximum energy over 200 keV, and of total intensity of several tens up to one hundred kA. Some preliminary studies on the direction of the ion beam emission were also performed...|$|R

In Room For One Colour (1998), a corridor lit by yellow monofrequency tubes, the participants {{find themselves in a}} room filled with light that affects the perception of all other colours. Another installation, 360 degrees Room For All Colours (2002), is a round light-sculpture where participants lose their sense of space and perspective, and experience being subsumed by an intense light. Olafur's later installation Din blinde passager (Your blind passenger) (2010), commissioned by the Arken Museum of Modern Art, is a 90-metre-long tunnel. Entering the tunnel, the visitor is surrounded by dense fog. With visibility at just 1.5 metres, museumgoers have to use senses other than sight to orient themselves in relation to their surroundings. For Feelings are facts, the first time Olafur has worked with Chinese architect Yansong Ma as well as his first exhibition in China, Olafur introduces <b>condensed</b> <b>banks</b> of artificially produced fog into the gallery of Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing. Hundreds of fluorescent lights are installed in the ceiling as a grid of red, green, and blue zones.|$|R
40|$|The {{maritime}} {{transportation system}} {{is an important}} component of the United States’ (U. S.) economy, from commerce activities to freight movement to disaster’ relief. The annual impact of the maritime transportation system on the U. S. national economy is reported as approximately $ 649 billion of the total U. S. gross domestic product (U. S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration, n. d.). This impact is attributed to activities related to the movement of goods and people. Indeed, the maritime transportation system plays an important role in international trade by transporting goods such as coal and farm products, which are common commodities for foreign and domestic commerce (Institute for Water Resources, 2012). The maritime transportation system is governed by multiple agencies including the Maritime Administration (MARAD), U. S. Army of Engineers (USACE), and U. S. Coast Guard. Because of the many stakeholders, there are many disjoint sources of data related to maritime transportation. In order to support efficient information gathering about the maritime transportation system, we have developed the Maritime Transportation Resource Bank, a reliable and <b>condensed</b> resource <b>bank</b> that identifies information and data sources related to maritime transportation, as a means to facilitate resource identification and advance knowledge about the system...|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of the optical spectra measurements for free plasma streams generated {{with the use of}} the modified DPF- 1000 U machine. This facility was recently equipped with a gas injection system (the so-called gas-puff) placed on the symmetry axis behind the central opening in the inner electrode. The DPF- 1000 U experimental chamber was filled up with pure deuterium at the initial pressure of 1. 6 or 2. 4 mbar. Additionally, when the use was made of the gas-puff system about 1 cm 3 of pure deuterium was injected at the pressure of 2 bars. The gas injection was initiated 1. 5 or 2 ms before the triggering of the main discharge. The investigated plasma discharges were powered from a <b>condenser</b> <b>bank</b> charged initially to 23 kV (corresponding to the energy of 352 kJ), and the maximum discharge current amounted to about 1. 8 MA. In order to investigate properties of a dense plasma column formed during DPF- 1000 U discharges the use was made of the optical emission spectroscopy. The optical spectra were recorded along the line of sight perpendicular to the vacuum chamber, using a Mechelle® 900 spectrometer. The recent analysis of all the recorded spectra made it possible to compare the temporal changes in the electron density of a freely propagating plasma stream for discharges without and with the gas-puffing. Using this data an appropriate mode of operation of the DPF- 1000 U facility could be determined...|$|E
40|$|A 15 kJ <b>condenser</b> <b>bank</b> for {{magnetic}} compression experiments is described. The operating voltage is 40 kV and the interpal inductance 3 nH. The {{rate of rise}} of the current under short-circuit conditions is 1. 3 · 10 ^ 13 A/sec. 60 units, each consisting of a 40 kV / 0. 31 μF coaxial condenser, a pressurized spark gap, and a special current-conductor, are switched in parallel and connected to the load {{by means of a}} two-plate collector system. The spark gap inductance is 10 nH and its jitter time stays below 10 nsec without resetting the electrodes in an operating range of 16 to 50 kV. This permitted a reduction of the decoupling length ofthe conductors to 1 m. Each current- conductor is composed of a coaxial transmission line with an internal inductance of 12 nH/m. For the construction of the collector system, it was essential to achieve minimum inductance and to obtain a high life time of theinsulating foil. These two requirements were fulfilled by choosing an initial insulating thicknes s of 0. 6 mm, and by constructing a highlyrigid collector system that allowed a surface planeness of hetter than ± 0. 01 mm and an extremely good surface quality. Large amplitude oscillations of the plates during the discharge are thus suppressed, achieving rather uniform mechanical stress. Later the insulating thickness can be further decreased to 0. 4 mm thereby reaching the limit of electric stress. In a coil of 15 cm length and 42 mm diameter, magnetic fields up to 120 kG with a quarter period of 0. 65 μsec have been generated...|$|E
40|$|For the {{compression}} of a cylindrical plasma by fast rising axial magnetic fields, the initial state of this plasma is {{of critical importance}} (1). Therefore experiments with a preheating discharge {{for the production of}} an initial plasma with known and reproducible properties were started at this laboratory simultaneously with the first experiments on {{the compression}} of a weakly preionized deuterium gas. An electrodeless ring discharge was chosen. The absence of electrodes makes a high degree of purity of the plasma possible. Kolb's experience with a preheating discharge for magnetic com-pression experiments (2) confirmed this conception and gave further impulse to this work. Early experiments were made with a RF-transmitter as current generator, in pulsed as weIl as in stationary operation. Dueto the low inductance of the compression coil considerable difficulties are met in coupling the RF power to the discharge. The maximum available power is limited to some hundred kilowatts. By discharging a low inductance condenser on the compression coil a damped RF pulse with apower of 100 M Watt is easily obtained. To avoid prefiring of the main <b>condenser</b> <b>bank,</b> the voltage of the coil must be lirnited. With the spark gaps used at this laboratory the maximum permissible voltage at the coil was about 5 kV. This voltage, however, is sufficient to start an electrodeless ring discharge in hydrogen. Investigations on this electrodeless ring discharge were made with and without a steady magnetic bias field in a wide pressure range. Preliminary results, concerning the breakdown of the gas, the formation of a highly ionized plasma, and the subsequent decay of the plasma dtie to end losses and recombination are reported in this paper...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} internal corporate ratings as {{a means by which}} commercial <b>banks</b> <b>condense</b> their informational advantage and preserve it vis- 0 -vis a competitive lending market. In drawing on a unique data set collected from leading universal banks in Germany, we are able to evaluate the extent to which non-public information determines corporate ratings. As a point of departure, the paper describes a sample of rating systems currently in use, and points at methodological differences between them. Relying on a probit analysis, we are able to show that the set of qualitative, or soft, factors is not simply redundant with respect to publicly available accounting data. Rather, qualitative information tends to be decisive in at least one third of cases. It tends to improve the firms' overall corporate rating. In the case of conflicting rating changes, i. e. when qualitative and quantitative rating changes have opposing signs, quantitative criteria dominate the overall rating change. Furthermore, the more restrictive the weighting scheme as part of the rating methodology is, the stronger is the impact of qualitative information on the firms' overall rating. The implications of our results underline the need to define stringent rating standards, from both a risk management and a regulatory point of view...|$|R
40|$|The {{toroidal}} {{machine has}} been designed appropriate to do the experiments leading to the breakthrough in researches of plasma turbulence and turbulent transport. The proposed new device can realize high accessibility and flexibility for performing physics experiments, particularly for realizing super multiple computer tomography (SMCT) that is the major diagnostics newly developed in this proposal. The diagnostics can observe wide range of different scales of fluctuations and cover the whole plasma cross-section. The proposal of this new device with the ambitious diagnostics is based on quite different concept that includes Japanese original ideas. Among toroidal machines tokamak will be appropriate for the experiment. The following machine parameters might be required as a rough target to obtain the plasma parameter required for diagnostics: the magnetic field strength of about 1 Tesla, the plasma major and minor radii of about 1 m and 30 cm, respectively, and the plasma current of about 150 kA. The top priority in designing the machine is put on versatility and flexibility of ports to enable detailed measurements of plasma parameters. Characteristic {{point is that the}} machine is equipped with diagnostics ports on the high field side. The shape of the toroidal field coil is not circular but D-shape-like to produce non-circular plasmas, which allows {{for the study of the}} influence of magnetic geometries and the realization of high plasma performance. There are two ways to energize the coils in a quasi-steady state: one is to use flywheel, motor-generator and thyristor stacks, and the other one is to use condenser banks. Here the priority is put on the <b>condenser</b> <b>bank.</b> Arbitrary waveforms of the coil current can be obtained by using IGBT as a switching element, of which characteristics are of higher frequency (several to 10 kHz) than that of thyristors with rectification of about 1 kHz. The high frequency characteristics result in low voltage ripple on the coil because high frequency noises are relatively easily removed with filters. Low level of noises will be essentially important for detailed measurements of fluctuations...|$|E
