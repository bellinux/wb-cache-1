This new development comes with new security and privacy challenges. Existing phone-based operating systems, Android in particular, are not ready for protecting authorized use of these external devices: indeed, any app on an Android phone that acquires permission to utilize communication channels like Bluetooth and Near Field Communications is automatically given the access to devices communicating with the phone on these channels. In this paper, we present the first study on this new security issue, which we call external Device Mis-Bonding or DMB, under the context of Bluetooth-enabled Android devices. Our research shows that this problem is both realistic and serious...|$|R
