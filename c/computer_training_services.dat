Forster worked with Governor Foster {{to pursue the}} “one-stop” concept; that is, having different government offices in a centralized location to accelerate access by those needing services. A prototype of the concept was unveiled in Slidell in suburban St. Tammany Parish in 2001. Forster explained, accordingly: [...] "All of the services that we offer in our regular offices, like <b>computer</b> <b>training,</b> placement <b>services</b> and Internet access, will now be available at the East St. Tammany Job Center. This is just another way that we are making things as easy as possible for anyone needing assistance." ...|$|R

The most successful of the businesses was Abacus, Inc., an early Macintosh computer vendor in San Francisco, which eventually offered a variety of <b>computer</b> hardware, <b>training</b> and <b>services.</b> At its height, Abacus employed over 250 people and had offices in five major California cities. Voted the 33rd and 42nd fastest growing privately held company in America by INC 500 in 1990 and 1991 respectively, Abacus achieved revenues in excess of $25 million per year. Prior to Apple Computer Corporation abandoning the Value-Added Reseller in 1992, Abacus was the number one reseller of Apple Macintosh computers in the Bay Area in 1991.|$|R

Purposely, it seeks to ascertain the type of information required by the lawyers to meet their specific information needs; their information seeking habits; different information sources used by them and the impact of ICT on their information seeking behavior. Data were collected with the help of questionnaire and analyzed through SPSS software version 14. It was noted that almost all the lawyers always seek information for case preparation. It was found that they acquire information from their District Bar Library; senior lawyers and personal collection. In case of urgent need of information they use law digest, personal collection and PLJ. They mentioned that English is their preferred language and print material is their preferred format. The results of the study showed that only three respondents admitted that ICT has completely changed their information seeking habits. However, they admittedthe fact that ICT has mad information seeking process easier. Frequency of internet usage by lawyers was gloomy. Only 11 respondents out of 54 reported that they use internet and admitted that their online information retrieval skill is poor.
