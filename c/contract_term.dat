His one-year contract with the school system was renewed three times; in 1969 the <b>contract</b> <b>term</b> was extended to two years.

Therefore, the district argued, neither did Doyle. And even if he did, his history of misconduct and intemperate outbursts was sufficient justification for his termination.|$|E
50|$|The Unfair <b>Contract</b> <b>Terms</b> Act 1977 (c 50) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom which regulates {{contracts}} {{by restricting}} {{the operation and}} legality of some <b>contract</b> <b>terms.</b> It extends to nearly all forms of contract {{and one of its}} most important functions is limiting the applicability of disclaimers of liability. The terms extend to both actual <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> and notices that are seen to constitute a contractual obligation.|$|R

Analyzing case law on internet contract enforceability and {{a survey of}} 500 firms’ websites, it demonstrates that even the enforceability of many internet contracts is questionable. It then presents new data that suggest that the prevalence of pro-seller <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> is far less than usually assumed. It suggests that the benefit of making these terms enforceable is outweighed {{by the loss of}} user friendliness required for the necessary interface changes. Finally, it uses fresh statistical analyses to determine what relationship, if any, exists between enforceability, pro-seller <b>contract</b> <b>terms,</b> business size, product channel, or product type. Generally, it concludes that the contract literature has likely overestimated the benefit of the pro-seller <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> and underestimated the role internet <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> play in informal enforcement; unenforceable terms may still serve as guideposts to dispute resolution...|$|R

25|$|The second, {{and older}} {{hallmark}} of the employment contract is that employees are bound to follow their employers’ instructions while at work, so long as that does not contravene statute or their agreed terms. Every employment relation leaves the employer with a residue of discretion, historically expressed as the ‘master-servant’ relationship. Today, in practice, this leaves the employer {{with the ability to}} vary the way work is done in accordance with business need. The courts have allowed this to continue, so long as it does not contradict a contract’s express terms, which always require an employee’s consent, or renegotiation of a collective agreement. The status of ‘flexibility clauses’, purporting to allow employers the discretion to vary any <b>contract</b> <b>term</b> has been contested, as it will often enable abuse of power that the common law controls. The limits of the courts’ tolerance for such practices are evident if they touch procedures for accessing justice, or potentially if they would contravene the duty of mutual trust and confidence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{promises}} {{offered by}} {{one person to}} another are the terms of a contract, but not every representation before an acceptance will always count as a term. The basic rule of construction is that a representation is a term if it looked like it was [...] "intended" [...] to be from the viewpoint of a reasonable person. It matters how much importance is attached to the term by the parties themselves, but also as a way to protect parties of lesser means, the courts added that someone who is in a more knowledgeable position {{will be more likely to}} be taken to have made a promise, rather than a mere representation. In Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams Mr Williams sold a Morris car to a second hand dealer and wrongly (but in good faith, relying on a forged log-book) said it was a 1948 model when it was really from 1937. The Court of Appeal held that the car dealer could not later claim breach of contract because they were in a better position to know the model. By contrast, in Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd the Court of Appeal held that when a car dealer sold a Bentley to a customer, mistakenly stating it had done 20,000 miles when the true figure was 100,000 miles, this was intended to become a term because the car dealer was in a better position to know. A misrepresentation may also generate the right to cancel (or [...] "rescind") the contract and claim damages for [...] "reliance" [...] losses (as if the statement had not been made, and so to get one's money back). But if the representation is also a <b>contract</b> <b>term</b> a claimant may also get damages reflecting [...] "expected" [...] profits (as if the contract were performed as promised), though often the two measures coincide.|$|E
2500|$|Relatively {{few cases}} are ever brought {{directly}} by consumers, given {{the complexity of}} litigation, cost, and its worth if claims are small. In order to ensure consumer protection laws are actually enforced, the Competition and Markets Authority has jurisdiction to bring consumer regulation cases on behalf of consumers after receiving complaints. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 section 70 and Schedule 3, the CMA has jurisdiction to collect and consider complaints, and then seek injunctions in the courts to stop businesses using unfair terms (under any legislation). The CRA 2015 is formally broader than UCTA 1977 in that it covers any unfair terms, not just exemption clauses, but narrower in that it only operates for consumer contracts. Under section 2, a consumer is an [...] "individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individual's trade, business, craft or profession." [...] However, while the United Kingdom could always opt for greater protection, when it translated the Directive into national law it opted to follow the bare minimum requirements, and not to cover every <b>contract</b> <b>term.</b> Under section 64, a court may only assess the fairness of terms that do not specify [...] "the main {{subject matter of the}} contract", or terms which relate to [...] "appropriateness of the price payable" [...] of the thing sold. Outside such [...] "core" [...] terms, a term may be unfair, under section 62 if it is not one that is individually negotiated, and if contrary to good faith it causes a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of the parties. A list of examples of unfair terms are set out in Schedule 2. In DGFT v First National Bank plc the House of Lords held that given the purpose of consumer protection, the predecessor to section 64 should be construed tightly and Lord Bingham stated good faith implies fair, open and honest dealing. This all meant that the bank's practice of charging its (higher) default interest rate to customers who had (lower) interest rate set by a court under a debt restructuring plan could be assessed for fairness, but the term did not create such an imbalance given the bank wished only to have its normal interest. This appeared to grant a relatively open role for the Office of Fair Trading to intervene against unfair terms. However, in OFT v Abbey National plc the Supreme Court held that if a term related in any way to price, it could not by virtue of section 64 be assessed for fairness. All the High Street banks, including Abbey National, had a practice of charging high fees if account holders, unplanned, exceeded through withdrawals their normal overdraft limit. Overturning a unanimous Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court viewed that if the thing being charged for was part of a [...] "package" [...] of services, and the bank's remuneration for its services partly came from these fees, then there could be no assessment of the fairness of terms. This controversial stance was tempered by their Lordships' emphasis that any charges must be wholly transparent, though its compatibility with EU law is not yet established by the European Court of Justice, and it appears questionable that it would be decided the same way if inequality of bargaining power had been taken into account, as the Directive requires.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} industry structure, {{corporate governance}} at firm-level and country-level, {{and the bank}} loan <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> by analysing 2, 689 companies from 23 countries during the period 2004 – 2008. We find that firms in less competitive industries, with better firm-level governance, or with better country-level governance borrow larger sized loans at lower interest rates without collateral requirements. However, the effect of monopoly power of market concentration on the loan <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> is adjusted by corporate governance mechanisms. By controlling for both firm-level and country-level governance, firms in competitive industries are found to have favored loan <b>contract</b> <b>terms.</b> Substitution effects between firm-level governance and country-level governance in determining the loan <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> are also evidenced by our results...|$|R

40|$|A {{rudimentary}} {{conceptualization of}} the development of ancillary <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> would assert competition will result in terms that are joint-wealth-maximizing for merchants and customers. Building on developments in modeling frictions in markets, this article presents simple models of frictions in multi-period contracting as to ancillary <b>contract</b> <b>terms.</b> The modeling illustrates that, for plausible parameter estimates of frictions, combinations of switching costs and investigation costs may allow collectively inferior <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> to persist in consumer transactions. The results are in harmony with recent evidence illustrating the infrequency with which consumers actually read <b>contract</b> <b>terms.</b> The modeling identifies circumstances where this opportunistic behavior [...] taking advantage of frictions to secure collectively suboptimal <b>contract</b> <b>terms</b> [...] is particularly likely. They include: (i) contracts of small dollar amounts, in terms of consideration or marginal cost in rendering performance; (ii) contracting involving the sequencing of relationship-specific investments during formation; (iii) multi-period contracting involving increasing switching costs; (iv) rapidly growing markets; and (v) merchants who bifurcate contractual terms among customers. A number of these factors are common to the provision of online services. This article additionally samples authority that can be revived by courts inclined to police opportunistic structuring of the methods of mutual assent to secure collectively suboptimal <b>contract</b> <b>terms...</b>|$|R
