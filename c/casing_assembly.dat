Pump <b>casing</b> <b>assembly</b> consists of single or multiple stages to meet exact system head requirements. A {{wide range of}} casing sizes are available to meet the system capacity requirements. Standard construction includes iron casing with bronze impellers on a stainless steel pump shaft. The Main problem associated with ductile iron casing is corrosion, {{because it will be}} immersed in water during operations. In this research work an attempt has been made to replace the metallic casing of multistage submersible pump with ABS material. First the geometric modeling of six stage pump is carried out using modeling package CATIA V 5. Then the model is imported to preprocessor solver hyper mesh, here finite element model of ductile iron and ABS is generated. After that FE model is imported in to ABAQUS V 6. 12 solver to carry out the static analysis for different pressures. The von mises stress developed for both the casings are compared. Water flow simulation inside the pump casing for ductile steel and ABS material for different pressures is simulated using Solid WorksV 11 solver. The maximum velocity distribution obtained for both materials are same. The prototype model of ABS pump casing is manufactured using FDM technique, this model is tested for physical properties using shore durometer. The obtained hardness values compared with ductile steel casing. Analysis results show that ductile iron can be replaced by ABS as it possesses good corrosion resistance and light weight.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a design process that can optimize an engine <b>casing</b> <b>assembly</b> to reduce tip clearance losses. Performing design optimization on the casings that form a gas turbine engine's external structure is a very tedious and cumbersome process. The design process involves the conceptual, the preliminary and the detailed design stages. The redesign costs involved are high when changes are made to the design of a part in the detailed design stage. Normally a 2 D configuration is envisaged by the design team in the conceptual design stage. Engine thrust, mass flow, operating temperature, materials and manufacturing processes available at the time of design, mass of the engine, loads and assembly conditions {{are a few of the}} many important variables that are taken into consideration when designing an aerospace component. The linking together of this information into the design process to achieve an optimal design using a quick robust method is still a daunting task. In this thesis, we present techniques to extract midsurfaces of complex 3 D axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric geometries based on medial axis transforms. We use the proposed FE modeling technique for optimizing the geometry by designing a sequential workflow consisting of CAD, FE analysis and optimization algorithms within an integrated system. An existing commercial code was first used to create a midsurface shell model and the results showed that such models could replace 3 D models for defection studies. These softwares being black box codes could not be customized. Such limitations restrict their use in batch mode and development for research purposes. We recognized an immediate need to develop a bespoke code that could be used to extract midsurfaces for FE modeling. Two codes, Mantle- 2 D and Mantle- 3 D have been developed using Matlab to handle 3 D axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric geometries respectively. Mantle- 2 D is designed to work with 2 D cross-section geometry as an input while Mantle- 3 D deals with complex 3 D geometries. The Pareto front (PF) of 2000 designs of the shell based optimization problem when superimposed on the PF of the solid based optimization, has provided promising results. A DoE study consisting of 200 designs was also conducted and results showed that the shell model differs in mass and defection by < 1 % and < 5. 0 % respectively. The time taken to build/solve a solid model varied between 45 - 75 minutes while the equivalent midsurface based shell model built using Mantle- 2 D required only 3 - 4 minutes. The Mantle- 3 D based dimensional reduction process for a complex non-axisymmetric solid model has also been demonstrated with encouraging results. This code has been used to extract and mesh the midsurface of a non-axisymmetric geometry with shell elements for use in finite element analysis. 101 design points were studied and the results compared with the corresponding solid model. The first 10 natural frequencies of the resulting shell model deviates from the solid model by < 4. 0 % for the baseline design, while the mass and defection errors were < 3. 5 % and < 9. 0 % for all 101 design points...|$|E

5000|$|Prior to the 1970s, {{collection}} of discrete groundwater samples from multiple depths in the subsurface required {{the installation of}} well clusters or nested wells [...] Well clusters consist of a closely spaced group of monitoring wells, each well completed to a different depth in individual boreholes. Well clusters were first used in the 1950s at contaminated sites. Because {{there is only one}} well screen in each borehole, there is little risk of vertical connection between zones. The individual wells in the cluster must be installed near one another (e.g., ≤10 ft. apart), so that the head data obtained from them is a result of variations in the vertical head and not horizontal gradients. Also, care must be taken to avoid installing clusters of wells with overlapping screens and sand packs - this may allow vertical movement of contamination between the wells in the presence of vertical hydraulic gradients. Installation of wells clusters can be expensive because of increased drilling costs associated with drilling multiple borings, especially in fractured rock. [...] Nested wells are wells constructed of two or more well screens and <b>casing</b> <b>assemblies</b> of different lengths installed in a single borehole. The key drawback of nested wells is that {{it can be difficult to}} effectively seal the portions of the borehole between the monitored zones. Nested wells were popular in the 1970s but many seal failures occurred. For this reason, nested wells are discouraged or prohibited in many areas. [...] There are typically three separate monitoring intervals in nested wells, although more monitoring intervals have been constructed in very deep monitoring wells. The risk of hydraulically connecting the various monitoring zones is inversely proportional to the thickness of the seals between the monitoring intervals. Thus, shallow nested wells with many monitoring zones are more at risk of hydraulic failure than deep nested wells with fewer monitoring zones.|$|R

40|$|Welding of nickel-based {{superalloys}} {{is employed}} {{in the manufacture of}} many important components of the jet engine, such as combustor <b>casings,</b> compressor disc <b>assemblies,</b> etc. Welds induce microstructural modification in the weld seam and the heat affected zone (HAZ) which generally reduce the fatigue resistance compared to that of the parent metal. Welds also generate significant residual stresses, both locally due to combination of solidification shrinkage and high temperature plastic deformation, and also globally through the general tensioning of the structure. Diffraction of high energy synchrotron X-rays is very well suited to the task of accurate non-destructive evaluation of residual stresses near welds in thin walled components assembled by welding nickel superalloys. Residual stresses induced by linear and annular welds produced in test pieces made from C 263 and IN 718 nickel based alloys under different conditions are evaluated, and the effects of various heat treatments on stress state are discussed.

30|$|A {{failure mode}} is {{regarded}} as any kind of damage to the downhole construction (e.g., casing strings, cement sheath) and/or surface equipment (e.g., wellhead) of a geothermal well that either temporarily excludes further drilling operations, well testing or fluid production, or leads directly to the partial or total well abandonment. All of the geothermal wells drilled into extremely high temperatures push their components including casing strings, <b>casing</b> connections, wellhead <b>assembly,</b> cement sheaths, drilling fluid to its technical limits. Based on the classification of casing failures made by Teodoriu (2015), excluding casing failure from corrosion, extensive wear, and overloading, most wells investigating high-temperature geothermal resources will fall {{into the category of}} the so-called temperature variation induced fatigue. This kind of failure is caused by large temperature variations and is aggravated by the lack of casing mobility within the cement sheaths. It is expected that such casing failure will be caused by accumulated temperature cycles, putting the casing material above its yield limit. Similarly to the casing material and connections, fatigue due to extensive thermally driven loads will lead to cement sheaths damage and loss of the cement bond at casing–cement or cement–rock interfaces with potential influx of hostile reservoir fluids.|$|R
