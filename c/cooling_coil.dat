500|$|Despite an {{incomplete}} {{understanding of the}} principles behind them, in some ways Evans's thinking {{about the potential for}} steam engines was once again far ahead of its time. In the postscript of the Steam Engineer's Guide, Evans noted that drawing a vacuum on water reduces its boiling point and cools it. He further observed that a vacuum would have the same effect upon ether, and the resulting cooling should be sufficient to produce ice. He went on to describe a piston vacuum pump apparatus to produce this effect, and also showed that a compression cylinder, or the compression stroke of the vacuum pump, should produce heat in a condenser. Thus Evans had produced the first detailed and theoretically coherent design for a vapor-compression refrigerator, identifying all the major components (expander, <b>cooling</b> <b>coil,</b> compressor and condenser) of a refrigeration cycle, leaving some to credit him as the 'grandfather of refrigeration'. [...] Although Evans never developed a working model of his designs, and {{there is no evidence that}} he ever attempted to, Evans in his later life worked and associated extensively with fellow inventor Jacob Perkins on steam engines and the potential for refrigeration. Perkins would later develop and build a refrigeration device for which he received patents in 1834–1835, employing much the same principles originally put forward by Evans.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "dew point temperature" [...] is an {{absolute}} measure of the moisture in air. Some facilities are being designed with the design dew points in the lower 50s °F, and some in {{the upper and lower}} 40s °F. Some facilities are being designed using desiccant wheels with gas fired heater to dry out the wheel enough to get the required dew points.

2500|$|On {{the liquid}} side of these heat exchangers, the common fluids are water, a water-glycol solution, steam, or a refrigerant. For heating coils, {{hot water and}} steam are the most common, and this heated fluid is {{supplied}} by boilers, for example. For cooling coils, chilled water and refrigerant are most common. Chilled water is supplied from a chiller that is potentially located very far away, but refrigerant must come from a nearby condensing unit. When a refrigerant is used, the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> is the evaporator in the vapor-compression refrigeration cycle. HVAC coils that use this direct-expansion of refrigerants are commonly called DX coils. [...] Some DX coils are [...] "microchannel" [...] type.|$|E

50|$|Because window air {{conditioner}} units have condensers and expansion units, {{some of them}} can be used as makeshift dehumidifiers by sending their heat exhaust back into the same room as the cooled air, instead of the outside environment. If the condensate from the <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> is drained away from the room as it drips off the <b>cooling</b> <b>coils,</b> the result will be room air that is drier but slightly warmer.|$|R

50|$|A {{lambda point}} {{refrigerator}} is a device used to cool liquid helium, typically around a superconducting magnet or for low temperature measurements, from approximately 4.2 K to temperatures near the lambda point of helium (approximately 2.17 K), the temperature at which normal fluid helium (helium I) transitions to the superfluid helium II. Cooling {{is achieved by}} pumping the liquid helium in the bath through a <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> via a needle valve and vacuum pump. The reduced pressure in the coil causes some of the helium to evaporate, creating a two-phase system within the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil.</b> The heat removed via evaporation lowers {{the temperature of the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> closer to the lambda point. Since the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> is immersed in the liquid helium bath, liquid surrounding the coil is also cooled. The colder, higher density liquid sinks away from the coil toward the bottom of the bath while the warmer, lower density liquid helium rises to the top. Liquid helium typically has poor thermal conductivity, so convective currents associated with a temperature gradient in the bath provide a constant flow of this colder liquid helium toward the bottom of the bath, allowing temperatures below 4.2 K to be realized in the helium bath, typically close to 2.2 K.|$|E

50|$|However, many window {{air conditioners}} are {{designed}} to dispose of condensate water by re-evaporating it into the exhaust air stream, which cancels out the air humidity decrease caused by the condensation of moisture on the <b>cooling</b> <b>coils.</b> To be effective as a dehumidifier, an air conditioner must be designed or modified so that {{most or all of}} the water that condenses is drained away in liquid form, rather than re-evaporated. Even if condensate is drained, a modified air conditioner is still less efficient than a single-purpose appliance with a design optimized for dehumidification.

50|$|In winter, when outdoor {{temperatures}} are low enough, {{the water is}} chilled solely by the Free <b>Cooling</b> <b>coil.</b> This allows the chillers’ compressors to stop operating, saving significant amounts of energy.

40|$|Abstract. A {{procedure}} for deriving a dynamic model {{of an air}} condition system was described in this paper. The system consisted of a zone, <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> and fan. Room thermal balance model and dynamic model of AC control system components including sensor, <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> and ducts, were established. This model accurately predicts the effect of inlet air temperature during closed loop control of output air temperature using chilled water flow rate as a control input. Fuzzy adaptive control (FAC) combined with proportional integral derivative (PID) control algorithms (FAC-PID) were used to control the chilled water flow rate. Computational simulations were carried out in toolbox Simulink of Matlab. The fuzzy parameters were carefully tuned to produce less oscillatory responses. The {{results show that the}} system based on FAC-PID control is capable of controlling the disturbance efficiently with less time lag and small error than PID control...|$|R
50|$|While single-zone {{constant}} {{air volume}} systems typically {{do not have}} these, multi-zone systems often have terminal units in the branch ducts. Usually there is one terminal unit per thermal zone. Some types of terminal units are VAV boxes (single or dual duct), fan-powered mixing boxes (in parallel or series arrangement), and induction terminal units. Terminal units may also include a heating or <b>cooling</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In some circumstances, an {{externally}} {{fired heater}} brings synthetic thermal fluid to temperatures of [...] to , and special pumps circulate it through heat exchangers inside the autoclave. This has both advantages - gas or oil {{can be used}} as a fuel without much concern for the space occupied inside the autoclave working volume - and disadvantages - the cost is very high, and it can be trickier to maintain properly. Additionally, it can serve to heat and cool the autoclave by routing the heat transfer fluid through either the heater or the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil,</b> as required by the process.|$|E
50|$|A final {{advantage}} is increased dehumidification. Because VAV air flow is reduced under part-load conditions, air {{is exposed to}} <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> for a longer time. More moisture condenses on the coils, dehumidifying the air. Thus, although a constant-volume and a single-zone VAV unit maintain the same room temperature, the VAV unit provides more passive dehumidification and more comfortable space conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} coolant was R-12 refrigerant. Liquid refrigerant {{is held in}} a low-pressure surge tank.

The compressed vapor is expanded into an intermediate, desuperheater tank. Liquid condensed in this expansion is drained back to the surge tank.

Any condensed liquid is returned to the intermediate tank, the surge tank, or the supply tank.

40|$|Situations exist {{around the}} Savannah River Site (SRS) and the Department of Energy (DOE) complex {{where it is}} {{advantageous}} to remotely navigate vertical pipe arrays. Specific examples are waste tanks in the SRS Tank Farms, which contain horizontal <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> at the tank bottom, vertical <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> throughout and {{a limited number of}} access points or ''risers''. These factors limit accessibility to many parts of these tanks by conventional means. Pipe Traveler technology has been developed to address these issues. The Pipe Traveler addresses these issues by using the vertical <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> as its medium of travel. The unit operates by grabbing a pipe using dual grippers located {{on either side of the}} equipment. Once securely attached to the pipe a drive wheel is extended to come in contact with the pipe. Rotation of the drive wheel causes the unit to rotate around the pipe. This action is continued until the second set of grippers is aligned with the next pipe. Extension pistons are actuated to extend the second set of grippers in contact with a second pipe. The second set of grippers is then actuated to grasp the pipe. The first set of grippers releases the original pipe and the process is repeated until the unit reaches its desired location. Once at the tool deployment location the desired tool may be used. The current design has proven the concept of pipe-to-pipe navigation. Testing of the Pipe Traveler has proven its ability to transfer itself from one pipe to another...|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{selected}} chilled water temperatures {{and the relative}} humidity of the space, {{it is likely that}} the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> will dehumidify the entering air stream, and as a by product of this process, it will at times produce a condensate which will need to be carried to drain. The fan coil unit will contain a purpose designed drip tray with drain connection for this purpose. The simplest means to drain the condensate from multiple fan coil units will be by a network of pipework laid to falls to a suitable point. Alternatively a condensate pump may be employed where space for such gravity pipework is limited.|$|E

50|$|Besides the {{advantages}} presented above, parallel radiant cooling panels offer other advantages as well, such as compact design, vertical shaft space area savings, and quick accommodation of dynamic controls. Energy savings in DOAS/radiant ceiling cooling panel system can by linked to: <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> load reduction, chiller energy reduction, pumping energy consumption and fan energy consumption reduction. In general, {{due to the}} total energy recovery and small supply air quantity of DOAS, the chiller energy consumption can be reduced significantly compared to the conventional VAV system. In a study of a pilot DOAS/radiant ceiling cooling panel system, hourly energy simulation predicts that the annual electrical energy consumption of the pilot DOAS/radiant panel cooling system is 42% {{less than that of}} the conventional VAV system with economizer control.|$|E

A further factor in minimising injury at the reimplantation operations may have been that the kidneys were kept at 7 °C within the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil,</b> which was within a degree of the temperature used during perfusion storage, so that the kidneys were not subjected to the greater changes in temperature that would have occurred if ice cooling had been used.|$|E
5000|$|By comparison, {{most modern}} [...] "warm air" [...] {{furnaces}} typically use a fan to circulate {{air to the}} rooms of house and pull cooler air back to the furnace for reheating; this is called forced-air heat. Because the fan easily overcomes {{the resistance of the}} ductwork, the arrangement of ducts can be far more flexible than the octopus of old. In American practice, separate ducts collect cool air to be returned to the furnace. At the furnace, cool air passes into the furnace, usually through an air filter, through the blower, then through the heat exchanger of the furnace, whence it is blown throughout the building. One major advantage of this type of system is that it also enables easy installation of central air conditioning, simply by adding a <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> at the outlet of the furnace.|$|E

As an alternative to the air dryer, the supply system can be equipped with an anti-freeze device and oil separator. The compressed air is then stored in a reservoir (also called a wet tank) from which it is then distributed via a four way protection valve into the front and rear brake circuit air reservoir, a parking brake reservoir and an auxiliary air supply distribution point. The system also includes various check, pressure limiting, drain and safety valves.|$|E

50|$|Many {{atmospheric}} water generators {{operate in a}} manner {{very similar to that}} of a dehumidifier: air is passed over a <b>cooled</b> <b>coil,</b> causing water to condense. The rate of water production depends on the ambient temperature, humidity, the volume of air passing over the coil, and the machine's capacity to <b>cool</b> the <b>coil.</b> These systems reduce air temperature, which in turn reduces the air's capacity to carry water vapor. This is the most common technology in use, but when powered by coal-based electricity it has one of the worst carbon footprints of any water source (exceeding reverse osmosis seawater desalination by three orders of magnitude) and it demands more than four times as much water up the supply chain as it delivers to the user.|$|R
