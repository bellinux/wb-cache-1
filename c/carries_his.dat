5|$|Burt was {{generous in}} life and honored after death.

5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration. They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that <b>carries</b> <b>his</b> name, {{there is evidence that}} he carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits which {{led to the development of}} a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence to suggest that this death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E
5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly.

5|$|In Week 3, Vick {{was brought}} into action against the St. Louis Rams when Ben Roethlisberger {{sustained}} a knee injury that sidelined him for 4–6 weeks. Vick played decently in that stretch, going 40–66 with 2 TDs and 1 INT, while also rushing for 104 yards on 15 <b>carries</b> (<b>his</b> other five carries were kneel downs). Vick suffered a hamstring injury in a win against the Arizona Cardinals, being replaced by Landry Jones, which led to him missing six games, and by then Roethlisberger was healthy enough to play. Despite continual injuries to Roethlisberger and the team not signing another quarterback throughout the season, Vick would be inactive {{the remainder of the}} season, leading some sports commentators to speculate that Vick's playing career may be over.|$|E

5|$|The husband, whose stained hands reveal he is a dyer by trade, looks harried as he <b>carries</b> <b>his</b> {{exhausted}} youngest daughter. In earlier impressions (and the painting), {{his hands}} are blue, to show his occupation, while his wife's face is coloured with red ink. The placement of the cow's horns behind his head represents him as a cuckold and suggests the children are not his. Behind the couple, their children replay the scene: the father's cane protrudes between the son's legs, doubling as a hobby horse, while the daughter is clearly in charge, demanding that he hand over his gingerbread. A limited number of proofs missing the girl and artist's signature were printed; Hogarth added the mocking girl to explain the boy's tears.|$|E

5|$|With {{the breed}} that <b>carries</b> <b>his</b> name, John Sebright {{intentionally}} {{set out to}} create a very small bantam chicken with laced plumage similar to the laced variety of Polish chickens. Although the exact makeup of the breed is uncertain, he {{is thought to have}} crossed British, Hamburgh, Nankin and Polish birds with a base of Rosecombs before achieving a laced chicken that would breed true. After the breed's establishment circa 1810, Sebright founded The Sebright Bantam Club, which was the very first individual breed association for chickens. The breed has appeared in the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection since the first edition in 1874. Today, the breed is one of the ten most popular bantam chickens, according to the American Bantam Association.|$|E
