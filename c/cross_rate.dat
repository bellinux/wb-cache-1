However, crossings may vary by species, culvert design, different environmental factors, and land-use and land-cover (LULC) at culvert sites. We monitored 265 culverts located throughout Maryland, USA, with motion-detecting game cameras to assess seasonal and regional effects on culvert <b>crossing</b> <b>rates</b> by wildlife and other animal species considered common to the areas. Northern raccoon (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) exhibited lower <b>crossing</b> <b>rates</b> in culverts during winter than at other times of the year. We did not detect any difference in seasonal crossings for other species, but several species exhibited similar patterns of lower crossings/culvert/day during winter. We detected more crossings/culvert/day in the Piedmont ecoregion of Maryland for several species associated with farmland and suburbia (e. g., raccoon and red fox [Vulpes vulpes]).

40|$|Chemical {{reactions}} that involve net hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) are ubiquitous in chemistry and biology, {{from the action}} of antioxidants to industrial and metalloenzyme catalysis. This report develops and validates a procedure to predict rate constants for HAT reactions of oxyl radicals (RO•) in various media. Our procedure uses the Marcus cross relation (CR) and includes adjustments for solvent hydrogen-bonding effects on both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reactions. Kinetic solvent effects (KSEs) are included by using Ingold’s model, and thermodynamic solvent effects are accounted for by using an empirical model developed by Abraham. These adjustments are shown to be {{critical to the success}} of our combined model, referred to as the CR/KSE model. As an initial test of the CR/KSE model we measured self-exchange and <b>cross</b> <b>rate</b> constants in different solvents for reactions of the 2, 4, 6 -tri-tert-butylphenoxyl radical and the hydroxylamine 2, 2 ′- 6, 6 ′-tetramethyl-piperidin- 1 -ol.

We then extend the model to over 30 known HAT reactions of oxyl radicals with OH or CH bonds, including biologically relevant reactions of ascorbate, peroxyl radicals, and α-tocopherol. The CR/KSE model shows remarkable predictive power, predicting rate constants to within a factor of 5 for almost all of the surveyed HAT reactions...|$|E

In this paper, we present an empirical microstructure model to characterize each channel’s price discovery speed. We identify the information sources of price adjustments to separate price discovery from the market responses to liquidity shocks. We assess market efficiency of price discovery visually, by the time paths of price convergence toward the new fundamental value, and numerically, by the magnitude of pricing errors during the price discovery process. We also use our price discovery model to illustrate the structural determinants of two often used price discovery measures: the information share and component share. We show that two measures are static and unable to reveal the underlying price discovery dynamics between markets.
