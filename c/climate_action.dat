5|$|In December 2009, {{participants}} from the Camp for <b>Climate</b> <b>Action</b> occupied the square {{for the two}} weeks during which the UN Conference on Climate Change took place in Copenhagen. It was billed as a UK base for direct action on climate change and saw various actions and protests stem from the occupation.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 2006, over 600 people {{attended}} {{a protest against}} the high carbon emissions. It was coordinated by the Camp for <b>Climate</b> <b>Action</b> group. At least 3,000 police officers from 12 forces {{were reported to have}} been drafted in {{for the duration of the}} protest, to safeguard electricity supplies and prevent the protesters from shutting the station down. Thirty-nine people were arrested after trying illegally to gain access to the plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus. In November 2007, Cal Poly became a signatory {{member of the}} American College & University Presidents Climate Commitment. Among other things, this committed the university to ensure that within one year, it would purchase or produce at least 15% of the institution's electric consumption from renewable sources.

40|$|This report {{provides}} the first progress assessment of <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> launched at the 2014 UN Climate Summit in New York. It considers {{the distribution and}} performance of <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> along multiple dimensions {{that are relevant to}} both mitigation and adaptation. While it is too early for a conclusive assessment of the effectiveness of <b>climate</b> <b>actions,</b> this study makes a first and indispensable step toward such an assessment. Initial findings are encouraging. One year after their launch, most <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> have performed well in terms of producing outputs, putting them on track to implementing their commitments in the coming years. The research for this project is underpinned by the Global Aggregator for <b>Climate</b> <b>Actions</b> (GAFCA), a database developed between January and September 2015 by a research team at the German Development Institute/Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) and the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). GAFCA includes data on organizational characteristics, geography of implementation and output performance of <b>climate</b> <b>actions.</b> It creates the foundation for a long-term systematic examination of <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> that can inform more effective efforts to strengthen such actions. Our analysis is focused on three broad questions: Have organizers of the 2014 UN Climate Summit engaged a wide range of non-state and sub-national actions that set targets relevant to both mitigation and adaptation? Do <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> align with the interests of both developing and developed countries, and do they achieve an appropriate balance in implementation in the global North and South? Have <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> started to deliver on their commitments one year since they were launched at the 2014 UN Climate Summit? (Output performance...|$|R

5|$|University of Colorado Denver | Anschutz Medical Campus {{offers more}} than 140 degree {{programs}} in 13 schools and colleges. The university offers degrees {{in a wide variety}} of academic fields such as engineering, business, culture, history, language, the natural sciences, the biomedical sciences and medicine. CU Denver hosts 8 schools and colleges: the College of Architecture and Planning, the College of Arts & Media, The Business School, the School of Education & Human Development, the College of Engineering and Applied Science, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the School of Public Affairs and its Presidential <b>Climate</b> <b>Action</b> Project, and the Graduate School. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is CU Denver's largest school on the Downtown Denver Campus, offering 23 baccalaureate degrees, 17 master's degrees, and 4 PhD programs. CU Denver sponsors the only college of architecture and planning in Colorado. The School of Architecture and Planning is located on 14th street, offering graduate degrees in architecture, urban design, and landscape architecture. In the engineering areas, the downtown campus has worked with Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. On the Anschutz Medical Campus, the university houses the School of Dental Medicine, the School of Medicine, the College of Nursing, the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Colorado School of Public Health, and the Graduate School.|$|E

40|$|Women in {{the rural}} regions of {{developing}} countries suffer most from climate change, due to its impacts on their routine activities such as fetching water and growing crops. Since women are most affected, women need to participate in all <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> and have access to resources and technologies designed to facilitate adaptation, otherwise gender inequality will worsen. Meanwhile, choices largely made by women in both rich and poor countries related to feeding their families and running their homes have a considerable impact on global greenhouse gas emissions.

40|$|As {{countries}} {{negotiate a}} new climate agreement for the United Nations climate conference in December 2015, a groundswell of <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> {{is emerging as}} cities, regions, businesses and civil society groups act on mitigation and adaptation, independently, {{with each other and}} with national governments and international organizations. The Paris conference provides a historic opportunity to establish a framework to catalyse, support, and steer these initiatives. Without such a framework, ‘bottom-up’ climate governance runs the risk of failing to deliver meaningful results.

40|$|At COP 21 in Paris, governments {{reiterated the}} {{importance}} of ‘non-Party’ contributions, placing big bets that the efforts of cities, regions, investors, companies, and other social groups will help keep average global warming limited to well under 2 °C. However, there is little systematic knowledge concerning the performance of non-state and subnational efforts. We established a database of 52 <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> launched at the 2014 UN Climate Summit in New York to assess output performance – that is, the production of relevant outputs – to understand whether {{they are likely to}} deliver social and environmental impacts. Moreover, we assess to which extent <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> are implemented across developed and developing countries. We find that <b>climate</b> <b>actions</b> are starting to deliver, and output performance after one year is higher than one might expect from previous experiences with similar actions. However, differences exist between action areas: resilience actions have yet to produce specific outputs, whereas energy and industry actions perform above average. Furthermore, imbalances between developing and developed countries persist. While many actions target low-income and lower-middle-income economies, the implementation gap in these countries remains greater. More efforts are necessary to mobilize and implement actions that benefit the world’s most vulnerable people...|$|R
