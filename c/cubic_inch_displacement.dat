500|$|Ford {{used its}} V8 {{flathead}} engine {{in most of}} its line up through {{the beginning of the}} decade, even as it introduced the Ford Y-block engine and the similar but larger Lincoln Y-block V8 engine in 1952 for its luxury car lines. [...] These were soon phased out with the Ford Windsor engine in 1962, which still forms the basis for the current engine line. [...] The Lincoln Y-block 317 cubic inch motor was rated at 160hp, only slightly higher than the 336 cubic inch [...] "Invincible 8" [...] flathead design that it replaced. [...] The Lincoln also came in 341 and 368 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> <b>displacement</b> (CID) versions. [...] Like the GM motor, it used an overhead-valve design rather than the inblock-valve design shared by all flathead engines.|$|E
2500|$|The Corvette Grand Sports were raced {{with several}} {{different}} engines, {{but the most}} serious factory engine actually used was a 377 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> <b>displacement,</b> all-aluminum, small block with four Weber side-draft carburetors and a cross-ram intake, rated [...] at 6400rpm. Body panels were made of thinner fiberglass to reduce weight and the inner body structure 'birdcage' was aluminum rather than steel. The ladder-type frame utilized large seamless steel tubular side members connected front and rear with crossmembers of about the same diameter tubes. Another crossmember was just aft of the transmission and a fourth one at the rear kick-up anchored the integral roll cage. The frame was slightly stiffer than the 1963 Corvette production frame and was 94 pounds lighter. A number of other lightweight components were utilized to reduce overall weight to about 800 pounds less than the production coupe. Initially the Grand Sport project was known simply as [...] "The Lightweight".|$|E
2500|$|Bel Air {{interiors}} had {{an optional}} massive expanse of chrome across {{the lower part}} of the dashboard (most were painted), along with a deluxe Bel Air steering wheel with full chrome horn ring. Carpeting and full wheel covers rounded out Bel Air standard equipment. For 1954, the Bel Air stayed essentially the same, except for a revised grille and taillights, and a revised engine that had insert bearings and higher oil pressure, needed for the full-flow oil filtration system that was not available prior to 1954. [...] Prior to 1954, the 235 and 216 cubic inch six cylinder engines had babbit bearings and scoops to create oil pressure at the bottom of each rod and the oil pressure was standard at 15-30 PSI. During these years, there were three engine choices, depending on the transmission ordered. Both 235 cubic inch engines were [...] "Blue Flame" [...] inline six cylinder OHV engines, featuring hydraulic valve lifters (in 1953 with automatic transmissions) and aluminum pistons. The [...] 235 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> <b>displacement</b> engine was standard on stickshift models, with solid lifters and splash plus pressure lubrication including babbit bearings. Powerglide cars got a [...] version which had hydraulic lifters and full pressure lubrication.|$|E

2500|$|The 1968 Caprice {{received}} a minor facelift {{that included a}} new grille with taillights set into the bumper and optional hidden headlamps. Caprice coupes now came standard with the new Astro Ventilation system, which included extra vents in the dash, {{and the removal of}} vent (wing) windows. Side marker lamps became standard on all U.S. cars and the Caprice carried over the optional white corner marker lamps at the forward edge of the fenders in addition to the amber parking lights which were illuminated with the headlights. All 1968 Chevrolets got front side marker lights on the fender; cars with an optional engine were identified with its <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> <b>displacement</b> listed on half the bezel; the light itself occupied the other half. The fiber optics monitoring system was offered again as an option. Chevrolet made the Caprice Coupe's formal roofline available in the Impala series. The Impala Custom Coupe became the best-selling model in the line. The L72 [...] Turbo-Jet V8 returned to the option list after a one-year hiatus. A new [...] Turbo Fire V8 rated at [...] replaced the [...] small block as the standard engine. Inside, the instrument panel was revised with a return to the horizontal sweep speedometer and a revised three-spoke steering wheel. An optional instrument cluster had a narrow speedometer within its opening and flanking it with engine-turned instruments in the place of warning lights. The fuel gauge, placed next to the speedometer within its own pod in the base models, was moved to its new place next to the speedometer. A tachometer took the place of the fuel gauge in the large opening left by the fuel gauge.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the V-71 series in 1957 effectively doomed the 6-110, as both the 8-71 (568 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> <b>displacement)</b> and 12-71 (852 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> <b>displacement)</b> offered higher horsepower in a more compact form factor. However the high torque and great reliability of the 6-110 was still valued for heavy-duty applications.|$|E
50|$|The MP15 used a 12-cylinder {{version of}} the 645E series engine {{developing}} 1500 hp at 900 r.p.m. Introduced in the SW1500, this was a 2-stroke, 45-degree V type, with a 9-inch bore by 10-inch stroke, giving 645 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches</b> <b>displacement</b> per cylinder. The 645 series, introduced in 1966, was EMD’s standard engine through the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The Rolls-Royce Eagle was a British 24-cylinder, sleeve valve, H-block {{aero engine}} of 46 litre (2,807 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches)</b> <b>displacement.</b> It was {{designed}} and built in the early-1940s by Rolls-Royce Limited and first ran in 1944.

50|$|The first Sabre engines {{were ready}} for testing in January 1938, {{although}} they were limited to 1,350 hp (1,000 kW). By March, they were passing tests at 2,050 hp (1,500 kW), and by June 1940, when the Sabre passed the Air Ministry's 100-hour test, the first production versions were delivering 2,200 hp (1,640 kW) from their 2,238 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> (37 litre) <b>displacements.</b> By {{the end of the}} year, they were producing 2,400 hp (1,800 kW).
