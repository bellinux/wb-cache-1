5|$|In July, three {{associates}} of Berkman—Charles Berg, Arthur Caron, and Carl Hanson—began collecting dynamite and storing {{it at the}} apartment of another <b>conspirator,</b> Louise Berger. Some sources, including Charles Plunkett, one of the surviving conspirators, say that Berkman was the chief <b>conspirator,</b> {{the oldest and most}} experienced member of the group.

Byers hopes that he will meet her at the convention.|$|E
25|$|The {{third and}} final stage of armed {{resistance}} began with the Beipu uprising in 1907 in which Saisiyat Aboriginals and Hakka people revolted against the Japanese. Between this and the 1915 Tapani Incident thirteen smaller armed uprisings took place. In many cases, <b>conspirators</b> were discovered and arrested before planned uprisings could even occur. Of the thirteen uprisings, eleven occurred after the 1911 Revolution in China, to which four were directly linked. <b>Conspirators</b> {{in four of the}} uprisings demanded reunification with China, <b>conspirators</b> in six planned to install themselves as independent rulers of Taiwan, and <b>conspirators</b> in one could not decide which goal to pursue. The objectives of the <b>conspirators</b> in the other two cases remain unclear.|$|R
5000|$|The {{plot was}} {{discovered}} and the Delgado brothers {{and the other}} <b>conspirators</b> were thrown in jail under threat of execution. Somoza later released the <b>conspirators,</b> but {{from that moment on}} all the <b>conspirators</b> became permanent enemies of the regime and were under constant surveillance. Many of them went into exile to avoid the threats and harassment from the Somoza regime.|$|R

Tintin evades this, and escapes as a fellow-passenger of the opera singer Bianca Castafiore. Leaving the car to evade Castafiore's singing, Tintin is arrested again and survives another assassination attempt before arrival in Klow on foot. There, he meets the King's aide-de-camp, Colonel Boris; but Boris is also a <b>conspirator</b> and organises a further unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Tintin.|$|E
5|$|In early 1257, Aybak {{was killed}} in a conspiracy, and was succeeded by his 15-year-old son, al-Mansur Ali, while Saif ad-Din Qutuz held an {{influential}} position. Soon after al-Mansur Ali's ascendancy rumors of another conspiracy to which an-Nasir Yusuf had an alleged connection emerged. The accused <b>conspirator,</b> al-Mansur Ali's vizier, Sharaf ad-Din al-Fa'izi, was strangled by Egyptian authorities. The Bahri Mamluks in Syria led by Baibars pressured an-Nasir Yusuf to intervene by invading Egypt, but he would not act, fearing the Bahri dynasty would usurp his throne if they gained Egypt.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, 1972, United Airlines Flight 553, a Boeing 737-200, {{crashed into}} a {{residential}} area outside Midway during landing. The crash of the 737-200 killed 43 of the 61 on board, and two on the ground. One of the victims on the plane was Dorothy Hunt, the wife of Watergate <b>conspirator</b> E. Howard Hunt. She was carrying $10,000 in cash. James McCord alleged that she supplied the Watergate defendants with money for legal expenses.|$|E
50|$|On May 21, 1801, an {{informer}} {{told the}} authorities about the {{plans of the}} <b>conspirators,</b> {{which led to the}} arrest of several involved. Although an inquiry was initiated, the <b>conspirators</b> were acquitted for lack of evidence. The Areopagus Lodge was closed in 1802, and somewhat later reopened under the name of Suaçunas Academy, established in the same mill, the scene of meetings of former <b>conspirators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Conspirators</b> seeking {{independence}} from Portugal planned {{to rise up}} in rebellion {{on the day that}} the derrama was instituted. [...] However, the <b>conspirators</b> lacked both well-formed plans and an overall leader. Some of the <b>conspirators</b> were republicans, others were monarchists. Some favored the abolition of slavery, while others judged abolition as impractical at that time. The <b>conspirators</b> did put forth a few economic and social ideas: the promotion of cotton production, the exploitation of iron and saltpeter reserves, a proposal to give incentives to mothers to have many children, {{and the creation of a}} citizens' militia.|$|R
5000|$|During the American Revolutionary War, Peter Sueman, {{a farmer}} from Broad Run, {{was one of}} seven {{residents}} of Frederick County who were discovered as <b>conspirators</b> with Great Britain.

The men were sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered in Frederick. On August 17, 1781, Sueman and two other <b>conspirators,</b> Casper Fritchie and Yost Peckler, were executed in Frederick. The other four <b>conspirators</b> were pardoned by Governor Thomas Sim Lee.|$|R
5|$|The Carpet from Bagdad is a 1915 American silent {{adventure}} film {{directed by}} Colin Campbell {{and based on}} Harold MacGrath's 1911 eponymous novel. In the story, Horace Wadsworth (played by Guy Oliver), one of a gang of criminals also planning a bank robbery in New York, steals the titular prayer rug from its Baghdad mosque. He sells the carpet to antique dealer George Jones (Wheeler Oakman) to fund the robbery scheme. But the theft places both men and Fortune Chedsoye (Kathlyn Williams), the innocent daughter of another <b>conspirator,</b> in danger from the carpet's guardian.|$|E
5|$|The main {{threat to}} Harald Maddadsson and Rognvald Kali came from Erlend Haraldsson, {{especially}} from Erlend's supporter Frakkok. The old <b>conspirator,</b> however, was soon disposed of, {{burned to death}} in her hall near Helmsdale. The Orkneyinga Saga names Svein Asleifsson as the killer, and says that he came to Caithness from the south, from Atholl, with Rognvald's blessing and Matad's help. This Svein Asleifsson had also been the man in whose custody Earl Paul had disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he {{took control of the}} country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking <b>conspirator</b> was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E
50|$|Around 300 other <b>conspirators</b> were impaled alive, {{and another}} report states that in {{addition}} to these, some other 20 chief <b>conspirators</b> had their arms and legs sawed off, and left to expire in the marketplace.|$|R

50|$|The <b>conspirators</b> {{made two}} major errors: {{they got their}} {{gunpowder}} wet {{and then tried to}} dry {{it in front of the}} fire, causing it to blow up. Walsh invited the <b>conspirators</b> to surrender, and upon their refusal ordered an assault of the building. All of the <b>conspirators</b> were either captured or killed. Catesby was killed, as were the John and Christopher Wright and Thomas Percy, but Ambrose Rookwood was captured alive and later held in Worcester gaol.|$|R
5|$|Halotus is {{primarily}} remembered for his suspected {{involvement in the}} conspiracy and poisoning of Emperor Claudius on 13 October (times of death are in dispute; see below) 54 AD. It is possible that Claudius died of natural causes, and the actual manner of the poisoning, in regards to which poison may have been used, in which food {{it could have been}} hidden, etc., remains unclear. It is considered most likely, considering the writings of various ancient historians, that the poison was concealed in mushrooms (as Claudius was known to have been particularly fond of them), and Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' wife, is thought to have been the most likely to have instigated the murder or to have been the lead <b>conspirator</b> in the plot to overthrow Claudius.|$|E
5|$|The Pasha's Daughter is a 1911 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on an American named Jack who is traveling in Turkey.

5|$|The {{intersection}} of 7th Street NW and H Street NW {{is the heart}} of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood today, but prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants. Before the American Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above. Lincoln <b>conspirator</b> Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses a Chinese restaurant), but it may also house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, occupants of the building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling and whispers, footsteps, muffled sobs, and creaking floorboards which have unnerved them.|$|E

5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. The Dispatch published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of the Dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a <b>conspirator</b> behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the credibility of the Dispatch and harmed Riley's reputation.|$|E
5|$|The assassins, the {{key members}} of the clandestine network, and the key Serbian {{military}} <b>conspirators</b> who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other <b>conspirators</b> were arrested and tried before a Serbian court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military <b>conspirators.</b> Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.|$|R

5|$|As {{they reach}} the lobby, Denham and Shaw return, {{revealing}} the Thanksgiving court date as a ruse. Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's safe and, for violating his bail by not declaring the latter, has him remanded back into federal custody until his real court date. Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they walk outside the Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and is acting as Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts {{on the condition that}} Josh, being the primary <b>conspirator,</b> must serve a minimal two-year sentence, but Denham lowers it to 16 months to make sure Josh gets out for good behavior. Shaw is convicted and sentenced to prison {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} that Benchley was filming various short films, he also began working at The New Yorker, which had started in February 1925 {{under the control of}} Benchley's friend Harold Ross. While Benchley, along with many of his Algonquin acquaintances, was wary of getting {{involved}} with another publication for various reasons, he completed some freelance work for The New Yorker over the first few years, and was later invited to be newspaper critic. Benchley initially wrote the column under the pseudonym Guy Fawkes (the lead <b>conspirator</b> in the English Gunpowder Plot), and the column was well received. Benchley tackled issues ranging from careless reporting to European fascism, and the publication flourished. He was invited to be theatre critic for The New Yorker in 1929, leaving Life, and contributions from Woollcott and Parker became regular features in the magazine. The New Yorker published an average of forty-eight Benchley columns per year during the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|One of Mary's first {{actions as}} queen was {{to order the}} release of the Roman Catholic Duke of Norfolk and Stephen Gardiner from {{imprisonment}} in the Tower of London, as well as her kinsman Edward Courtenay. Mary understood that the young Lady Jane was essentially a pawn in Dudley's scheme, and Dudley was the only <b>conspirator</b> of rank executed for high treason {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the coup. Lady Jane and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, though found guilty, were kept under guard in the Tower rather than immediately executed, while Lady Jane's father, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, was released. Mary was left in a difficult position, as almost all the Privy Counsellors had been implicated in the plot to put Lady Jane on the throne. She appointed Gardiner to the council and made him both Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor, offices he held until his death in November 1555. Susan Clarencieux became Mistress of the Robes. On 1 October 1553, Gardiner crowned Mary at Westminster Abbey.|$|E
