40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} the structure, function and metabolism of fatty acids and lipids that are of particular importance in the context of parenteral nutrition. Lipids are a heterogeneous group of molecules that share the common property of hydrophobicity. Lipids range in structure from simple short hydrocarbon chains to more complex molecules, including triacylglycerols, phospholipids and sterols and their esters. Lipids within each class may differ structurally. Fatty acids are common components of <b>complex</b> <b>lipids,</b> and these differ according to chain length and the presence, number and position of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. Structural variation among <b>complex</b> <b>lipids</b> and among fatty acids gives rise to functional differences that result in different impacts upon metabolism and upon cell and tissue responses. Fatty acids and <b>complex</b> <b>lipids</b> exhibit a variety of structural variations that influence their metabolism and their functional effects...|$|R
40|$|Thrombin and poly-l-lysine {{alter the}} {{incorporation}} of acetate, glycerol, and fatty acids into the lipids of washed human platelets. Both aggregating agents decrease {{the incorporation of}} acetate into all lipid classes other than free fatty acids. Similarly, glycerol incorporation into <b>complex</b> <b>lipids</b> is impaired by both thrombin and polylysine. Thrombin caused marked depression of the incorporation of palmitic acid into both lecithin and triglycerides. By contrast it enhanced the incorporation of oleic acid into lecithin, but not into triglycerides.

50|$|Galactocerebrosides are {{abundant}} sphingolipids of the myelin membrane {{of the central}} nervous system and peripheral nervous system and are also present in small amounts in kidney. The key enzymatic step in the biosynthesis of galactocerebrosides consists of the transfer of galactose to ceramide catalyzed by UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT, EC 2.4.1.45). The enzyme encoded by the CGT gene is the first involved in <b>complex</b> <b>lipid</b> biosynthesis in the myelinating oligodendrocyte.|$|E
50|$|In {{a broader}} sense, a Transfersome {{is a highly}} adaptable, stress-responsive complex aggregate. The form {{preferred}} by researchers and pharmacologists is an ultradeformable vesicle possessing an aqueous core surrounded by the <b>complex</b> <b>lipid</b> bilayer. Interdependencies inherent in the local composition {{and shape of the}} bilayer makes the vesicle both self-regulating and self-optimizing. This enables the Transfersome to cross various transport barriers efficiently, and then act as a Drug carrier for non-invasive targeted drug delivery and sustained release of therapeutic agents.|$|E

The interaction of these peptides and the intact basic protein with <b>complex</b> <b>lipids</b> was investigated by following the solubilization of lipid-protein complexes into chloroform in a biphasic solvent system. The C-terminal peptide fragment (residues 117 - 170) and the intact basic protein both formed chloroform-soluble <b>complexes</b> with acidic <b>lipids,</b> but not with neutral <b>complex</b> <b>lipids.</b> The N-terminal fragment (residues 1 - 115) did not form chloroform-soluble complexes with either acidic or neutral <b>complex</b> <b>lipids.</b> The molar ratio of lipid to protein that caused a 50 % loss of protein from the upper phase to the lower chloroform phase was {{the same for the}} intact basic protein as for the smaller C-terminal peptide fragment. Phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol were approximately twice as efficient as sulphatide at causing protein redistribution to the chloroform phase. The results are interpreted as indicating that the sites for ionic interactions between lipid and charged groups on the basic protein of myelin are located in the C-terminal region of the protein molecule...|$|R

50|$|In the X-linked {{adrenoleukodystrophy}} (X-ALD), a mutation {{occurs in}} the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC transporter). This leads to cerebral inflammatory demyelination caused by the myelin destabilization that {{occurs in the}}se patients. The inflammatory demyelination begins in the corpus callosum and it slowly progresses outwards towards both hemispheres. In X-ALD patients, abnormally high levels of very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) accumulate in various body tissues and fluids. This increased concentration then incorporates into various <b>complex</b> <b>lipids</b> where they are not normally found. This {{has been found to}} be directly involved in the cerebral inflammation.

50|$|Most {{methods of}} lipid {{extraction}} and isolation from biological samples exploit the high solubility of hydrocarbon chains in organic solvents. Given the diversity in lipid classes, {{it is not}} possible to accommodate all classes with a common extraction method. The traditional Bligh/Dyer procedure uses chloroform/methanol-based protocols that include phase partitioning into the organic layer. These protocols work relatively well for a wide variety of physiologically relevant lipids but they have to be adapted for <b>complex</b> <b>lipid</b> chemistries and low-abundance and labile lipid metabolites.When organic soil was used, citrate buffer in the extraction mixture gave higher amounts of lipid phosphate than acetate buffer, Tris, H2O or phosphate buffer.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the tafazzin gene (TAZ, {{also called}} G4.5) are closely {{associated}} with Barth syndrome. The tafazzin gene product functions as an acyltransferase in <b>complex</b> <b>lipid</b> metabolism. In 2008, Dr. Kulik found that all the BTHS individuals that he tested had abnormalities in their cardiolipin molecules, a lipid found inside the mitochondria of cells. Cardiolipin is intimately connected with the electron transport chain proteins and the membrane structure of the mitochondria which is the energy producing organelle of the cell. The human tafazzin gene, NG_009634, is listed as over 10,000 base pairs in length and the full-length mRNA, NM_000116, is 1919 nucleotides long encoding 11 exons with a predicted protein length of 292 amino acids and a molecular weight of 33.5 kDa. The tafazzin gene is located at Xq28; the long arm of the X chromosome. Mutations in tafazzin that cause Barth syndrome span many different categories: missense, nonsense, deletion, frameshift, splicing (see Human Tafazzin (TAZ) Gene Mutation & Variation Database).|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, we used cholestatrienol (CTL) as a {{fluorescent}} reporter molecule to study sterol-rich Lo domains in <b>complex</b> <b>lipid</b> bilayers. CTL is {{a fluorescent}} cholesterol analog that mimics {{the behavior of}} cholesterol well. The ability of 12 SLPC to quench the fluorescence of cholestatrienol gives {{a measure of the}} amount of sterol included in Lo domains in mixed lipid membranes. The stability of sterol-rich domains formed in <b>complex</b> <b>lipid</b> mixtures containing saturated sphingomyelins, phosphatidylcholines, or galactosylceramide as potential domain-forming lipids were studied. The amount of sterol associated with sterol-rich domains seemed to always increase with increasing temperature. The quenching efficiency was highly dependent on the domain-forming lipid present in <b>complex</b> <b>lipid</b> mixtures. Sphingomyelins formed stable sterol-enriched domains and were able to shield CTL from quenching better than the other lipids included in this study. The saturated phosphatidylcholines also formed sterol-rich domains, but the quenching efficiency in membranes with these was higher than with sphingomyelins and the domains melted at lower temperatures. PGalCer was not able to form sterol-enriched domains. However, we found that PGalCer stabilized sterol-rich domains formed in PSM-containing bilayers. Using a fluorescent ceramide analog, we also demonstrated that N-palmitoyl-ceramide displaced the sterol from sphingolipid-rich domains in mixed bilayer membranes...|$|E

High-temperature gas chromatography coupled with electron impact or chemical ionization mass spectrometry was used to achieve a simple analytical protocol, without prior separation in classes and without prior cleavage of lipid molecules, {{in order to obtain}} simultaneously i) a qualitative characterization of the individual SSLs and ii) a quantitative evaluation of lipid classes. The method was first optimized with SSLs collected from the forehead of a volunteer. More than 200 compounds were identified in the same run. These compounds have been classified in five lipid classes: free fatty acids, hydrocarbons, waxes, sterols, and glycerides. The advantage to this method was it provided structural information on intact compounds, which is new for cholesteryl esters and glycerides, and to obtain detailed fingerprints of the major SSLs. These fingerprints were used to compare the SSL compositions from different body areas. The squalene/cholesterol ratio was used to determine the balance between sebaceous secretion and skin removal.

40|$|Progress {{with respect}} to {{enrichment}} and separation of native membrane components in <b>complex</b> <b>lipid</b> environments, such as native cell membranes, {{has so far been}} very limited. The reason for the slow progress can be related to the lack of efficient means to generate continuous and laterally fluid supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) made from real cell membranes. We show in this work how the edge of a hydrodynamically driven SLB can be used to induce rupture of adsorbed lipid vesicles of compositions that typically prevent spontaneous SLB formation, such as vesicles made of <b>complex</b> <b>lipid</b> compositions, containing high cholesterol content or being derived from real cell membranes. In particular, upon fusion between the moving edge of a preformed SLB and adsorbed vesicles made directly from 3 T 3 fibroblast cell membranes, the membrane content of the vesicles was shown to be efficiently transferred to the SLB. The molecular transfer was verified using cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) binding to monosialoganglioside receptors (G(M 1) and G(M 3)), and the preserved lateral mobility was confirmed by spatial manipulation of the G(M 1 /M 3) -CTB complex using a hydrodynamic flow. Two populations of CTB with markedly different drift velocity could be identified, which from dissociation kinetics data were attributed to CTB bound with different numbers of ganglioside anchors...|$|E
