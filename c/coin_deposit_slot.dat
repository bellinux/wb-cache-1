40|$|This is the Accepted Manuscript of the {{following}} article: Ceri Houlbrook, ???The penny???s dropped: Renegotiating the contemporary <b>coin</b> <b>deposit???,</b> Journal of Material Culture, Vol. 20 (2) : 173 - 189, March 2015. The final published version is available at: [URL] ?? 2015, ?? SAGE Publications. This article examines the status of <b>coins</b> as contemporary <b>deposits</b> in the British Isles. With a focus on both historical and contemporary sites, from the Neolithic long barrow of Wayland???s Smithy, Oxfordshire, to the plethora of wishing-wells and coin-trees distributed across the British Isles, it demonstrates the popularity of <b>coins</b> as ritual <b>deposits.</b> The author considers how they are perceived and treated by site custodians, and concludes with {{a case study of}} an archaeological excavation, the 2013 Ardmaddy Wishing-Tree Project, which recovered a large amount of contemporary <b>coin</b> <b>deposits.</b> This article does not aim to locate itself within the debates of site custodianship and accessibility, nor does it propose to address the broader dilemmas of a site???s ritual continuity or resurgence. Instead, its aim is to encourage archaeologists to consider the contemporary deposit {{as an integral part of}} the ritual narrative of a site, rather than as disposable ???ritual litter???...|$|R
50|$|In 1879, the Department of Finance issued Hawai`i's first paper money, silver <b>coin</b> <b>deposit</b> {{certificates}} for $10, $20, $50 and $100. However, {{these notes}} were only issued in small numbers and US notes {{made up the}} bulk of circulating paper money. From 1884, only US gold coins were legal tender for amounts over $10.|$|R
50|$|Although almost {{ubiquitous}} in continental Europe, the deposit system is less {{common in the}} United Kingdom and Canada {{and has not been}} widely adopted in the United States, with the exception of some chains like Aldi, which require a $0.25 deposit. Other stores such as Costco and ShopRite also use the <b>coin</b> <b>deposit</b> system, but it is not used at all of their locations.|$|R
5000|$|Mir Zakah [...] is {{a village}} in Northern Afghanistan , where [...] "one of the largest ancient <b>coin</b> <b>deposits</b> ever attested {{in the history of}} mankind" [...] was {{discovered}} in 1947 {{at the bottom of a}} well and extensively plundered in later years. The village lies on the old caravan route from Ghazni to Gandhara. The controversial Alexander Medaillon is said to have come from the treasure.|$|R
50|$|Luke is the {{reserved}} yet tough {{leader of the}} Warriors. He is rich, tall and handsome and holds {{the keys to the}} group's sweet purple convertible and their headquarters at his home. He is Tabby's love interest. Although he acts tough most of the times, he still has certain fears, particularly of forests. His family fortune comes from his environmental activist parents' invention of <b>coin</b> <b>deposit</b> locks on shopping carts.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2007 {{the bank}} {{launched}} a new banking service named [...] "Gold <b>Coins</b> <b>Deposit</b> Account". Through this new service, Bank Refah's customers can <b>deposit</b> their gold <b>coins</b> into a special deposit account and in return receive points, which they can then redeem against future loans and credits. The launch of this unique deposit account, which received high publicity in the Iranian media, was marked by a presidential speech by the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.|$|R
5000|$|Debuted in Phoenix, Arizona in 1977 the Automated Coin Toll System (ACTS) was an {{addition}} to TSPS which provided an automated way to perform charge advisory and toll collection of coin paid calls, reducing the need for operator involvement. The ACTS sub-system handled the automated voice announcements, e.g. [...] "Please deposit five cents {{for the next three}} minutes" [...] (initially voiced by Jane Barbe , and later Pat Fleet), and worked with TSPS for <b>coin</b> <b>deposit</b> (start of call) coin collection/coin return (at end of call).|$|R
5|$|Æthelwulf's first Rochester coinage {{may have}} begun {{when he was still}} sub-king of Kent, under Egbert. A hoard of <b>coins</b> <b>deposited</b> at the {{beginning}} of Æthelwulf's reign in about 840, found in the Middle Temple in London, contained 22 coins from Rochester and two from Canterbury of the first issue of each mint. Some numismatists argue that the high proportion of Rochester coins means that the issue must have commenced before Egbert's death, but an alternative explanation is that whoever hoarded the coins simply happened to have access to more Rochester coins. No coins were issued by Æthelwulf's sons during his reign.|$|R
2500|$|A {{payphone}} or {{pay phone}} {{is a public}} telephone, usually located in a stand-alone upright container such as a phone booth, with payment done by inserting money (usually coins), a credit or debit card, or a telephone card before the call is made. Pay telephone stations preceded {{the invention of the}} pay phone and existed as early as 1878. These stations were supervised by telephone company attendants or agents who collected the money due after people made their calls. In 1889, the first coin-operated telephone was installed by inventor William Gray at a bank in Hartford, Connecticut. However, it was a [...] "postpay" [...] machine that only accepted <b>coins</b> <b>deposited</b> after the call was placed.|$|R
50|$|The first silver dollars {{were struck}} on October 15, 1794. The silver {{used for the}} 1794 dollar coins came from {{part of a large}} {{quantity}} of French billon <b>coins</b> <b>deposited</b> by the Bank of Maryland; as they were of a lower fineness than required, refining was necessary. In total, 1,758 acceptable silver dollars were produced in 1794. Those which were deemed unsuitable for circulation were either melted or restruck in 1795. The 1,758 coins that were officially delivered by Chief Coiner Henry Voight, though acceptable, struck poorly due to the press that was used during early production at the Mint, which was a man-powered screw press intended for use on coins no larger than a half dollar.|$|R
50|$|A rare find in Mir Zakah, {{located in}} Pakhtia {{province}} on the Pakistan border is loosely {{related to the}} numismatic knowledge of the Greco-Bactrian era, for which Ai Khanoum provided significant insight. Between 1992 and 1995 {{one of the largest}} <b>deposit</b> of <b>coins</b> known in the history of currencies was discovered {{at the bottom of a}} well. The circumstances surrounding the treasure's discovery remain unknown to this day. The <b>coin</b> <b>deposit</b> is calculated to contain more than four tons of minted metal, near 550,000 coins of mostly silver and bronze and 350 kilograms of gold. The numismatic travesty of this profound discovery is, according to reliable sources, two and a half tons of the coins had been taken to Switzerland for sale.|$|R
5000|$|A clear box is an {{amplifier}} used by phreaks to use post-pay {{pay phones}} without paying. In some locations, especially rural {{areas in the}} United States and Canada, pay phones were configured for [...] "post-pay" [...] operation. In this mode, the handset microphone is muted until payment is made. The user of a post-pay pay phone would dial first, wait until the called party answered, {{and at that point}} the user would be prompted to insert the coins. Upon receiving the correct payment for the call, the pay phone would then connect the microphone and allow the caller to speak. An artifact of this scheme was that the called party usually heard the ACTS tones produced by the pay phone upon <b>coin</b> <b>deposit.</b>|$|R
50|$|Copenhagen City Bikes or Bycykler København was {{the bicycle}} sharing system of Copenhagen, Denmark. Launched in 1995 with 1,000 cycles, {{the project was}} the world's first {{organized}} large-scale urban bike-sharing scheme, which, unlike its Dutch predecessor, featured what are now considered basic elements such as <b>coin</b> <b>deposit,</b> fixed stands and specially designed bikes with parts that cannot be used on other bikes. Riders paid a refundable deposit at one of 110 special bike stands and had unlimited use of a bike within the specified downtown area. The scheme was funded by commercial sponsors. In return, the bikes carried advertisements, which appeared on the bike frame and the solid-disk type wheels. When the programme was abolished in October 2012, some 1,500-1,700 bikes were still in service, {{out of a total}} of 2,500 put onto the streets.|$|R
40|$|In {{the records}} of Wągrowiec, the town in Wielkopolska, kept in the National Archive in Poznań, {{there are a number}} of seventeenth and eighteenth – century notes, {{concerning}} hiding, withdrawing and searching for <b>coin</b> <b>deposits.</b> These mentions, most often included in testaments and lawsuit acts, were usually related to the times of political disturbances (Swedish Deluge, Great Northern War). The lawsuit under consideration dates back to 1764 and regards the discovery of a treasure in the village of Rakowo, providing an interesting example of the redeposition and change of the owner of hidden possession – issues that are usually difficult to notice in the analyses of hoards. The examples demonstrate the significance of hitherto underestimated municipal documents for the studies on the circulation and hoarding of money in the modern times...|$|R
50|$|The user of {{the booth}} pays for the call by <b>depositing</b> <b>coins</b> into a <b>slot</b> on the telephone. With some {{telephones}} the deposit is made before making the call, and the coins are returned if the call attempt is unsuccessful (busy, no answer, etc.). With other types of telephone <b>coins</b> are not <b>deposited</b> until the call has been made and the caller hears their party answer. The <b>deposit</b> of <b>coins</b> then permits two-way conversation to proceed.|$|R
5000|$|The giro {{function}} had {{the additional}} advantage (beside the obvious convenience) {{that the value}} of the underlying deposit was guaranteed. This was important in an era in which Metallism still reigned supreme. As a matter of fact, depositors were prepared to pay a small [...] "fee" [...] {{in the form of an}} agio for this [...] "bank money" [...] or bankgeld (which was an early example of fiat money) over normal circulating coin, called courantgeld. Though the wisselbank was not a mint, it provided <b>coins</b> <b>deposited</b> with it for melting and recoining at Dutch mints in the form of a high-quality currency, called [...] "trade money" [...] (or negotiepenningen in Dutch). These coins were used in trade with areas where the Dutch and other West Europeans had a structural trade deficit, like the Far East, Russia and the Levant, because they were highly valued there for their quality as commodity money.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{virtually}} no evidence for the continuance of the cult of Mithras into the 5th century. In particular large numbers of votive <b>coins</b> <b>deposited</b> by worshippers have been recovered at the Mithraeum at Pons Sarravi (Sarrebourg) in Gallia Belgica, in a series that runs from Gallienus (253 - 268) to Theodosius I (379 - 395). These were scattered over the floor when the Mithraeum was destroyed, as Christians apparently regarded the coins as polluted; and they therefore provide reliable dates for {{the functioning of the}} Mithraeum. [...] It cannot be shown that any Mithraeum continued in use in the 5th century. The coin series in all Mithraea end {{at the end of the}} 4th century at the latest. The cult disappeared earlier than that of Isis. Isis was still remembered in the middle ages as a pagan deity, but Mithras was already forgotten in late antiquity.|$|R
40|$|Voltammetry of microparticles (VMP) and {{electrochemical}} impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques, {{complemented by}} SEM-EDX and Raman spectroscopy, {{were applied to}} a set of 15 Roman bronze coins and one Tessera from the temple of Magna Mater (Rome, Italy). The archaeological site, dated back be- tween the second half {{and the end of the}} 4 th century A. D., presented a complicated stratigraphic context. Characteristic voltammetric patterns for cuprite and tenorite for sub-microsamples of the corrosion layers of the <b>coins</b> <b>deposited</b> onto graphite electrodes in contact with 0. 10 M HClO 4 aqueous solution yielded a grouping of the coins into three main groups. This grouping was confirmed and refined using EIS experiments of the coins immersed in air-saturated mineral water using the reduction of dissolved oxygen as a redox probe. The electrochemical grouping of coins corroborated the complex stratigraphy of the archaeological site and, above all, the reuse of the coins during the later periods due to the economic issues related to the fall of the Roman Empire...|$|R
40|$|Shopping carts may be {{associated}} with a variety of injuries, particularly in toddlers and young children. These usually relate to falls from carts or to tip-overs. Injuries that are sustained include hematomas/contusions, abrasions, lacerations, fractures, and fingertip amputations. Fatal episodes are uncommon and are usually due to blunt craniocerebral trauma from falls. A case involving a 19 -month-old girl is reported who became entrapped when she inserted her head through the side frame of a cart that had been removed from a supermarket and left at her home address. Death was caused by neck compression. Although rare, the potential for lethal entrapment during unsupervised play means that the presence of stray shopping carts at private residences and in public places, including playgrounds and parks, is of concern. Strategies, such as <b>coin</b> <b>deposits,</b> should be encouraged to assist in the return of such carts to supermarkets. Lisbeth Jensen, Cheryl Charlwood and Roger W. Byar...|$|R
50|$|At the 27 Charcos de la Damajagua, {{teams had}} to {{complete}} a circuit {{in which they had}} to climb small waterfalls and then return sliding down the waterfalls and in some cases jumping off them. Then, teams had to collect two small bags with <b>coins</b> and <b>deposit</b> them on a Scotiabank piggy bank. Once teams completed the course, they would receive their next clue from their guide.|$|R
50|$|Outerwall {{will also}} be coming out with {{additional}} services, including the ability to <b>deposit</b> <b>coins</b> directly into a personal bank account. A specific time frame for availability of this service has not been announced.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the launch}} of the 2003 coin series, the State Bank has had some {{difficulties}} with making the acceptance of coins universal despite the partial discontinuation of smaller notes, to the point of some banks refusing <b>coin</b> cash <b>deposits</b> or the cashing in of large amounts of coins. This has prompted laws requiring private and municipal banks to transact and offer services for coins and the full discontinuation of small denomination and cotton based notes.|$|R
5|$|In {{the upper}} Vistula basin, where the Przeworsk culture {{settlements}} were still relatively dense {{in the first}} half of the 5th century, they are markedly absent during the second half of it. This is also the case in Silesia - the depopulation pattern began there earlier and the latest finds are dated around 400 AD. All of it agrees well with the information given by Procopius of Caesarea, according to whom the Heruli returning to Scandinavia from the Carpathian Basin in 512, heading towards the Varni tribe area in Germany, crossed a large region devoid of human settlements - presumably Silesia and Lusatia. Likewise there are no settlements found in Masovia and Podlasie beyond the early part of the 5th century. On the other hand, in central Poland and Greater Poland isolated remnants from the Roman era cultures continue to be located through the end of 5th and even into the earlier parts of the 6th century. Still further north, in Pomerania, such findings are actually quite numerous, including many cult <b>coin</b> <b>deposit</b> sites (Roman and then Byzantine golden solidi). That's where the Germanic groups lasted the longest (and kept up trade and other contacts with their brethren elsewhere).|$|R
25|$|The {{behavior}} of state machines {{can be observed}} in many devices in modern society that perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a sequence of events with which they are presented. Examples are vending machines, which dispense products when the proper combination of <b>coins</b> is <b>deposited,</b> elevators, whose sequence of stops is determined by the floors requested by riders, traffic lights, which change sequence when cars are waiting, and combination locks, which require the input of combination numbers in the proper order.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the most}} {{well-known}} phreaking boxes were the black box, which tricked switching equipment into believing a call had not been answered when in fact it had, resulting in free incoming long distance calls; the beige box, which is an improvised lineman's handset typically made from a one-piece telephone and alligator clips; the blue box which emulated the in-band signaling tones once used by long distance operators and switching equipment; and the red box, which emulated the tones generated by payphones when <b>coins</b> were <b>deposited.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As Robin and Maid Marian {{fall in love}} again, the townsfolk have a troubadour festival {{spoofing}} Prince John, describing him as the [...] "Phony King of England", and {{the song}} soon becomes popular with John's soldiers. A paltry <b>coin</b> gets <b>deposited</b> into the poor box at Friar Tuck's church, which gets seized by the Sheriff. Friar Tuck lashes out at the Sheriff, to which he is quickly arrested. Prince John orders Friar Tuck hanged, knowing Robin Hood {{will come out of}} hiding to rescue his friend.|$|R
5000|$|Locking options: {{various types}} of key locking or padlocking {{facility}} are available now. Key locking options include flush locks, cam locks, or locks incorporated into a rotating handle; padlocking facilities may be a simple hasp and staple, or else a padlocking hole may {{be included in a}} handle, often called a latchlock. More modern designs include keyless operation, either by <b>coin</b> <b>deposit</b> (which {{may or may not be}} returned when use of the locker terminates), or by using electronic keypads to enter passwords for later reopening the locker. Some older lockers used a drop-latch which was incorporated into the door handle, and slid up and down and could be padlocked at the bottom in the [...] "down" [...] position, but these are less used now. Three-point locking is not possible with this type of latch, because it needs to be operated by means of a latch that rotates rather than slides up and down; so this drop-latch is probably a less secure locking option, which may be why it is little used nowadays. Prefect Combination locks are very popular in school lockers used in the UK due to their ease of use and the time and cost saved in the removal of locker keys.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{it used to}} be {{possible}} to make calls from coin-box phones (payphones) by tapping the switch hook without <b>depositing</b> <b>coins.</b> A person caught tapping could be charged with 'abstracting electricity' from the General Post Office and several cases were prosecuted under this offence.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{sophisticated}} electronic coin acceptors {{are being}} used in some places that, in addition to validating weight and size, also scan the <b>deposited</b> <b>coin</b> using optics and match the image to a pre-defined list, or test the coin's [...] "metallic signature" [...] based on its alloy composition.|$|R
50|$|Early {{machines}} designed {{primarily for}} commuters are essentially receipt printers,accepting only coins (no bills) and prepaid magnetic TransitChek-like cards - not credit cards.Passengers must first insert <b>coins</b> (amount <b>deposited</b> is displayed), then press numerous lighted buttons sequentially to specify traveller count, train class, single/return/concessionary, and destination. Buttons light up only when adequate coins are inserted. TVMs sell only unreserved single/round-trips to local destinations (<50 miles) {{from the current}} station. Earlier button presses constrain subsequent choices: destinations for which insufficient fares were paid (in selected train class) do not activate and have no effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{reference to}} a vending machine is {{in the work of}} Hero of Alexandria, an engineer and mathematician in first-century Roman Egypt. His machine accepted a coin and then dispensed holy water. When the <b>coin</b> was <b>deposited,</b> it fell upon a pan attached to a lever. The lever opened a valve which let some water flow out. The pan continued to tilt with the weight of the coin until it fell off, at which point a counterweight snapped the lever up and turned off the valve.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{vending machine}} {{was also one}} of his constructions; when a coin was {{introduced}} via a slot {{on the top of the}} machine, a set amount of holy water was dispensed. This was included in his list of inventions in his book Mechanics and Optics. When the <b>coin</b> was <b>deposited,</b> it fell upon a pan attached to a lever. The lever opened up a valve which let some water flow out. The pan continued to tilt with the weight of the coin until it fell off, at which point a counter-weight would snap the lever back up and turn off the valve.|$|R
50|$|The hoard was {{discovered}} by an amateur archaeologist using a metal detector on 31 August 2015. He immediately informed Estonian authorities and helped them uncover the hoard. The archaeologists discovered no traces of any settlement close to the deposit, and as it contained no <b>coins</b> the <b>deposit</b> has been dated on stylistic grounds. It {{has been estimated that}} the hoard was deposited at the early 12th century or during the 11th century. It consists of two neck rings, weighing 193 g and 150 g respectively, and two spiral rings weighing 104 g and 102 g. The finding indicates that the hoard was deliberately buried.|$|R
