40|$|Neel {{walls and}} <b>cross-tie</b> walls are two {{structures}} commonly seen in ferromagnetic thin films. They are interesting because their internal length scales are not determined by dimensional analysis alone. This paper studies (a) the repulsive interaction of one-dimensional Neel walls and (b) the internal length {{scale of the}} <b>cross-tie</b> wall. Our analysis of (a) is mathematically rigorous; it provides, roughly speaking, the first two terms of an asymptotic expansion for the energy {{of a pair of}} interacting walls. Our analysis of (b) is heuristic, since it rests on an analogy between the <b>cross-tie</b> wall and an ensemble of Neel walls. This analogy, combined with our results on Neel walls and a judicious choice of parameter regime, yields a specific prediction for the internal length scale of a <b>cross-tie</b> wall. This prediction is consistent with the experimentally observed trends...|$|R

2500|$|TEPCO admits for {{the first}} time that it had failed to take {{stronger}} measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants. TEPCO's internal reform task force, led by company President Naomi Hirose, said in a report TEPCO had feared efforts to better protect nuclear facilities from severe accidents such as tsunamis would trigger anti-nuclear sentiment, interfere with operations or increase litigation risks. TEPCO could have mitigated the impact of the accident if it had diversified power and cooling systems by paying closer attention to international standards and recommendations, the report said. TEPCO also should have trained employees with practical crisis management skills rather than conduct obligatory drills as a formality, it said. In the internal report TEPCO said that before the accident it had been afraid to consider the risk of such a large tsunami as the one in March 2011 which hit Fukushima, fearing admissions of risk could result in public pressure to shut plants down. [...] "There were concerns that if new countermeasures against severe accidents were installed, concern would spread in host communities that the current plants had safety problems," [...] the report said.

40|$|The low {{temperature}} properties of the Kagome-type system Co 3 V 2 O 8 have been studied by powder neutron diffraction both in zero field and in applied magnetic field of up to 8 T. Below 6 K, the zero-field ground state is ferromagnetic with the magnetic moments aligned along the a-axis. The size of the moment {{on one of the}} two Co sites, the so called <b>cross-tie</b> site, is considerably reduced compared to the fully polarized state. The application of a magnetic field in this phase is found to rapidly enhance the <b>cross-tie</b> site magnetic moment, which reaches the expected value of ~ 3 muB by the maximum applied field of 8 T. Different reorientation behaviors are found for the Co <b>cross-tie</b> and spine sites, suggesting a more pronounced easy-axis anisotropy for moments on the spine sites. Rietveld refinements reveal that a simple model, where the spins on both <b>cross-tie</b> and spine sites rotate in the ac-plane in a magnetic field, reproduces the experimental diffraction patterns well. In addition, it is found that at higher temperatures and moderate magnetic fields, the incommensurate antiferromagnetic order, corresponding to a transverse sinusoidal modulation above 8 K, is suppressed to be replaced by ferromagnetic order.

40|$|Co 3 V 2 O 8 (CVO) has a {{different}} type of geometrically frustrated magnetic lattice, a kagomÃ© staircase, where the full frustration of a conventional kagomÃ© lattice is partially relieved. The crystal structure consists of two inequivalent (magnetic) Co sites, one-dimensional chains of Co(2) spine sites, linked by Co(1) <b>cross-tie</b> sites. Neutron powder diffraction has been used to solve the basic magnetic and crystal structures of this system, while polarized and unpolarized single crystal diffraction measurements have been used to reveal a rich variety of incommensurate phases, interspersed with lock-in transitions to commensurate phases. CVO initially orders magnetically at 11. 3 K into an incommensurate, transversely polarized, spin density wave state, with wave vector k=(0,Î´, 0) with Î´= 0. 55 and the spin direction along the a axis. Î´ is found to decrease monotonically with decreasing temperature and then locks into a commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with Î´= 1 / 2 for 6. 93 ÌcT 3 Ìc 8. 6 K. In this phase, there is a ferromagnetic layer where the spine site and <b>cross-tie</b> sites have ordered moments of 1. 39 Î¼B and 1. 17 Î¼B, respectively, and an antiferromagnetic layer where the spine-site has an ordered moment of 2. 55 Î¼B, while the <b>cross-tie</b> sites are fully frustrated and have no observable ordered moment. Below 6. 9 K, the magnetic structure becomes incommensurate again, and the presence of higher-order satellite peaks indicates that the magnetic structure deviates from a simple sinusoid. Î´ continues to decrease with decreasing temperature and locks in again at Î´= 1 / 3 over a narrow temperature range (6. 23 ÌcT 3 Ìc 6. 5 K). The system then undergoes a strongly first-order transition to the ferromagnetic ground state (Î´= 0) at Tc= 6. 2 K. The ferromagnetism partially relieves the <b>cross-tie</b> site frustration, with ordered moments on the spine-site and <b>cross-tie</b> sites of 2. 73 Î¼B and 1. 54 Î¼B, respectively. The spin direction for all spins is along the a axis (Ising-like behavior). A dielectric anomaly is observed around the ferromagnetic transition temperature of 6. 2 K, demonstrating that there is significant spin-charge coupling present in CVO.
