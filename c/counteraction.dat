The politically motivated killing of a white man, Petrus Oberholzer, near Melsetter by ZANU insurgents on 4 July 1964 marked the start of intensified black nationalist violence and police <b>counteraction</b> that culminated in the banning of ZANU and PCC/ZAPU on 26 August, {{with most of the}} two movements' respective leaders concurrently jailed or restricted.

Panarin also proposed the submission to Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Voice of Russia radio and the RIA Novosti press agency (further, based on the so created structure, formation of a Foreign Policy Media Holding within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia) and creation of non-governmental organisations of Russia, acting on {{the territory of the}} CIS countries, the EU, and the US.|$|E

He proposed a contract on anti-terror between the authorities and the media with a behavioural codex of the journalists {{and the creation of a}} special state body for informational <b>counteraction</b> organisation and coordination of the information activities of all state structures operating to counter terror. In his view, the media are to a certain degree a catalyst for terrorism because terrorist acts of such a volume would be impossible without them; also, the press induces panic in the organs of state authority and affects the public negatively.|$|E
500|$|The final {{escalation}} towards {{war began}} in early January 1918, as each military or political {{act of the}} Reds or the Whites resulted in a corresponding <b>counteraction</b> by the opponent.

On the left, {{the vanguard of the}} war was the active, urban Red Guards from Helsinki, Kotka and Turku; they led the rural Reds, and convinced the socialist leaders who wavered between peace and war to support revolution. On the right, the vanguard of the conflict was the Jägers who had been moved to Finland by the end of 1917, and the active volunteer White Guards of Viipuri province in the southeastern corner of Finland, southwestern Finland and southern Ostrobothnia. The first [...] local battles were fought during 9–21 January in southern and southeastern Finland, mainly to win the race for weapons and for controlling the Viipuri town.|$|E

[...] Cantley described Thorpe as [...] "a national figure with a very distinguished public record".

[...] The mystery surrounding the £20,000 that Thorpe had obtained from Hayward was dismissed as an irrelevance: [...] "The fact that a man obtains money by deceit does not [...] that the man {{was a member of a}} conspiracy." [...] Waugh felt that the judge's lack of even-handedness could well provoke a <b>counteraction</b> against the accused from the jury. The summing-up became the subject of a scathing parody by the satirist Peter Cook, written and delivered shortly after the trial at The Secret Policeman's Ball in aid of Amnesty International.

2500|$|Analyzing strategy, Schlesinger {{maintained}} that the {{theory and practice of}} the 1950s and 1960s had been overtaken by events, particularly the rise of the Soviet Union to virtual nuclear parity with the United States and the effect this development had on the concept of deterrence. Schlesinger believed that [...] "deterrence is not a substitute for defense; defense capabilities, representing the potential for effective <b>counteraction,</b> are the essential condition of deterrence." [...] He had grave doubts about the assured destruction strategy, which relied on massive nuclear attacks against an enemy's urban-industrial areas. Credible strategic nuclear deterrence, the secretary felt, depended on fulfilling several conditions: maintaining essential equivalence with the Soviet Union in force effectiveness; maintaining a highly survivable force that could be withheld or targeted against an enemy's economic base in order to deter coercive or desperation attacks against U.S. population or economic targets; establishing a fast-response force that could act to deter additional enemy attacks; and establishing a range of capabilities sufficient to convince all nations that the United States was equal to its strongest competitors.|$|E
40|$|To {{successfully}} {{predict the}} actions of an adversary and develop effective <b>counteractions,</b> {{the knowledge of the}} enemy organization, objectives, and the modus operandi are needed. Current approaches to analyzing the threat are manual, labor-intensive, and require significant amount of time. In empirical studies, humans exhibited decision and confirmatory biases, which negatively impacted their assessment of the adversary. Compounded by huge amounts of data, large information gaps, and significant complexity of the problem people need to analyze, the ability of the intelligence teams to recognize an active enemy is reduced, further resulting in decreased effectiveness of <b>counteractions</b> and unintended consequences. In this 2 -part paper, we discuss a project that focused on developing an automated adversarial organization identification technology.

40|$|Surface {{alterations}} of {{the original}} limestone and the efficiency of several cleaning methods were investigated on the Corfu Venetian Fortress facade. Black crusts of gypsum dendrites and loose depositions or black-grey calcareous encrustations in combination with biological decay were identified as main decay processes. The cleaning treatments, chosen according to their acting on the stone surface, were: sepiolite for solvent action, ammonium bicarbonate for exchange action, EDTA for the chemical chelating action, hydrogen peroxide for chemical action on biological species and nylon brushes for physical action. Each cleaning method's efficiency and <b>counteractions</b> were evaluated by laboratory examinations concerning the morphology and {{the composition of the}} surface with SEM observations and X-ray microanalysis, before and after treatment and during ageing tests in sulphur dioxide and humidity atmosphere.

2500|$|By 1927, the {{magazine}} again had {{a focus on}} eugenics, as well as racial hygiene and natalism. Hosting a topical essay by Spengler, it had contributions by eugenicists Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer, Alfred Ploetz, and Fritz Lenz. Issuing predictions about the [...] "fate of our race", Lenz discussed the Nordic race {{in relation to the}} German people, while statistician Richard Korherr contributed Geburtenrückgank ("Birth Rate"), a much-read study of the West's population decline. These works were complimented in 1929 by a [...] essay on biopolitics and the alleged Slavic population pressure on Germany's eastern frontier, suggesting <b>counteraction</b> through German recolonization. In other ways {{the magazine}} contradicted Völkisch tenets. Sexologist Max von Gruber wrote that most of the [...] "greatest men of our race" [...] were not purely Nordic, but [...] "hybrids", and that productive miscegenation was in the national character. Franz Spina's 1928 piece on the Sudeten Germans expressed support for a rapprochement between Germany and the Czechoslovak Republic. Also, as noted by historian Bernd Weisbrod, s racial antisemitism was of the moderate variety embraced by the National Populists. This was notably illustrated by its hosting, in September 1930, of an article by Jünger, in which the novelist suggested that self-segregation was [...] "the most efficient weapon" [...] against Jews.|$|E

30|$|Although MET is {{necessary}} for fibroblasts reprogramming, there are still several questions remaining unclear. Firstly, since the process from MEF to iPSC {{can be considered as}} a reversed process of embryonic development at least partially, the reversed process of sequential EMT-MET, which is also a sequential EMT-MET, might be observed during iPSC generation. Secondly, the different or even opposite regulatory roles of the four transcriptional factors, like on TGFβ 1 and TGFβ receptor 2, make MET induction more complex (Li et al., 2010). These two questions were answered in one of our recent publications (Liu et al., 2013 a). Considering the complex functions of the four factors in regulating pluripotency (Kashyap et al., 2009; Pan et al., 2002) and the proper expression level of Oct 4 required to maintain pluripotency (Pan et al., 2006), we proposed that the four factors have different functions during iPSC generation and may even have <b>counteractions</b> under certain circumstances or at certain time points. In order to diminish or decrease the possible <b>counteractions,</b> we introduced the four factors into MEF at different time points during iPSC generation.|$|R
