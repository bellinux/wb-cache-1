40|$|An {{analysis}} was performed of radiological and toxicological consequences of a worst-case leak from a 2 -inch diameter flush connection in a pit over tank AY- 102. The unmitigated (without controls) flush line spray leak assumes that the blank connector and the removable plug in the pit <b>cover</b> <b>block</b> have been removed so that the maximum system flow is directed out of the open 2 -inch line vertically into the air above the pit. The mitigated (with controls) spray scenario assumes the removable plug is in place and the flow is directed against {{the underside of the}} pit <b>cover</b> <b>block.</b> The unmitigated scenario exceeded both onsite and offsite risk guidelines for an anticipated accident.

40|$|The {{numerical}} dating of hydrothemal speleothems (doughnuts) from locality At Crocodile gave older data {{than was}} published in the literature: 123 to 127 thousand years (with range 108 to 144 thousand years).

40|$|Paleomagnetism {{together}} with {{an analysis of the}} internal structure of the Bicorb-Quesa and northern Navarres salt-wall segments (Prebetic Zone in SE Iberia) were used to constrain their kinematics and driving mechanisms. Paleomagnetic data from Upper Triassic red beds of the selected salt-related structures and from the Miocene rocks belonging to adjacent syn-diapiric half-grabens reveal 15 - 30 degrees counter-clockwise vertical-axis rotations of the salt-wall rocks and a 20 degrees clockwise rotation of the Jurassic-Miocene <b>cover</b> <b>block</b> located south of the salt-wall. This, {{together with}} the salt-wall structure, indicates that the origin of the salt-wall was linked to the motion of a late Miocene thin-skinned extensional fault system, which detached on the Upper Triassic evaporites. Specifically, the salt-wall formed by the south-southwest displacement with a 20 degrees clockwise rotation component of a <b>cover</b> <b>block</b> bounded northwards by the detachment disruptions generated by the motion of pre-existent basement faults. The Upper Triassic detachment level was first affected by a counter-clockwise vertical axis rotation and, during the Paleogene-earliest Miocene building of the Iberian Chain, by tight WNW-trending folds and SSE-directed minor thrusts. This study also shows that Paleomagnetism together with the analysis of the internal structure can successfully depict the geometry and kinematic evolution of complex salt-wall structures.

(2) Testing of the low point floor drain assembly by opening and closing the drain {{to and from the}} ''retracted'' and ''sealed'' positions.
