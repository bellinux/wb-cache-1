40|$|An {{air-cooled}} gradient resistor column {{has been}} designed and implemented for the KFUPM 350 kV ion accelerator. The air-cooled column overcomes operational limitations on the acceleration voltages obtained with the old water-cooled column and improves on reliability and maintainability. The new column consists of five sections, each having sixteen 8 M Omega 15 W resistors connected in a series-parallel combination. Corona shields defining equipotential circular planes have been incorporated to maintain a uniform potential difference across the column sections. In {{order to protect the}} gradient column and accelerator tube against arcing, spark gaps are provided on each <b>corona</b> <b>shield.</b> The new column has been tested over the full range of 0 - 320 kV across the accelerator tube for extended durations without arcing. Both electrical and mechanical aspects of the new design are discussed, measurement techniques used during installation and testing are described, and performance data are given...|$|E

40|$|RF window {{designs of}} the Pillbox type {{were capable of}} {{transmitting}} peak rf power up to about 10 MW. The power levels now being produced by advanced high frequency power sources is beyond the level that can safely be transmitted through a single rf window of conventional design. New approaches are required to keep the rf electric fields at a manageable level {{in the vicinity of}} the rf window. This paper describes some of the recent rf window designs at SLAC and elsewhere and some of the test results. Windows that operate in larger waveguide in higher order modes such as TE 01 and in a mix of modes such as TE 11, TM 11 and TE 12 are described. RF chokes and <b>corona</b> <b>shields,</b> circular polarization and forced electric field reduction are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{capabilities}} of applying the three-dimensional finite element method (3 D-FEM) for designing complex-shaped substation connectors to operate at 765 kVRMS AC. To check this methodology, it was analyzed the feasibility of upgrading a 400 kVRMS substation connector to operate at 765 kVRMS. However, both experimental and simulation results conducted according to the ANSI/NEMA CC 1 - 2009 standard concluded that although it passed the visual corona test, to ensure a wide safety margin it was desirable an improvement of the electrical behavior of such connector. It was shown that FEM results allowed detecting the peak stress points of the connector regarding the electrical stress thus allowing applying a corrective action. Then, two possible solutions were analyzed, i. e. the use of <b>corona</b> <b>shields</b> and the redesign of the connector assisted by 3 D-FEM simulations. Results presented in this work show that both approaches have an excellent behavior in reducing the electric field strength on the connector surface. However, to make the final decision, the production cost of both alternatives was analyzed, thus favoring the redesign option. Next, the redesigned version of the substation connector was manufactured and tested. Experimental results conducted in a high voltage laboratory verified {{the effectiveness of the}} methodology and the potential of the proposed system to act as an advanced design tool for optimizing the behavior of complex-shaped substation connectors. Thus, this system allows assisting efficiently the design process while permitting constraining the economic costsPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Geologic {{mapping of}} Venus at 1 : 5 M scale has shown {{in great detail}} the flow {{complexes}} of volcanoes, <b>coronae,</b> and <b>shield</b> fields, and the varying structural patterns that differentiate tesserae from corona rims and isolated patches of densely lineated terrain. In most cases, however, the lower-elevation plains between the higher-standing landforms are discriminated only {{on the basis of}} potentially secondary features such as late-stage lava flooding or tectonic overprinting. This result, in which volcanoes and tesserae appear as "islands in the sea," places weak constraints on the relative age of large upland regions {{and the nature of the}} basement terrain. In this work, we focus on the spatial distribution and topography of densely lineated and tessera units over a large region of Venus, and their relationship to apparently later <b>corona</b> and <b>shield</b> flow complexes. The goal is to identify likely connections between patches of deformed terrain that suggest earlier features of regional extent, and to compare the topography of linked patches with other such clusters as a guide to whether they form larger tracts beneath the plains. Mapping Approach. We are mapping the region from 57 S to 57 N, 300 E- 60 E. Since the 1 : 5 M quadrangles emphasize detail of tessera structure and corona/edifice flows, we simply adopt the outlines of these features as they relate to the outcrops of either "densely lineated terrain" or tessera (Fig. 1). The densely lineated material is mapped in many quadrangles based on pervasive structural deformation, typically with a single major axis (in contrast to the overlapping orthogonal patterns on tesserae). This unit definition is often extended to include material of corona rims. We do not at present differentiate between plains units, since earlier efforts show that their most defining attributes may be secondary to the original emplacement (e. g., lobate or sheet-like flooding by thin flow units, tectonic patterns related to regional and localized stress regimes) [1]...|$|R
40|$|Because {{hotspots}} {{represent an}} important manifestation of heat loss on Venus, their geological evolution is of fundamental importance for {{any attempt to}} understand Venusian tectonics. Eistla Regio is an approximately 7500 -km-long, moderately elevated region inferred to overlie one or more large mantle upwellings or hotspots. It also contains many <b>shield</b> volcanoes and <b>coronae</b> believed due {{to the rise of}} thermal plumes in the mantle. Central Eistla Regio includes two large volcanoes, Sappho and Anala, and several coronae in close proximity. Detailed mapping in this region results in two conclusions of tectonic significance: (1) Sappho and Anala occur near the intersection of two major extensional deformation zones, and (2) the coronae are older than the large volcanoes. Several of the coronae occur as a chain along Guor Linea, one of the major extensional deformation zones. Stratigraphic relationships indicate that the coronae began forming very soon after the emplacement of the widespread regional plains materials. Thus Central Eistla Regio was the site of a swarm of plumes that first formed coronae and then later formed shield volcanoes. The expected result of such a swarm would be thermal thinning of the elastic lithosphere with time. However, model results, geological observations, and gravity data suggest that the change from <b>coronae</b> to <b>shield</b> volcanoes was accompanied by a thickening of the lithosphere with time. This thickening is interpreted {{to be the result of}} global cooling of the lithosphere following the most recent episode of near-global resurfacing. The global cooling must have occurred faster than local heating of the lithosphere due to the impingement of thermal plumes...|$|R

Sometimes positively charged particles can account for 30 %~ 50 % of the total particles escaped. They are formed probably from the reentrainment by corona electrode rapping or from back corona effects. In view of this phenomena, for strengthen the corona electrode capability of capturing positively charged particles; new types of corona electrodes were investigated. It has multi- function of corona discharge, reducing back corona, prevent reentrainment and collect the positively charged particles. Different types and geometries of corona electrodes were proposed; {{all of them were}} featured to add a channel shaped wind buffer, which has the same voltage with the corona wire and located between subsequent corona wires. These buffers can reduce gas flow scouring reentrainments, collect positively charged particles and restrain back <b>corona</b> by electrostatic <b>shielding</b> effect.

40|$|The geology {{and surface}} {{morphology}} of Bell Regio (18 - 42 deg N, 32 - 58 deg E) are investigated {{using a combination}} of Magellan, Venera, and analogous terrestrial data. The properties of surface units are compared to either direct terrestrial analog measurements or to the behaviors predicted by theoretical models. Five major volcanic sources are identified from geologic mapping (Tepev Mons, Nefertiti <b>corona,</b> a large <b>shield</b> volcano east of Tepev, and two small edifices southeast of Tepev). The volcano Api Mons lies northeast of the main Bell uplift. The oldest volcanic units are associated with an extensive low shield volcano east of Tepev Mons and a small edifice southeast of Tepev. The annular flow apron of Tepev Mons formed next, with volcanism at a second small edifice on the southeast flank of Tepev Mons producing the youngest flow units. Comparisons between Magellan data, terrestrial radar images, and field topography profiles suggest that only three units resemble terrestrial a'a flows; the remainder are consistent with smoother pahoehoe-type surfaces. This suggests that most of the flow units were erupted at relatively low volume effusion rates (less than 100 cu m/sec) {{over long periods of time}} or had very low viscositie...|$|R
40|$|Venus has an unmoving lithosphere, a young surface {{indicative}} of volcanic resurfacing, {{and a wide}} variety of volcanic and tectonic features. The planet s ubiquitous magmatic features include 100, 000 small shield volcanoes as well as the descriptively named pancakes, ticks, and arachnoids [1]. Coronae, volcanic and tectonic features up to 2, 600 km in diameter, have been attributed to lithospheric interactions with upwelling plumes [e. g., 2], but more recently to delamination of the lower lithosphere with [3] or without [4] a central upwelling. Lavas issuing from different volcanic features appear to have a range of compositions, as evidenced by their apparent viscosities and by data from Soviet landers. Steep-sided or "pancake" domes [e. g., 5] appear to consist of more viscous magma [6], perhaps silicic compositions created by remelting basaltic crust [7]. These steep-sided domes are associated with <b>coronae</b> and with <b>shield</b> volcanoes effusing basaltic magmas [7, 8] with apparently low viscosities (low enough to allow fluid flow for hundreds of km, creating channels reminiscent of water rivers on Earth). Pancake domes, in contrast, can be up to 3 km in height and have volumes from 30 to approx. 3, 000 km 3 [calculated from data in 8], and hundreds dot the planet [6 - 8]...|$|R
40|$|Aggregate morphologies as a {{function}} of apparent pH (PH*) have been studied for PS-b-P 4 VP diblocks in DMF/H 2 O. The pH* changes are induced by addition of HCl or NaOH (100 nM to 20 mM). As the pH* increases, the morphology changes from large compound micelles to a mixture of spheres, rods, and vesicles, to spheres, to rods, back to spheres when no acid or base is added, then to rods again, back to spheres again, and finally to a mixture of spheres, rods, lamellae, and vesicles. The interplay of the charge introduction into the <b>corona</b> chains, <b>shielding,</b> and steric-solvation interaction is responsible for the complex behavior. The effect of NaCl on the neutral copolymer and the effect of pH* on a quaternized copolymer are also explored. Thermodynamics of micellization of PS-b-PAA copolymers in DMF/water have been investigated as {{a function}} of four variables, i. e. the water content, PS block length, PAA block length, and NaCl concentration. Based on a closed association model, thermodynamic functions (DeltaG, DeltaH, and DeltaS) are estimated. Morphological phase diagrams, as well as kinetics and mechanisms of the rod to vesicle transition for PS-b-PAA diblocks in dioxane/water have been studied. In the study of morphological phase diagrams, the regions of stability are identified for spheres, spheres and rods, rods only, rods and vesicles or rods and bilayers, vesicles or bilayers alone, and for some copolymers, more complex mixtures. Evidence is presented that spheres, rods, and vesicles represent true equilibrium structures. The influence of the water content and polymer concentration on aggregate morphologies and the effect of fractionation on the phase diagram are discussed. The block length dependence of the phase diagram is also explored. It is found that copolymers with long core-forming blocks favor the formation of vesicles, and that for copolymers with short core-forming blocks, vesicles are favored at high water contents and other bilayers at relatively low water contents. In the kinetic and mechanistic study, two consecutive first order relaxation processes are found. In the first, the rod is flattened and then converts to a lamella, while in the second, the lamella closes to form a vesicle. Two relaxation times are explored in terms of the initial water content, size of the jump in the water content, and polymer concentration...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} means to evaluate lightning performance of pole-mounted distribution transformers and Medium Voltage (MV) distribution lines. The main intention {{is to provide a}} general bench-mark procedure for analysis of lightning performances of pole-mounted transformers and MV distribution lines and thereby to ensure proper installation and reduction of the high lightning failure rate existing in Sri Lanka. // In installation of HV surge arresters, the separation length between the arrester and the high voltage bushing is of paramount importance. Thus the calculation of the separation lengths and failure rates are first discussed and the drawbacks of the present method of installation are presented. The required separation depends on several factors such as tower configuration, system voltage, tower surge impedance, the length of the earth wire of the arrester etc. Effect of ground flash and residual voltage of arresters impart a considerable contribution to the transformer protection. An alternative approach for this is also presented. The role of the earth resistance and its contribution to High Voltage and Low Voltage failures due to lightning are discussed indicating typical modes of failure. The determination of a safe value for the earth resistance is also presented// Flashover due to lightning induced surge voltages is of paramount importance in evaluating reliability and power quality of Medium Voltage distribution lines. First, analysis has been done on flashovers due to direct lightning. Next a comprehensive analysis has been done to develop a method to evaluate lightning performance against lightning induced flashes. Accuracy of the algorithms to calculate lightning induced line flashes highly depends on parameters such as wave front time of return stroke current, magnitude of the return stroke current and its probability distribution and the speed of the return stroke current. Having selected the most suitable values for these parameters, a technique has been developed to determine line flas hover rates due to induced lightning. Next, cumulative effect of both direct and indirect lightning surges has been discussed. Analysis has been done to study dependence of line flas hover rates on line insulation levels,isokeraunic level, line height, wave front time, <b>corona</b> damping, <b>shielding</b> due to near by objects etc. Variation of line flas hover rates with above parameters has been discussed. Theoretical results have been compared with practical data as a measure to check adequacy of the developed analysis technique.

40|$|The {{discovery}} {{of a large number}} of gamma-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by the EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) has spawned a lot of theoretical interest in the high-energy and multifrequency emission from these objects. Since most of them show evidence for relativistic outflow, jet models have received most of the attention so far. However, the presence of soft photons at the center of the active nucleus and the resulting Compton drag make it difficult to produce the observed amount of MeV/GeV emission. We explore hot, two-temperature accretion disks around Kerr black holes as an alternative to relativistic beam models for the production of the high-enerty emission. The decay of neutral pions created in the hot region produces photons with energies up to several hundred MeV. Relativistic pairs created as a result of charged pion decays produce additional inverse-Compton radiation in the range of approx. 1 keV- 4 MeV if the pairs are exposed to UV radiation, or in the range of approx. 40 keV- 150 MeV if the pairs are exposed to soft X-rays. This suggests that high-energy flares in AGNs may be triggered by changes in the disk structure (such as phase transitions or the development of electron scattering <b>coronae)</b> that temporarily <b>shield</b> the hot inner region from UV photons emitted at larger radii, thereby reducing the optical depth for MeV/GeV gamma-rays. Stochastic processes may also play a role in accelerating the utrarelativistic electrons responsible for producing the highest energy (GeV) emission...|$|R
