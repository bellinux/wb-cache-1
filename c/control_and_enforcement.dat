Both formats were designed as successors to DVD, capable of higher quality {{video and audio}} playback, and of greater capacity when used to store video, audio, and computer data. Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD share most of the same methods of encoding media onto discs with each other, resulting in equivalent levels of audio and visual quality, but differ in other aspects such as interactive capabilities, internet integration, usage <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement,</b> and in which features were mandatory for players.

25|$|The Government of Argentina (GoA) with World Bank {{assistance}} has {{aimed to}} reduce industrial wastewater discharge (organic {{as well as}} toxic effluents) that directly enter the MR River. Over the next 15–20 years these efforts {{will contribute to the}} environmental recovery of the river. They will focus on the 50 main industrial polluters that contribute ~95% of the total industrial organic load (approximately 70 percent of the total organic load) discharged to the MR River and a further 170 industries with the highest toxic load currently discharged into the MR River. A combination of technical assistance to improve monitoring, <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> by the MR Basin Authority will be instituted. The idea is to help in collecting baseline data and carry out diagnostic exercises. Support will be provided for private sector investments in pollution control and cleaner production processes, targeting small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) that typically pollute more per unit of output and have weaker financial and technical capacity to comply with environmental regulations.|$|E

50|$|Prepared {{substances}} (as {{opposed to}} those that occur naturally in a consumable form, such as cannabis and psilocybin mushrooms) require reagents. Some drugs, like cocaine and morphine, are extracted from plant sources and refined {{with the aid of}} chemicals. Semi-synthetic drugs such as heroin are made starting from alkaloids extracted from plant sources which are the precursors for further synthesis. In the case of heroin, a mixture of alkaloids is extracted from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) by incising its seed capsule - a milky fluid bleeds out of the incisions which is then left to dry out and scraped off the bulbs, yielding raw opium. Morphine, one of many alkaloids in opium, is then extracted out of the opium by acid-base extraction and turned into heroin by reacting it with acetic anhydride. Other drugs (such as methamphetamine and MDMA) are normally made from commercially available chemicals, though both can also be made from naturally occurring precursors. Methamphetamine can also be made from ephedrine, one of the naturally occurring alkaloids in ephedra (Ephedra sinica). MDMA can be made from safrole, the major constituent of several etheric oils like sassafras. Governments have adopted a strategy of chemical control as part of their overall drug <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> plans. Chemical control offers a means of attacking illicit drug production and disrupting the process before the drugs have entered the market.|$|E
50|$|SOPA {{has largely}} been {{declared}} unconstitutional {{by the majority of}} Internet users. However, there are potential positive effects that could arise from passing the bill. A great number of jobs and industries are dependent on intellectual property and many people could benefit from better <b>control</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> of their IP rights. The bill is supported by many media and film production companies, as well as renowned brand names like Nike who could see great financial benefits from having their copyrighted materials better protected. The implementation of SOPA or a similar policy could even potentially turn stock price declines of companies like Zynga and Netflix around. Producers of Internet content would benefit from SOPA in that it makes targeting copyright violators easier and less costly. SOPA also encourages ISPs and website owners to be proactive and make sure that their sites, products and services are not engaging in or facilitating high levels of copyright infringement - i.e. that their success does not depend on violating the rights of those who hold copyrighted material. SOPA may also be beneficial for preventing abuse of safe harbors. Some provisions within the bill would allow the US Attorney General to completely prohibit US internet users and servers from conducting business with sites that infringe upon IP rights, incentivizing careful self-monitoring. It essentially aims to encourage safer transactions and fair returns to the creators and owners of valuable IP. Those who do comply to IP legislation are currently at a competitive disadvantage, but bills like SOPA can reduce this disadvantage particularly against foreign sites.|$|E
