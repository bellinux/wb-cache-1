40|$|To {{improve the}} {{understanding}} of brake <b>creep</b> <b>groan,</b> both experimental and numerical studies are conducted in this paper. Based on a vehicle road test under the condition of downhill, complicated stick-slip type motion of caliper and its correlation with the interior noise were analyzed. In order to duplicate these brake <b>creep</b> <b>groan</b> phenomena, a transient dynamic model including brake corner and subsystems was established using finite element method. In the model, brake components {{were considered to be}} flexible body, and the subsystems including driveline, suspension, tire, and vehicle body were considered to be rigid body. Simulation and experimental results of caliper vibration in time and frequency domains were compared. It was demonstrated that the new model is effective for the prediction and analysis of brake <b>creep</b> <b>groan,</b> and it has higher accuracy compared to the previous model without the subsystems. It is also found that the lining and caliper not only have stick-slip motion in each coordinate direction but also have translational and torsional movements in plane, which relate to the microscopic sticking and slipping, friction coefficient, and forces, as well as the contact status at the friction interface...|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, the {{activities}} carried {{out during the}} PhD are comprehensively described. They covered, in parallel to a theoretical-numerical study on the main vibratory phenomena of disc brakes, {{the development of a}} simple experimental apparatus to investigate the "creep groan" generation mechanism. The experimental activity was conducted at the Tribology Laboratory of the Department of Civil and Industrial Engineering (DICI) of the University of Pisa with the support of Brembo SpA, which provided the materials (samples and discs) for the research. The experimental characterization of the pad material was carried out on a pin on disc tribometer with the brake disc in place of the tribometer disc and the sample of pad fixed on a suitable interface in the place of the pin. The goal of this tribological characterization was to check the behavior of coefficient of friction between the sample and disc with varying of the operating (speed, load) and geometric (contact area) parameters. After the tribological characterization, {{in order to determine the}} influence of the behavior of the coefficient of friction due to the variation of the operating and geometric parameters on the stability of brake system and in particular on its propensity to squeal, numerical simulations in ANSYS environment were carried out on the disc-pad system using the complex eigenvalue analysis. Since it is generally accepted that brake <b>creep</b> <b>groan</b> is due to the stickâ€“slip phenomenon an extended literature review was made on the relevant analytical models and simulations with some of the lumped parameter models were performed for a better understanding of the phenomenon. Finally, experimental tests were carried out using a simple experimental apparatus set up to investigate the generation mechanism of the <b>creep</b> <b>groan</b> phenomenon where some operative parameters, such as angular velocity of the disc, load, as well as contact area, stiffness of material of the samples and system stiffness, were varied and their effects on the phenomenon observed.

40|$|Since {{nowadays}} the NVH {{performance of}} vehicles {{has become an}} important priority, the noise radiating from brakes is considered a source of considerable passenger discomfort and dissatisfaction. <b>Creep</b> <b>groan</b> and squeal that show up with annoying vibrations and noise in specific frequency ranges are typical examples of self-excited brake vibrations caused by the stick-slip effect, the former, by the mode coupling of brake disc and friction pads or calliper, the latter. In both cases, the friction coefficient, which depends, among other factors, on the morphology of the mating surfaces and on the operating conditions, is a fundamental parameter but {{not the only one}} for the occurrence of the vibratory phenomena.

40|$|Since {{nowadays}} the NVH {{performance of}} vehicles, train included, {{has become a}} priority, the noise radiating from brakes is considered a source of considerable passenger discomfort and dissatisfaction. <b>Creep</b> <b>groan</b> and squeal that show up with annoying vibrations and noise in specific frequency ranges are typical examples of self-excited brake vibration caused by, respectively, the stick-slip effect and the coupling of brake disc and friction pads or caliper. In both cases, the friction coefficient is a fundamental parameter for the occurrence of the vibratory phenomena. The knowledge of the friction coefficient of the pair of materials in contact, and also its possible dependence on the morphology of the surfaces and the operating conditions is therefore essential for predicting {{the behavior of the}} brake and supporting design choices. The present work presents the tests carried out with a pin-disc tribometer according to ASTM on specimens of brake friction material, with circular cross-section of different sizes while the disc was of cast iron. Tests were conducted imposing the normal load and the sliding speed and measuring the tangential force. The correlation between the coefficient of friction and the load, the nominal pressure and the sliding velocity, was calculated and compared with literature models. A negative correlation with the sliding speed and a positive correlation with applied load was found as well as a weak correlation with the nominal pressure. In parallel, a finite element (FE) complex eigenvalue parametric analysis was performed on the brake assembly to evaluate propensity to dynamic instability of brakes with multiple pads {{as a function of the}} number of pads, geometrical and material parameters obtaining useful indications...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, {{numerous}} {{studies have been conducted}} for the development of alternative materials for better performance of brake pads. With a huge selection of materials, automobile manufacturers must prioritize the performance standards, safety, cost and environmental factors of the brake pads. To improve the friction performance of brake pads, maintain customers comfort level and environment safety, design engineers test and verify the best materials to satisfy the federal performance standards. Raw materials of brake pads compose of different categories such as organic, semi metallic and low-metallic. Besides the difference in composition, these materials affect the brake pads in terms of friction properties, wear rates and noise levels. It is crucial for engineers and manufacturers to improve friction stability while minimizing vibration by manipulating the composition of different raw materials and additive materials. Automotive brake pads normally consist of numerous metallic and composite materials that are formed by hot compression which can result in various mechanical properties [14]. This research proposes to investigate different composition of metallic raw materials and how their frictional performance is affected under different environmental testing standards. This research investigates the frictional performance of six types of raw materials with different mechanical properties and morphology using a universal mechanical tester (Bruker UMT). This paper examines the overall friction performance, coefficient of friction and <b>creep</b> <b>groan</b> behavior of six different raw materials under different humidity levels. By scrutinizing the static and kinetic coefficient of friction(COF) at different humidity levels, humidity-induced friction instability at low speed is studied and presented in this paper. After performing friction tests for each material, it was concluded that the friction performance and kinetic coefficient of friction of the brake pad samples were drastically affected by longer exposure to humid air...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, {{significant}} {{requirements of}} changes in composition of brake friction materials in order for faster and more reliable transportation {{as well as their}} environmental friendly characterizations attracted attentions. However, the relation between performance and formulation/composition is not clear since friction processes are accompanied by many complex problems such as instability in the coefficient of friction, noise, vibration and wear. Creep-groan is a low frequency vibration which could originate in different part of the system (vehicle). The resulting resonant vibration in the passenger compartment causes discomfort and often leads to complaints of customers and related increase of warranty costs covered by manufacturers. In spite of relatively large amount of publications addressing the creep-groan phenomena, there is not an universal solution addressing the engineering aspects of brake/vehicle design. In addition, Relevance of wear occurring in brake materials increased particularly with relation to the released chemicals and corresponding health and environmental hazards. It is well known that humidity can considerably modify the adhesion of rubbing counterfaces by creating menisci and increasing the contact area. The chemistry, morphology and phase composition of the friction layers (third body) generated on the friction surfaces could play a determining role when amounts of adsorbed water on brake surfaces is concerned. The friction layer is typically a complex mix of numerous materials and, as a rule, contains the agglomerated or sintered nanoparticles. Hence, quantum effects could further modify the adsorption of water. This work addresses the impact of humidity on wear and <b>creep</b> <b>groan</b> of two commercial brake material types: the so called i) 2 Ì† 2 non-asbestos organic 2 Ì† 2 (NAO) and the ii) 2 Ì† 2 semi-metallic 2 Ì† 2 (SM) brake materials rubbed against pearlitic gray cast iron rotors typically used in the passenger vehicles. The friction and wear tests were performed with the Universal Mechanical Tester (UMT) manufactured by Bruker and the wear surfaces/mechanisms were studied by using of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis, and optical topography methods. The applied wear testing conditions were designed as a series of particularly designed drag tests and were performed at several different relative humidity levels ranging between 50...|$|E
40|$|Brake judder is a braking induced, forced {{vibration}} occurring {{in different types}} of vehicles. The frequency can {{be as high as}} 500 Hz, but usually remains below 100 Hz and often as low as 10 - 20 Hz. The driver experiences judder as vibrations in the steering wheel, brake pedal and floor. In the higher frequency range, the structural vibrations are accompanied by a sound. Note that a phenomenological definition (i. e {{forced vibration}}) of brake judder is used. Hence, the low frequency brake vibrations, <b>creep</b> <b>groan</b> (related to stick-slip) and dynamic groan (an instability phenomenon), are not studied in this work. The vibration starts with medium to heavy braking from high speed and remains until low speed, if the brakes are continuously applied. There is a considerable amplification of the judder vibration near certain Â“criticalÂ” vehicle speeds. This behavior has been successfully simulated by the amplitude function technique, which was developed within the project. The method is specially designed for theoretical analysis of forced vibrations like brake judder. The use of amplitude functions was also found to be valuable when analyzing measured vibrations in a braking vehicle. Brake torque variation (BTV) and brake pressure variation (BPV) are the primary excitation mechanisms for judder vibrations. While BPV causes vibrations mostly in the hydraulic system, BTV is believed to be responsible for vibrations in the vehicle structure. This work concentrates on the vibrations caused by BPV; direct effects of BPV like pedal vibrations are not studied. BTV arises mostly as a result of permanent or reversible, geometrical defects, e. g. DTV (Disc Thickness Variation) of disc brakes and shape deviations of drum brakes. DTV in turn is affected by manufacturing tolerances, disc runout, thermal coning and buckling of the disc, uneven disc wear, uneven friction film generation, uneven heating and Thermo-Elastic Instabilities (TEI). Verifying measurements were made on a street-going vehicle with strong first order DTV on one of its front brakes. The measured vibration variation during braking was predicted almost exactly by a rotor-stator model, exposed to a sinusoidal BTV with a sweeping frequency due to the finite deceleration. However, the maximal measured vibration level was seen to vary considerably compared to the predicted value. A full vehicle model, including the aerodynamic drag etc., combined with a more accurate signal analysis, was found to improve the absolute vibration level prediction, especially at low decelerations. Most of the remaining differences at low deceleration levels are believed to be caused {{by the fact that the}} relative BTV of the calculations was approximated by the measured relative BPV level. At high brake pressure levels, the relative BPV level becomes too low (less than 5 %) to admit a reliable estimation. Besides, the estimation of the correction terms due to aerodynamic drag etc. affects the theoretical vibration level. To avoid all this, one should try to measure the brake torque directly. However, measuring the BPV level is useful if one wishes to estimate the instantaneous DTV level in a braking vehicle. This is possible if a relevant pad compression model is available. It was found that a pad stiffness that increases with the brake pressure was able to explain the measured BPV level dependence on the absolute brake level. For such a pad stiffness characteristic, an increase of the DTV level (whatever reason) by 50 % might result in more than a 100 % increase in the corresponding BPV and BTV levels. Hence, a progressive pad is more sensitive to increases of the DTV level than a linear pad would be...|$|E
