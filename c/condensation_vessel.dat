40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to find an optimal process for a manually operated jacketed steam steriliser, which is mainly used in developing countries. The experiments were focussed on the steam penetration into a textile test pack and the drying procedure. The performance of the various test cycles was evaluated against the requirements in the European standards for large steam sterilisers and the validation of steam sterilisers, by measuring the temperature and pressure in the steriliser and textile test packs. The standard sterilisation process as recommended by the manufacturer of the steam steriliser did not fulfil the requirements by far and could not be considered as a proper sterilisation process. The optimum process for sterilisation of a worst case load (textile in top and bottom perforated sterilisation drums) was found to be: 20 minutes steam flushing at atmospheric pressure, three times a slow pressure build-up to 300 kPa followed by a drop to 100 kPa and finally a slow pressure build-up to the sterilisation pressure. This process has however not been proven suitable for the sterilisation of hollow medical devices. The optimum drying result was obtained by the use of an external <b>condensation</b> <b>vessel.</b> The <b>condensation</b> <b>vessel</b> also contributed to cost effective operation by it's simple design and low water consumption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article mainly {{provides}} {{a selection of}} various applications of holographic in-terferometry in heat and mass transfer research. investigations of compact heat exchangers, the cooling of electronical equipment, simultaneous heat and mass transfer, mixing processes and mass transfer in agitated <b>vessels,</b> <b>condensation</b> of steam bubbles and the supersonic hy-drogen combustion will be presented. But also other engineering fields in which this tech-nique is implemented, such as the non-destructive material testing, are described. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} deflagration code DPAC (Deflagration Pressure Analysis Code) {{has been}} upgraded {{for use in}} modeling hydrogen deflagration transients. The upgraded code is benchmarked using data from vented hydrogen deflagration tests conducted at the HYDRO-SC Test Facility at the University of Pisa. DPAC originally was written to calculate peak deflagration pressures for deflagrations in radioactive waste storage tanks and process facilities at the Savannah River Site. Upgrades include {{the addition of a}} laminar flame speed correlation for hydrogen deflagrations and a mechanistic model for turbulent flame propagation, incorporation of inertial effects during venting, and inclusion of the effect of water vapor <b>condensation</b> on <b>vessel</b> walls. In addition, DPAC has been coupled with CEA, a NASA combustion chemistry code. The deflagration tests are modeled as end-to-end deflagrations. The improved DPAC code successfully predicts both the peak pressures during the deflagration tests and the times at which the pressure peaks...|$|R
