40|$|AbstractMore {{electric}} aircraft initiative {{has led to}} Fly-By-Wire (FBW) and Power-By-Wire (PBW) technologies. PBW {{technology has}} several advantages and has potential for weight reduction and energy saving compared to conventional hydraulic system. Recent development in aviation technology have combined the electric and hydraulic system and arrived at high performance Electro Hydrostatic Actuator (EHA) system. It is a one of the PBW technology which aims at replacing the <b>centralized</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>system</b> by a local self-contained and compact actuator system. It is an emerging technology which combines the benefits of conventional hydraulic system and direct drive actuators, like the high energy efficiency, high dynamic response, high torque to mass ratio and high maintainability. EHA system was initially introduced in aircraft for flight control system. Most of the current research literatures considered the EHA system with symmetric actuator configuration. This is because, most of the aircraft application uses symmetric cylinder. However in case of industrial application, asymmetric actuators are predominantly used. An indigenous experimental setup of EHA system with asymmetric actuator has been developed with sensors and instrumentation. In this paper, the dynamic analysis, position tracking {{and control of the}} EHA system by varying the speed of drive motor has been established using a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller.

40|$|AbstractElectro-hydrostatic {{actuator}} (EHA) was {{a typical}} power-by-wire (PBW) actuator, which was widely-used in large commercial aircrafts, such as Airbus A 380. The electro-hydrostatic actuator(EHA) had the advantages of small sizes, light weight, high power density, high reliability and maintainability. With the application of EHA in large commercial airplanes, the airworthiness certification of EHA became an new problem. The precondition of the airworthiness certification of EHA was to understand its operating principle and characteristic. Because of no <b>centralized</b> <b>hydraulic</b> oil tank and short cycle oil circuit, the temperature-rise of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>system</b> in EHA always kept high during operation. Therefore, {{it was important to}} build the thermal-hydraulic models of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>system</b> in EHA, and to do the thermal analysis of the EHA by this model. In this paper, a lumped-parameter thermal-hydraulic model of the hydraulic part in EHA was proposed.

By the simulation of a practical system and the comparison with the traditional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>system,</b> the accuracy and practicality of this model was verified...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{regulation}} {{on emissions}} {{and a general}} trend towards more environmentally friendly solutions has motivated the researchers {{to look for ways}} to make mobile machinery more efficient. Excavators particularly are a remarkable source of pollution due to the vast amount and the low efficiency of these machines. Excavators are ordinarily equipped with conventional, <b>centralized</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>system,</b> where main pump supplies volumetric flow for the whole system. This flow is directed from the pump to actuators through control valves, and the returning flow is directed into the tank. Conventional hydraulic system has numerous disadvantages. Many supportive functions are required, including pressure control and load-sensing functions. Even on idle mode, there are flow losses due to continuous circulation of fluid through valves. In addition, the distance between pumps and actuators may be long, which causes pressure loss and an additional weight of long hoses filled with fluid. One proposed improvement is the use of displacement-controlled hydraulics, in which the actuator control is realized by sophisticated pump control, instead of metering the flow in directional valves. In this work, the efficiency of a modified JCB micro excavator is studied. Excavator is fitted with pressure and position sensors, and the simulation model is verified with laboratory measurements. The literature on the topic is reviewed to find the best practises concerning the studies on mobile machinery efficiency, including standardized duty cycles. The hydraulic system of the excavator is modelled in Matlab Simulink, and the simulation model is utilized to calculate the power consumption of the excavator during a digging and loading and a levelling cycle. Further simulation study is produced by replacing the conventional hydraulic system with displacement-controlled units, namely direct-driven hydraulics, or DDH’s. The same duty cycles are performed with both systems, and the results are presented. The study shows a power loss of as much as 60 % in the directional valve group. A total power consumption of the DDH system is less than 10 % of the consumption of conventional system, during two different free-space duty cycles. Subsequently, results of this study will motivate for further research and manufacturing a working prototype...|$|E
40|$|The strong {{competition}} between the leading civil aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus and new economical and ecological constraints have lead to new aircraft concepts and to a change of the aircraft architecture design. In particular the bleedless architecture of the more electrical aircraft promises new optimization potential. However, in the conventional aircraft architecture bleed air is generated by the compressor of the engines, in the more electrical aircraft architecture the lack of bleed air has to be compensated by additionally inducted air. Furthermore, when {{taking into account that}} the conventional <b>centralized</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>system</b> shall also be replaced by electrical actuators or local hydraulic units, then, more additional cooling air from the outside atmosphere has to be inducted to fulll the new additional cooling requirements of the equipment. The higher amount of required fresh and cooling air can only be provided by either additional air intakes or up-scaled air intakes. Both approaches have a crucial effect on the overall efficiency of the aircraft in particular in regard to the additional produced drag of the new or up-scaled air intakes. Even in the early design phase of the aircraft the air intake type has to be specified, and details of the geometrical design and the placement of air intakes have to be fixed. However, a design freeze is only possible when sophisticated evaluation techniques have been applied which guarantuee for certain intake types optimal positions in regard to performance and integration. Only then an efficiency benefit in comparison to conventional aircraft architecture can be obtained. Nevertheless, constraints might inhibit proposed locations, which, in fact, means taking into account performance losses on the air intake side. Therefore, further optimization potential has to be opened i. e. by using additional ow manipulating devices in combination with the chosen air intake. Thus, the main objective of the presented research work is to evaluate the potential of vortex generators for the enhancement of the efficiency of air intakes. In the presented work essential aspects of the air-intake design and the effect of vortex generators on the ow eld will be discussed. In particular constraints which lead to a decision for a NACA air-intake type and a certain combinations of vortex-generators will be explained. One goal of the work is to demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} use state of the art grid deformation techniques to improve the performance of such a complex aircraft system. Hereto, two congurations will be considered, one is a wind tunnel configuration, the other is an A 340 like DLR F 12 aircraft configuration.

40|$|A hybrid {{hydraulic}} {{actuation system}} is proposed {{as an active}} pitch link for rotorcraft applications. Such an active pitch link {{can be used to}} implement Individual Blade Control (IBC) techniques for vibration and noise reduction, in addition to providing primary control for the helicopter. Conventional technologies like electric motors and hydraulic actuators have major disadvantages when it come to applications on a rotating environment. <b>Centralized</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>system</b> require the use of mechanically complex hydraulic slip rings and electric motors have high precision mechanical moving parts that make them unattractive in application with high centrifugal load. The high energy density of smart materials can be used to design hydraulic actuators in a compact package. MagnetoRheological (MR) fluids can be used as the working fluid in such a hybrid hydraulic actuation system to implement a valving system with no moving parts. Thus, such an actuation system can be theoretically well-suited for application in a rotating environment. To develop an actuation system based on an active material stack and MR fluidic valves, a fundamental understanding of the hydraulic circuit is essential. In order to address this issue, a theoretical model was developed to understand the effect of pumping chamber geometry on the pressure losses in the pumping chamber. Three dimensional analytical models were developed for steady and unsteady flow and the results were correlated to results obtained from Computation Fluid Dynamic simulation of fluid flow inside the pumping chamber. Fundamental understanding regarding the pressure losses in a pumping chamber are obtained from the modeling process. Vortices that form in the pumping chamber (during intake) and the discharge tube (during discharge) are identified as a major cause of pressure loss in the chamber. The role of vortices during dynamic operation is also captured through a frequency domain model. Extensive experimental studies were conducted on a hybrid hydraulic system driven by a pump (actuated by a 2 " long and 1 / 4 " diameter Terfenol-D rod) and a Wheatstone bridge network of MR fluidic valves. The Wheatstone bridge network is used to provide bi-directionality to the load. Through a variety of experimental studies, the main performance metrics of the actuation system, like output power, blocked force, maximum no-load velocity and efficiency, are obtained. The actuation system exhibits a blocked force of 30 N and a maximum no-load velocity of 50 mm/s. Extensive bi-directional tests were also done for cases of no-load, inertial load and spring load to establish the frequency bandwidth of the actuator. The actuation system can output a stroke of 9 mm at an output actuator frequency of 4 Hz. An analytical model was developed to predict the performance of the hybrid hydraulic actuation system. A state space representation of the system was derived using equations derived from the control volume considerations. The results of the analytical model show that the model predicts the frequency peak of the system to within 20 Hz of the actual resonance frequency. In the third part of this dissertation, the effectiveness of the hybrid hydraulic actuation system is evaluated in a rotating environment. A piezoelectric stack that is driven by three PI- 804. 10 stacks was attached {{at the end of a}} spin bar. After balancing the spin bar using a counterweight, the spin bar is spun to an RPM of 300. This simulates a centrifugal loading of 400 g, which is slightly higher than the full-scale centrifugal loads experienced by a pitch link on a UH- 60. The performance of the actuator was measured in terms of velocity of an output cylinder shaft. Since some deterioration of performance was expected at 300 RPM, the output cylinder was redesigned to include roller bearings to support the excess force. Through no load and load tests, the effectiveness of the current hybrid actuation system design was shown as the performance of the system did not deteriorate in performance with greater centrifugal acceleration...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of aircraft in civil aviation {{has led to}} higher cruise flight altitude and Mach number. At the same time, economical and ecological requirements as well as comfort demands are increasing. This requires a new concept for the aircraft design, {{which may be the}} more electrical aircraft. In the proposed more electrical aircraft, all auxiliary systems are electric powered. This substitutes the pneumatic and hydraulic systems used in current aircrafts. The propulsion turbines of the next generation of aircraft will be designed for higher efficiency and durability. The bleed air outlets in a turbine decrease the efficiency and, by inducing vibrations on the blades, also significantly the durability of the engine. Moreover, the distribution of hydraulic fluid from the engine requires tubing throughout the aircraft, requiring fixed space and adding additional weight. Therefore, the increase in both efficiency and durability will be achieved by the electrification of the aircraft, which eliminates both bleed air and centralized hydraulic fluid distribution. In current aircraft, the bleed air is used partly to get compressed and warm air for the cabin air conditioning. In the next generation aircraft, the cabin air has to be provided by an air intake in combination with a compressor and an air conditioning system. The conventional <b>centralized</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>system</b> has to be replaced by electrical actuators or local hydraulic units. These components require also cooling air from the outside atmosphere, which has to be inducted by additional air intakes. Current civil transport aircraft commonly use NACA-type air intakes. The proposed new system design of the more electrical aircraft is characterized by the distribution of the consumers throughout the aircraft, which have to be cooled. This may require a wider variety of air intakes. Therefore a new design process including different types of air intakes has to be established. This work addresses the methods for the intake design process. One method to distinguish aerodynamic design methods is to categorize by the dimensions of the approach. One-dimensional approaches are most commonly used and combine streamline theory with empirical factors. They are used in preliminary design, as a relatively accurate estimation. In many cases, correction factors are used to extend the applicability of the method to describe the flow situation more realistically. Since empirical factors are used, the accuracy of these approaches is limited by the accuracy and portability of these factors usually obtained through experimental investigations. The objective of this work is to develop a method for preliminary air intake design. The focal point of the considerations is the intake design for supplying a compressor used in a civil transport aircraft at cruise flight condition at Mach 0. 82 and an altitude of 39000 ft. Different intake types are investigated in order to identify an optimal configuration in terms of high pressure recovery as well as for low additional drag force on the aircraft. The main objective of the design process of the air intake is to maximize the total pressure recovery from the free-stream air in order to minimize the required compressor power. The method for preliminary intake design is supposed to be one-dimensional and applicable to various intake types. The effects of varying boundary layer thickness, mass flow rate, and flight altitude are taken into account. Furthermore, parameters that specify the geometry of the air intake are evaluated with regard to optimal performance. The chosen method is implemented into a software tool, which allows the calculation of different air intakes and the comparison of those with regard to the requirements. This new calculation tool allows for prediction of intake performance in an early design stage. Dependencies between total pressure recovery, drag, and mass flow of the different intake types are investigated...|$|E
