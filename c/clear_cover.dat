25|$|All P2 {{platform}} Volvos {{received a}} minor facelift across all markets for 2005. The front fascia was redesigned, tail lamps & head lamps were changed to <b>clear</b> <b>covers,</b> the center console and dashboard received detail changes. Some minor changes were {{done to the}} electrical system and some engines, for example diesel engined models received a particle filter. A new 6-speed automatic transmission was introduced, available in both AWD and FWD configurations. Production of the second generation V70 and XC70 ended with the 2007 model year.|$|R
50|$|Through {{its ability}} to focus {{comments}} from {{a large number of}} ABBA fans into one forum, ABBAMAIL impacted parts of ABBA's music production, such as PolyGram and Universal Music re-releasing CDs in a corrected form. In 1997, all eight studio albums were remastered and re-released. Audiophiles among the fan group immediately noticed errors and problems with this mastering and discussed being disappointed by the quality of the covers. The original negatives were sourced for the cover art, resulting in the first <b>clear</b> <b>covers</b> since CDs had been released.|$|R
50|$|A {{vinyl cover}} absorbs more {{sunlight}} directly, allowing temperature to rise faster, but ultimately prevents the pool from reaching as high a temperature as a <b>clear</b> <b>cover.</b> Vinyl covers {{consist of a}} heavier material and have a longer life expectancy than bubble covers. Insulated vinyl covers are also available with {{a thin layer of}} flexible insulation sandwiched between two layers of vinyl. These covers are mandatory to be fitted to all pools in areas of Australia that have experienced drought since 2006. This is an effort to conserve water, as much water evaporates and transpires.|$|E
50|$|Previews {{and reviews}} were {{informative}} and the layout was <b>clear.</b> <b>Cover</b> featured games like NHLPA Hockey '93 and Sonic 2 were given massive six page coverage. Each review had an info panel {{to the right}} of the page which included all the game details and ratings. Ratings were given, out of ten, to graphics, sound, gameplay, game size and addiction. The overall score was given as a percentage. Sometimes a second, and third, member of staff would add their 'Not so fast...' box to the review, stating their opinion on the game. Also included in the reviews was a 'Then again..' box, which gave the reader a reminder of previously released games in the same genre.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{reinforced}} concrete structure comprising eleven spans of 15.2 metres clear or 16.6 metre {{centre to centre}} of piers. The bridge is reinforced on both faces with eleven rails, which were erected as frames and are bolted to the pier tops underneath the concrete and spliced with fishplates.The bridge has a solid deck, 6 metres wide, with circular segmental soffit and a depth at {{the centre of the}} roadway varying in each span from 3.4 to 0.51 metres. The roadway camber is 0.13 metres and there is an integral kerb at each side. The reinforcement consists of railway rails 92mm deep, with 82.6 metre long lower flanges. There are thirteen such rails running longitudinally in each face at 610mm centre, with <b>clear</b> <b>cover</b> of about 170mm. The top and bottom rails are formed into eleven frames, each bolted to the pier top. The top member is continuous over the length of the bridge, achieved by fishplated connections.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many new}} wargame {{companies}} in the early '70s, early SPI games left {{a lot to be}} desired physically. A typical early game came in an envelope with a one-color map and one large folded sheet for the rules. However, SPI quickly set about improving the physical quality of the components with better printing and boxes under the guidance of Art Director Redmond A. Simonsen. In 1973, they introduced a flat plastic box that was molded to be a counter storage tray with a <b>clear</b> <b>cover.</b> The actual cover of the game was a printed sheet that backed the clear plastic. This allowed SPI to produce the boxes in bulk, as they were identical for each game, the printed sheet provided the cover and could be printed with all the other components of the game. This system became the hallmark of SPI games, and was later emulated by Simulations Canada, whose early games utilized a smaller storage tray, with the cover of the rules booklet doubling as the cover sheet.|$|E
5000|$|The {{optional}} 6x CD-ROM {{was implemented}} using a sleep-swappable module system {{similar to the}} one pioneered by the PowerBook 5300; other modules included a Zip drive and the standard 1.4 MB floppy (an 8x CD-ROM would eventually become standard on the 133 MHz model). A pioneering feature of the 1400 was the [...] "BookCover" [...] laptop skin which allowed owners the opportunity to give their PowerBook a customized look. Every 1400 shipped with a gray cover, a <b>clear</b> <b>cover,</b> and six inserts; a ClarisWorks template was also included as an [...] "extra" [...] on the system restore CD, from which users could design their own BookCover. The 1400 was easily upgradeable. System memory modules could be [...] "piggy-backed" [...] onto each other (another feature unique to the 1400), allowing the use of additional RAM. The CPU was located on a removable daughter card, which could be replaced with one containing a faster processor, including a number of commercially available cards with PowerPC G3 processors from vendors such as Sonnet Technologies, NewerTech, and Vimage. Aside from its two PC Card slots, the 1400 also included an internal expansion slot. Although few applications were ever developed to utilize it, Apple did release their own branded video card which included an increased amount of VRAM and an external video port. Other devices included a third-party video card, as well as a relatively rare Ethernet networking card.|$|E

30|$|A <b>clear</b> <b>cover</b> {{at the top}} {{and bottom}} of the beam was 20  mm, whereas a <b>clear</b> <b>cover</b> of 15  mm was {{maintained}} on the beam’s vertical sides. All specimens had two circular openings, one in each shear span, that were placed symmetrically about the mid-point of the beam (Fig.  1). The opening size was 140  mm, which corresponded to opening height-to-effective depth ratio of 0.5. The beams were cast in a horizontal position using plywood molds.|$|E
40|$|Infrared thermographic {{technique}} is investigated numerically and experimentally to identify reinforcing steel in concrete members. Other non-destructive techniques, {{such as the}} ultrasonic technique, are subject to errors due to large scatter in sound wave propagation velocity for the different components of concrete. Since thermal conductivity and heat capacity are less influenced by the composite nature of concrete, thermography remains a promising alternative. A finite element based numerical analysis demonstrated the feasibility of thermography as an evaluation technique for reinforcement in concrete. Based on the understanding developed from the numerical simulations, experimental tests were conducted in 10 concrete specimens containing bars of various sizes and <b>clear</b> <b>cover.</b> The temperature measurements with infrared probes {{on the surface of}} the specimens clearly identified the bars up to one inch <b>clear</b> <b>cover.</b> More refined processing and imaging technique are needed to identify bars at larger depth...|$|E

5000|$|As {{is typical}} of an ancient Chinese text, the {{organization}} of the Guanzi has been altered over time, both the chronology and significance of which isn't all that <b>clear.</b> <b>Covering</b> a wide variety of subjects, ranging from detailed economic discussions to overviews of local soil topography, many chapters include Confucian values as a necessity for the state, expressing a blend a blend of what may be considered Legalistic, Confucian, and Daoistic philosophy that has been termed [...] "Huang-Lao". The first reference to the collection appears in the more Taostic Huainanzi, of the early Han dynasty, and Han bibliographies listed the text as Taoist. For example, the Nèiyè (內業 [...] "Inner Enterprise/Training") chapter has some of the oldest recorded descriptions of Daoist meditation techniques.|$|R
30|$|It was {{demonstrated}} that the damaged areas of the bare concrete decks on the validation bridge mostly coincided with the areas that had clear covers that were less than the design value (90  mm). The corrosion potentials measured on the five selected locations of the validation bridge showed that the rebar beneath a reduced <b>clear</b> <b>cover</b> depth had a higher chance of corrosion activity. Generally, corroded rebars in concrete will result in micro-cracking around the rebar, which further accelerates {{the deterioration of the}} concrete by other factors such as freezing and thawing.|$|E
