500|$|The Witham's {{course is}} one of the strangest of British rivers, the result of {{glaciation}} (and possibly isostatic rebound) redirecting older rivers. The source of the river is on high ground near South Witham, Lincolnshire, from whence it flows generally north, very close to and almost parallel with the Trent around the outskirts of Newark, before turning east towards Lincoln. [...] The upper waters are important for agricultural water extraction, and for coarse fish such as roach, <b>common</b> <b>bream</b> and pike; small mammals like water voles, and native crayfish. A gap in the limestone scarp (see Lincolnshire Wolds) near Ancaster may represent an earlier, straighter course of the river towards Boston, a proto-River Slea.|$|E

50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>bream</b> {{lives in}} schools near the bottom. At night <b>common</b> <b>bream</b> can feed {{close to the}} shore and in clear waters with sandy bottoms feeding pits can be seen during daytime. The fish's protractile mouth helps it dig for chironomid larvae, Tubifex worms, bivalves, and gastropods. The bream eats water plants and plankton, as well.|$|E

Among the most famous dishes is the seafood changurro. Among the meats are: the beef steaks, pork loin with milk, fig leaf quail, marinated goose, etc.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>bream</b> {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the silver or white bream (Blicca bjoerkna), in particular at the younger stages (see picture). The most reliable method of distinguishing these species is by counting the scales in a straight line downwards from the first ray of the dorsal fin to the lateral line. Silver bream have fewer than 10 rows of scales, while <b>common</b> <b>bream</b> have 11 or more. At the adult stage the reddish tint of the pectoral fin of the silver bream is diagnostic. Like other Cyprinidae, <b>common</b> <b>bream</b> can easily hybridise with other species, and hybrids with roach (Rutilus rutilus) can be very difficult to distinguish from pure-bred bream.|$|E

40|$|Natural hybrids of leuciscine {{cyprinids}} {{were investigated}} in a medium-sized submontane reservoir (49 ° 52 'N, 20 ° 03 'E, altitude 270 m) in the Carpathian {{part of the}} Vistula basin. The material included 380 hybrid specimens (TL: 24. 0 – 39. 8 cm, SL: 19. 0 – 31. 7 cm, W: 134 – 714 g) collected in 2006 – 2013. To detect their ancestry, genotypes of the 327 putative hybrids were compared to reference genotypes of 85 roaches, 115 <b>common</b> <b>breams,</b> 18 rudds, and 99 silver breams. Individuals were typed in 15 polymorphic microsatellite loci (Dubut et al. 2009), while species specific amplification of a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was used to detect maternal origin of hybrids (Wyatt et al. 2006). Few individuals with traces of rudd and silver bream ancestry {{were excluded from the}} study. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA suggests bias towards bream maternal origin, with only 22 individuals (6, 7 %) with roach mitochondrial DNA. The analyzed set of hybrids was composed mostly of first generation bream × roach hybrids. Only 7 individuals (2, 1 %) showed a sign of backcrossing to bream, however, this finding has to be confirmed by analysis of further loci as it might result from presence of null alleles in roach. F 2 generation hybrids were not detected. Biometric investigation of collected specimens comprised of selected morphometric (body height, and lengths of head, trunk, and tail) and meristic characters (counts of scales in lateral line and soft rays in anal fin) of individuals of different maternal origin. As all the analyzed differences between these categories of specimens appeared insignificant, the investigated population of hybrids may be regarded morphologically uniform...|$|R
50|$|Lake Onega {{features}} a large variety {{of fish and}} water invertebrates, including relicts of the glacial period such as lamprey. There are about 47 fish species from 13 families; they include sturgeon, landlocked salmon, brown trout, European smelt, grayling, roaches, Crucian carp, whitefishes, char, pike, European cisco, <b>common</b> dace, silver <b>bream,</b> carp bream, sabre carp, spined loach, wels catfish, European eel, rudd, ide, gudgeon, pike-perch, European perch, ruffe and burbot.|$|R
5000|$|In very turbid waters, <b>common</b> <b>bream</b> {{can occur}} in large numbers, which {{may result in a}} {{shortage}} of bottom-living prey such as chironomids. The bream are then forced to live by filter feeding with their gill rakers, Daphnia water fleas being the main prey. As the fish grows, the gill rakers become too far apart to catch small prey and the bream will not then grow bigger than 40 cm. If a <b>common</b> <b>bream</b> is malnourished, it can develop a so-called [...] "knife back", a sharp edge along its back.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>bream</b> {{generally}} {{lives in}} rivers (especially {{in the lower}} reaches) and in nutrient-rich lakes and ponds with muddy bottoms and plenty of algae. It {{can also be found}} in brackish sea waters.|$|E

40|$|This study {{highlights}} {{the analysis of}} the morphological and genetic variation of the <b>common</b> sea <b>bream</b> Pagrus pagrus, and compares its two main areas of concentration: the northern (35 ºS - 38 ºS) and the southern areas (39 ºS - 41 ºS) of the Buenos Aires coast of the Argentine Sea. Body shape characterization presented two significantly different morphotypes (Wilks' Lambda= 0. 224, P< 0. 001). Northern individuals displayed a higher middle area while southern ones were smaller and their caudal peduncle was shorter. The northern and southern areas did not yield significant genetic differences either with the control region or the microsatellite loci, revealing that P. pagrus is not genetically structured. However, individuals from these areas should not be managed as a single group since they display distinct life history traits, responsible for morphological differentiation. The presence of two spawning areas with distinctive characteristics would define two stocks of P. pagrus from the Buenos Aires coast...|$|R
50|$|This 175-hectare wetland, {{comprising}} grasses, {{salt marsh}} and sedges, is fed mainly by water from Laverton Creek, which originates in Truganina. Truganina Swamp provides habitats for two endangered species - the Altona skipper butterfly, which feeds on chaffy saw sedge, and the orange-bellied parrot, which feeds on beaded glasswort and scrubland species of glasswort. The wetland {{is an important}} habitat for migratory wading birds such as pelicans, greenshanks, royal spoonbills and birds from as far as Siberia. It also supports many fish, such as black <b>bream,</b> <b>common</b> galaxias, short-finned eel, flat-headed gudgeon, Tamar River goby, small-mouthed hardyhead, goldfish, yellow-eyed mullet and mosquito fish.|$|R
5000|$|Bream ( [...] ) is {{a general}} term for a species of {{freshwater}} and marine fish belonging {{to a variety of}} genera including Abramis (e.g., A. brama, the <b>common</b> <b>bream),</b> Acanthopagrus, Argyrops, Blicca, Brama, Chilotilapia, Etelis, Lepomis, Gymnocranius, Lethrinus, Nemipterus, Pharyngochromis, Rhabdosargus or Scolopsis.|$|E

50|$|The area of Kizhi island {{differs from}} most of other parts of Onega Lake. It is {{characterized}} by numerous small islands, which reduce the water flow, and relatively shallow and uneven lake bottom. Whereas the average depth of the lake is 31 meters, the depth is about 2-3 meters in the Kizhi and only in some places reaches 16-20 meters. Because of the weak flows and shallow depth, water is relatively warm and quiet that promotes growth of aquatic vegetation. Fish types include roach, some gobies, crucian carp, sabre carp, perch, ruffe, pike, <b>common</b> dace, silver <b>bream,</b> ide, gudgeon, carp bream, spined loach, European smelt, char, pike-perch, rudd and burbot.|$|R

Native mammals include swamp wallabies, grey-headed flying foxes, common brushtail possums, common ringtail possums, water rats, echidnas, and platypus {{in the upper}} reaches of the river. Native reptile species include eastern brown snakes, tiger snakes, skinks, and common snakeneck turtles. Native birds include the eastern whipbird, cockatoo, rainbow lorikeet, galah, brown falcon, peregrine falcon, square-tailed kite, royal spoonbill, black swan, Pacific black duck, little pied cormorant, moorhen, and long-billed corella. There are various native frogs and native fish species include the short-finned eel, tupong, short-headed lamprey, Australian grayling, southern black <b>bream,</b> <b>common</b> galaxias, broad-finned galaxias and spotted galaxias.

40|$|A recent {{threat to}} European fish {{diversity}} {{was attributed to}} the association between an intracellular parasite, Sphaerothecum destruens, and a healthy freshwater fish carrier, the invasive Pseudorasbora parva originating from China. The pathogen {{was found to be}} responsible for the decline and local extinction of the European endangered cyprinid Leucaspius delineatus and high mortalities in stocks of Chinook and Atlantic salmon in the USA. Here, we show that the emerging S. destruens is also a threat to a wider range of freshwater fish than originally suspected such as <b>bream,</b> <b>common</b> carp, and roach. This is a true generalist as an analysis of susceptible hosts shows that S. destruens is not limited to a phylogenetically narrow host spectrum. This disease agent is a threat to fish biodiversity as it can amplify within multiple hosts and cause high mortalities...|$|R
