40|$|Gear {{shifting}} {{strategy of}} vehicle is important {{aid for the}} acquisition of dynamic performance and high economy. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is used to optimize the gear shifting schedule for off-road vehicle by using an objective function that weighs fuel use and trip time. The optimization is accomplished through discrete dynamic programming and a trade-off between trip time and fuel consumption is analyzed. By using concave and <b>convex</b> surface <b>road</b> as road profile, an optimal gear shifting strategy is used to control the longitudinal behavior of the vehicle. Simulation {{results show that the}} trip time can be reduced by powerful gear shifting strategy and fuel consumption can achieve high economy with economical gear shifting strategy in different initial conditions and route cases...|$|R

A distributed estimation approach based on opinion dynamics is proposed to enhance the reliability of vehicle corners’ velocity estimates, which are obtained by an unscented Kalman filter. The corners’ estimates from a Kalman observer, which is formed by integrating the model-based and kinematic-based velocity estimation approaches, are utilized as opinions with different levels {{of confidence in the}} developed algorithm. More reliable estimates robust to disturbances and time delay are achieved via solving a <b>convex</b> optimization problem. <b>Road</b> tests confirm the robustness of the methods independent of the powertrain configuration on surfaces with various friction conditions in pure and combined-slip maneuvers, which are arduous for the current vehicle state estimators.

50|$|The {{range of}} {{visibility}} {{of which is}} the de facto ACDA, is usually that distance before which an ordinary person can see small hazards—such as a traffic cone or buoy—with 20/20 vision. This distance may be attenuated by specific conditions such as atmospheric opacity, blinding glare, darkness, road design, and adjacent environmental hazards including civil and recreational activities, horse-drawn vehicle, ridden animal, livestock, deer, crossing traffic, and parked cars. The ACDA may also be somewhat attenuated on roads with lower functional classification.This is because the probability of spontaneous traffic increases proportionally to the density of road access points, and this density reduces the distance a person exercising ordinary care can be assured that a road will be clear; such reduction in the ACDA is readily apparent from the conditions, even when a specific access point or the traffic thereon is not. Furthermore, even though a through-driver may typically presume all traffic will stay assuredly clear when required by law, such driver may not take such presumption when circumstances provide actual knowledge under ordinary care that such traffic cannot obey the law. During times of darkness, one can see ahead about 250 feet with low beams, and about 350-500 feet with high beams. This clear distance corresponds to a maximum safe speed of 52 mph and 65-81 mph respectively on dry pavement with good tires, which is attenuated further by <b>convex</b> and lateral <b>road</b> curvature; safe speed is always dynamic.|$|R
