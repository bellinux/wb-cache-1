5|$|To {{transform}} a probabilistically checkable proof system {{of this type}} into a clique problem, one forms a graph with a vertex for each possible accepting run of the proof <b>checker.</b> That is, a vertex is defined {{by one of the}} possible random choices of sets of positions to examine, and by bit values for those positions that would cause the <b>checker</b> to accept the proof. Two vertices are adjacent, in this graph, if the corresponding two accepting runs see the same bit values at every position they both examine. Each (valid or invalid) proof string corresponds to a clique, the set of accepting runs that see that proof string, and all maximal cliques arise in this way. One of these cliques is large if and only if it corresponds to a proof string that many proof checkers accept. If the original satisfiability instance is satisfiable, it will have a valid proof string, one that is accepted by all runs of the <b>checker,</b> and this string will correspond to a large clique in the graph. However, if the original instance is not satisfiable, then all proof strings are invalid, each proof string has {{only a small number of}} <b>checker</b> runs that mistakenly accept it, and all cliques are small. Therefore, if one could distinguish in polynomial time between graphs that have large cliques and graphs in which all cliques are small, or if one could accurately approximate the clique problem, then applying this approximation to the graphs generated from satisfiability instances would allow satisfiable instances to be distinguished from unsatisfiable instances. However, this is not possible unless P=NP.|$|E

5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability results is {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof {{if and only if}} it is satisfiable. The proof is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the <b>checker</b> will either accept or reject the proof, without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the <b>checker</b> will accept it must be low.|$|E
5|$|According to {{literary}} critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé's story include Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon and the 1950 American film Destination Moon. Hergé was certainly {{inspired by a}} number of photographic stills from the Destination Moon film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first computer to be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white <b>checker</b> pattern on Hergé's rocket was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon's 1947 book German Research in World War II. He commissioned the construction of a model rocket with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a moon rocket might look like. He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.|$|E

5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Montpelier {{came under the}} control of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels were reduced further, down to two booking clerks, four porters, a <b>checker</b> and a weighbridge operator by 1950. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. The goods yard at Montpelier closed on 18 November 1965, with the signal box following on 10 May 1967. Staff were completely withdrawn on 17 July 1967 with tickets issued by the train guard. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the northern track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the southern platform. The former goods yard is now a small industrial estate. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E

(This {{specialization}} {{is frequently}} combined {{with that of}} the Stockmaker) Uses <b>checkering</b> tools to create an ornate pattern of small raised diamonds in the wood surfaces which are to be gripped. The <b>checkering</b> tools are in effect tiny saws, designed to leave a v-shaped groove (of approximately 60 to 90 degrees) in the surface of the wooden gunstock. Special <b>checkering</b> tools consisting of two saw blades in parallel are used to set the spacing (between 16 and 24 lines per inch). The area to be <b>checkered</b> is covered by one set of such grooves parallel to each other. A second set of parallel grooves is then executed across the first set, at approximately a 30-degree angle, leaving the area covered with small, pointed diamonds. The edges of the <b>checkered</b> area are frequently ornamented with simple bas-relief wood carving, frequently variations on the fleur-de-lis.|$|R
25|$|Although {{most species}} of <b>checkered</b> beetles are predaceous in nature, some are {{scavengers}} {{and others have}} been found feeding on flower pollen. Because of the <b>checkered</b> beetles predaceous nature and insatiable appetite, they are often key players in the biological control of other insects. The <b>checkered</b> beetles have also developed a unique adaptation to aid in their quest for prey. The beetles use pheromones to help them locate, kill, and consume their prey.|$|R
