5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Anita Shapira, {{there is}} a gap, at times quite wide, between the 'facts established by historical research' {{and the image of}} the battle as retained in <b>collective</b> <b>memory.</b> This is certainly the case for the battle of Latrun, which has become, in Israel, a founding myth.|$|E

Public opinion has resulted in alternatives put forward to preserve the clock tower, including moving the proposed six-lane road or relocating the clock tower {{to the front of the}} new pier as a memorial.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses (West) Germany as an {{exemplary}} case to analyse {{the formation of}} <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> {{over a period of}} more than two decades after 1945. It traces the formation of <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> in the German public through a decade of collective amnesia, followed by a period of regaining <b>collective</b> <b>memories.</b> It argues that the formation of <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> is embedded in social and normative change, and identifies three causal factors that were responsible for the oscillation between amnesia and memory: the absence of victims in the imminent post-war period, that promoted the myth of innocence (Fulbrook 1999); a series of major trials that started in the 1960 s; and young elites who acknowledged moral and legal guilt and supported the trials, reconciliation and compensation.

40|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>memories</b> of the {{historical}} past allow group members {{to make sense of}} their sharedpast but also to project themselves in the present and future. In this line, <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> ofcolonialism may present consequences for present day intergroup relations and acculturationdynamics, given that they allow processes of meaning making and social positioning whendifferent groups with a shared colonial past interact. Indeed, previous research has shown thatcollective memories are associated with processes of reconciliation, victimization, and groupbasedemotions, among others, but, to our knowledge, little research has paid attention to theconnections between <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> of colonialism and acculturation dynamics amonggroups with a past of colonization. The present study aimed to analyze <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> ofcolonialism and acculturation experiences among Congolese immigrants living in Belgium. 43 semi-structured interviews with Congolese participants were content analyzed, using ananalytical framework along the two variables of interest. We were able to map distinct aspectsof the <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> of colonialism that Congolese immigrants in Belgium have, as well astheir experiences of acculturation in Belgium. Our results suggest that individuals remembertheir ingroup’s past in accordance with their current social identifications and relationshipswithin a given society. The results are discussed in light of their consequences for present dayintergroup relations between host and immigrant communities in Belgium. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and <b>collective</b> <b>memory</b> {{point out}} that during the exodus of Palestinian Arab {{population}} of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened {{could be seen as}} ethnic cleansing. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, {{so as not to be}} used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on village land.|$|E
5|$|Such events {{implanted}} in the Polish <b>collective</b> <b>memory</b> the image of Jewish crowds greeting the invading Red Army as liberators, and willing collaborators, further strengthening Żydokomuna sentiment that held Jews responsible for collaboration with the Soviet authorities in importing communism into divided Poland. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, widespread notion of Judeo-Communism, combined with the German Nazi encouragement for expression of antisemitic attitudes, {{may have been a}} principal cause of massacres of Jews by gentile Poles in Poland's northeastern Łomża province in the summer of 1941, including the massacre at Jedwabne according to Joanna B. Michlic. However, the responsibility of the gentile Poles for the Jedwabne pogrom has been highly disputed, with some sources stating that the Germans were the principal authors of the massacre.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their <b>collective</b> <b>memory.</b> On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E

40|$|The {{school is}} {{an agent of}} {{socialisation}} in which coexists a plurality of <b>collective</b> <b>memories.</b> The curriculum ensures the transmission of official <b>memory.</b> However, alternative <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> might also be discussed by students and teachers. This leads to a competition of memories. More specifically, this observation may be made regarding the transmission of the Holocaust in Belgium. This emotional historical fact, classically taught according to the official curriculum, is nevertheless sometimes questioned. This is for example the case for non-Belgian students, who consider other possible memories and want to discuss about these. In order to analyze this possible competition between <b>collective</b> <b>memories,</b> we explored the speeches of young from multiple national origins {{in relation to the}} topic of the Holocaust. Two focus groups, differing {{on the basis of the}} national origin of the participants, were conducted with young students aged form sixteen to eighteen.

40|$|Belgium has {{a long-standing}} history of {{conflicts}} between Flemings and French speakers. We posit that {{the content of}} the <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> associated with each group are organized around two objective dimensions: (1) linguistic policy and (2) financial and political autonomy. A model is proposed that predicts that different justice principles will be applied by each community regarding the distribution of specific resources depending upon which dimension of the conflict is salient and their group membership. Respect or violation of these principles predicts stereotype content. <b>Collective</b> <b>memories</b> can be used to justify the in-group’s justice principles and to present such stereotypes as anchored in the past. We conclude by drawing general implications of the model {{for the study of the}} role <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> play in intergroup conflicts...|$|R
5|$|Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs. Mostly megalithic, the {{earliest}} instances date {{to within a}} few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the Iberian peninsula have been dated through thermoluminescence to c. 4510BCE, and some burials at the Carnac stones in Brittany also {{date back to the}} fifth millennium BCE. The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from {{the earliest}}, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of <b>collective</b> <b>memory,</b> and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of ancestor-worship, a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.|$|E
5|$|For {{the events}} {{surrounding}} 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, {{a history of the}} Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished {{in the last two decades}} of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the <b>collective</b> <b>memory.</b> Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.|$|E
5|$|The decisive {{victory of}} the Ethiopian Empire over the Kingdom of Italy in the 1896 Battle of Adwa, during the First Italo-Ethiopian War, made a {{profound}} impact on the historiography of Italy and Ethiopia. It was not lost to the <b>collective</b> <b>memory</b> of Italians, since the Italian capture of Adwa, Tigray Region, Ethiopia in 1935, during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, was hailed as an act that avenged their previous humiliation and defeat. Historiography about Ethiopia throughout much of the 20th century focused primarily on this second invasion and the Abyssinian Crisis that preceded it, in which Ethiopia was depicted as being relegated to the role of a pawn in European diplomacy. The Ethiopian courtier (i.e. blatta) and historian Marse Hazan Walda Qirqos (1899–1978) was commissioned by the Selassie regime to compile a documentary history of the Italian occupation entitled A Short History of the Five Years of Hardship, composed concurrently with the submission of historical evidence to the United Nations War Crimes Commission for Fascist Italy's war crimes. Coauthored by Berhanu Denque, this work {{was one of the first}} vernacular Amharic histories to cover the Italian colonial period, documenting contemporary newspaper articles and propaganda pieces, events such as the 1936 fall of Addis Ababa and the 1941 British-Ethiopian reconquest of the country, and speeches by key figures such as Emperor Selassie and Rodolfo Graziani (1882–1955), Viceroy of Italian East Africa.|$|E

40|$|Bonegilla was Australia’s largest post-war migrant {{reception}} and training centre. Its {{history and the}} histories of the approximately 320, 000 ex-residents began to reemerge in Australian public life from the 1980 s. In this thesis, I analyse cultural or <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> as located and publicly mediated in the materiality of public history forms, in the shared resources of individuals. Accordingly, this thesis is structured around those separate public history forms that have coalesced around Bonegilla since the 1980 s: anniversary reunions; museum exhibitions; heritage discourses, listings and heritage tourist ventures; and popular culture such as journalism, film and television. I argue that Bonegilla’s <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> have become increasingly multi-vocal, contrary to the predictions of some scholars analysing commemorative practice in Australia. Further, I maintain that public histories create spaces for the vernacular exchange of <b>collective</b> <b>memories,</b> and my study of Bonegilla strongly supports this contention. While state involvement in some public history practices promotes a positivist, revisionist version of multiculturalism and Bonegilla’s role in it, there are still participants in and receivers of these narratives, many of whom draw on available frameworks to attribute wider meaning to their histories. I agree that representational analyses are useful in uncovering the power plays that function in public histories, but the use-value of these public histories to receivers and respondents also requires scholarly attention. Ex-residents and ex-residents’ associations, their families and the second-generation, connected ethnic organisations, local councils, and multicultural lobby groups have all been involved in Bonegilla’s public history. They have been implicated in the memory-making process and in the formation and function of Bonegilla’s <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> since the 1980 s. They have proven capable of appropriating and adding to Bonegilla’s multi-vocality, even as some of its public history is framed by the official.

25|$|In the {{simplest}} terms, <b>collective</b> <b>memory</b> {{can be understood}} as the memory of a group of people, and is usually associated with the passing of that memory from generation to generation. However, there are many nuances to this idea; it must also be considered in terms of the processes of remembering and forgetting events. Thus, when a typical emotional event is socially shared and propagates to perhaps 50 other people, that event becomes a <b>collective</b> <b>memory</b> for that group or community of people. When the emotional event is particularly intense, the event would be expected to undergo an even larger diffusion. Furthermore, the more intense the emotional event is, the more rapid the diffusion should be and should reach more people in a shorter amount of time. This is especially true for events that are shared via mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, internet, etc. In this case, the <b>collective</b> <b>memory</b> is no longer confined to a local population, but instead can become that of a regional, national, or even international population. Besides the propagation of a single person’s emotional event, many people can simultaneously experience a single national emotional event, such as the disappearing of an important person. Such an event also becomes part of a collectively shared memory. However, {{it must be noted that}} each person still has their own personal memory of the event, such as where they were when they experienced the event, what they were doing, etc.|$|E

40|$|After {{publication}} of Adam Hochschild's King Leopold's Ghost in 1998, asserting that King Leopold II had {{been responsible for}} a "holocaust" in the Congo and the heated public debate this provoked, {{we set out to}} study Belgian people's reactions to these accusations. In two studies we compared <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> of and emotions associated with Belgium's colonial action in the Congo in different generations. Results show higher levels of collective guilt and support for reparative actions among young adults than among older generations. This difference can be explained either by referring to the different ideological backgrounds in which different generations were socialized, as evidenced by stark differences in <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> of colonialism, or by referring to the influence of national identification. Indeed, people could adapt their representations of colonialism in order to avoid experiencing a social identity threat. However, evidence for the identity-protecting functions of <b>collective</b> <b>memories</b> and <b>collective</b> emotions was only found in the older generations: young people held negative representations of colonialism independently of their level of national identification. We refer to the normative dimension of collective guilt to interpret these results. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
