5|$|The System Has Failed is {{the tenth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth. Released on September 14, 2004, {{it was the}} band's second and final studio album {{distributed}} by Sanctuary Records. The System Has Failed was the first album released after Mustaine recovered from his arm injury sustained in 2002 which prevented him from playing guitar. It is also {{the first of three}} Megadeth records not to include original bassist and co-founder David Ellefson. Instead, the album features session players, including former Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland on lead guitar. However, Poland only provided lead guitar parts and solos on a contractual basis and did not rejoin the band. To date, it is the only Megadeth album where the only <b>certified</b> <b>member</b> of the band was the sole Mustaine.|$|E
