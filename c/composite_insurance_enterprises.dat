40|$|This {{research}} study involves a comparative analysis of marketing life insurance in the UK. The main objectives {{of this study}} are: (1) to investigate the attitudes of marketing managers of the large and the small life and <b>composite</b> <b>insurance</b> companies towards marketing life insurance; (2) to investigate the variables which influence life insurance purchasing behaviour; and (3) to conduct a comparative analysis of the attitudes of marketing managers, the insured and the non-insured towards the variables under investigation. The design {{of this study is}} by facets. The facet approach helped to compile three sets of questionnaires which were addressed to (a) the insured, (b) the non-insured, and (c) marketing managers of life and <b>composite</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. The data collected consists of both attitudinal and categorical variables. The analytical techniques used to analyse the attitudinal data include: Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MINISSA Programme), Discriminant Analysis, and Spearman RankOrder Correlation Coefficients. As for the categorical data the Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA) is employed in the analysis. Furthermore, Wilcoxon Test and F-Test are used for testing the research hypotheses. Briefly, the research findings suggest that (1) marketing managers of life and <b>composite</b> <b>insurance</b> companies give priority to strategic marketing, direct response marketing, and marketing effectiveness variables and then concern themselves with customer services, competition, economic and sales problems; (2) both the insured and the non-insured attach more importance to saving through other financial institutions than life and <b>composite</b> <b>insurance</b> companies; (3) the insured regard "colleagues/friends", "TV advertising", and "ads in newspapers and magazines" as the main sources of information in keeping them informed and encouraging them to purchase life insurance; (4) both the insured and the non-insured regard "standard of service", "contact by the agent", and "quality of staff" as the most important factors in influencing their purchasing decisions; and (5) both the insured and the non-insured regard "providing for children's education" and "return on investment" as the main reasons for saving through life and <b>composite</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. A comparative analysis of the attitudes of marketing managers, the insured, and the non-insured suggests that marketing managers will need to put more emphasis on "retirement income", and "mortgage repayment plans" in their marketing campaigns; more emphasis should also be placed on the "quality of staff", and "standard of service". Finally, an analysis of the effects of socioeconomic and demographic variables on life insurance purchasing behaviour suggests that selected predictors (i. e., marital status, family life cycle, family size, age, education, occupation and income) when tested together explain {{a significant portion of the}} variance of the dependent variable...|$|R

5000|$|The Royal Exchange Assurance {{emerged from}} a joint stock <b>{{insurance}}</b> <b>enterprise</b> known as Onslow's insurance or Onslow's Bubble. This had been begun as the Mercer's Hall Marine Company, or Undertaking kept at the Royal Exchange for insuring ships and merchandise at sea. A similar enterprise sought incorporation in 1718, but the Attorney-General reported against this. Lord Onslow then sought a means of avoiding the difficulty by his company acquiring the charters of Society of Mines Royal and Company of Mineral and Battery Works, which declared itself open for assuring ships and merchandise in March 1719. Their opponents petitioned against this and the Attorney-General reported in May 1719 that the use made of the charters was [...] "unwarrantable". The directors admitted this mistake but requested their own charter in January 1720. They and another <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprise</b> each offered £300,000 towards the king's Civil List debts. The king then encouraged the House of Commons to permit their incorporation. This {{was done in the}} Bubble Act. The new chartered company then accepted subscriptions paid on shares in the old company in payment for those on its own shares.|$|R

50|$|Many {{scholars}} and practitioners suggest an integrated package of services ('a credit-plus' approach) {{rather than just}} providing credits. When access to credit is combined with savings facilities, non-productive loan facilities, <b>insurance,</b> <b>enterprise</b> development (production-oriented and management training, marketing support) and welfare-related services (literacy and health services, gender and social awareness training), the adverse effects discussed above can be diminished. Some argue that more experienced entrepreneurs who are getting loans should be qualified for bigger loans to ensure {{the success of the}} program.|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} risk-based capital {{requirements}} {{and the potential}} expansion {{of the role of}} the Appointed Actu-ary demand expertise in evaluating the financial stability of <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Because of the growth of property/casualty loss reserves and the wide fluctuations in interest rates during the past two decades, asset-liability management is of increasing importance for ca-sualty actuaries. The American Academy of Actuaries task force on risk-based capital has provided the NAIC with a pro-posed “interest rate risk charge ” for its risk-based cap-ital formula. This paper reviews the theoretical devel-opment of an interest rate risk charge as well as its practical application for setting capital requirements. Interest rate risk is the potentially adverse effect of a shift in market interest rates on the net worth of the <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprise.</b> For statutory risk-based capital re-quirements, interest rate risk depends on (i) the relative payment patterns of assets and liabilities, (ii) the statu-tory valuation rate for the assets, and (iii) the statutory valuation rate for the liabilities. The paper also discusses the effects of numerous exter-nal factors—such as changes in market interest rates or changes in statutory valuation rates—on the magnitude of the interest rate risk, as well as several unresolved issues, such as the proper allocation of assets to cover loss liabilities. It concludes with an example illustrat-ing the computation of an interest rate risk capital charge...|$|R
