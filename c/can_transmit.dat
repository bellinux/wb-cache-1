40|$|Estimate {{the maximum}} number C of bits of {{information}} that <b>can</b> be <b>transmitted</b> per second in a communications channel of bandwidth B, meaning that this channel acts as a low-pass filter with cutoff frequency B. 2 Solution The solution proceeds by taking the channel capacity C to be the product of {{the maximum number}} of pulses per second that <b>can</b> be <b>transmitted</b> times the maximum amount of information that can be encoded onto a single pulse. 2. 1 Maximum Number of Pulses per Second A simple model of a pulse is that it is one-half period of a sine wave. The shortest period wave that <b>can</b> be <b>transmitted</b> down a channel of bandwidth B is 1 /B. Hence, the shortest pulse that <b>can</b> be <b>transmitted</b> has period 1 / 2 B, and the maximum number of (distinct) pulses per second that <b>can</b> be <b>transmitted</b> is The estimate (1) is sometimes called Nyquistâ€™s theorem [1]. 2. 2 Maximum Information per Pulse Npulse = 2 B.

5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas <b>can</b> <b>transmit</b> Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The chigoe flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.|$|E
5|$|The USB 3.1 Type-C {{connector}} is {{an emerging}} standard which has replaced legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors <b>can</b> <b>transmit</b> DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters which perform active conversion from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification {{was published in}} 2015. USB Type-C chipsets {{are not required to}} include Dual-mode trasnmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters would not work with Type-C sources.|$|E
5|$|A {{helmet-mounted sight}} (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link <b>can</b> <b>transmit</b> target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centres, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved situation awareness.|$|E

5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks <b>can</b> <b>transmit</b> pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell <b>can</b> <b>transmit</b> virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
