40|$|AbstractThis study compares two {{different}} impregnating methods {{to investigate the}} influence of <b>carbonization</b> <b>rate</b> on the tribological properties of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} bulk density, hardness, infiltration efficiency and friction coefficient of pressure impregnating specimens are higher than those of vacuum impregnating specimens. In comparison with the vacuum impregnating specimens, the pressure impregnating specimens also show the lower apparent porosity and weight loss. Studies on the tribological properties of the specimens with different <b>carbonization</b> <b>rate</b> show that the specimens with the higher <b>carbonization</b> <b>rate</b> exhibit the lower bulk density and infiltration efficiency, but the higher porosity and friction coefficient. These results are attributed by the defect induced by the thermal stress during the higher <b>carbonization</b> <b>rate</b> process. In addition, the pressure impregnating method produces a more notable effect on the properties of C/C composites than that of the <b>carbonization</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} durability performance of concrete with various combinations of circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) fly ash and coal-fired fly ash. All cylindrical specimens with the same binder content of 420 kg/m 3 and water/binder ratio of 0. 5 were cast and cured in the saturated limewater. Permeability test, sulfate attack resistance test, rapid chloride ion penetration test (RCPT) and carbonization test were performed. Test results demonstrate that the adding of CFBC fly ash and coal-fired fly ash would reduce the water permeability and chloride ions penetration, and increase the sulfate attack resistance, but an increase in carbonization depth. The carbonization depth increases with an increasing contents of CFBC fly ash and coal-fired fly ash. There exists a negative relationship between compressive strength and <b>carbonization</b> <b>rate.</b> Based on the test results, CFBC fly ash and coal-fired fly ash {{can be considered as}} cement replacement materials and employed in concrete...|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} carbon {{hollow fiber}} membranes (CHFM) for CO 2 separation were prepared by manipulating of <b>carbonization</b> heating <b>rates</b> under a N 2 atmosphere. During heat treatment process, carbonization of the polymeric hollow fiber membrane was conducted up to 650 °C {{and in the}} range of 1 – 9 °C/min for heating rate. The gas permeation properties were determined using a single gas permeation apparatus at room temperature. Fine-tuning of the carbonization conditions appears necessary to obtain desired permeation properties. The gas permeance for all examined gases (N 2, CH 4, CO 2) and selectivity of CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /N 2 was decreased and increased, respectively, for the PEI/PVP-based CHFMs prepared at low heating rate. It was found that the heating rate posses significant effect on structure and gas permeation properties of the resultant CHFMs. Experimental results indicated that, <b>carbonization</b> heating <b>rate</b> of 3 °C/min is the best conditions in the preparation of CHFMs derived from polymer blends of PEI/PVP for the CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /N 2 separation...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} polyacrylonitrile―based hollow―porous carbon fibres (PAN―HPCFs) were {{prepared}} by oxidating PAN hollow―porous fibers in air and carbonizing their cured fibers in nitrogen. The effects of preoxidation and <b>carbonization</b> heating <b>rate</b> on the microstructure, composition, electrical volume conductivity and complex permittivity were investigated. The microstructure of the obtained PAN―HPCFs is changed greatly by the heating rate. The electrical volume conductivity and complex permittivity decrease {{with the increase}} of heating rate. The electrical volume conductivity is in the range 1997. 14 S/m to 153. 39 S/m with the preoxidation heating rate increasing from 0. 5 ¡æ/min to 4 ¡æ/min. At 2 GHz, the value of &epsilon;&Prime; of composites of paraffin and PAN―PHCFs decreases from 70. 35 to 6. 99 when preoxidation heating rate increases form 0. 5 ¡æ/min to 4 ¡æ/min.

40|$|This {{research}} reports {{the production of}} precursor polyacrylonitrile (PAN) / manganese dioxide (MnO 2) nanofibers (NFs) via electrospinning method followed by stabilization and carbonization processes. Nowadays, electrospinning has become a suitable method in manufacturing continuous NFs, thus it is employed to fabricate NFs in this study. The microstructural properties and adsorption competencies of the produced NFs were also studied. The NFs were prepared by electrospinning the polymer solution of Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and Manganese Dioxide (MnO 2) in, N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent. The factors considered {{in this study were}} various polymer PAN/MnO 2 concentrations which will significantly affect the specific surface area, fiber morphology and the diameter of the NFs prepared. Subsequently, heat treatment is applied by setting up the stabilization temperature at 275 oC and carbonization temperature at 800 oC with constant dwelling time (30 min). Nitrogen gas at constant rate 0. 2 L/min was used for stabilization and carbonization with the stabilization rate (2 oC/min) and <b>carbonization</b> <b>rate</b> (5 oC/min). The CNFs produced were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Brunauer Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area and Fourier Transmission Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).

30|$|Activated carbon {{prepared}} from waste {{tea leaves}} for CO 2 adsorption was investigated by Menon et al. (2015) where {{the effect of}} the activating agents, activation sequence, activating agent to waste tea leaves precursor impregnation ratio, carbonization temperature and the <b>carbonization</b> heating <b>rate</b> were evaluated. The process of chemical activation involved the usage of phosphoric acid at an impregnation ratio of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 (g/g) potassium hydroxide at a ratio of 2 : 1 (g/g) and potassium carbonate at a ratio of 1.5 : 1 (g/g) before being carbonized in a muffle furnace at a temperatures ranging from 600  °C to 800  °C for 2  h. Pre-chemical treatment involved the pyrolysis of the waste tea leaves at a temperature of 600  °C under a nitrogen atmosphere before its impregnation with phosphoric acid at an activating agent to tea leaves ratio of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 (g/g), respectively. Post-drying of the mixture at 110  °C for 15  h, the dried samples were then heated to a temperature of 800  °C inside a furnace for 2  h. The surface and pore analysis of the samples obtained found out that the pre-chemical treated samples had the lowest surface areas of 336  m 2 /g and 311  m 2 g, respectively, whereas the chemical activation using H 3 PO 4 at an impregnation ratio of 2 : 1 and carbonization at 700  °C resulted in activated carbon having the highest surface area, micropore volume and total volume of 1044  m 2 /g, 0.39 and 0.59  cm 3 /g, respectively. Also, the study was able to determine that carbonization at a temperature of 600  °C was ideal as the resulting AC would have more pores of width 1  nm that would be suitable for CO 2 gas adsorption.|$|R
40|$|For {{the clean}} and {{economical}} production of chromium compounds, {{it is crucial}} to remove aluminates from chromate alkali solutions and utilize aluminum-containing compounds. In this work, carbonization was used to remove aluminates from a synthetic chromate leaching solution containing a high K 2 O/Al 2 O 3 mole ratio. The influence of reaction temperature, <b>carbonization</b> time, flow <b>rate</b> of carbon dioxide, and seed ratio on the precipitation of Al was investigated. The optimal output was obtained under the following experimental conditions: a reaction temperature of 50 degrees C, a carbonization time of 100 min, a carbon dioxide flow rate of 0. 1 L/min, and a seed ratio of 1. 0. Gibbsite was obtained following carbonization. The structure and morphology of the gibbsite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and laser particle size analyzer. The particle size distribution and morphology of the gibbsite were significantly influenced by the experimental conditions. The gibbsite had a mean particle size (d(50)) of 16. 72 mu m. The thermal decomposition of the gibbsite was analyzed by XRD and the decomposition path was determined.

The weight gains of the precursors JC- 0.20, JC- 0.25, and JC- 0.33 were approximately 7.6, 17.2, and 23.2  %, respectively. The resulting mixture and the sample {{in the control}} group (without wood ash–water mixture impregnation) were loaded in a crucible, which was placed inside an upright high-temperature activation furnace (inner diameter, 26  cm; inner height, 40  cm). Each sample was heated under a nitrogen flow (200  mL/min) for <b>carbonization</b> at a <b>rate</b> of 10  °C/min, and maintained at the desired temperature for 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5  h.

40|$|There is {{scarcity}} of coking coal reserve in India. Only 15 % coking coal is coking in nature. As Coking coal is costly, there arrives {{a need to}} find an alternative route for iron making. India is the world's biggest maker of DRI. The majority of which is delivered primarily through the coal based method of production. Growth in the DRI production can be attributed largely to the popularity of secondary steelmaking route, which has shown a phenomenal growth in India. This has been {{mainly because of the}} low investment cost of the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) as compared to the integrated blast furnace-oxygen converter route and because of its better flexibility of product mix. The future of coal based sponge iron industry in India is bright because of huge availability of non –coking coal (85 % of the total coal found). We are selecting different non-coking coal samples from various mines of Odisha to study and evaluate the effect of different carbonization temperatures on the physical, chemical properties, calorific value, reactivity, and caking index of the coal samples.. Present investigation deals with the study of physical and chemical properties of non- coking coal samples. The results indicated that the physical and chemical properties of coal depend on the <b>carbonization</b> temperature, heating <b>rate</b> and soaking time. It has been found that ash content and fixed carbon content increases while calorific value and volatile matter decreases as the carbonization temperatures rises from 400 °C to 1000 ° C. It is also found that coal chars reactivity towards CO 2 decreases as the carbonization temperature rises from 400 °C to 1000 ° C. Apparent porosity increases up to 400 °C and decreases thereafter as the carbonization temperature increases up to 1000 °C, while apparent density shows contradictory effect of apparent porosity. Lingraj coalmine showed higher fixed carbon content, calorific value and coal grade as compared to other coalmines. Reasons to carry out this work is to search good quality of coal for DRI plants...|$|R
