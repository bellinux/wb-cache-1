They also stressed that satisfied customers are less sensitive to price and more likely to buy more and are more inclined to spend more on tested and tried products.

40|$|In {{seeking to}} provide a more {{cost-effective}} means to substitute for gaps in the collection the University of Hong Kong Libraries began to consider the feasibility of combining purchase with interlibrary loan borrowing in the fall of 2001. From 2002 the University of Hong Kong Libraries implemented a new initiative, called the “Overseas Book Loan Initiative,” to purchase interlibrary loan requests for locally unavailable monographs instead of borrowing them from overseas. This paper presents the University of Hong Kong model of “purchase on demand,” and attempts to study whether purchase instead of borrow is a better alternative for the University of Hong Kong Libraries' situation, given the local factors and circumstances. The four underlying factors: speed, subsequent use, content appropriateness, and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> are examined by analyzing actual data collected. Evidence from the study suggests that purchasing instead of borrowing is a better option if the library can continue to support the higher out-of-pocket costs to achieve the benefits of improving patron support, addingindemand materials to the collection, and optimizing the use of resources. postprin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{expanding}} e-society, mobile embedded systems are increasingly {{used to support}} transactions such as for banking, stock or database applications. Such systems entail a range of heterogeneous entities- both the embedded devices and the networks connecting them. While these systems are exposed to frequent and varied perturbations, the support of atomic distributed transactions is still a fundamental requirement to achieve consistent decisions. Guaranteeing atomicity and high performance in traditional fixed wired networks {{is based on the}} assumption that faults like node and link failures occur rarely. This assumption is not supported in current and future mobile embedded systems where the heterogeneity and mobility often result in link and node failures as a dominant operational scenario. In order to continue guaranteeing strict atomicity while providing for high efficiency (low resource blocking time and message overhead) and acceptable commit rate, transactional fault-tolerance techniques need to be revisited perhaps at the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> execution time. In this paper, a comprehensive classification of perturbations and their impact on the design of mobile transactions is provided. In particular we argue for the delay-awareness of mobile transactions to allow for the fault-tolerance mechanisms to ensure resilience to the various and frequent perturbations. Key words: Transactions, mobile database systems, dependability...|$|E
40|$|Multi-versioned {{database}} {{systems have}} the potential to significantly increase the amount of concurrency in transaction processing be-cause they can avoid read-write conflicts. Unfortunately, the in-crease in concurrency usually comes at the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> se-rializability. If a database user requests full serializability, modern multi-versioned systems significantly constrain read-write concur-rency among conflicting transactions and employ expensive syn-chronization patterns in their design. In main-memory multi-core settings, these additional constraints are so burdensome that multi-versioned systems are often significantly outperformed by single-version systems. We propose BOHM, a new concurrency control protocol for main-memory multi-versioned database systems. BOHM guarantees se-rializable execution while ensuring that reads never block writes. In addition, BOHM does not require reads to perform any book-keeping whatsoever, thereby avoiding the overhead of tracking reads via contended writes to shared memory. This leads to excellent scalability and performance in multi-core settings. BOHM has all the above characteristics without performing validation based con-currency control. Instead, it is pessimistic, and is therefore not prone to excessive aborts in the presence of contention. An exper-imental evaluation shows that BOHM performs well in both high contention and low contention settings, and is able to dramatically outperform state-of-the-art multi-versioned systems despite main-taining the full set of serializability guarantees. 1...|$|E
