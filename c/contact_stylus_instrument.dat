This research {{is to develop a}} surface profile reconstruction method for tip profile with LSA lens and then verified the result by estimating the form error. Experimental set-up is configured of a surface profile and roughness analyzer, Panasonic Ultra Accuracy 3 -D Profilometer (UA 3 P), and the feasibility of the developed program is compared with the results of a commercial operation software, UA 3 P software. The figure form error (FFE) is used to evaluate the developed method. Experiments have been performed by measuring the LSA lens of a s 55 ml spherical gage with measuring ranges increasing from ± 30 °, ± 45 ° to ± 60 ° and measuring an aspheric lens with range ± 50 °. Experimental results showed that the FFE of the developed method has smaller FFE values than those obtained by the UA 3 P software as the measuring range of ± 30 ° and ± 45. Similar result of FFE is obtained as 0. 891 µm for the aspheric lens by the developed method than FFE 0. 896 µm by the UA 3 P software. Therefore, the developed method has been verified for estimating the FFE of LSA lens with variant measuring ranges. Future work is to develop related compensation methodology of FFE for LSA lens measurement and also to find appreciated tip profiles for measuring LSA lens of higher order nonlinear terms...|$|E

40|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments</b> with {{sufficient}} range to resolution that could measure and analyze aspheric surfaces {{first appeared in}} the 1980 s. These where limited to the measurement of a single profile over a rotationally symmetric aspheric surface. Although limited in use they proved to be very useful for the characterization of both optical and non-optical aspheric surfaces, correction of tool paths for aspheric generators etc. The work described here reviews recent developments in the measurement and characterization of aspheric surfaces by <b>contact</b> <b>stylus</b> instrumentation and includes measurement over an area rather than a single profile and measurement and the characterization of non-rotationally symmetric aspheric surfaces. Some of the challenges involved in the areal measurement of aspheric surfaces by <b>contact</b> <b>stylus</b> instrumentation will be described together with the techniques and considerations used to overcome these challenges. Specifically we will describe the mathematical models used to describe the aspheric surfaces and how these can be used to eliminate measurement set-up errors.

The method utilizes {{three or more}} images of the measured surface from the same viewpoint, taken sequentially under different illumination conditions. The scenes captured by the camera were reconstructed by the least square method to obtain surface normal from surface topography. Three-dimensional surface textural patterns were recovered from those surface normal. The system was validated with five standard surface roughness specimens. The Ra calculated from the recovered surface was compared with the values measured from <b>contacting</b> roughness measurement (<b>stylus</b> <b>instrument).</b> The best coefficient of the slant angles can also be determined through the linear regression.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the {{measurement}} of surface topographies was further developed using the capabilities of 3 D optical profilers based on different measuring principles. These instruments have significant advantages over <b>contact</b> <b>stylus</b> measuring <b>instruments</b> but also some limitations. One limitation is depending from {{the interaction of the}} surface with the numerical aperture of the objective. Because of the surface slope, some parts of the surface are not correctly detected by the instrument, resulting on void pixels i. e. missing information on the measured topography. Data generated using fitting algorithms can be used to reconstruct the surface and replace the missing data, and the way this operation is performed affects the evaluation of surface parameters. As an alternative, the calculation of parameters may be performed on non-reconstructed datasets. In this work, the effect of void pixels on the determination of 3 D parameters on different manufactured surfaces has been investigated using computer simulation starting from actual measurement data. Both randomly distributed and slope-dependent void pixels are considered. A sensitivity analysis with different distributions of void pixels as well as the effect of increasing slope are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{parameters are}} usually measured using scanned <b>contact</b> <b>stylus</b> probe based <b>instruments.</b> International {{standards and norms}} are based on those instruments. For small scale roughness, smaller than a few tenths of micrometers, such measurement becomes difficult: ambient vibration amplitudes can be of the same order of magnitude as the roughness itself and contact with the sample may damage it. For these applications, Digital Holographic Microscopes provides an ideal alternative as they provide interferometric resolutions with extremely short acquisition time. The strength of DHM ™ lies in particular {{on the use of}} the so-called off-axis configuration, which enables to capture the whole information by a single image acquisition within a few microseconds. DHM ™ images provide measurements of the surface topography which can be used for surface analysis and roughness measurements amongst others.

40|$|Making {{no claim}} to be a {{definitive}} review, a several techniques in nanometrology are examined in order to identify critical challenges for the coming years. First, barriers to the wider application of X-ray interferometry are considered, showing that its use is likely to remain highly specialized. Sub-micrometre surface topography is then used to highlight how basic concepts, sensor technology and analytical software interact to both define and restrict instrument design and International Standards. Measurements should relate to the function of the surfaces, but suffer from poor fundamental understanding of their behaviour. Attempts to reconcile information from <b>stylus</b> <b>contact</b> <b>instruments,</b> from optical instruments and from atomic force microscopes are similarly impeded. Possible approaches to calibration are compared. Consideration of the wider issue of surface integrity shows additional challenges in defining and controlling surface cleanliness and in calibrating nano-friction and nano-harness instruments.

40|$|The {{thickness}} {{measurement of}} transparent layers with optical techniques is very problematic. The observed deviations can easily reach 100 % of the layer thickness to be measured. In order to analyse these deviations, tactile reference measurements have been developed. The proposed method {{is based on}} contact mode measurements with low <b>contact</b> pressure. With <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments,</b> this can be realized either by using the recommended tip radius of 2 µm and very small probing forces in the micronewton range (and low scanning speeds of 50 µm s- 1) or by using the recommended probing force of 750 µN, but a large probing tip radius. Three metal layers on silicon or silicon dioxide and two polymer resist materials on a thin chromium adhesive layer on silicon are used as artefacts. The comparison of the optical measurements with the tactile reference values disclosed deviations of the optical measurements of up to 195 % of the layer thickness. Layer thicknesses were between 200 nm and 4 µm. This paper analyses the deviations of two white light interference microscopes, one phase shift interference microscope, one confocal microscope, one autofocus sensor, a chromatic sensor, an interferometric film thickness sensor and one spectroscopic ellipsometer. Simple and well-known expressions for {{the description of the}} observed deviations are presented and discussed. The order of magnitude of the observed deviations can be described well by these correction formulas but further investigations are necessary in order to better understand the systematic deviations of optical surface measuring instruments on non-cooperating surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − In the {{uncertainty}} budget of Rockwell C hardness (HRC) tests, geometric error of the Rockwell diamond indenter {{is a major}} contributor. The geometric calibration of Rockwell diamond indenters has been a key issue for Rockwell hardness standardization. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a microform calibration system based on a <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> for the geometric calibration of Rockwell diamond indenters. Using that system, a NIST master standard Rockwell diamond indenter No. 3581 was established in 1995, by which approximately 300 standard reference material (SRM) Rockwell hardness blocks of HRC scale were calibrated for implementation of the HRC scale in the United States. This indenter has been re-calibrated in 1997, 2005 and 2007. The calibration results have shown both high stability for the NIST standard Rockwell diamond indenter and high reproducibility for the NIST microform calibration system. After more than fifteen years of service, the <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> was recently replaced by a new one. In order to test the measurement agreement between the two <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments,</b> another NIST master Rockwell diamond indenter No. 101 has been recently calibrated by the new instrument and the calibration result shows good agreement with the previous results...|$|R

The dynamics incorporate a tip flight phenomenon, inferring detachment from zero value of the reaction force and the trajectory from a free vibration solution to a second order system. Tip shape is handled by a rigid kinematic model. Following brief discussions of the modelling and the process for generating test profiles with defined correlation lengths, the influences of the inherent parameters of the <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> and the testing method on the measurement fidelity are examined. The tip shape effect of the <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> is also considered in the dynamic measurement.

The {{influence of the}} damping ratio on the dynamic performance of the <b>stylus</b> <b>instrument</b> is examined and tends to confirm other recent work. The best combinations of signal fidelity and measurement speed occur with damping ratios considerably higher than conventionally used, mainly because the damping can suppress or delay tip flight. Residual vibrations associated with start-up transients are shown to have potentially serious effects on the signal fidelity. Hence, {{the responses of the}} stylus system to three typical velocity control signals are investigated. The normally used step control signal can generate relatively large residual vibration, while slope control and, even better, cycloidal control signal can suppress the residual vibration and guarantee the signal fidelity...|$|R

40|$|At the Laboratory for Precise Measurements of Length, {{currently}} the Croatian National Laboratory for Length, unique nano-roughness calibration standards were developed, {{which have been}} physically implemented {{in cooperation with the}} company MikroMasch Trading OU and the Rudee Boskovic Institute. In this paper, a new design for a calibration standard with two measuring surfaces is presented. One of the surfaces is for the reproduction of roughness parameters, while the other is for the traceability of length units below 50 nm. The nominal values of the groove depths on these measuring surfaces are the same. Thus, a link between the measuring surfaces has been ensured, which makes these standards unique.

40|$|The {{object of}} this Ph. D {{work is to}} {{evaluate}} fidelity in surface measurements in nanometric metrology for both contact and non-contact methods, namely <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments</b> and scanning tunnelling microscopy. Fidelity is defined, in this thesis, as a measure to which an instrument system reproduces the surface features and thus the parameters of interest. High fidelity measurement has two meanings; less distortion in the measured result and less disturbance to the surface being measured. Interaction at the interface between the probe and the surface {{is the source of}} failure to achieve high fidelity. No instrument measures surface topography alone: all instruments measure a convolution of topography and the geometrical and physical interaction of the measured probe and the surface. In the case of a mechanical stylus, factors extraneous to the topography include (a) the shape and size of the stylus, (b) mechanical properties of the stylus and the specimen such as elastic moduli and hardness, (c) frictional force of the sliding pair. and (d) dynamic interaction forces during the sliding. For the scanning tunnelling microscope, factors which affect measurement in addition to topography include the geometry of the tip, the electronic properties of the surface and mechanical deformation due to electrostatic forces and contamination. 'These factors have been investigated in great detail, particularly for the <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments.</b> A specially designed electro-magnetic force actuator has been developed to give a better control on loading force during the experiments. Tracking force effects were evaluated by profiling statistical parameters, and scanning electron microscopy. Friction between a stylus and specimen has been measured for different loading force, sliding speed, material and surface finish. Improvement on dynamic characteristics of a stylus system has been achieved by active damping control. An optimal damping ratio for <b>stylus</b> <b>instruments</b> is found to be within 0. 5 - 0. 7. Through the study, the tracking force and traversing speed are found to be the crucial factors to be tackled so that high fidelity measurement can be obtained. A similar investigation has been also made on two home-built scanning tunnelling microscopes to explore the potential applications of STM on nanometric metrology. ...|$|R
