Such methodologies are useful for gaining insight in the cracking of specimens and simple structures under well defined global load distributions. Microscopic failure considers the initiation and propagation of a <b>crack.</b> <b>Failure</b> criteria in this case are related to microscopic fracture. Some of the most popular failure models in this area are the micromechanical failure models, which combine the advantages of continuum mechanics and classical fracture mechanics. Such models are based on the concept that during plastic deformation, microvoids nucleate and grow until a local plastic neck or fracture of the intervoid matrix occurs, which causes the coalescence of neighbouring voids. Such a model, proposed by Gurson and extended by Tvergaard and Needleman, is known as GTN. Another approach, proposed by Rousselier, is based on continuum damage mechanics (CDM) and thermodynamics. Both models form a modification of the von Mises yield potential by introducing a scalar damage quantity, which represents the void volume fraction of cavities, the porosity f.|$|E

40|$|Epoxy {{has been}} used widely in {{electronic}} devices because of its excellent electrical properties for insulators. In epoxy resin curing reaction process, phenomena such as heat of reaction, reaction progress (degree of cure, physical properties, etc.), cure shrinkage and viscoelastic behavior, are related intricately. It is known that there are serious problems of delamination at the metal- epoxy resin interface and <b>crack</b> <b>failure</b> in epoxy resin due to cure shrinkage when epoxy resin is used as encapsulating medium of insulators in electrical and electronic equipments. It {{is very difficult to}} make experimentally clear the mechanism of the delamination and <b>crack</b> <b>failure</b> occurring in electrical and electronic equipments during curing reaction. Though several papers have been reported on the attempts to predict the stress-strain behavior during curing reaction, their simulation model is proposed under the conditions without cure shrinkage, heat of reaction, reaction progress, delamination or <b>crack</b> <b>failure.</b> Therefore, previous works cannot be always applied to the practical production process. In order to solve these problems, the authors have proposed a new simulation model, which can applies to the curing process from potting (liquid state) to gelling (solid state) under a constant curing temperature. In this work, the authors have attempted the simulation with a finite element method for two-stage cure reaction as follows: Epoxy resin was potted between the inner and outer iron cylinders. The potted epoxy resin was cured under a given temperature before gelling and under a higher temperature during gelling (two-stage cure reaction). In order to express the two-stage cure reaction, the equation of cure reaction was corrected.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{effective}} and comprehensive repair techniques is increasing {{throughout the world}} as existing concrete structures continue to age. The bonded concrete overlay method, where a new repair material layer is cast over an existing damaged substrate, is the most commonly utilized method of repair. However, this repair technique is prone to failure due to differential volume changes between the newly cast repair material and the existing substrate. These volume changes {{can be attributed to}} thermal and shrinkage differences, with drying shrinkage being identified as they key source of the volume change. When the resulting induced stress form the differential volume changes exceeds the intrinsic tensile strength of the repair material, <b>cracking</b> <b>failure</b> occurs. This can be detrimental to the effectiveness of the repair and its durability. Overlay crack resistance {{has been found to be}} dependent on specific material properties, namely: tensile strength, elastic modulus and shrinkage. The effect of tensile relaxation on overlay performance is also significant, with the resulting 'stress relief' cause by this relaxation prolonging the time to <b>cracking</b> <b>failure.</b> In this investigation, the influence of the inclusion of coarse aggregate in the repair material is investigated. The study focuses on the specific impact of coarse aggregate volume content and size on the performance of bonded overlay materials, and the material properties that influence this performance.

Further testing was conducted with w:c = 0. 6 laboratory mixes with different nominal sized coarse aggregates. The impact of coarse aggregate volume and size on individual material properties, which included tensile strength, tensile relaxation, free drying shrinkage and elastic modulus, were tested separately for the various mixes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{new set of}} six phenomenological failure {{criteria}} for fiber-reinforced polymer laminates denoted LaRC 03 is described. These criteria can predict matrix and fiber failure accurately, without the curve-fitting parameters. For matrix failure under transverse compression, {{the angle of the}} fracture plane is solved by maximizing the Mohr-Coulomb effective stresses. A criterion for fiber kinking is obtained by calculating the fiber misalignment under load and applying the matrix failure criterion in the coordinate frame of the misalignment. Fracture mechanics models of matrix cracks are used to develop a criterion for matrix failure in tension and to calculate the associated in situ strengths. The LaRC 03 criteria are applied to a few examples to predict failure load envelopes and to predict the failure mode for each region of the envelope. The analysis results are compared to the predictions using other available {{failure criteria}} and with experimental results.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behaviors of}} LiFePO 4 battery cell and module specimens under in-plane constrained compression were investigated for simulations of battery cells, modules and packs under crush conditions. The experimental stress-strain curves were correlated to the deformation patterns of battery cell and module specimens. Analytical solutions {{were developed to}} estimate the buckling stresses {{and to provide a}} theoretical basis for future design of representative volume element cell and module specimens. A physical kinematics model for formation of kinks and shear bands in battery cells was developed to explain the deformation mechanism for layered battery cells under in-plane constrained compression. A small-scale module constrained punch indentation test was also conducted to benchmark the computational results. The computational results indicate that macro homogenized material models can be used to simulate battery modules under crush conditions. Fatigue behavior and failure modes of ultrasonic spot welds in lap-shear specimens of magnesium and steel sheets with and without adhesive were investigated. For ultrasonic spot welded lap-shear specimens, the failure mode changes from the partial nugget pullout mode under low-cycle loading conditions to the kinked <b>crack</b> <b>failure</b> mode under high-cycle loading conditions. For adhesive-bonded and weld-bonded lap-shear specimens, the test results show the near interface cohesive failure mode and the kinked <b>crack</b> <b>failure</b> mode under low-cycle and high-cycle loading conditions, respectively. Next, the analytical effective stress intensity factor solutions for main cracks in lap-shear specimens of three dissimilar sheets under plane strain conditions were developed and the solutions agreed well with the computational results.

40|$|In modern {{solid waste}} landfills, liner systems are {{essential}} structural elements that ensure that waste materials are safely {{separated from the}} environment. Many liner systems have been developed and used over the past decade. Among impermeable layers, clay liners are {{regarded as one of}} the very significant components of liner system and are being used worldwide as a waste containment system in landfills. One of the failures associated with clay liners is the occurrence of nonuniform settlements, resulting from the sudden collapse of waste, or the decomposition of waste materials, and (or) the subgrade over which the liner is laid. This paper deals with the use of a small centrifuge to model the deformation behaviour of clay liners. Model tests were performed in a small geotechnical centrifuge to investigate the behaviour of clay liners in landfills subjected to nonuniform settlements at sharp curvatures. A parametric study was conducted to analyze the influence of parameters like thickness, consistency, and overburden on the behaviour of clay liners. The clay liner without any overburden is observed to experience severe cracking in the form of deep and wide cracks at the maximum curvature zone. The depth and width of the cracks are found to decrease with an increase in clay liner thickness. The <b>cracking</b> <b>failure</b> pattern is suppressed by shearing for a clay liner with an increase in overburden pressure.
