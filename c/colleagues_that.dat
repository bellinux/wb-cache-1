5|$|LACM 149371 was {{discovered}} in 1998 at the Santa Rosa fossil site in the Ucayali Region of Peru. The Santa Rosa fauna also contains fossils of various unique species of marsupials and hystricognath rodents, a possible bat, and some notoungulates. The fauna was published in a volume of the Science Series of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in 2004, which included a paper by Francisco Goin and <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> described and discussed LACM 149371.|$|E
5|$|The United States Navy's {{greatest}} defeat until World War II caused {{panic in}} Washington. As Lincoln's Cabinet met {{to discuss the}} disaster, the frightened Secretary of War Edwin Stanton told the others that the Virginia might attack East coast cities, and even shell the White House before the meeting ended. Welles assured his <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> they were safe as the ship could not traverse the Potomac River. He added that the Union also had an ironclad, {{and that it was}} heading to meet the Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Grant {{suggested}} to his <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> they should {{catch up with}} the presidential limousine. Since he was the only Dallas-based member of the press in camera car two, Grant directed his driver to the Trade Mart, where they saw no activity. A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E

50|$|Though greatly {{respected}} he {{does not}} seem to have been popular; according to a well-known story he informed a <b>colleague</b> <b>that</b> he intended to retire in vacation to avoid the trouble of a retirement dinner — the <b>colleague</b> cheerfully replied <b>that</b> this was quite unnecessary since no-one would have turned up to the dinner anyway.|$|R
5|$|Brezhnev {{stayed in}} office under {{pressure}} from some of his Politburo associates, though in practice the country was not governed by Brezhnev, but instead by a collective leadership led by Suslov, Ustinov, Gromyko, and Yuri Andropov. Konstantin Chernenko, due to his close relationship with Brezhnev, had also acquired influence. While the Politburo was pondering who would take Brezhnev's place, his health continued to worsen. The choice of a successor would {{have been influenced by}} Suslov, but since he died in January 1982, before Brezhnev, Andropov took Suslov's place in the Central Committee Secretariat. With Brezhnev's health worsening, Andropov showed his Politburo <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> he was not afraid of Brezhnev's reprisals any more, and launched a major anti-corruption campaign. On 10 November 1982, Brezhnev died and was honored with major state funeral and buried 5 days later at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.|$|E
5|$|Newton often openly mocked {{the captain}} by {{creating}} obscene poems and songs {{about him that}} became so popular the crew began to join in. He entered into disagreements with several <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> resulted in his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried, then outright enslaved and forced {{to work on a}} plantation in Sierra Leone near the Sherbro River. After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and a ship found him by coincidence. Newton claimed the only reason he left was because of Polly.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{determined}} Yeates {{had spent}} the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street, leaving at around 8:00pm to begin the 30-minute walk home. She told friends and <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> she was not looking forward to spending the weekend alone {{as it would be}} her first in the flat without Reardon; she planned to spend her time baking in preparation for a party the couple would be throwing the following week, and shopping for Christmas. Yeates was seen on closed-circuit television (CCTV) at around 8:10pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing anything. She phoned her best friend, Rebecca Scott, at 8:30pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve. The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8:40pm. She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby off-licence, Bargain Booze.|$|E

5000|$|In September 1999, Norris was {{pitted against}} writer Jeffrey Archer, {{in the race}} to become Conservative {{candidate}} for Mayor of London.

5|$|Embarrassed by {{the events}} at the press conference, Đính {{returned}} to the officers' mess at the Joint General Staff headquarters. His colleagues, led by General Trần Văn Đôn, were plotting a coup against Diệm because of the Buddhist crisis, and attempted to play on Đính's ego to convince him to join them. They knew that without Đính's assistance, a coup would be difficult as his forces dominated the region surrounding the capital. In a series of meetings, the other generals assured Đính {{that he was a}} national hero worthy of political authority, and claimed that Nhu had not realised how important he was in the future of the country. Đính's colleagues even bribed his soothsayer to predict his elevation to political power. The other generals told him that the people were dissatisfied with Diệm's cabinet and that Vietnam needed dynamic young officers in politics, and that their presence would reverse the declining morale in the ARVN. They advised Đính to ask Diệm to promote him to interior minister, Dương Văn Minh to defence minister, and Trần Văn Minh to education minister. The other generals hoped that would reject Đính and wound his pride. As a result, Đính and his fellow generals met Diệm at the palace, where Đính asked the president to promote him to the post of interior minister. Diệm bluntly chastised Đính in front of his colleagues, and ordered him out of Saigon to the central highlands resort town of Đà Lạt to rest. Đính felt humiliated and embarrassed, having promised his <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> he would be successful. The Ngô brothers had been alarmed by Đính's request, and put him under surveillance. Đính found out, further straining his relationship with the palace. Đính agreed to join the coup, although with his ambitious nature, the other officers were skeptical and planned to have him assassinated if he tried to switch sides.|$|E
5|$|The new senator {{took his}} seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C. Jones, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without {{his wife and}} family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson {{immediately}} set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who {{took advantage of the}} provisions of the Homestead Bill {{were more likely to be}} Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners. Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.|$|E

25|$|He was {{appointed}} Consul {{for the year}} 410, without <b>colleague.</b> <b>That</b> year Rome was besieged by the Visigoths of Alaric I, who would eventually sack the city; the usurper Priscus Attalus chose Tertullus as consul, but neither the Western Emperor Honorius, nor the Eastern court of Theodosius II recognised him.|$|R

25|$|The TEIQue {{provides}} an operationalization {{for the model}} of Petrides and <b>colleagues,</b> <b>that</b> conceptualizes EI in terms of personality. The test encompasses 15 subscales organized under four factors: well-being, self-control, emotionality, and sociability. The {{psychometric properties of the}} TEIQue were investigated in a study on a French-speaking population, where it was reported that TEIQue scores were globally normally distributed and reliable.|$|E
25|$|White {{reminded}} his <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> the Court had acknowledged this in its 1974 {{majority opinion}} in Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co.. In that case, the respondent, an Illinois company seeking {{to recover from}} petitioner, a German citizen it alleged to have misrepresented the status of trademarks it sold, appealed an order to arbitrate before a panel in Paris. Since the transaction had also involved a stock purchase, Alberto-Culver argued that the 1933 Act and Wilko controlled and the case could not be arbitrated.|$|E
50|$|Hinton {{developed}} a flocculation test for syphilis in 1927, and co-{{developed a}}nother syphilis test using spinal fluid with a <b>colleague</b> <b>that</b> {{would come to}} be known as the Davies-Hinton test. These tests were considered a boon for medicine, as the treatment for syphilis at the time was long, painful, and hazardous.|$|R

25|$|In later years, Powell {{recorded}} his promotion from private to lance-corporal in his Who's Who entry, {{on other occasions}} describing it as a greater promotion than entering the Cabinet. Early in 1940, he was trained for a commission after, whilst working in a kitchen, answering the question of an inspecting brigadier with a Greek proverb; on several occasions, he told <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> he expected {{to be at least}} a major-general {{by the end of the}} war.

25|$|Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, {{offered to}} sell the patent {{outright}} to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone {{was nothing but a}} toy. Two years later, he told <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> if he could get the patent for $25million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted {{to sell the}} patent. Bell's investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.|$|E
25|$|On 21 April 1943, de Gaulle was {{scheduled}} to fly in a Wellington bomber to Scotland to inspect the Free French Navy. On take-off, the bomber's tail dropped, and the plane nearly crashed into the airfield's embankment. Only the skill of the pilot saved them. On inspection, {{it was found that}} aeroplane's separator rod had been sabotaged, using acid. Britain's MI6 investigated the incident, but no one was ever apprehended. De Gaulle blamed the Western Allies, and later told <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> he no longer had confidence in them.|$|E

25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to his assassination, Arlosoroff's fervor to help {{establish}} a Jewish national homeland intensified. At a Mapai Labour Council meeting occurring in January 1933, Arlosoroff strongly clashed with David Ben-Gurion and other prominent Mapai leaders regarding whether or not the Zionists should work within the British government's infrastructure to help bring about Jewish statehood. Arlosoroff warned his <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> if the Zionist movement maintained an isolationist policy with the British ruling authorities, Arab political influence would increase within the British Administration and cause the rights of Jewish people in Eretz Israel to suffer.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Hansen {{supported}} the renomination and reelection of President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., who won Wyoming's three electoral votes. His backing of Ford {{was consistent with}} the stand of his Republican Senate <b>colleagues</b> <b>that</b> year; only two, Paul Laxalt of Nevada and Jesse Helms of North Carolina, endorsed Ford's rival for the nomination, Ronald W. Reagan of California. Hansen retired from the Senate in 1978, when he declined to run for a third term. He moved back to Jackson and chaired several financial and civic associations. He {{supported the}} Republican presidential nominees in all elections thereafter.|$|E
