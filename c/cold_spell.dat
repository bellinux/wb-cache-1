Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a <b>cold</b> <b>spell.</b> Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E
5|$|Operation {{proved to}} give several major difficulties, and by March 2001, Oslo Sporveier was {{threatening}} to terminate the purchase agreement unless the manufacturer—who by then had merged to become AnsaldoBreda—fixed the problems. These included the noise being 15dB too loud, and trams being out of service during the January–February <b>cold</b> <b>spell,</b> when batteries and rectifiers would not operate. It was agreed that AnsaldoBreda would have to replace all 256 motors to satisfy the criteria in the contract. By 1 June, AnsaldoBreda had delivered one tram that met all the contract's criteria. Tram 155 was by then still undelivered, and was being used for testing by the manufacturer. At the same time, 149 was being used for tests in Oslo. The trams were taken out of service, and gradually put back as they were upgraded. In February 2002, tram 155 was equipped with new motors, and a new agreement was made where all motors would be replaced by December 2003, if Oslo Sporveier was satisfied with six months of trials with 155.|$|E
5|$|Mid-March brought warmer air to {{the country}} which thawed the snow lying on the ground. This {{snowmelt}} rapidly ran off the frozen ground into rivers and caused widespread flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the British Army and foreign aid agencies were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the <b>cold</b> <b>spell</b> over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter had severe effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10per cent of the year's industrial production, 10to 20per cent of cereal and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The ruling Labour Party began to lose its popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the Conservative Party in the 1950 election. That winter is also cited {{as a factor in}} the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80, Britain's decline from being a superpower, and the introduction of the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in Berlin, civil disorder in the Netherlands and business closures in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

Ondřej Lhotka Department: Department of Physical Geography and Geoecology, Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague Supervisor: RNDr. Jan Kyselý, Ph. D., Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences Abstract: Heat waves and <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> have serious impacts on natural environment and society. The main aims of this thesis are to examine past {{variability of}} Central European heat waves and <b>cold</b> <b>spells,</b> to assess severity of recent {{events in a}} long-term context, to evaluate simulation of heat waves in climate models, and to construct their scenarios for a possible future climate. Heat waves and <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> were primarily investigated as spatial events, using gridded data sets. E-OBS gridded data was utilized to assess past variability of heat waves and <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> and to evaluate regional climate model (RCM) simulations from the ENSEMBLES and EURO-CORDEX projects. An extremity index that captures joint effects of temperature, duration, and spatial extent of individual heat waves and <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> was proposed and tested. The persistent 1994 heat wave {{was found to be}} the most extreme over Central Europe in the 1950 − 2012 period, and the summer of 2013 was unprecedented at several Central European stations [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Background Asthma is {{a serious}} global health problem. However, few studies have {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> and pediatric outpatient visits for asthma. Objective To examine the association between <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> and pediatric outpatient visits for asthma in Shanghai, China. Methods We collected daily data on pediatric outpatient visits for asthma, mean temperature, relative humidity, and ozone from Shanghai between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2009. We defined <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> as four or more consecutive days with temperature below the 5 th percentile of temperature during 2007 – 2009. We used a Poisson regression model to {{examine the impact of}} temperature on pediatric outpatient visits for asthma in cold seasons during 2007 and 2009. We examined the effect of <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> on asthma compared with non-cold spell days. Results There was a significant relationship between cold temperatures and pediatric outpatient visits for asthma. The cold effects on children's asthma were observed at different lags. The lower the temperatures, the higher the risk for asthma attacks among children. Conclusion Cold temperatures, particularly <b>cold</b> <b>spells,</b> significantly increase the risk of pediatric outpatient visits for asthma. The findings suggest that asthma children need to be better protected from cold effects in winter...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{blocking}} is {{an important}} contributor to European temperature variability. It can trigger <b>cold</b> and warm <b>spells,</b> which is of specific relevance in spring because vegetation is particularly vulnerable to extreme temperatures in the growing season. The spring season is investigated as a transition period from predominant connections of blocking with <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> in winter to predominant connections of blocking with warm spells in summer. Extreme temperatures are termed <b>cold</b> or warm <b>spells</b> if temperature stays outside the 10 th to 90 th percentile range {{for at least six}} consecutive days. <b>Cold</b> and warm <b>spells</b> in Europe over 1979 – 2014 are analyzed in observations from the European daily high-resolution gridded dataset (E-OBS) and the connection to blocking is examined in geopotential height fields from ERA-Interim. A highly significant link between blocking and <b>cold</b> and warm <b>spells</b> is found that changes during spring. Blocking over the northeastern Atlantic and Scandinavia is correlated with the occurrence of <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> in Europe, particularly early in spring, whereas blocking over central Europe is associated with warmer conditions, particularly from March onward. The location of the block also impacts the spatial distribution of temperature extremes. More than 80 % of <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> in southeastern Europe occur during blocking whereas warm spells are correlated with blocking mainly in northern Europe. Over the analysis period, substantial interannual variability is found but also a decrease in <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> and an increase in warm spells. The long-term change to a warmer climate holds the potential for even higher vulnerability to spring cold extremes...|$|R
25|$|Often, a Chinook is {{preceded by}} a “Manyberries Chinook” during {{the end of a}} <b>cold</b> <b>spell.</b> This {{southeast}} wind was named for the small village Manyberries, now a hamlet, in southeastern Alberta, from where the wind seems to originate. It can be fairly strong and cause bitter windchill and blowing snow. The wind will eventually swing around to the southwest and the temperature rises sharply as the real Chinook arrives.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} Ice Age the Bristol Channel was dry land, but {{subsequently}} the sea level rose, resulting in major coastal changes. The Somerset Levels were flooded, but the dry points such as Glastonbury and Brent Knoll are known to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunters. The landscape at this time was tundra. Britain's oldest complete skeleton, Cheddar Man, lived at Cheddar Gorge around 7150 BC (in the Upper Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age), shortly after {{the end of the}} ice age; however, it is unclear whether the region was continuously inhabited during the previous 4000 years, or if humans returned to the gorge after a final <b>cold</b> <b>spell.</b> A Palaeolithic flint tool found in West Sedgemoor is the earliest indication of human presence on the Somerset Levels. During the 7th millennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys, so the Mesolithic people occupied seasonal camps on the higher ground, indicated by scatters of flints. The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reed swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways. These included the Post Track and the Sweet Track. The Sweet Track, dating from the 39th century BC, is thought to be the world's oldest timber trackway and was once thought to be the world's oldest engineered roadway. The Levels were also the location of the Glastonbury Lake Village as well as two lake villages at Meare. Stonehenge and Avebury are perhaps the most famous Neolithic sites in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{association}} between cardiovascular mortality and winter <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> was evaluated {{in the population}} of the Czech Republic over 21 -yr period 1986 – 2006. No comprehensive study on cold-related mortality in central Europe has been carried out despite the fact that cold air invasions are more frequent and severe in this region than in western and southern Europe. Methods <b>Cold</b> <b>spells</b> were defined as periods of days on which air temperature does not exceed - 3. 5 °C. Days on which mortality was affected by epidemics of influenza/acute respiratory infections were identified and omitted from the analysis. Excess cardiovascular mortality was determined after the long-term changes and the seasonal cycle in mortality had been removed. Excess mortality during and after <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> was examined in individual age groups and genders. Results <b>Cold</b> <b>spells</b> were associated with positive mean excess cardiovascular mortality in all age groups (25 – 59, 60 – 69, 70 – 79 and 80 + years) and in both men and women. The relative mortality effects were most pronounced and most direct in middle-aged men (25 – 59 years), which contrasts with majority of studies on cold-related mortality in other regions. The estimated excess mortality during the severe <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> in January 1987 (+ 274 cardiovascular deaths) is comparable to that attributed to the most severe heat wave in this region in 1994. Conclusion The results show that cold stress has a considerable impact on mortality in central Europe, representing a public health threat of an importance similar to heat waves. The elevated mortality risks in men aged 25 – 59 years may be related to occupational exposure of large numbers of men working outdoors in winter. Early warnings and preventive measures based on weather forecast and targeted on the susceptible parts of the population may help mitigate the effects of <b>cold</b> <b>spells</b> and save lives. </p...|$|R
500|$|The winter {{began with}} two periods of cold weather in December 1946 and January 1947, but the coldest period {{did not begin}} until 21January 1947.
