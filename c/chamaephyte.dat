Abandoned croplands of different ages were compared with each other and to the natural vegetation.

The male, staminate cones are oval, 3-8mm long, organized in dense clusters, with 3-6 stipitate microsporangia. The female, or ovulate cones are found at the nodes of the stems. The ovulate cones are oval, up to 10mm long, with 4-5 pairs of overlapping yellow bracts surrounding two flowers. The seeds present in the ovulate cones are oval and acuminate in shape. This plant species flowing/fruiting season is between March and May. The roots of this plant are very fibrous and help the plant firmly anchor in sandy soil.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Hantam-Tanqua-Roggeveld subregion is {{situated}} {{in an area where}} the Fynbos, Succulent Karoo and Nama Karoo biomes meet. Life form spectra were compiled at a species richness and vegetation cover level {{in order to determine the}} affinities of the vegetation of the subregion with respect to its Succulent Karoo, Fynbos and Nama Karoo Biome status. A percentage succulence was also calculated for both species richness and cover. Comparisons of life form spectra and succulence were made across the eight vegetation associations found in the area and across three broad vegetation groups, i. e., Mountain Renosterveld, Winter Rainfall Karoo and Tanqua Karoo. Mountain Renosterveld vegetation was characterised by high <b>chamaephyte,</b> cryptophyte and therophyte species contributions. Compared to the other broad vegetation groups, the Mountain Renosterveld group showed phanerophyte contributions at the vegetation cover level to be highest, but the degree of succulence was low. Winter Rainfall Karoo vegetation was co-dominated by high levels of <b>chamaephyte,</b> cryptophyte and therophyte species with chamaephytes dominating the vegetation cover. Succulent contributions to species richness and cover values were higher than for Mountain Renosterveld vegetation. Tanqua Karoo vegetation was dominated by <b>chamaephyte</b> species or co-dominated by <b>chamaephyte</b> and cryptophyte species with therophyte species contributions lowest of all vegetation groups. Contributions by succulent species to richness and vegetation cover were high in the Tanqua Karoo. Life form spectra of the Mountain Renosterveld associations compared poorly to other sites in the Fynbos Biome. However, the low level of succulence in the Mountain Renosterveld associations also precludes its inclusion into the Succulent Karoo Biome. The large contribution of succulent species at a species and vegetation cover level in Winter Rainfall Karoo and Tanqua Karoo associations confirms that these two groups belong to the Succulent Karoo Biome. Affinities to the Nama Karoo Biome were indicated by the low level of succulence at a vegetation cover level in one of the Winter Rainfall Karoo associations (Roggeveld Karoo) ...|$|E

During this reaserch one species “Senecio joharchii (Asteraceae: Senecioneae) ” is presented as new species to science and three species are recorded for the first time from Iran...|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on Zarabad, Cheraghabad and Nogombecom plants of {{sub-basin}} watershed city of Chabahar, Iran. The studied flora included 78 species which belonged to 66 genera and 29 families. Poaceae with 16 genera and 19 species, Asteraceae with 7 genera and 8 species, Chenopodiaceae with 5 genera and 4 species, Papilionaceae, with 5 genera and 6 species, constituted the largest plant families respectively. The largest genera of the region were: Salsola, Heliotropium and Plantago, respectively. 42 % of the flora belonged to Nobo-Sindian elements, 35 %to Irano-Turanian, 18 %were bioregional elements and 5 % of the species were cosmopolitan. Flora of the studied area, included therophytes (56 %), <b>chamaephytes</b> (15 %), phanerophytes (14 %), geophytes (12 %) and hemicryptophytes (3 %) ...|$|R
50|$|Zino's petrel is {{endemic to}} the main island of Madeira, where it breeds on {{inaccessible}} and well-vegetated ledges in the central mountains between Pico do Areeiro and Pico Ruivo. The typical ledge plants are endemic hemicryptophytess and <b>Chamaephytes,</b> but grasses may also be present. It nests at heights above 1650 m. It was formerly more widespread, since subfossil remains {{have been found in}} a cave in eastern Madeira, and on nearby Porto Santo Island. The breeding ledges have to be inaccessible to introduced goats so that they remain rich in endemic flora. The vegetation ensures that there is sufficient earth on the ledges to allow the birds to burrow and make their nests, and trampling by grazing animals reduces the soil cover.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT – (Floristics, {{structure}} and soil of insular vegetation in four quartzite-sandstone outcrops of “Chapada Diamantina”, Northeast Brazil). Soil islands on rocky surfaces often harbor aggregated vegetation {{that consists of}} insular plant communities. These islands are typical of the rocky outcrops and {{in various parts of}} Brazil form the so-called “campos rupestres ” vegetation. Four of such sites have been selected in the state of Bahia, Northeast Brazil, for this comparative study on floristics and vegetation structure: three areas situated inside the “Parque Nacional da Chapada Diamantina ” (Guiné, Fumaça and “Gerais da Fumaça”) and one is at the border of the Environmental Protection Area of “Marimbus-Iraquara ” (“Mãe Inácia”). All occurring vegetation islands were studied in four random plots of 10 × 10 m per site. Soil was often shallow, sandy and acidic. Vascular plant species were determined, with respective life forms and canopy coverage areas. The total number of species when all four sites were added was 135, and the number of species per island varied from 2 to 32. The areas of the 214 soil islands varied from 0. 015 to 91. 9 m 2, totaling 568 m 2 in the four sites. Monocotyledon families were dominant, essentially Velloziaceae, as well as Orchidaceae, Bromeliaceae, Amaryllidaceae and Cyperaceae. Among the eudicotyledons, dominant families were mainly Clusiaceae, Asteraceae and Melastomataceae. The biological spectra revealed that phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes predominated among the life forms, while <b>chamaephytes</b> had the largest coverage area. Epilithic and desiccant <b>chamaephytes</b> composed the most conspicuous interspecific associations, and were probably related to early successional processes. Sites closest to one another were not the most similar in structure, indicating that other factors more relevant than distance might be involved in the abundance of species in space...|$|R
