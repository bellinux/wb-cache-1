40|$|<b>Cefpiramide</b> {{is a new}} Pseudomonas-active {{cephalosporin}} with a {{broad spectrum}} of antibacterial activity. Like cefoperazone, <b>cefpiramide</b> was moderately susceptible to hydrolysis by a variety of / 7 -lactamases from Gram-negative bacilli. Tests with 6552 bacterial isolates in five separate medical centres documented cefpiramide's effectiveness against the more commonly encountered bacterial pathogens. Additional studies with 761 selected isolates, representing 35 species, demonstrated similarities between <b>cefpiramide</b> and cefoperazone: <b>cefpiramide</b> was more active against Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Like most other cephalosporins, <b>cefpiramide</b> inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, non-enterococcal strepto-cocci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and /?-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae. <b>Cefpiramide</b> was marginally active against Streptococcusfaecalis (MIC 50...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefpiramide</b> (SM- 1652) {{were studied}} after the intravenous administration of single or multiple doses to 21 healthy volunteers. The <b>cefpiramide</b> concentration in plasma at time zero after a bolus intravenous injection of 500 or 1, 000 mg was 152 or 303 micrograms/ml, respectively. The maximum <b>cefpiramide</b> level in plasma {{at the end}} of a 1 -h infusion of 1, 000 or 2, 000 mg was 166 or 317 micrograms/ml, respectively. The mean plasma half-life of <b>cefpiramide</b> in 15 subjects who received a single dose of 500 or 1, 000 mg was 4. 44 h. There was no evidence of drug accumulation in plasma when 500 or 1, 000 mg of <b>cefpiramide</b> was administered 11 times at 12 -h intervals. Urinary excretion of <b>cefpiramide</b> over a 24 -h period was ca. 22. 5 %, regardless of the intravenous administration technique and the dosage. Fecal recoveries of <b>cefpiramide</b> varied from 0 to 36. 9 % in different subjects...|$|E
40|$|A microbroth {{dilution}} method {{was used to}} measure the MICs of <b>cefpiramide</b> (SM 1652), cefotaxime, moxalactam, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, piperacillin, and mezlocillin against 921 isolates of gram-negative (701) and gram-positive (220) bacteria. The activity of <b>cefpiramide</b> was equivalent to those of piperacillin and mezlocillin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive isolates, including enterococci. <b>Cefpiramide</b> had equivalent or slightly greater activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{efficacy of}} <b>cefpiramide</b> and ciprofloxacin alone and in combination was investigated and {{compared with that}} of ticarcillin plus tobramycin against pseudomonal infections in mice made neutropenic by administration of cyclosphosphamide. Therapy with <b>cefpiramide</b> plus ciprofloxacin was significantly more effective than that by either antibiotic alone. These results were consistent with in-vitro synergisu'c effects. At a higher dose of ciprofloxacin (4 mg/kg) plus <b>cefpiramide</b> (50 mg/kg), the combination therapy protected all neutropenic mice from fatal bacteraemia, and was more protective than ticarcillin (200 mg/kg) plus tobramycin (1 mg/kg). The peak serum concentration of <b>cefpiramide</b> in infected neutropenic mice was 51 mg/ 1 when they were given 50 mg/kg subcutaneously. Ciprofloxacin attained a peak serum concentration of 1 - 2 mg/ 1 and a serum half-life of 34 min...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefpiramide</b> {{is a new}} {{parenteral}} cephalosporin mainly excreted in the bile. Eight {{patients with}} cholestasis and 11 healthy subjects received a single 1 g i. v. dose. <b>Cefpiramide</b> concentrations in plasma and urine were measured by h. p. l. c. and plasma binding was determined by ultrafiltration. Total clearance of <b>cefpiramide</b> (mean +/- s. d.) was 15. 5 +/- 7. 1 ml min- 1 in patients and 25. 6 +/- 4. 6 ml min- 1 in healthy subjects. As a result, the terminal elimination half-life was longer in patients (12. 0 +/- 2. 9 h vs 5. 3 +/- 0. 9 h). Owing to impaired biliary elimination of <b>cefpiramide</b> in cholestasis, the urinary recovery of unchanged drug in patients was about five times greater than in healthy subjects (85. 1 +/- 10. 3 % vs 16. 2 +/- 3. 9 %). Plasma binding was significantly lower in cholestasis (fu = 0. 23 +/- 0. 13 vs 0. 02 +/- 0. 004 in healthy subjects). Accordingly, the dosage regimen of <b>cefpiramide</b> should be modified in patients with cholestasis...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of <b>cefpiramide</b> and apalcillin {{were compared with}} those of other third-generation cephalosporins and extended-spectrum penicillins against over 1, 000 clinical bacterial isolates. The activity of <b>cefpiramide</b> against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to those of piperacillin and cefoperazone, inhibiting 90 % of strains at concentrations {{less than or equal to}} 16. 0 micrograms/ml. This drug was also active against a broad range of gram-negative organisms but was generally less active than many of the other cephalosporins tested against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The activity of <b>cefpiramide</b> against gram-positive organisms was comparable to that of cefoperazone. Apalcillin, along with ceftazidime, was the most active agent tested against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subsp. anitratus, inhibiting 90 % of these strains at concentrations less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Against other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, its activity was similar to that of piperacillin. The activities of both <b>cefpiramide</b> and apalcillin were significantly reduced by the presence of several plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in a series of otherwise isogenic strains of P. aeruginosa in comparison with their activities against a parent strain which lacks these enzymes. Many strains of Enterobacter cloacae were synergistically inhibited by the combination of gentamicin with either <b>cefpiramide</b> (5 of 10 strains) or apalcillin (6 of 10 strains). Most strains of P. aeruginosa were synergistically inhibited by the combination of gentamicin with either <b>cefpiramide</b> (8 of 10 strains) or apalcillin (10 of 10 strains). However, cefoxitin antagonized the activity of both <b>cefpiramide</b> and apalcillin against most of these same strains...|$|E
40|$|The rate of {{bactericidal}} {{activity of}} a new cephalosporin, <b>cefpiramide,</b> was compared with amoxicillin and cefotaxime for ten strains of Streptococcus faecalis. <b>Cefpiramide</b> was bacteriostatic at 10 μg/ml and bactericidal at 100 μg/ml. Cefotaxime only reduced the growth rate. A paradoxical effect was observed in all ten strains tested against amoxicillin. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} {{of two new}} antimicrobial agents, apalcillin and <b>cefpiramide</b> (SM- 1652), were evaluated against 324 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Apalcillin (a penicillin derivative) and <b>cefpiramide</b> (a semisynthetic cephalosporin) were compared with piperacillin, moxalactam, and cefoxitin. Organisms studied included the Bacteroides fragilis group, other Bacteroides species, fusobacteria, clostridia, nonsporeforming gram-positive rods, and anaerobic cocci. Piperacillin {{was found to be}} the most active overall, inhibiting 96 % of the strains tested at its achievable level in serum (128 micrograms/ml). Apalcillin was comparable in activity to piperacillin, inhibiting 93 % of anaerobes tested at this concentration. The other antibiotics inhibited ca. 80 % of the strains at 32 micrograms/ml. In terms of activities against particular species, apalcillin was active against 75 % of B. fragilis group strains and 97 to 100 % of all other anaerobes. <b>Cefpiramide</b> inhibited 37 % of B. fragilis group strains at 32 micrograms/ml and 68 % at 64 micrograms/ml (a level that may be achievable with this drug). <b>Cefpiramide</b> inhibited 92 % of all other anaerobes at 32 micrograms/ml and 95 % at 64 micrograms/ml. The clostridia other than Clostridium perfringens were the most resistant (84 % inhibited at 32 micrograms/ml and 95 % inhibited at 64 micrograms/ml) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activities of}} BMY- 28142, cefbuperazone (BMY- 25182; formerly T- 1982), and <b>cefpiramide</b> (WY- 44635; formerly SM- 1652) {{were compared with}} those of cefmenoxime, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, and moxalactam. BMY- 28142 was the most active cephalosporin against the majority of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic microorganisms studied. Its spectrum of activity was very similar to that of cefotaxime. However, BMY- 28142, cefbuperazone, cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, and moxalactam were equivalent in activity and rate of killing against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. <b>Cefpiramide</b> was considerably less active than the other cephalosporins against the Enterobacteriaceae...|$|E
40|$|Penetration of <b>cefpiramide</b> and {{cefazolin}} into {{a specific}} extravascular fluid {{was measured with}} rabbits bearing capsules in the peritoneal cavity. A general feature of slow accumulation and elimination of drugs from extravascular sites having low surface area/volume ratios has also been observed in this study. The capsular concentration-time profiles were well expressed by the following equation: C(CF) = A(CF) [e-kel(CF) (t-to) -e-kp(CF) (t-to) ], where C(CF), A(CF), kp(CF), kel(CF), and to indicate capsular concentration at time t, constant for the dimension of concentration, capsule penetration rate constant, capsule elimination rate constant, and lag time before penetration occurs, respectively. The kp(CF), kel(CF), and to were 0. 139 h- 1, 0. 059 h- 1, and 0. 45 h, respectively, for <b>cefpiramide,</b> and 0. 448 h- 1, 0. 0145 h- 1, and 0. 14 h, respectively, for cefazolin. A(CF) was 22. 7 micrograms/ml for <b>cefpiramide</b> and 4. 53 micrograms/ml for cefazolin, being parallel to the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for free drug from to to infinity (20. 1 micrograms. h/ml for <b>cefpiramide</b> and 3. 43 micrograms. h/ml for cefazolin). In conclusion, {{it is suggested that}} as well as kp(CF) and kel(CF), the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for free drug from to to infinity may play an important role regarding the circulating reservoir of drugs in determining capsular concentration-time profiles in experimental models for particular extravascular sites of infection, like abscesses into which drugs cannot easily penetrate...|$|E
40|$|After {{intravenous}} administration of 1 g of <b>cefpiramide,</b> the biliary {{elimination of the}} drug was studied by using high-performance liquid chromatography. In five healthy volunteers, a mean peak concentration of 339 +/- 107 (standard error of the mean) micrograms/ml was measured in aspirated duodenal fluid during h 2 after administration, and 1. 2 % of the dose given was recovered over a 4 -h period. A maximal concentration of 1, 161 +/- 392 micrograms/ml was reached during h 2 in T-tube bile from 10 recently cholecystectomized patients, with a 24 -h biliary recovery of 23. 1 %; urinary recovery {{over the same period}} averaged 49. 4 %. In 10 patients undergoing cholecystectomy, the concentrations in serum, choledochal bile, gallbladder bile, and gallbladder wall 1 h after <b>cefpiramide</b> administration were 157 +/- 21, 1, 726 +/- 501, and 84 +/- 33 micrograms/ml and 23 +/- 4 micrograms/g, respectively. These figures represent the highest biliary concentrations attained so far with a beta-lactam antibiotic and are therefore a good prerequisite for treatment of biliary tract infections with <b>cefpiramide...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of {{a single}} 2. 0 -g intravenous dose of <b>cefpiramide</b> in patients with normal or impaired renal function were studied. Serial concentrations in serum and urine were measured by using high-performance liquid chromatography, {{and the effect of}} the concentration in serum on protein binding was assessed. Thirty patients (ten with creatinine clearances of greater than 80 ml/min, ten with creatinine clearances between 10 and 80 ml/min, and ten on dialysis) were studied. The concentration-time curve of <b>cefpiramide</b> was best described by an open two-compartment model. The elimination half-lives in patients with normal or impaired renal function or those on dialysis were 5. 41 +/- 1. 44, 8. 3 +/- 2. 82, and 8. 38 +/- 4. 06 h, respectively, and the serum clearances in the same groups were 2. 0 +/- 0. 84, 1. 29 +/- 0. 45, and 2. 04 +/- 1. 10 liters/h, respectively. There {{were no significant differences in}} any of the parameters among the three groups of patients. In patients with normal or impaired renal function, protein binding varied between 93. 0 +/- 1. 3 % at 304. 4 micrograms/ml and 99. 3 +/- 0. 8 % at 41. 1 micrograms/ml and was linearly and inversely related to the <b>cefpiramide</b> concentration in serum. In patients on dialysis, protein binding was significantly lower (P less than 0. 05) and varied between 88. 5 +/- 7. 1 % at 173. 4 micrograms/ml to 94. 9 +/- 4. 8 % at 46. 8 micrograms/ml. In patients with normal or abnormal renal function, renal <b>cefpiramide</b> clearance decreased linearly with declining renal function, whereas plasma clearance was maintained. Therefore, nonrenal elimination becomes more important as renal impairment progresses...|$|E
40|$|Influences of {{antibiotics}} on the fecal flora in children were studied for oral ampicillin, penicillin V, erythromycin, cefaclor, and gentamicin and for intravenous ampicillin, methicillin, <b>cefpiramide,</b> and ceftazidime. All antibiotics affected the normal flora, although {{the quality and}} quantity of the changes were variable. No substantial differences were noted between the oral and intravenous use of ampicillin with regard to its effect on the flora. Three penicillins, ampicillin, penicillin V, and methicillin, caused remarkable changes. The characteristic pattern observed was the considerable suppression of Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus species. Although enterobacteria did not significantly change in number, Klebsiella spp. frequently replaced Escherichia coli. In patients given erythromycin and cefaclor, the reduction in the number of Bifidobacterium spp. was 1 log 10 and that of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was 3 log 10. Gentamicin administered orally caused a drastic change, including a remarkable decline of E. coli to less than 2 log 10 /g of feces. <b>Cefpiramide,</b> a parenteral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin, suppressed normal flora so markedly that almost all species of organisms were eradicated, and the active growth of yeasts was promoted (2. 6 log 10 increase). Ceftazidime caused similar changes as <b>cefpiramide,</b> but the changes were less extensive. Yeasts increased after treatment with most antibiotic groups. This increase was particularly prominent in patients given oral penicillins and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins...|$|E

FEC- 1 differed notably from chromosomal E. coli cephalosporinase, especially in its broad-spectrum substrate profile and its high inhibition by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and imipenem. A conjugation study revealed that FEC- 1 was encoded by a 74 -megadalton plasmid, pFCX 1. This may be the first instance of a plasmid-mediated oxyimino-cephalosporinase from E. coli...|$|E
40|$|The antipseudomonal {{activity}} of so-called third and subsequent generation cephems was evaluated. The third and subsequent generation cephems {{have been reported}} to have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their potency and clinical efficacy against pseudomonal infections, however, vary from drug to drug. Judging from our experience and our review of the literature, the four drugs, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, <b>cefpiramide</b> and ceftazidime are of value in clinical practice, though the effect of these drugs is not sufficient. In {{view of the fact that}} concomitant use of cefsulodin and cefmenoxime eradicated Pseudomonas aeruginosa in as much as 82. 9 % of the patients who had complicated UTI due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, concomitant therapy of these four drugs in various combinations is a future subject to be studied...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the in vitro synergistic activity at clinically attainable concentrations of combinations of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam antibiotics against 30 gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli. All 56 pairs of 4 aminoglycosides and 14 beta-lactams were evaluated. Combinations with amikacin demonstrated inhibitory synergistic activity in 29 % of the assays, {{as compared with}} 22 % for netilmicin (P = 0. 018), 17 % for gentamicin (P less than 0. 001), and 13 % for tobramycin (P less than 0. 001). Among the beta-lactams, combinations with cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, or <b>cefpiramide</b> (SM- 1652) demonstrated inhibitory synergistic activity most often (39, 38, and 35 % of the assays, respectively) and with ceforanide, cefsulodin, and imipenem least often (less {{than or equal to}} 8 % each). The most active combination was amikacin and ceftriaxone, with which 67 % of the assays demonstrated inhibitory synergism. Isolates with high-level resistance to either antibiotic in a combination were unlikely to be inhibited synergistically by the combination. Further, combinations generally demonstrated little synergistic activity against isolates highly susceptible to beta-lactams...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} effect of cefozopran (SCE- 2787), a new semisynthetic parenteral cephalosporin, against experimental infections in mice was examined. Cefozopran {{was more effective}} than <b>cefpiramide</b> and was as effective as ceftazidime and cefpirome against acute respiratory tract infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae DT-S. In the model of chronic respiratory tract infection caused by K. pneumoniae 27, cefozopran was as effective as ceftazidime. The {{therapeutic effect}} of cefozopran against urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa P 9 was superior to that of cefpirome and was equal to those of ceftazidime and cefclidin. In addition, cefozopran was more effective than ceftazidime and was as effective as flomoxef in a thigh muscle infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus 308 A- 1. Against thigh muscle infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus N 133, cefozopran was the most effective agent. The potent therapeutic effect of cefozopran in those experimental infections in mice suggests {{that it would be}} effective against respiratory tract, urinary tract, and soft tissue infections caused by a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in humans...|$|E
40|$|Many {{cephalosporin}} antibiotics {{have recently}} been invented and {{attempts have been made}} to use them clinically. The choice of which of these drugs should be used has been difficult in gynecology. The efficacies of these drugs depend on their antibacterial spectra, potencies, and concentrations in tissues. This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of various cephem antibiotics in the exudate of the retroperitoneal space that is formed after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. These cephem antibiotics were cefoxitin, cefotiam, cefotetan, <b>cefpiramide,</b> cefminox, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, cefpimizole, flomoxef, and cefuzonam. The maximum concentrations after administration of a 1 -g dose in the exudate of the pelvic retroperitoneal space were 37. 9 micrograms/ml with cefminox, 30. 3 micrograms/ml with cefpimizole, 21. 6 micrograms/ml with flomoxef, 21. 5 micrograms/ml with ceftazidime, and 17. 6 micrograms/ml with cefbuperazone, which were relatively high. When selecting antibiotics for prophylactic use against infections in the retroperitoneal space after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, on the basis of drug transfer, flomoxef, cefminox, cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, and cefpimizole were considered to be the drugs of first choice at a dose of 1 g...|$|E
40|$|Eisai hyperbilirubinemic mutant rats (EHBRs) with {{conjugated}} hyperbilirubinemia {{were recently}} derived from Sprague-Dawley rats (SDRs). The pharmacokinetic {{characteristics of the}} beta-lactam antibiotic <b>cefpiramide</b> (CPM), which is mainly excreted into bile, were investigated in 10 - and 20 -week-old EHBRs and were compared with those in 20 -week-old healthy SDRs. The pharmacokinetic parameters of CPM after an intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg of body weight were estimated for each rat by noncompartmental methods. When compared with age-matched healthy SDRs, significant decreases (by approximately 30 %) in the systemic clearance of CPM were observed in 20 -week-old EHBRs. The biliary clearance of CPM in 20 -week-old EHBRs markedly decreased to less than 10 % of that in age-matched healthy SDRs, while total urinary recovery of unchanged CPM increased to threefold and renal clearance doubled. However, {{no significant differences in}} any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of CPM were observed between the two groups of EHBRs. There were no significant differences among the three groups in the steady-state volume of distribution of CPM.

40|$|Intraoperative wound {{infection}} and postoperative pulmonary and urinary tract infections {{are the major}} problems that face the transplant surgeon today. These infections are the major cause of the mortality after renal transplantation. Almost any microorganism could be causative. But, in this paper, only bacterial infections will be discussed. Prophylaxis of intraoperative infection {{is the same as}} that used for general surgery. In addition, one of the major defects in the recipient is defective renal function, resulting in general weakness. The use of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents (eg, cefmetazole etc.), effective against many different bacteria from gram-positive cocci to gram negative rods, administered to these patients will produce dramatic results. Aminoglycosides are nephrotoxic and should not be given to the patients having renal failure. Piperacillin or the third generational cephems (ceftizoxime, latamoxef, cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, ceftriaxon and ceftazidime) are the drugs of choice for postoperative infections, especially for urinary tract infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa should be treated with cefsulodin, cefoperazone, or <b>cefpiramide</b> by the intravenous route. After chemotherapeutic and antibiotic therapy sterilizes the urine, this should be followed by suppressive therapy with quinolone- carboxylic acid (pipemidic acid, norfloxacin, enoxacin and DL- 8280), combinations of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, sulfonamides, or fosfomycin for many weeks or months.

The relationship among therapeutic activity, in vitro antibacterial activity, total or free (unbound) levels in serum, and homogenized whole lung levels was investigated. In the intraperitoneal infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae, the 50 % effective doses (ED 50 s) of the cephem antibiotics {{correlated with the}} area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values of free levels in serum and the MICs but not with those of total levels in serum. A linear relationship was seen between 1 /ED 50 values and AUC of free levels in serum/MIC values. On the other hand, in mice with pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae, the number of bacteria in the lung closely correlated with the AUC of the antibiotic concentration in lung tissue. There was a direct correlation between the levels in lung tissue and total levels in serum but not free levels in serum. The cephem antibiotics tested {{in this study were}} bound only slightly to homogenates of mouse lung.

The results are as follows: The therapeutic efficacy was analyzed in 254 patients (136 cases administered CPM and 118 cases administered CFS) after excluding 20 cases as drop-out. Among 254 cases, the number of patients with infection of P. aeruginosa was 190 cases (100 cases administered CPM and 90 cases administered CFS), while that with infection of organisms other than P. aeruginosa was 64 cases (36 cases administered CPM and 28 cases administered CFS). By the administration of a 2 g/day dose for 5 days, the overall clinical effective rate of CPM was significantly higher than that of CFS in total patients. When the patients were classified into 2 groups with respect to causative organisms (P. aeruginosa and others), the clinical effective rate of CPM in patients with infections of P. aeruginosa was significantly higher than that of CFS, while the clinical effective rate of CPM in patients with infection of other organisms than P. aeruginosa was {{the same as that of}} CFS. As to the bacteriological effect on bacteriuria, the eradication rate of CPM was significantly higher than that of CFS not only against all causative organisms but also against P. aeruginosa. The rate of replacement by S. faecalis was significantly higher in the CFS-treated group than in the CPM-treated group. The same result was obtained on the rate of replacement by other organisms. The MIC values of CPM for isolated organisms before drug administration were lower than those of CFS.
