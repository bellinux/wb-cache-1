They are easy to remove and always reveal a [...] underneath, which is an {{indentation}} in the <b>casting</b> <b>surface.</b> s are similar to buckles, except they are thin line indentations and not associated with scabs. Another similar defect is s, which are buckles that occur in the cope of sand castings. All of these defects are visual in nature and are no reason to scrap the workpiece. These defects are caused by overly high pouring temperatures or deficiencies of carbonaceous material.|$|E

50|$|Next, a {{chemically}} reactive bondbreaker is sprayed on the form's surfaces {{to prevent}} the cast concrete from bonding with the slab. This allows the cast element to separate from the <b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> once it has cured. This is a critical step, as improper chemical selection or application will prevent {{the lifting of the}} panels, and will entail costly demolition and rework.|$|E
40|$|The air-gap {{nucleation}} time, {{the stress}} evolution and the solid shell growth pattern are examined for different mold topographies {{to illustrate the}} potential control of aluminum <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> morphologies {{during the early stages}} of solidification using proper design of mold topographies. The interaction between heat transfer and deformation during the early stages of solidification is considered in this work. Simulation results show that a sinusoidal mold surface with a smaller wavelength leads to an earlier nucleation of air-gaps. In addition, the unevenness in the solid-shell growth pattern decreases faster for a smaller wavelength. Such studies can be used to tune mold surfaces for control of <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> morphologies...|$|R
40|$|The DC {{casting process}} {{used for the}} {{production}} of cast aluminium alloy products intended for processing by rolling, extrusion or forging is an economically important process with approximately 10 million tonnes of DC cast product being produced annually world wide [1]. Process productivity, particularly with respect to elimination of casting defects and hence process scrap is an important factor to DC cast product producers. The literature reporting the DC casting process, particularly with respect to the formation of defects on the <b>cast</b> <b>surface,</b> is reviewed and the mechanisms for the formation of such defects examined. A universally understood and accepted explanation was found for only one of the normal surface defects encountered in practice. A number of samples of commercially cast DC products were subject to detailed <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> examination, particularly surface microstructures. The results of this examination and the literature survey identified molten metal surface tension as a possible contributing factor affecting the molten metal meniscus stability within the DC casting mould. Meniscus instability is linked with the formation of surface defects. The literature on surface tension of aluminium alloys provided only limited information hence the surface tension of a range of binary and ternary alloys, including commercial alloys was determined, producing data hitherto not available. Of the common alloying elements used in commercial aluminium alloys, iron and magnesium were found to significantly reduce the surface tension. Surface fracture also resulted in a reduction in surface tension for the majority of alloys tested. The surface tension data is combined with mould thermal and physical model calculations to propose a mechanism for the formation of the <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> defects. The model proposes a maximum stable size for the meniscus according to the alloy and mould conditions. Conditions outside these limits result in meniscus instability and the formation of <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> defects. The model suggests possible operating changes that may reduce the incidence of surface defect formation. The work also identifies a number of areas requiring further investigation before major practical process changes aimed at <b>cast</b> <b>surface</b> defect elimination, may be formulated...|$|R

Specimens with cast, ground, or polished surface were evaluated {{to study the}} effect of surface condition on NDE and fatigue crack initiation. Fractographic and metallurgical analyses were performed to determine the nature of crack precursors. Preliminary results show that fatigue strength was lower for specimens with <b>cast</b> <b>surfaces</b> than for specimens with machined surfaces. The liquid penetrant and gas penetrant techniques both provided indications of a large population of defects on the <b>cast</b> <b>surfaces.</b> On ground or polished specimen surfaces, the gas penetrant appeared to estimate {{the actual number of}} voids more accurately than the liquid penetrant...|$|R
50|$|After {{degating}} {{and heat}} treating, sand or other molding media may remain {{adhered to the}} casting. To remove any mold remnants, the surface is cleaned using a blasting process. This means a granular media will be propelled against {{the surface of the}} casting to mechanically knock away the adhering sand. The media may be blown with compressed air, or may be hurled using a shot wheel. The cleaning media strikes the <b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> at high velocity to dislodge the mold remnants (for example, sand, slag) from the <b>casting</b> <b>surface.</b> Numerous materials may be used to clean cast surfaces, including steel, iron, other metal alloys, aluminium oxides, glass beads, walnut shells, baking powder, and many others. The blasting media is selected to develop the color and reflectance of the cast surface. Terms used to describe this process include cleaning, bead blasting, and sand blasting. Shot peening may be used to further work-harden and finish the surface.|$|E
50|$|Tilt-up {{construction}} requires significant {{organization and}} collaboration {{on the building}} site. The chronological steps {{that need to be}} taken for a tilt-up project are: site evaluation, engineering, footings and floor slabs, forming tilt-up panels, steel placement, embeds and inserts, concrete placement, panel erection and panel finishing. Once the pad (<b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> or floor slab) has cured, forms are built on top. Dimensional lumber, a high quality plywood or fiber board that has at least one smooth face is typically used, although aluminum or steel forms are also common. Carpenters work from engineered drawings designed for each panel or element to construct on site. They incorporate all door and window openings, as well as architectural features and other desired shapes that can be molded into the concrete. Studs, gussets and attachment plates are located within the form for embedding in the concrete. The forms are usually anchored to the <b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> with masonry nails or otherwise adhered to prevent damage to the floor slab.|$|E

40|$|Cylinder heads have an {{extremely}} complex shape with {{large areas of}} concave <b>casting</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The concave <b>casting</b> <b>surfaces</b> are often associated with metal expansion penetration problems or other surface defects, e. g. surface shrinkage. The defects cause high production costs due to component rejection and increased fettling time. This report presents {{an investigation of the}} microstructure in grey cast iron close to the sand-metal interface affected by metal penetration in a complex shaped casting. The dominant penetration defect observed in the cylinder heads was expansion penetration. Even pre-solidification penetration and sand crack defects were observed. The microstructure found in the non penetrated areas is typical for solidification of grey iron cast in sand moulds...|$|R
40|$|Communication of {{specifications}} {{between a}} customer and a manufacturer {{is important for}} meeting form, fit, and functional requirements of any part. Current standards for the requirements of <b>cast</b> metal <b>surfaces</b> use qualitative methods, including comparator plates and images of surfaces, to specify the surface quality allowing ample room for variation in interpretation of the standard. The length scale of existing contact surface measurements is too small for most <b>casting</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This paper covered a proposed digital standard for specifying <b>cast</b> metal <b>surfaces.</b> The proposed digital standard used point cloud data of a <b>cast</b> <b>surface,</b> likely attained using a non-contact capture method, {{in order to identify}} roughness properties and anomalies caused by the casting process. Unlike current qualitative methods, this standard does not specify the potential causes of surface issues, such as porosity or inclusions. This standard was developed in order to reduce measurement variation and eliminate confusion between the customer and manufacturer. Assigning quantitative criterion to the surface allows the customer to specify exactly what is needed as opposed to limiting them to a subjective comparator or image to base their requirements. Additionally, this quantitative method could be used to verify visual inspection results among the inspectors within a production facility to reduce their measurement error and improve productivity...|$|R

50|$|The cast tape only dries {{from one}} side, the exposed surface, as the <b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> is impermeable. Drying is {{dependent}} on two processes, namely the evaporation of the solvent from the surface, and the diffusion of the solvent through the tape towards the single exposed surface. The evaporation may be sped up by applying air drying. However, usually evaporation {{should be limited to}} ensure steady diffusion of the solvent. If the solvent does not leave the sheet in a controlled fashion, the tape may crack or curl.|$|E
50|$|Up to 5% of {{reducing}} agents, such as coal powder, pitch, creosote, and fuel oil, may {{be added to}} the molding material to prevent wetting (prevention of liquid metal sticking to sand particles, thus leaving them on the <b>casting</b> <b>surface),</b> improve surface finish, decrease metal penetration, and burn-on defects. These additives achieve this by creating gases at the surface of the mold cavity, which prevent the liquid metal from adhering to the sand. Reducing agents are not used with steel casting, because they can carburize the metal during casting.|$|E

50|$|In many {{implementations}} it is {{practical to}} render only {{a subset of}} the objects in the scene to the shadow map in order to save some of {{the time it takes to}} redraw the map. Also, a depth offset which shifts the objects away from the light may be applied to the shadow map rendering in an attempt to resolve stitching problems where the depth map value is close to the depth of a surface being drawn (i.e., the shadow <b>casting</b> <b>surface)</b> in the next step. Alternatively, culling front faces and only rendering the back of objects to the shadow map is sometimes used for a similar result.|$|E

50|$|FreeFAB Wax™, {{invented by}} James B Gardiner and Steven Janssen at Laing O'Rourke (construction company). The {{patented}} {{technology has been}} in development since March 2013. The technique uses construction scale 3D printing to print high volumes of engineered wax (up to 400L/hr) to fabricate a 'fast and dirty' 3D printed mould for precast concrete, glass fibre reinforced concrete (GRC) and other sprayable/cast-able materials. The mould <b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> is then 5 axis milled removing approximately 5mm of wax to create a high quality mould (approximately 20 micron surface roughness). After the component has cured, the mould is then either crushed or melted-off and the wax filtered and re-used, significantly reducing waste compared to conventional mould technologies. The benefits of the technology are fast mould fabrication speeds, increased production efficiencies, reduced labour and virtual elimination of waste by re-use of materials for bespoke moulds compared to conventional mould technologies.|$|E

The shape, morphology, and position of pericytes {{were compared to}} corresponding imprints on the <b>cast</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Pericytes, observed in digested tissue specimens, showed a typical morphological pattern: a central body with two primary processes that run along the capillary in opposite directions. From these primary processes, secondary ones arise and often encircle the vessel almost completely.

40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} {{mechanisms of}} horizontal wrinkles and water wave wrinkles on steel <b>casting</b> <b>surface</b> {{have been investigated}} in this study. The horizontal wrinkles, which are the traces of rising steel flow overlapping, are caused by low pouring temperature and slow molten steel flow rising rate.
