50|$|A sales quote is {{prepared}} {{in the form}} of a pro forma invoice which is different from a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice.</b> It is used to create a sale and is sent in advance of the <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice.</b> The content of a pro forma invoice is almost identical to a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> and is usually considered a binding agreement although the price may change in advance of the final sale.|$|E
50|$|In some countries, customs may {{accept a}} pro forma invoice (generated by the {{importer}} {{and not the}} exporter) if the required <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> is not {{available at the time}} when filing entry documents at the port of entry to get goods released from customs. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, for example, uses pro forma invoices to assess duty and examine goods, but the importer on record is required to post a bond and produce a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> within 120 days from the date of entry. If the required <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> is needed for statistical purposes, the importer has to produce the <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> within 50 days from the date Customs releases the goods to the importer.|$|E
50|$|A {{pro forma}} invoice {{is the same}} as a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> which, when used in {{international}} trade, represents the details of an international sale to customs authorities.

40|$|Documents {{issued in}} one country often have to be legalised (authenticated) {{before they can be}} used in another country. Different types of {{documents}} (legal papers) such as birth, death and marriage records, deeds of assignments, powers of attorney, <b>commercial</b> <b>invoices</b> etc. need to be legalised by the Destination Country before they can be assumed legal. Legalising a document simply means confirming that official documents are sealed and signed either with an Apostille Certificate for countries {{that are part of the}} Hague convention 1961, or with a Certificate of Authentication where countries are not party to The Hague Convention. Legalising (authenticating) documents is a process of verification of signatures. The aim of this research is to critically examine the current processes of document legalisation, through analysing and establishing the opportunities that lie before the organisation to implement a new process in document legalisation to replace the prolonged historical process currently used in some countries, specifically the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Using enterprise network technology 1, this research will also produce a solution to the risks involved, the implementation and the security, and it will also analyse the impact of such implementation to the organisation. Considering the project, which explores a very sensitive area in the organisation and one of major change to the organisation’s business process, the authenticity of data must be given a high priority. Therefore, an online survey may not always be a legitimate approach. A paper survey may well fit the purpose but, on the other hand, a detailed interview and/ or telephone survey will be even more accurate. Hence I made use of a mixed method (qualitative/ quantitative) approach. The business of document legalisation goes back in history by more than two thousand years and, therefore, needs to be explored historically, establishing how the business of the document legalisation process has evolved alongside the established professions in government today, and defining the areas of concern such as security, availability, traceability and mobility. This will pave the way for an investigation to evaluate a new process that can utilise available technology to solve the areas of concern. The current process of Document Legalisation has been used for many years and a change in this process may take some time. There are many possible pitfalls that the programme may encounter, one of which is the change to a process that has not yet been established in any other area of the world, so there are no other occurrences in this subject for comparison. A clear and informative document explaining the project – a Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time Limit (SMART) description of the project – will solve any conflict. Considering that the research in th is complex topic runs in history for more than two thousand years, a mixed method approach should be used. However, to elaborate the methodology that can explore the underlying philosophical assumption taken by researchers a mixed methodology term should be more accurate, due to the history and composition of knowledge that have been accumulated in this topic. Hence clarification is needed to establish reasons and define a new approach in the document legalisation process. In addition to the historical literature, the main groups taken into consideration to form the data are the decision makers, interviews with senior staff and a survey for employees working in the field of document legalisation. To find reasons for every step in document legalisation, experiments should not be ignored. The reason for this is to clarify the area of data mismatch. The scope of the project will discuss the current risk involved in the current process of legalising documents, identifying its weaknesses, and the needs and requirements of the newly proposed process with recommendations to establish a solution utilising state of the art technology to provide a new secure, mobile and traceable process which is available 24 / 7...|$|R

Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and customs declaration. For example, the form many require an Hs code (harmonize code), which helps define the type of goods and their associated tax rate, if any. Also, the forms normally require the traveler to note the country of origin of the goods and may sometimes require a certificate of origin. These forms {{can also be used}} when hand carrying goods across a border. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods. For that reason, importers often use a customs brokerage to clear goods through customs.|$|E
50|$|A {{letter of}} credit or LC can also {{be the source of}} payment for a transaction, meaning that redeeming the {{letter of credit}} will pay an exporter. Letters of credit are used {{primarily}} in international trade transactions of significant value, for deals between a supplier in one country and a customer in another. They are also used in the land development process to ensure that approved public facilities (streets, sidewalks, stormwater ponds, etc.) will be built. The parties to a letter of credit are usually a beneficiary who is to receive the money, the issuing bank of whom the applicant is a client, and the advising bank of whom the beneficiary is a client. Almost all letters of credit are irrevocable, i.e., cannot be amended or canceled without prior agreement of the beneficiary, the issuing bank and the confirming bank, if any. In executing a transaction, letters of credit incorporate functions common to giros and traveler's cheque. Typically, the documents a beneficiary has to present in order to receive payment include a <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice,</b> bill of lading, and a document proving the shipment was insured against loss or damage in transit. However, the list and form of documents is open to imagination and negotiation and might contain requirements to present documents issued by a neutral third party evidencing the quality of the goods shipped, or their place of origin.|$|E

40|$|Sikorsky is {{currently}} negotiating the SDTA {{proposal for the}} CH- 53 K helicopter. Due to the Truth In Negotiations Act (TINA), when submitting a proposal to the government all suppliers with a total award greater than $ 700, 000 need to have supporting documentation (material substantiation) showing that pricing is fair and reasonable. This can be accomplished through competition, a cost-price analysis (CPA), or commerciality. Each entity involved in the proposal prefers a different substantiation method: the government prefers CPA or competition, the suppliers prefer commerciality, and Sikorsky prefers competition. Because the government and suppliers have opposing views on commerciality, the government has increased the oversight {{and complexity of the}} commercial process. Previously, a proposal's commerciality claims required only a commerciality claim form and an invoice showing that the part had been sold to a commercial entity, but did not require the supplier to provide the <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice</b> price. For the SDTA proposal, an approved commerciality claim required a commerciality form, non-redacted invoices showing pricing information and the customer to which the part was sold, an escalated price analysis to support price reasonableness, a detailed list of modifications to the commercial part, an estimated cost of the modifications, and final commercial end user information. The commercial process involved roughly 90 Sikorsky employees and required roughly 11 months to fulfill all of the government's SDTA commercial requirements. As a comparison, CPA substantiation was completed 4 months prior to commerciality. Reasons for the long cycle time include labor time, a lengthy paper internal approval process including process downtime, lost or misprocessed documents, and insufficient employee training. To combat these inefficiencies, a formalized commercial substantiation process that uses an electronic workspace to provide process control is proposed in this thesis. The formalized commercial substantiation process decreases the required labor hours by an estimated 43 %, decreases the internal approval cycle time by 74 %, and provides secure document management. These improvements not only benefit the company internally, but also provide external benefits like an increase in government satisfaction which will help Sikorsky attain additional government contracts. by Carolyn Marie Freeman.

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Master of Business Administration, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 46). A freight forwarder, forwarder, or forwarding agent is a person or company that organizes shipments for individuals or corporations to get goods from the manufacturer or producer to a market, customer or final point of distribution. Forwarders contract with a carrier to move the goods. A forwarder does not move the goods but acts as an expert in supply chain management. A forwarder contracts with carriers to move cargo ranging from raw agricultural products to manufactured goods. Information typically reviewed by a freight forwarder includes the <b>commercial</b> <b>invoice,</b> shipper's export declaration, bill of lading and other documents required by the carrier or country of export, import, and/or transhipment. Nowadays, the freight forwarding is not limited within the same geographical limit of any country. Due to globalization and free market economy, this industry is facing severe competition. As the competition among companies are rapidly increasing, many companies are trying to provide distinct services in terms of air freight forwarding, sea freight forwarding, customs brokerage, consolidation, logistics management, Off-Dock services, household removal, transportation and so on. Novo Cargo is totally committed to provide a total transportation services to their clients irrespective {{of the size of}} consignment. They plan, coordinate, supervise, document and monitor the entire movement system of consignment. As Freight forwarding and logistics service sector is gradually developing to be a huge service sector so I am glad {{to have an opportunity to}} work in Novo cargo Services Ltd. to explore their activities and build up an analytical insight regarding their services. As important freight forwarding and logistics services, Off-Dock offers entire item-wise package of service activities for handling the temporary empty/laden container storage, loading/unloading general export/import goods, and containers under custom clearance. It is an equivalent of a seaport located in the hinterland. Novo Cargo uses Esack depot as a part of Off-Dock facilities which is located adjacent to Chittagong port. Novo Cargo’s dynamic approach to household removal business is well supported by the concerned authorities in Bangladesh. The objective of the company is to deliver reliable, cost effective transportation and management of clients’ goods. Novo Cargo also offers other comprehensive services like air and sea freight, surface services, customs brokerages, cargo management, chartering, consolidation, warehousing and distribution, inland transportation and so on. SWOT, PEST and STP analysis of Novo Cargo are done here to identify its competitive advantage through analyzing its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, find out macro-environmental factors used in the environmental scanning and use the formula of segmentation, targeting and positioning for strategic marketing. Though Novo Cargo is also facing more or less challenging situations in the current market, but it is well organized and is able to offer a full range of professional logistics services to its customers as well as overseas partners. It operates with a commitment to the global sea and air freight customers through highly qualified and experienced professional team specializing in all international logistics and customs requirements.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 33). This report is prepared {{on the basis of}} my three-month practical experience at Bio-Pharma Ltd. This internship program helped me to learn about the practical scenario of a Pharmaceutical Company. In Bangladesh, pharmaceutical sector {{is one of the most}} developed hi tech sector which is contributing in the country. This industry contributes the national earnings through exporting world class medicines all over the world. While dealing with foreign party, the activities of international business start. The pharmaceutical industry is considered to be one of the most potential and thriving industries in Bangladesh. This is one particular sector where against all odds; Bangladesh has achieved nearly self- sufficiency. Biopharma is the leading pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh in spite of the dominant presence of number of renowned Multinational companies. With almost 1700 employees, the company is maintaining the highest domestic market share and at the same time the highest share in pharmaceutical export of the country. As a student of Business, I feel the importance to reveal its international business activities and enrich my knowledge in order to relating the pharmaceutical industry and its operations with my academic studies. While working at Biopharma Ltd., I have been assigned to do different types of tasks which are equally important for other type of organization. I have done the following tasks: Business development is a very important tool with which a company expands its business to other markets and creates a potential market for its own. Therefore, a company should be very careful about this matter. In order to develop a business, a company needs to know some basic information about the environmental forces, i. e. demographic, political, economical, socio-cultural, legal, and technical and so on. Due to working in Biopharma, I learnt those etiquettes more clearly and concisely. Communication manner is also an important practice for all business personnel. I learned written communication through which a pharmaceutical company creates business relationships and involves with corporate activities. In order to operate business in abroad, first thing comes is a buyer or an importer who will sell the products in its country. For doing this there should be an agreement by which the parties would agree to do business together with trust. This agreement mentions all the rights and obligations, terms and conditions regarding partnership for both the parties [...] In Biopharma, I studied some negotiation incidents as well. From the study I learned that both companies always try to win the game through negotiation. Sometimes, negotiation reaches to a dead end and after that people come again and try to find out the best possible situation which would be profitable for both. Though shipping procedure is a vast thing and it is not possible to understand the whole thing in this short time. However, I managed to observe these situations and did some tasks which reduced my fear about the complicated processes and enriched my ability and experience. For a shipment one needs to know some basic things without which it would be nearly impossible to operate a shipment. Those things are: a. Type of Payment: b. Incoterms: c. Bill of Lading and Airway Bill: d. Paper Submissions: e. Certificate of Origin (COO) : In order to get bank clearance, I have learnt what papers do it needed to submit and the number of copies. Same was with the customs clearance. It might seem very easy but to me, at first, it was seemed very complicated when I was studying them. Documentation is very important tasks to be done. It is simple but very complex series of job. I did for sorting papers for buyers and office. I did sorting papers for pre-shipment as well. For this I have learnt about Form 10 A, EXP, Insurance, Packing list, <b>Commercial</b> <b>Invoice</b> and others. At the international business department of Biopharma Ltd., very few things were left that I didn’t do. I have done almost every possible staffs which are equally important in every organization including pharmaceutical companies in dealing with foreign delegates. The international business department of Biopharma does many tasks. This report has been prepared by on the basis of experience gathered during the period of internship and my own learning and understandings. The entire process has been made by collecting primary data which played a vital role to write down the report and secondary data was needed for supportive structured build-up to the report...|$|E
