An agreement was reached on the use of based on proven technologies CNFC-FR (Closed Nuclear Fuel Cycles and Fast Reactors), as a reference system for <b>common</b> <b>assessment.</b> <b>Common</b> <b>principles,</b> however, did not eliminate among participating countries essential discrepancies neither in existing nuclear power systems nor in development strategies, which has led to discrepancies in implementation of CFC. Gas and lead coolant are proposed along with sodium, and nitride (more dense) as well as metallic fuel – along with MOX, so the different fuel cycles. Since 2000, IV-generation reactors cooled with water at supercritical state (SCWR – Supercritical Water-Cooled Reactors) are developed in many countries. Construction of demonstration facilities are planned to 2025, followed by commercial nuclear power systems. Development of SCWR will correct the development of nuclear power industry strategy and the CFC in several countries. This paper considers characteristics of CFC implementation in Russia, milestones, dates, problems arising. The use of fast neutron spectrum SCWR reactors within CFC is justified...|$|R

Basically, assessment for lecturers is not a novelty. Assessment is important since it is done in every learning process. It is necessary to be done because the result of assessment can be used as one of the standards of learners’ competency in understanding the material. Number and value can be used as the standard of learning success since they are the characteristics of the assessment. In doing the assessment of learning outcomes, the lecturers should notice the <b>assessment</b> <b>principles</b> as the qualified assessments guidelines. The <b>assessment</b> <b>principles</b> which are needed to be actualized in the assessment of learning outcomes in speaking ability are validation principle, competence education, objective, fair, open, continuity, comprehensive and economical. Based on the reality, some speaking ability’s <b>assessment</b> <b>principles</b> in higher education have not fully actualized yet.   The effort to realize the speaking ability’s <b>assessment</b> <b>principle</b> in higher education is by doing assessment based on information technology.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} which is aimed to increase the service quality in public organization by extending the quality management applications is to; put forward the effect of European Union <b>Common</b> <b>Assessment</b> Framework {{which is one of}} the implementation and organizational self-assessment model in public administration of total quality management ({{which is one of the}} theory of modern management) on public organization according to the employee perception by carrying out organizational self-assessment. The research group consists of; 379 employeeS surveyed at the central organization of Ministryr of Labor and Social Security in which the <b>Common</b> <b>Assessment</b> Framework is applied and 247 employees surveyed at the Sports General Directorate Central Organization of the Ministry of Youth and Sport in which the <b>Common</b> <b>Assessment</b> Framework is not applied. This research consists of a descriptive (descriptive- quantification) study in which the scanning model was used. In this research; as a data collection tool a Likert type <b>Common</b> <b>Assessment</b> Framework Organizational Quality Scale (CAF-OQS) which is developed by us was used. In order for the content validity of the scale, we benefitted From expert opinion composed of 11 people and pilot scheme and also for the construct validation Exploratory Factor Analysis iwas carried out. In order to determine the scale reliability the Cronbach alpha coefficient was calculated. Item-total correlation is approximately between. 70 and. 90 and cronbach alpha value is. 98. The eigenvalue graph of the scale showed that the scale has an integrated structure with a single factor. The explained variance was calculated as 69. 53 % and this showed that the scale has presented the single factor variable which is called “Organizational Quality” as approximately 70 %. As the value of the factor loading which shows whether the item belongs to a factor or not is approximately between. 80 and. 90, and it presented that the items have a high relation with the organizational quality factor. In terms of the organizational variance of the employees organizational quality sense, whether the <b>Common</b> <b>Assessment</b> Framework is carried or not it was estimated that the average of Ministry of Labor and Social Security (= 71. 37) is meaningly higher than Sports General Directorate average (= 57. 16). This verity shows us that in the eye of the employees, the organizational quality of the public organization in which the <b>Common</b> <b>Assessment</b> Framework is carried out is affected in a positive way. As a result, to test the effect of the European Union <b>Common</b> <b>Assessment</b> Framework on the public organization, at first, a scale was developed on the basis of criteria of the <b>Common</b> <b>Assessment</b> Framework, and then the <b>Common</b> <b>Assessment</b> Framework put forward a positive impact on the public organization by making organizational self-assessment of the central organization of the two ministries with this scale measuring organizational quality [...] Key Words: Management, Total quality management, public administration, organizational self-assessment, <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> framework (CAF), sports management...|$|R

40|$|Under the Common Core State Standard (CCSS) initiative, {{states that}} voluntarily adopt the common core {{standards}} {{work together to}} develop a <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> in order to supplement and replace existing state <b>assessments.</b> However, the <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> may not cover all state standards, so states within the consortium can augment the assessment using locally developed items that align with state-specific standards {{to ensure that all}} necessary standards are measured. The purpose of this dissertation was to evaluate the linking accuracy of the augmented tests using the common-item nonequivalent groups design. Pseudo-test analyses were conducted by splitting a large-scale math assessment in half, creating two parallel <b>common</b> <b>assessments,</b> and by augmenting two sets of state-specific items from a large-scale science assessment. Based upon some modifications of the pseudo-data, a simulated study was also conducted. For the pseudo-test analyses, three factors were investigated: (1) the difference in ability between the new and old test groups, (2) the differential effect size for the <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> and state-specific item set, and (3) the number of common items. For the simulation analyses, the latent-trait correlations between the <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> and state-specific item set as well as the differential latent-trait correlations between the <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> and state-specific item set were used in addition to the three factors considered for the pseudo-test analyses. For each of the analyses, four equating methods were used: the frequency estimation, chained equipercentile, item response theory (IRT) true score, and IRT observed score methods. The main findings of this dissertation were as follows: (1) as the group ability difference increased, bias also increased; (2) when the effect sizes differed for the <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> and state-specific item set, larger bias was observed; (3) increasing the number of common items resulted in less bias, especially for the frequency estimation method when the group ability differed; (4) the frequency estimation method was more sensitive to the group ability difference than the differential effect size, while the IRT equating methods were more sensitive to the differential effect size than the group ability difference; (5) higher latent-trait correlation between the <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> and state-specific item set was associated with smaller bias, and if the latent-trait correlation exceeded 0. 8, the four equating methods provided adequate linking unless the group ability difference was large; (6) differential latent-trait correlations for the old and new tests resulted in larger bias than the same latent-trait correlations for the old and new tests, and (7) when the old and new test groups were equivalent, the frequency estimation method provided the least bias, but IRT true score and observed score equating resulted in smaller bias than the frequency estimation and chained equipercentile methods when group ability differed...|$|R
