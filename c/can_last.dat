5|$|Dental {{sealants}} {{are another}} preventive therapy {{often used to}} provide a barrier to bacteria and decay {{on the surface of}} teeth. Sealants <b>can</b> <b>last</b> up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in an procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{extremely}} {{cold winter}} temperatures, the falls freeze, creating a dramatic cascade of ice that <b>can</b> <b>last</b> {{well into the}} spring. If there is a rain shortage in the autumn, the falls may virtually dry up. In the summer, especially in the rainy months of June and July, the flow can be surprisingly forceful.|$|E
5|$|Episodic {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the details of specific events. This sort of memory <b>can</b> <b>last</b> for a lifetime. Much evidence implicates the hippocampus in playing a crucial role: people with severe damage to the hippocampus sometimes show amnesia, that is, inability to form new long-lasting episodic memories.|$|E

5|$|Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range shield {{were formed}} mainly during the Early Pleistocene mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago. These {{secondary}} vents are monogenetic in nature, meaning each cone was only active {{for a single}} eruption sequence before becoming extinct. The duration of volcanic activity at these cones <b>can</b> <b>last</b> from hours to years. Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range are small cinder cones situated at the summit and flanks of the shield volcano.|$|E
5|$|Remnants of many supernovae {{consist of}} a compact object and a rapidly {{expanding}} shock wave of material. This cloud of material sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which <b>can</b> <b>last</b> {{for up to two}} centuries. The wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion, and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about 10,000years.|$|E
5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, {{primarily}} because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and <b>can</b> <b>last</b> tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{distinct}} local weather phenomena, marked downslope lee winds {{caused by the}} proximity of the Pennines, leading to super geostrophic winds which can reach in excess of 60KT (70mph), most commonly in winter and spring. In the winter the presence of a subsidence inversion between the Pennines and the North York Moors can allow dense, persistent fog to form which <b>can</b> <b>last</b> for several days.|$|E
5|$|These highly {{explosive}} eruptions {{are associated}} with volatile-rich dacitic to rhyolitic lavas, and occur most typically at stratovolcanoes. Eruptions <b>can</b> <b>last</b> anywhere from hours to days, with longer eruptions being associated with more felsic volcanoes. Although they {{are associated with}} felsic magma, Plinian eruptions can just as well occur at basaltic volcanoes, given that the magma chamber differentiates and has a structure rich in silicon dioxide.|$|E

5|$|Warfarin {{decreases}} {{blood clotting}} by blocking an enzyme called vitamin K epoxide reductase that reactivates vitamin K1. Without sufficient active vitamin K1, clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X have decreased clotting ability. The anticlotting protein C and protein S are also inhibited {{but to a}} lesser degree. A few days are required for full effect to occur and these effects <b>can</b> <b>last</b> {{for up to five}} days.|$|E
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some <b>can</b> <b>last</b> for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|A typical McKinsey {{engagement}} <b>can</b> <b>last</b> {{between two}} and twelve months and involves three to six McKinsey consultants. An engagement is usually managed by a generalist that covers the region the client's headquarters are located in and specialists that have either an industry or functional expertise. Unlike some competing consulting firms, McKinsey does not hold a policy against working for multiple competing companies (although individual consultants are barred from doing so). This has sometimes led to accusations of sharing confidential information or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as best practices.|$|E

5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the female to mate; mating <b>can</b> <b>last</b> 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E
5|$|All {{octopuses}} are venomous, {{but only}} a few species pose a significant threat to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus Hapalochlaena, which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that <b>can</b> <b>last</b> for over a month even if treated correctly, and the bite of Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.|$|E
5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk {{has been hit}} by an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific part of the Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that <b>can</b> <b>last</b> for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is {{because of what happened}} in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E

50|$|Sir William Hawkins led {{the first}} voyage of the English East India Company to India and sailed into the Gujarat port of Surat on 24 August 1608 aboard the Hector. He {{had with him}} 25,000 pieces of gold and a {{personal}} letter to the Mughal Emperor Jehangir (sometimes also rendered as Cehangir or Ichan Guire) from King James I seeking trade concessions. He persisted for over two years, however Portuguese pirates stole his gold, and tried several times to murder him while on shore. He returned to England empty-handed.

5|$|Both parents remain {{involved}} in guarding the fry from brood predators {{and engage in}} behaviors to assist feeding such as moving leaves or fin digging (digging up the substrate with their fins). Brood care of eggs, larvae and free-swimming juveniles in the wild <b>can</b> <b>last</b> 4 to 6 weeks, and occurs only once per season {{for the majority of}} females. In contrast, females in aquaria are known to breed many times per year with short intervals of 12 or 13 days between broods, as long as suitable rocks or similar surfaces are available for them to lay their eggs on.|$|E
5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from vents {{on the floor of}} paterae, vents surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions <b>can</b> <b>last</b> for years or decades.|$|E
5|$|Giraffe groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and young males are known to occur. Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which <b>can</b> <b>last</b> weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E
