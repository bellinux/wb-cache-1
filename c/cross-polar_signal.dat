40|$|The {{design of}} spectrally-efficient, {{high-throughput}} satellite (HTS) systems with capacity approaching one terabit per second requires operating at Ka-band frequencies and above, {{where there are}} several gigahertz of allocated radio spectrum, using multiple spot beams with dual orthogonal polarisation mode. At these high frequencies, rain attenuation poses a major obstacle {{to the design of}} high-availability satellite links which are needed for the realisation of ubiquitous broadband multimedia communication services including high-speed Internet access at rural and remote locations. Furthermore, depolarisation-induced interference in such systems could have a performance-limiting impact if a co-channel <b>cross-polar</b> <b>signal</b> combines with system noise to drive the carrier-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (CNIR) below an acceptable threshold. This paper employs real measurement data to investigate the impact of depolarisation-induced interference on dual-polarised HTS systems for temperate and tropical climatic regions. Scenarios that cause significant system performance degradation are analysed, including the effects of signal frequency, antenna size, and regional rainfall rate. The impact of depolarisation on system performance is quantified by the reductions in the CNIR and link availability of a dual-polarised system when compared with those of a similarly-dimensioned single-polarised system...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} two circularly symmetric antennas with high polarization purity and low spill-over. Both were designed {{to be used in}} an all-sky polarization and intensity survey at 5 GHz (the C-Band All-Sky Survey, C-BASS). The survey requirements call for very low <b>cross-polar</b> <b>signal</b> levels and far-out sidelobes. Two different existing antennas, with 6. 1 -m and 7. 6 -m diameter primaries, were adapted by replacing the feed and secondary optics, resulting in identical beam performances of 0. 73 ° FWHM, cross-polarization better than - 50 dB, and far-out sidelobes below - 70 dB. The polarization purity was realized by using a symmetric low-loss dielectric foam support structure for the secondary mirror, avoiding the need for secondary support struts. Ground spill-over was largely reduced by using absorbing baffles around the primary and secondary mirrors, and by the use of a low-sidelobe profiled corrugated feedhorn. The 6. 1 -m antenna and receiver have been completed and tested. Results show that the co-polar beam matches the design simulations very closely in the main beam and down to levels of - 80 dB in the backlobes. With the absorbing baffles in place the far-out (>; 100 °) sidelobe response is reduced below - 90 dB. Cross-polar response could only be measured down to a noise floor of - 20 dB but is also consistent with the design simulations. Temperature loading and groundspill due to the secondary support were measured at less than 1 K...|$|E
40|$|The first-ever dual-frequency multi-constellation Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry (GNSS-R) polarimetric {{measurements}} over {{boreal forests}} and lakes from the stratosphere are presented. Data were {{collected during the}} European Space Agency (ESA) sponsored Balloon Experiments for University Students (BEXUS) 19 stratospheric balloon experiment using the P(Y) and C/A Reflect Ometer (PYCARO) instrument operated in closed-loop mode. Maps of the polarimetric ratio for L 1 and L 2 Global Positioning System (GPS) and GLObal Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), and for E 1 Galileo signals are derived from the float phase at 27, 000 m height, and the specular points are geolocalized on the Earth’s surface. Polarimetric ratio () maps over boreal forests are shown {{to be in the}} range 2 – 16 dB for the different GNSS codes. This result suggests that the scattering is taking place not only over the soil, but over the different forests elements as well. Additionally to the interpretation of the experimental results a theoretical investigation of the different contributions to the total reflectivity over boreal forests is performed using a bistatic scattering model. The simulated cross- (reflected Left Hand Circular Polarization LHCP) and co-polar (reflected Right Hand Circular Polarization RHCP) reflectivities are evaluated for the soil, the canopy, and the canopy–soil interactions for three different biomass densities: 725 trees/ha, 150 trees/ha and 72 trees/ha. For elevation angles larger than the Brewster angle, it is found that the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>signal</b> is dominant when just single reflections over the forests are evaluated, while in the case of multiple reflections the co-polar signal becomes the largest one.

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite Systems - Reflec-tometry (GNSS-R) {{represents}} an innovative tool for remote sensing. In this paper a facet-based simulator {{is presented to}} investigate the polarimetric characteristics of GNSS L-band signals reflected off sea surface. The aim of the proposed technique {{is to improve the}} classical simulation technique based on the Zavorotny-Voronovich (Z-V) approach. Therefore, the scattered power and the Delay-Doppler Map are obtained using a time-evolving random 3 D sea surface and the Kirchhoff Approximation (KA) of the Physical Optics (PO) to describe the scattering mechanisms.

30|$|Multipath {{propagation}} {{caused by}} scattering along the propagation path may cause random {{changes in the}} polarization state, which is also termed depolarization of the received field. This {{is a result of}} the electromagnetic investigation of wave propagation in a random, general scattering medium (see, e.g. [13], the classical work of propagation in random media). Similar results are also found in a rigorous investigation using full-wave electromagnetic simulation in a particular environment with well-specified scattering [14]. Experimental results are also available. In [15], satellite-to-indoor propagation measurements are described; received field was measured with antennas of different polarization while transmitted field was elliptically polarized. Measured power was close to identical with receive antennas of co- and counter-rotating circular polarization and of arbitrary linear polarization. Nabar et al. [16] report on (terrestrial) measurements resulting in equal received power in the average of co-polar and <b>cross-polar</b> transmitted <b>signals</b> if the link length is 1.6 [*]km or more. These and other results verify that the field at the receive antenna input port is depolarized. What is of interest is the power loss caused by polarization mismatch due to depolarization of the received field. For determining this loss, we have to take into account that (i) one particular realization of the received field at the antenna has one particular polarization being responsible for the possible polarization mismatch-loss; and (ii) this polarization is random.|$|R
40|$|Usually common polarimetric {{weather radar}} DSP-products (e. g. : reflectivity, {{differential}} reflectivity, linear depolarisation ratio - for both - co-polar and <b>cross-polar</b> <b>signal</b> components) {{are based on}} the logarithmic receiver output, because of the large dynamic range provided by the logarithmic receiver. In this paper {{for the first time we}} also use the linear receiver output to calculate common weather radar DSP-Products. Using the raw time series radar data recorded with the coherent polarimetric C-band weather radar of the DLR (''Poldirad'', Wessling, Germany) it is possible to do a comparison between processed weather radar echoes from the linear receiver and the logarithmic receiver. After the comparison showed very good results, we continued the work with the linear receiver data, especially on the topic named temporal decorrelation properties of the linear receiver data. This paper includes the first results obtained from two observables that belong to our working topic. The first observable is the ''Time Decorrelation Factor-TDF'' and the second one is the ''Decorrelation Time DTτ''The results have been summarised in the form of empirical relationships, plots and the least mean square (LMS) method of curve fitting was used to give the mathematical relationship for the observables TDF and DTτ. Generally, the paper will also reflect on the statistical properties of radar echoes measured with linear receivers. The usage of the linear receiver data opens a wide field of new applications and products for the work with polarimetric weather radar data, because the linear receiver data also provides phase information which a logarithmic receiver does not...|$|E
