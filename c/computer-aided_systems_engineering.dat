40|$|Abstract. Designing security-critical systems {{correctly}} is {{very difficult}} {{and there are many}} examples of weaknesses arising in practice. A particular challenge lies in the development of layered security protocols motivated by the need to combine existing or specifically designed protocols that each enforce a particular security requirement. Although appealing from a practical point of view, this approach raises the difficult question of the security properties guaranteed by the combined layered protocols, as opposed to each protocol in isolation. In this work, we apply a method for facilitating the development of trustworthy security-critical systems using the <b>computer-aided</b> <b>systems</b> <b>engineering</b> tool AutoFocus to the particular problem of layered security protocols. We explain our method at the example of a banking application which is currently under development by a major German bank and is about to be put to commercial use. ...|$|E

40|$|In weapon systems development, live fire {{tests have}} been {{frequently}} adopted {{to evaluate the}} performance of the systems under development. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure safety in the test ranges where the live fire tests can cause serious hazards. During the tests, a special care must be taken to protect the test and evaluation (T&E) personnel and also test assets from potential danger and hazards. Thus, the development and management of the range safety process is quite important in the tests of guided missiles and artillery considering the explosive power of the destruction. Note also that with a newly evolving era of weapon systems such as laser, EMP and non-lethal weapons, the test procedure for such systems is very complex. Therefore, keeping the safety level in the test ranges is getting more difficult due to the increased unpredictability for unknown hazards. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study on how to enhance the safety in the test ranges. To do so, an approach is proposed based on model-based systems engineering (MBSE). Specifically, a functional architecture is derived utilizing the MBSE method for the design of the range safety process under the condition that the derived architecture must satisfy both the complex test situation and the safety requirements.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} effects of <b>computer-aided</b> <b>systems</b> <b>engineering</b> (CASE) tool methodology support on the system specification output from structured analysis. A replicated project study was employed to allow {{for control of the}} requirements specification. Sixteen groups of four upper-division, undergraduate MIS students developed a system specification from the requirements specification of a hotel information system. The groups developed the specifications by following the Yourdon structured analysis methodology, with the aid of two popular, personal computer-based CASE tools. Both CASE tools claim to support the methodology but the methodology support offered by the two tools is different. Specifically, the size of the rule base varies between the tools, and the implementation mechanism for enforcing a specific methodology rule varies both between tools and between rules. It is hypothesized that the number of violations of a particular methodology rule {{is a function of the}} implementation mechanism, i. e., rules that are rigidly enforced will be violated less frequently than rules that are not rigidly enforced or are not a part of the CASE tool's rule base. The results indicate that, regardless of the type of methodology support supplied by the CASE tool, there are very few violations of the methodology rules that apply to the internal consistency of a data flow diagram. However, when the system is examined by verifying the hierarchical consistency of the data flow diagrams, the number of specification errors increases. Further, for some of the methodology rules, the number of violations is proportional to the amount of support provided by the CASE tool. One consequence of these results is that rules applying to the hierarchical consistency of data flows diagrams should be enforced by the CASE tool in as strict a manner as possible to assist in preventing errors from propagating down to the primitive process specifications and corrupting the construction of structure charts...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The complexity of enterprise engineering processes requires the application of reference architectures as means of guiding the achievement of an adequate level of business integration. This research aims to address important aspects of this requirement by associating the formalism of reference architectures to various life cycle phases of integrating manufacturing systems (IMS) and enabling their use in addressing contemporary system engineering issues. In pursuit of this aim, the following research activities were carried out: (1) to devise a framework which supports key phases of the IMS life cycle and (2) to populate part of this framework with an initial combination of architectures which can be encapsulated into a <b>computer-aided</b> <b>systems</b> <b>engineering</b> environment. This {{has led to the}} creation of a workbench capable of providing support for modelling, analysis, simulation, rapid-prototyping, configuration and run-time operation of an IMS, based on a consistent set of models associated with the engineering processes involved. The research effort concentrated on selecting and investigating the use of appropriate formalisms which underpin a selection of architectures and tools (i. e. CIM-OSA, Petrinets, object-oriented methods and CIM-BIOSYS), this by designing, implementing, applying and testing the workbench. The main contribution of this research is to demonstrate that it is possible to retain an adequate level of formalism, via computational structures and models, which extend through the IMS life cycle from a conceptual description of the system through to actions that the system performs when operating. The underlying methodology which supported this contribution is based on enacting models of system behaviour which encode important coordination aspects of manufacturing systems. The strategy for demonstrating the incorporation of formalism to the IMS life cycle was to enable the aggregation into a workbench of knowledge of 'what' the system is expected to achieve (i. e. 'problems' to be addressed) and 'how' the system can achieve it (i. e possible 'solutions'). Within the workbench, such a knowledge is represented through an amalgamation of business process modelling and object-oriented modelling approaches which, when adequately manipulated, can lead to business integration...|$|E
40|$|CASE (<b>Computer-Aided</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Engineering)</b> is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to {{the long line of}} "silver bullets" that promise to transform information systems development, delivering new levels of quality and productivity. CASE is particularly intriguing because information systems (IS) practitioners spend their working lives applying information technology (IT) to other people's work, and now they are applying it to themselves. CASE research to date has been dominated by accounts of tool development, normative writings (for example practitioner success stories) and surveys recording IT specialists' perceptions. There have been very few in-depth studies of tool use, and very few attempts to quantify benefits, therefore the essence of the CASE process remains largely unexplored, and the views of stakeholders other than the IT specialists have yet to be heard. The research presented here addresses these concerns by adopting a hybrid research approach combining action research, grounded theory and phenoinenology and using both qualitative and quantitative data in order {{to tell the story of}} a system developer's experience in using CASE tools in three information systems projects for a major UK car manufacturer over a four year period. The author was the lead developer on all three projects. Action research is a learning process, the researcher is an explorer. At the start of this project it was assumed that the tools would be the focus of the work. As the research progressed it became evident that the tools were but part of a richer organisational context in which culture, politics, history, external initiatives and cognitive limitations played important roles. The author continued to record experiences and impressions of tool use in the project diary together with quality and productivity metrics. But the diary also became home to a story of organisational developments that had not originally been foreseen. The principal contribution made by the work is to identity the narrow positivistic nature of CASE knowledge, and to show via the research stories the overwhelming importance of organisational context to systems development success and how the exploration of context is poorly supported by the tools. Sixteen further contributions are listed in the Conclusions to the thesis, including a major extension to Wynekoop and Conger's CASE research taxonomy, an identification of the potentially misleading nature of quantitative IS assessment and further evidence of the limitations of the "scientific" approach to systems development. The thesis is completed by two proposals for further work. The first seeks to advance IS theory by developing further a number of emerging process models of IS development. The second seeks to advance IS practice by asking the question "How can CASE tools be used to stimulate awareness and debate about the effects of organisational context?", and outlines a programme of research in this area...|$|E

40|$|An {{extension}} to a seamless, model-based development approach provides an architecture for debugging models that execute on target systems or in dedicated rapid-prototyping environments. During development, the ever-increasing design complexity of embedded systems frequently comes {{into conflict with}} cost, time-to-market, and quality. This complexity results from increasing functionality, the expanding design space, the distribution of functionality to distributed control units, the optimization of power dissipation, and performance requirements.

In this situation the innovative activity uses in practice not only the newest experience, but also the science laws and consequences, that is, in particular, “Science of Innovations”. The mentioned science laws explain wave dynamics of technical (technological) systems development. In the course of innovation activities and/or innovation designing a modification of continuously acting technological system, usually, causes its developing and growing upwards by Sshaped curve. Changing a principle of action changes S-shaped curve development (Fig. 1). If such changes are within the certain “trace tube” we are entitled to state the steady system development. Analysis of changing target function of technological system within the “trace tube” of its steady development characterizes its growing wave dynamics (Fig. 1) using the S-shaped curves (sigmoid type relations).

The work has provided valuable information to prove the feasibility of developing an integrated CAMSD framework to support the complete cycle of manufacturing operation—from manufacturing strategy analysis (MSA) to manufacturing system design (MSD) task execution. This has opened up possibilities {{for a new generation}} of software to be developed, which can be used online to regulate and automate a manufacturing company’s MSD activities. An overview of I/O-CAMSD is provided including the key issues addressed, its overall system structure, its MSA/MSD interface, and its task-centered software structure. The system’s actual application within industrial companies is also discussed. Index Terms—Computer-aided manufacturing system design (CAMSD), manufacturing strategy, manufacturing system design, manufacturing <b>systems</b> <b>engineering,</b> manufacturing <b>systems</b> management, task-centered approach.

40|$|A <b>computer-aided</b> <b>system</b> to {{estimate}} bone age based on Fourier analysis {{was assessed by}} reference to the original radiographs used to produce the Tanner-Whitehouse 2 (TW 2) standards for the radius, ulna and short finger bones. The <b>computer-aided</b> <b>system</b> involved matching a template of each bone to the scanned image of the radiograph. The computer then generated a stage of bone maturity, individual and total bone scores and a value for bone age. The bone ages assessed by the <b>computer-aided</b> <b>system</b> were {{no different from the}} original TW 2 reference values, indicating the applicability of the system. The system was used to assess the bone ages of tall Dutch girls, and the results obtained were compared with more traditional assessments made by an experienced rater. For the radiographs from the tall girls, there was good agreement for individual bones between this method and the traditional assessment by the rater, but less agreement for the total 13 -bone score and bone age...|$|R
