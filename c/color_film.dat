5|$|Columbia {{distributed}} Disney's shorts for {{two years}} before the Disney studio entered a new distribution deal with United Artists in 1932. The same year, Disney signed a two-year exclusive deal with Technicolor to utilize its new 3-strip <b>color</b> <b>film</b> process, which allowed for fuller-color reproduction where previous <b>color</b> <b>film</b> processors could not. The result was the Silly Symphony Flowers and Trees, the first film commercially released in full Technicolor. Flowers and Trees was a major success, and all Silly Symphonies were subsequently produced in Technicolor.|$|E
5|$|At the 12th Academy Awards, Gone {{with the}} Wind {{set a record}} for Academy Award wins and nominations, winning in eight of the {{competitive}} categories it was nominated in, from a total of thirteen nominations. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and received two further honorary awards for its use of equipment and color (it also became the first <b>color</b> <b>film</b> to win Best Picture). Its record of eight competitive wins stood until Gigi (1958) won nine, and its overall record of ten was broken by Ben-Hur (1959) which won eleven. Gone with the Wind also held the record for most nominations until All About Eve (1950) secured fourteen. It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, and may still hold {{the record of the}} longest Best Picture winner depending on how it is interpreted. The running time for Gone with the Wind is just under 221minutes, while Lawrence of Arabia (1962) runs for just over 222minutes; however, including the overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music, Gone with the Wind lasts for 234minutes (although some sources put its full length at 238minutes) while Lawrence of Arabia comes in slightly shorter at 232minutes with its additional components.|$|E

25|$|Motion picture film, {{primarily}} because of the rem-jet backing, requires different processing than standard C-41 process <b>color</b> <b>film.</b> The process necessary is ECN-2, which has an initial step using an alkaline bath to remove the backing layer. There are also minor differences in the remainder of the process. If motion picture negative is run through a standard C-41 <b>color</b> <b>film</b> developer bath, the rem-jet backing partially dissolves and destroys the integrity of the developer and, potentially, ruins the film.|$|E

25|$|Swanson's first <b>color</b> <b>film</b> {{was one of}} {{very few}} to be shot entirely aboard actual {{railroad}} equipment.

25|$|In 1949 Renoir {{traveled}} to India to shoot The River (1951), his first <b>color</b> <b>film.</b> Based {{on the novel}} {{of the same name}} by Rumer Godden, the film is both a meditation on human beings' relationship with nature and a coming of age story of three young girls in colonial India.

25|$|The real {{push for}} color films and the nearly {{immediate}} changeover from black-and-white production to nearly all <b>color</b> <b>film</b> were pushed {{forward by the}} prevalence of television in the early 1950s. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number rose to over 50 percent. The rise in color films was also aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near monopoly on the medium.|$|E
25|$|To mix the {{black-and-white}} footage of Rusty James and the Motorcycle Boy in the pet store {{looking at the}} Siamese fighting fish in color, Burum shot the actors {{in black and white}} and then projected that footage on a rear projection screen.

5000|$|Originally, all Eastman <b>Color</b> <b>films,</b> ECN and ECP alike, were on {{triacetate}} base (no Eastman <b>Color</b> <b>films</b> {{were ever}} made on nitrate base), but recent practice {{has been for}} ECN elements to be on triacetate base, so these may be easily spliceable (using lap-type cemented splices, also called [...] "negative assembly" [...] splices), and for ECP elements to be on polyester base, so these are not spliceable (except by using butt-type splices with polyester splicing tapes).|$|R
25|$|Currently {{available}} scanners typically use {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) or {{contact image sensor}} (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor. Early <b>color</b> <b>film</b> scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Butcher had a {{partnership}} that marketed and sold his images {{to the wall}} décor departments of Sears, Montgomery Ward, and J. C. Penney. He eventually accrued around 200 employees and offices in Akron, Ohio and Southern California. In order to increase sales, Butcher started photographing with <b>color</b> <b>film</b> so his images could match the avocado green shag carpets and gold couches. The bulk of his photography during this time took place west of the Rocky Mountains and in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
25|$|The {{first film}} Perret {{distributed}} with Franco-Film, Morgane la sirène, was wildly successful in France, England and Canada, which confirmed the young company's international ambitions. Printemps d’amour, the first French <b>color</b> <b>film</b> {{using the new}} American technology Technicolor, came out that same year starring Louis Lagrange and the American actress Hope Hampton. Afterwards Léonce produced his last two silent films: La Danseuse Orchidée (with the American actor Ricardo Cortez as well as Xenia Desni and Marcya Capri) and another film adaptation of a Henry Bataille play called La Possession (with the Italian actress Francesca Bertini).|$|E
