40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to observe the influence of electric stimulation <b>and</b> <b>chilling</b> period on meat of Simmental cross. This experiment used factorial design with 5 blocks. The first factor was electric stimulation (with and without electric stimulation), the second factor was chilling period (0, 12 and 24 hours). Around 7. 5 kg Simmental cross meat (Tricep brachii) from 5 head were used on this research. The observed variables were pH, cooking loss and tenderness. The results showed {{that there was no}} interaction of electric stimulation <b>and</b> <b>chilling</b> period (<b>up</b> to 24 hours) on all of observed variables. Electric stimulation treatment was significant improved tenderness of Simmental cross beef but it was not significant on pH and cooking loss.

40|$|Aims: Therapeutic limbal {{epithelial}} {{stem cells}} could be managed more efficiently if clinically validated batches were transported for ‘on-demand’ use. Materials & methods: In this study, corneal epithelial cell viability in calcium alginate hydrogels was examined under cell culture, ambient <b>and</b> <b>chilled</b> conditions for <b>up</b> to 7 days. Results: Cell viability improved as gel internal pore size increased, and was further enhanced with {{modification of the}} gel from a mass to a thin disc. Ambient storage conditions were optimal for supporting cell viability in gel discs. Cell viability in gel discs was significantly enhanced with increases in pore size mediated by hydroxyethyl cellulose. Conclusion: Our novel methodology of controlling alginate gel shape and pore size together provides a more practical and economical alternative to established corneal tissue/cell storage methods...|$|R

60|$|The leaves {{overhead}} {{were now}} in their latter green--so opaque, that it was darker {{at some of the}} densest spots than in winter-time, scarce a crevice existing by which a ray could get down to the ground. But in open places she could see well enough. Summer was ending: in the daytime singing insects hung in every sunbeam; vegetation was heavy nightly with globes of dew; and after showers creeping damps <b>and</b> twilight <b>chills</b> came <b>up</b> from the hollows. The plantations were always weird at this hour of eve--more spectral far than in the leafless season, when there were fewer masses and more minute lineality. The smooth surfaces of glossy plants came out like weak, lidless eyes; there were strange faces and figures from expiring lights that had somehow wandered into the canopied obscurity; while now and then low peeps of the sky between the trunks were like sheeted shapes, and on the tips of boughs sat faint cloven tongues.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare two {{chilling}} methods, combined (aerosol) <b>and</b> water <b>chilling,</b> {{in terms of their}} effectiveness in chilling of different weight categories of broiler chickens. At the same time microbial associations of different weight categories of broiler chickens were evaluated. Samples were collected in an approved establishment and poultry carcasses were divided according to weight <b>and</b> <b>chilling</b> methods into five categories. The first four categories were chilled using combined <b>chilling</b> method <b>and</b> fifth category was chilled with water. The temperature of the breast muscle before <b>and</b> after <b>chilling</b> <b>and</b> microbiological parameters (total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella) was measured. By comparing the temperature of the breast muscle after combined chilling method was not achieved in the breast muscles temperature below 4 °C in all weight categories. In any case, the lowest average temperature has been reached in the weight category < 1. 2 kg (4. 9 °C) and with increasing weight, the average temperature was rising, and the highest was in weight category 1. 8 to 2. 5 kg (10. 8 °C). Poultry carcasses were subsequently divided into portions and after cutting were <b>chilled</b> <b>up</b> to a temperature below 4 °C. In poultry carcasses chilled by water, the average temperature of the breast muscle after 20 minutes in the water bath was even higher (19. 6 °C) compared to combine chilling. Thus chilled poultry carcasses were frozen up to - 18 °C in a core of muscles. Comparing the microbiological contamination in different weight categories <b>and</b> <b>chilling</b> techniques, we found that the lowest total viable count (TVC) before <b>and</b> after <b>chilling</b> was in the lowest category and the difference before chilling was significantly lower comparing with all other categories. Conversely TVC after chilling by water was decreased. In comparing the number of Enterobacteriaceae before <b>and</b> after <b>chilling,</b> a similar pattern of contamination as above was found. Microbiological examination of samples of poultry carcasses did not detect the presence of Salmonella. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{develop an}} inquiry scale for {{diagnosis}} of heart system syndromes, {{and to discuss}} the provisional standardization of the inquiry method in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: Based on scale-making method, Chinese medicine theory and literature searching, an inquiry scale for diagnosis of heart system syndromes in TCM was developed. Statistics method, frequency counting and Delphi method were used for analysis. The inquiry scale was revised and tested repeatedly to check the test reliability, internal consistency reliability, and content validity, etc. Results: The inquiry scale for diagnosis of heart system syndromes mainly covered basic data, chief complaint, history of present illness (accompanying symptoms) and past history, with appendix of inspection and palpation information as well as diagnosis made according to traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Among them, general inquiries <b>covered</b> fever <b>and</b> <b>chills,</b> sweating, head-body <b>and</b> chest-belly symptoms, taste and diet, stool and urine, sleep, mood, and gynecologic symptoms, which were scaled in 8 dimensions. And 66 symptom variables were screened finally. The scale had a good content validity and its coefficient alpha was 0. 82. For the results of test-retest reliability, the Kappa values of using the scale for diagnosis of heart-qi deficiency, heart-yang deficiency, turbid phlegm, and cold coagulation twice by the same doctor ranged from 0. 74 to 1, showing that {{the consistency of the}} scale was relatively high. The Kappa values of evaluation of scorer reliability in diagnosis of heart-qi deficiency, heart-yang deficiency, and heart-yin deficiency were also high, which were 0. 63, 0. 72, 1 and 0. 48 respectively. Other results of diagnosis had low-consistency or even no diagnostic agreement. Conclusion: The research on the scale for inquiry in TCM indicates that it is feasible for the standardization of inquiry scale for diagnosis of heart system syndromes in TCM, offering a reference for research on the inquiry scales for other systems...|$|R
