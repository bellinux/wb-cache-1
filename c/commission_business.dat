5|$|The Rio de Janeiro bid {{committee}} was an incorporated non-profit entity {{under the leadership}} of an Honorary Council and an Executive Board, both chaired by Carlos Arthur Nuzman. At the highest level, the Honorary Council comprised the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the Governor of the State of Rio de Janeiro Sérgio Cabral, the Mayor of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro Eduardo Paes, and the two Brazilian IOC members: Nuzman and João Havelange. At the executive level, the Executive Board was divided in four departments—Government Coordination <b>Commission,</b> <b>Business</b> Council, Legacy Committee and Athletes' Commission—being responsible for the main operations of the campaign. The Board also included representations from the three levels of Government with the specific authority to make commitments on behalf of their respective Governments. Technical aspects of the bid were supported by various Councils and Committees composed of a professionals staff, and supplemented by a team of domestic and international experts; which were coordinated by Carlos Roberto Osório, Secretary General of the bid committee. Mike Lee, former Director of Communications and Public Affairs for the London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, was the lead advisor to the bid of Rio de Janeiro. His company, Vero Campaigning Communications, was responsible for planning the bid's advertising campaign strategy, presentation scripts, visual support development and international media relations, as well as international press conferences.|$|E
500|$|In 1859, Rockefeller {{went into}} the produce <b>commission</b> <b>business</b> with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised $4,000 ($ in [...] dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went {{steadily}} ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, [...] "God gave me money", {{and he did not}} apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, [...] "gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can." ...|$|E
500|$|To aid the {{transition}} to multiracial democracy, the South African government established a Commission of Inquiry Regarding the Prevention of Public Violence and Intimidation in October 1991 to investigate human rights abuses committed by the country's various political factions. Its members were chosen by consensus among the three main parties. Goldstone had by now become reputed as an impartial and unimpeachable judge, and was asked by ANC chairman Nelson Mandela to head the commission; it {{became known as the}} Goldstone Commission. Goldstone explained later that he had been selected because he had earned the confidence of both sides: [...] "The government was aware that I would not make findings against it without good cause, and the majority of South Africans had confidence that I would quote hesitate to make findings against the government if the evidence justified it." [...] He nonetheless received numerous death threats. He continued to work as an appeals court judge throughout his time chairing the Commission, hearing cases during the mornings and afternoons and then continuing through to midnight on <b>Commission</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E

500|$|Oliver Christian Bosbyshell {{was born}} in Vicksburg, Mississippi, on January 3, 1839, the son of Oliver Christian and Mary Ann (Whitney) Bosbyshell. [...] Both his parents were from old Philadelphia families; the couple had taken up {{temporary}} residence in Vicksburg. [...] The senior Oliver Bosbyshell was engaged in the <b>commission</b> <b>business.</b> He contracted bronchitis while fighting a fire that destroyed his warehouse, and died in Philadelphia after a sea voyage taken {{in the hope of}} recovering his health. Eight weeks later, his son was born, and Mary Bosbyshell returned from Mississippi with him to her father's house in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. [...] Young Oliver grew up there, and attended local public schools. [...] At age 15, he left school to become a telegraph messenger and {{for the next three years}} took various jobs in that field before deciding to pursue a career in the law. He first studied with attorney Francis W. Hugbee, then with his uncle, William Whitney; both were in Pottsville. [...] He was still engaged as a student in 1861, when the Civil War broke out.|$|E
500|$|Peres did {{not find}} his wages {{sufficient}} to support himself, his wife, and his four children. To supplement his income, he opened a grocery store and a <b>commission</b> <b>business</b> (selling others' goods on consignment) with his brother. As Saturday (the Jewish Sabbath) was also the busiest day for commerce, he decided to keep his business open on that day—something forbidden by Jewish law, and {{at odds with the}} rule he had championed. Some of congregants objected, and at B'nai Israel's [...] quarterly meeting, charges were brought against him; at a subsequent trial at a Jewish court, he was convicted and fired. In response, he sued the congregation in a civil court for lost wages and libel. The precedent-setting case, which reached the Tennessee Supreme Court, was decided in his favor as regards the lost income, but against him regarding libel. The court's ruling was that [...] "a religious institution is sovereign; that its laws and regulations are supreme; and that its policies and practices may not be challenged by a legal action in a court of law". In a letter to Rabbi Isaac Leeser in 1862, Peres claimed that he had been framed and that the store was actually run by his brother, just under his name. He writes that the synagogue had accused him of opening on the Sabbath [...] "in order to get rid of me".|$|E

Now old Longtooth proposed to young Featherhead that he should nibble a passage into this loft, and there establish himself in the <b>commission</b> <b>business,</b> passing the nuts and corn {{to him as he}} wanted them. Old Longtooth knew what he was about in the proposal, for he had heard talk of a brisk Scotch terrier that was about to be bought to keep the rats from the grain; but you may be sure he kept his knowledge to himself, so that Featherhead was none the wiser for it.|$|E

6000|$|Harry's face fell a little. [...] "Uncle," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{sorry to}} have {{disappointed}} you; {{sorry to have}} been compelled {{to run counter to}} any little ambitions you might have had for me in that respect; but I felt, after all you told me that day, that the army would be a very dangerous profession for me; and though I didn't want to be a coward and run away from danger, I didn't want to be foolhardy and heedlessly expose myself to it. So I thought on the whole it would be wiser for me to give up the direct <b>commission</b> <b>business</b> altogether, and go in at once for being a doctor. It was safer, and therefore better in the end both for me and for you, uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had already}} made up my mind, James, {{to tell you that}} I wished our {{partnership}} to be dissolved. To begin with, you now bet in such a large way, that I am sure this <b>commission</b> <b>business</b> is only an annoyance to you, and that you only continue it because it affords me work. However, I have kept a private account for the last three years, and I found that there was a good balance of profit after paying me my four pounds a week, so I did not hesitate in keeping on. However, I am now desirous of giving it up. For these four years I have been putting off the execution of a purpose I have had in my mind, and I must delay no longer. I do not tell you what it is, James, true friend as you are, for you might try and dissuade me from it, and that would only trouble me, without diverting me from my purpose. As for the £5,000, I cannot take such a sum as that; that is the result of your work, and not of the £75, which was what I put in. Still, as you say that you did benefit by Robert's work that year, and as that year laid the foundation of your fortune, I will consent to take £2,000, and I do that only for the sake of my child. Will you let it be so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He did {{eliminate}} it, {{save for}} mild relapses on festive occasions. A more seemingly incongruous marriage could scarcely be imagined, {{and yet it}} was a success from the start. From a slim, silent, self-willed girl Susan had grown up into a tall, rather rawboned and energetic young woman. She was what we called in those days [...] "intellectual," [...] and had gone in for kindergartens, and after her marriage she turned out to be excessively domestic; practising her theories, with entire success, upon a family that showed a tendency to increase at an alarming rate. Tom, needless to say, did not become intellectual. He settled down--prematurely, I thought--into what is known as a family man, curiously content with the income he derived from the <b>commission</b> <b>business</b> and with life in general; and he developed a somewhat critical view of the tendencies of the civilization by which he was surrounded. Susan held it also, but she said less about it. In the comfortable but unpretentious house they rented on Cedar Street we had many discussions, after the babies had been put to bed and the door of the living-room closed, in order that our voices might not reach the nursery. Perry Blackwood, now Tom's brother-in-law, was often there. He, too, had lapsed into what I thought was an odd conservatism. Old Josiah, his father, being dead, he occupied himself mainly with looking after certain family interests, among which was the Boyne Street car line. Among [...] "business men" [...] he was already getting the reputation of being a little difficult to deal with. I was often the subject of their banter, and presently I began to suspect that they regarded my career and beliefs with some concern. This gave me no uneasiness, though at limes I lost my temper. I realized their affection for me; but privately I regarded them as lacking in ambition, in force, in the fighting qualities necessary for achievement in this modern age. Perhaps, unconsciously, I pitied them a little.|$|E
