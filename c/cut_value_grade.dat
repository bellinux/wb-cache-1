In meat factories in Ireland, digital images are routinely taken after slaughter to derive EUROP conformation and fat grades. Two datasets (1, 048 carcasses in total) on individual carcass dissections were made available for this study, one by a research center and the other by a commercial partner. Dissection data consisted of eight and six primal cuts taken in the hind- and fore-quarter, respectively, and analyses revealed significant genetic variations in these data. Heritabilities of primal cut weights ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 83 in the fore-quarter cuts, and from 0. 14 to 0. 86 in the hind-quarter cuts. Primal cut weights were subsequently grouped into four wholesale cut weights according to their retail values: lower <b>value</b> <b>cuts,</b> medium <b>value</b> <b>cuts,</b> high <b>value</b> <b>cuts,</b> and very high <b>value</b> <b>cuts.</b> Equations to predict wholesale cut weights were subsequently derived from VIA image parameters. Accuracy of prediction were > 0. 84 and > 0. 72 in the steer and heifer datasets, respectively. Genetic analysis of the wholesale cut weights predicted in a large national dataset of steers and heifers revealed heritabilities of 0. 18, 0. 27, 0. 40, and 0. 17 for lower <b>value</b> <b>cuts,</b> medium <b>value</b> <b>cuts,</b> high <b>value</b> <b>cuts,</b> and very high <b>value</b> <b>cuts,</b> respectively. Genetic correlations among predicted wholesale cut weights ranged from 0. 45 to 0. 89 across genders. Predicted wholesale cut weights were also strongly genetically correlated with animal price at weaning age (0. 37 to 0. 66), as well as price at postweaning age (0. 50 to 0. 67) suggesting a benefit of indirect selection especially where data on carcass cut weights were not yet available. Including predicted wholesale cut weights in a selection criteria increased genetic gain for carcass traits {{over and above the}} current selection practice of selection on EUROP conformation score.

This improves the best previous results by a factor of Omega(n). Regarding a given tree in an instance as a rooted tree, we define O(n) rooted tree instances taking each vertex as a root, and establish a recursive formula on maximum integral multiflow values of these instances to design a dynamic programming that computes the maximum integral multiflow values of all O(n) rooted instances in linear time. We can prove that the algorithm implicitly maintains a cut-system so that not only a maximum integral multiflow but also a minimum cut-system can be constructed in linear time for any rooted instance whenever it is necessary.

40|$|Spectral {{clustering}} (SC) and graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms {{are sensitive}} to how graphs are constructed from data. In particular if the data has proximal and unbalanced clusters these algorithms can lead to poor performance on well-known graphs such as k-NN, full-RBF, ϵ-graphs. This is because the objectives such as Ratio-Cut (RCut) or normalized cut (NCut) attempt to tradeoff <b>cut</b> <b>values</b> with cluster sizes, which are not tailored to unbalanced data. We propose a novel graph partitioning framework, which parameterizes a family of graphs by adaptively modulating node degrees in a k-NN graph. We then propose a model selection scheme to choose sizable clusters which are separated by smallest <b>cut</b> <b>values.</b> Our framework is able to adapt to varying levels of unbalancedness of data and can be naturally used for small cluster detection.

40|$|Abstract—This paper explores {{models for}} finding outer bounds on the {{capacities}} {{of a simple}} family of wireless networks. Each wireless network is comprised {{of a collection of}} independent, memoryless channels with no more than three nodes: one transmitter and two receivers in each broadcast channel, two transmitters and one receiver in each multiple access channel, and one transmitter and one receiver in each point-to-point channel. The approach taken applies prior network equivalence results for modeling the individual components in each network and then bounds the difference between the modeling network capacity and the capacity of the original network. For binary channels, the modeling network guarantees capacities within a constant multiplicative factor of the true network capacity for all possible demand types. The results for networks of Gaussian channels yield cuts across each channel within an additive constant of the optimal <b>cut</b> <b>value.</b> These constant gaps in <b>cut</b> <b>values</b> give additive bounds on the accuracy of capacities for demand types where cut-sets are tight. The bounding network capacity is also tight for some example networks where the gap between the capacity region and the traditional cut-set outer bounds can be made arbitrarily large. I...|$|R

Towards this end, we begin by defining a base region where both sources are multicast to both the terminals. Following this we enlarge the region by appropriately encoding the information at the source nodes, such that terminal ti is only guaranteed to decode information from the intended source si, while decoding a linear function of the other source.

Our main result is that any streaming algorithm that breaks the 2 -approximation barrier requires Ω̃(n) space even if the edges of the input graph are presented in random order.
