500|$|An {{affidavit}} {{was filed}} in the Supreme Court {{on the basis of}} a report on testimony of suspended IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt that Modi ordered top police officers not to take active actions in the riots. Bhatt said that on the night of 27 February 2002, Modi said that [...] "Hindus must be allowed to carry out retaliatory violence against Muslims." [...] The report filed by Raju Ramachandran, a Supreme Court lawyer and an amicus curiae, alleged that Modi [...] "gave instructions to top police officers to go slow on rioters". On 7 May 2012, Ramachandran said that Modi can be prosecuted under sections 153 A (1) (a) & (b), 153 B (1), 166 and 505 (2) of the Indian Penal Code for promoting enmity among different groups during the 2002 Gujarat riots, including the Naroda incident. The Special Investigation Team criticised the amicus report for relying heavily on Bhatt's testimony, who according to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) was an [...] "unreliable witness" [...] as he remained silent for nine years.

2500|$|Another {{aspect of}} Objectivist poetics {{that is not}} {{explicitly}} addressed in these essays is an interest in exploiting the resonances of small, everyday words.

[...] This concern is also reflected in Oppen's statement [...] "if we still possessed the word 'is', there would be no need to write poems".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} have {{raised questions about}} Surratt's move into the city.

For example, Larson and Chamlee say that on September 21, 1864, John Surratt wrote to Louis J. Weichmann, observing that the family's plans to move into the city were advancing rapidly [...] "on account of certain events having turned up," [...] perhaps a cryptic reference to either his Confederate activities in general or the conspiracy to kidnap or kill Lincoln. Larson has observed that although the move made long-term economic sense for Surratt, it also, in the short term, would have meant moving expenses and furnishing up to 10 rooms in the townhouse, money that she did not have.|$|E

2500|$|In early August 2005, {{after the}} June {{election}} of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Iran's President, Iran removed seals on its uranium enrichment equipment in Isfahan, which UK officials termed a [...] "breach of the Paris Agreement" [...] though a <b>case</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> that the EU violated {{the terms of}} the Paris Agreement by demanding that Iran abandon nuclear enrichment. Several days later, the EU-3 offered Iran a package in return for permanent cessation of enrichment. Reportedly, it included benefits in the political, trade and nuclear fields, as well as long-term supplies of nuclear materials and assurances of non-aggression by the EU (but not the US). Mohammad Saeedi, the deputy head of Iran's atomic energy organization rejected the offer, terming it [...] "very insulting and humiliating" [...] and other independent analysts characterized the EU offer as an [...] "empty box". Iran's announcement that it would resume enrichment preceded the election of Iranian President Ahmadinejad by several months. The delay in restarting the program was to allow the IAEA to re-install monitoring equipment. The actual resumption of the program coincided with the election of President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, and the appointment of Ali Larijani as the chief Iranian nuclear negotiator.|$|E
2500|$|Probably {{under the}} reign of Domitian and most likely after 86 A.D., the {{fortress}} became a Colonia, a settlement for retired soldiers sanctioned by the Emperor. The Colonia now developed and a second enclosure, {{often referred to as}} the ‘‘Lower Colonia’’ was added between the Upper Colonia and the River Witham. [...] Evidence has been uncovered for the Forum, baths, temples, buildings and shops of the Colonia which was enclosed by walls. The walls of the Upper Colonia started to be built in the earlier part of the 2nd century A.D., while the Lower Colonia was walled in either the late 2nd or early 3rd centuries. The Roman settlement also spread to the south of the river Witham in the area known as the Wigford. In the early 3rd century A.D. with the re-organisation of the Roman Empire, a <b>case</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> that Lindum Colonia had become the provincial capital of Britannia Secunda and possibly a Bishop from Lincoln was present at the Council of Arles in 314. In the 4th century A.D.

2500|$|Major's {{verdict on}} the ERM {{was that it}} was the {{medicine}} that cured Britain of inflation; [...] "it hurt but it worked." [...] Speaking a few days after Black Wednesday, the Governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, argued that [...] "the decision to join the ERM two years ago in the circumstances; that, having joined, we were right to endeavour to stick it out; and that, in the circumstances which evolved, we were right to withdraw." [...] Lamont's view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced: without the discipline of the ERM, the Major government would have given up on the fight against inflation before Black Wednesday; ERM membership delivered a sharp break in Britain's inflation performance; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain Britain's membership was undoubtedly correct; [...] "the ERM was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do." [...] Sir Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period and later appointed by Gordon Brown to the Monetary Policy Committee, in an economic assessment of Britain's membership of the ERM, has written, [...] "although it was certainly a political disaster, the <b>case</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning point in our macro-economic performance." ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{probabilistic}} approach is introduced for {{the determination of}} the absolute structure of a compound which is known to be enantiopure based on Bijvoet-pair intensity differences. The new method provides relative probabilities for different models of the chiral composition of the structure. The outcome of this type of analysis <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> cast {{in the form of a}} new value, along with associated standard uncertainty, that resembles the value of the well known Flack x parameter. The standard uncertainty we obtain is often about half of the standard uncertainty in the value of the Flack x parameter. The proposed formalism is suited in particular to absolute configuration determination from diffraction data of biologically active (pharmaceutical) compounds where the strongest resonant scattering signal often comes from oxygen. It is shown that a reliable absolute configuration assignment in such <b>cases</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> on the basis of Cu K data, and in some cases even with carefully measured Mo K data. 1...|$|R
50|$|A common {{accessory}} for laptops is {{a laptop}} sleeve, laptop skin, or laptop case, {{which provides a}} degree of protection from scratches. Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, <b>are</b> most commonly <b>made</b> of neoprene, with sturdier ones made of low-resilience polyurethane. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in ballistic nylon to provide some measure of waterproofing. Bulkier and sturdier <b>cases</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> of metal with polyurethane padding inside, and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a laptop cooler, a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.|$|R
5000|$|Rachel Lovell, Case Western University {{describes}} her research: [...] "Our findings suggest {{it is very}} likely that a sexual offender has either previously sexually assaulted or will offend again in the future...Investigating each sexual assault as possibly perpetrated by a serial offender has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} sexual assaults if investigations focus more on the offender than on single incidents." [...] Investigation of the offender instead of the crime has been proposed to prevent serial rapes. The backlog of analyzing rape kits impedes the identification of serial rapists. Hundreds of thousands of rape kits remain untested across the US. Most law enforcement agencies do not track or count them. The process is complicated, invasive, time-consuming and may re-traumatize victims. The FBI maintains a DNA database and comparisons between <b>cases</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> Unfortunately, the backlog of analyzing rape kits can allow the perpetrator to continue their crime before being identified with other assaults.|$|R
