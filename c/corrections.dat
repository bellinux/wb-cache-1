40|$|Our {{research}} {{addresses the}} problem of error <b>correction</b> in speech user interfaces. Previous work hypothesized that switching modality could speed up interactive <b>correction</b> of recognition errors (so-called multimodal error <b>correction).</b> We present a user study that compares, on a dictation task, multimodal error <b>correction</b> with conventional interactive <b>correction,</b> such as speaking again, choosing Tom a list, and keyboard input. Results show that multimodal <b>correction</b> is faster than conventional <b>correction</b> without keyboard input, but slower than <b>correction</b> by typing for users with good typing skills. Furthermore, while users initially prefer speech, they learn to avoid ineffective <b>correction</b> modalities with experience. To extrapolate results from this user study we developed a performance model of multimodal interaction that predicts input speed including time needed for error <b>correction.</b> We apply the model to estimate the impact of recognition technology improvements on <b>correction</b> speeds {{and the influence of}} recognition accuracy and <b>correction</b> method on the productivity of dictation systems. Our model is a first step towards formalizing multimodal (recognition-based) interaction.

40|$|Study Design. A {{prospective}} study on adolescent idiopathic scoliosis to assess a new method of describing frontal plane <b>correction.</b> Objective. To assess {{the difference between}} using the <b>correction</b> rate and using the new fulcrum bending <b>correction</b> index when describing scoliosis <b>correction.</b> Summary of Background Data. A description {{of the outcome of}} scoliosis surgery based on the <b>correction</b> rate {{does not take into account}} the curve's flexibility. Methods. The fulcrum bending <b>correction</b> index is calculated by dividing the <b>correction</b> rate by the fulcrum flexibility (based on the fulcrum bending radiograph) and is expressed as a percentage. The fulcrum bending <b>correction</b> index was compared with the <b>correction</b> rate in 35 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergoing surgical <b>correction.</b> These patients were divided into a stiff and a flexible group based on a fulcrum flexibility of 50 % to show the advantage of the fulcrum bending <b>correction</b> index over the <b>correction</b> rate. Results. The difference in <b>correction</b> rate between the flexible (66 %) and the stiff group (45 %) was significant (P < 0. 05). The difference in the fulcrum bending <b>correction</b> index between the flexible (96 %) and the stiff group (107 %) was not significant (P = 0. 2). Conclusions. The fulcrum bending <b>correction</b> index takes into account the curve flexibility and is therefore better than the <b>correction</b> rate for comparing curve <b>correction</b> and use of instrumentation systems between different series of patients. A fulcrum bending <b>correction</b> index of close to 100 % suggests that the instrumentation has taken up all the flexibility revealed by the fulcrum bending radiograph. It is recommended that the fulcrum bending <b>correction</b> index be used in the future as part of the postoperative assessment of frontal plane <b>correction</b> in cases of thoracic scoliosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Faraday {{rotation}} (FR) {{is one of}} {{the main}} error sources for passive microwave remote sensing from space especially in frequencies less than or equal to 10. 7 GHz. In this paper, Faraday rotation <b>correction</b> for the vertical brightness temperature at L band and the third Stokes parameter brightness temperature at 10. 7 GHz are discussed.

At 1. 4 GHz, <b>correction</b> by polarimetric mode performs better than <b>correction</b> by auxiliary data. At 10. 7 GHz, <b>correction</b> by auxiliary data is feasible while polarimetric mode <b>correction</b> becomes invalid.

40|$|Abstract. Atmospheric <b>correction</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pre-processing steps in quantitative remote sensing. To extract quantitative information from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper-Plus (ETM+) imagery accurately, atmospheric <b>correction</b> is a necessary step. Furthermore, multi-temporal images after atmospheric <b>correction</b> can be compared to each other quantitatively. The Second simulation of satellite signal in the solar spectrum (6 S) radiative code can process many types of satellite data and provide several standard atmosphere and aerosol models for atmospheric <b>correction.</b> This paper demonstrates atmospheric <b>correction</b> of Landsat ETM+ data using 6 S code. Comparing images before and after atmospheric <b>correction,</b> the different of image before and after <b>correction</b> was not obvious using visual interpretation. Therefore, different ground object spectral curves after atmospheric <b>correction</b> are illustrated. They were similar with the standard ground object spectra. The correlation coefficient of ETM+ band 1 to band 4 and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) after atmospheric <b>correction</b> increases. The atmospheric <b>correction</b> removed the atmosphere effect, so the inherent relevant increased. 6 S code was an effective tool for atmospheric <b>correction</b> of remote senisng data...|$|R
