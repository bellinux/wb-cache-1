2500|$|The 1969 Constitution {{modified}} the detailed provision for electoral rolls and {{seats in the}} Assembly. The most significant 1969 modifications were that <b>cross</b> <b>voting</b> was abolished and the B roll was reserved for non-Europeans. The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 A roll, and 8 B roll seats. It was provided {{that the number of}} B roll seats would rise over time in line with the proportion of total personal income tax paid by blacks until a total of 50 black seats was reached. In addition to the B roll seats, the African tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members. The immediate result of this arrangement was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 8 seats in the Assembly, with a handful of African chiefs having 8 seats as well. These reforms served only to reinforce black rejection of the system.|$|E

5000|$|In 1978, Shahabuddin {{left the}} Indian Foreign Service through a {{voluntary}} retirement to join politics. The then Morarji Desai led central government {{refused to give}} him a monthly pension of one thousand rupees as he did not complete 20 years in the service. According to him, the then foreign minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee asked him thrice to reconsider his decision. In 1979, one of the Janata Party's Member of Upper house of Parliament resigned and hence a seat became vacant. The party nominated him from the seat. In 1984, Shahabuddin lost the Rajya Sabha election to the Indian National Congress owing to alleged <b>cross</b> <b>voting</b> by the party legislators in favour of Communist Party of India. Shahabuddin wrote to party leader Karpoori Thakur saying that legislators Satya Narayan Sinha and Munishwar Singh conspired to defeat him and demanded action against them. Subsequently Thakur sacked three legislators after Shahabuddin alleged that they had voted against him.In 1985, Shahabuddin was elected to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Indian parliament) as a candidate of the Janata Party. However, he lost the seat to M.J. Akbar of the Indian National Congress in 1989. In 1991, he was re-elected from the constituency, for which he took a helicopter from Patna to celebrate. In 1991, he again lost the election, this time to Janata Dal (United)'s Mohammed Taslimuddin.|$|E
30|$|For future 3 D TV {{broadcasting}} {{systems and}} navigation applications, {{it is necessary}} to have accurate stereo matching which could precisely estimate depth map from two distanced cameras. In this paper, we first suggest a trinary cross color (TCC) census transform, which can help to achieve accurate disparity raw matching cost with low computational cost. The two-pass cost aggregation (TPCA) is formed to compute the aggregation cost, then the disparity map can be obtained by a range winner-take-all (RWTA) process and a white hole filling procedure. To further enhance the accuracy performance, a range left-right checking (RLRC) method is proposed to classify the results as correct, mismatched, or occluded pixels. Then, the image-based refinements for the mismatched and occluded pixels are proposed to refine the classified errors. Finally, the image-based <b>cross</b> <b>voting</b> and a median filter are employed to complete the fine depth estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed semi-global stereo matching system achieves considerably accurate disparity maps with reasonable computation cost.|$|E
