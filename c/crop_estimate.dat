40|$|Crop {{estimation}} {{is a vital}} {{activity for}} the industry and accuracy is paramount. A project was started last season on ways on which the <b>crop</b> <b>estimate</b> could be improved by taking the fruit size profile into account. For this to be feasible techniques must be developed to calculate weight of the fruit in the field based on a few simple measurements such as length and width of fruit. Information is also required on fruit size distributions and how these change over the season. To obtain this information fruit size (length and two width measurements) has been monitored on samples of tagged fruit at regular intervals over two seasons. A model has been developed which accurately calculates fruit weight based on length and width measurements. The model is robust and has been validated using data from 4 different seasons and on a several orchards. Fruit size distributions were normally distributed other than at the beginning {{or the end of}} a season, when they tended to be skewed. Fruit growth follows a double sigmoid pattern with growth slowing down over the winter period...|$|E
40|$|Strawberry {{is one of}} {{the five}} fruit crops {{included}} in the USDA-funded multi-institutional and trans-disciplinary project, “RosBREED: Enabling Marker-Assisted Breeding in Rosaceae”. A Crop Reference Set (CRS) was developed of 900 genotypes and seedlings from 40 crosses representing the breadth of relevant diversity and encompassing founders used in breeding the domesticated strawberry. Individual native species and cultivar genotypes were included along with 10 progeny from 36 of the crosses of genotypes representing eastern and western North American and European short day and remontant cultivars. This CRS has been phenotyped in five U. S. states. Over 14 fruit quality traits have been studied, as well as remontancy, truss size, peduncle length, <b>crop</b> <b>estimate,</b> plant architecture, and disease resistance. The phenotyping conducted in the first growing season showed considerable variability amongst the genotypes and the locations for all of the characteristics. General and specific combining ability variance components were determined from the populations in order to provide breeders with guidance on the most effective breeding strategies for incorporating the superior traits from this germplasm into their programs...|$|E
40|$|Forecasting {{the size}} of the {{sugarcane}} crop is essential to the industry for optimising cane milling and sugar marketing. The SASA Experiment Station provides regular forecasts of mill and industry average cane yields from a climatic perspective. The usefulness of this information depends on its accuracy, and this communication reports briefly on this aspect. Future yields are calculated by applying the Canesim crop model to historic weather data, likely future weather scenarios, soil characteristics and management practices. Data from approximately 70 weather and rainfall stations are used to simulate the crop for each month of the milling season. Mean yields are calculated for homogenous climate zones, mill areas and the industry as a whole, and are expressed {{as a percentage of the}} yield from the previous season. The information is disseminated to the industry bi-monthly from February to August. Estimation accuracy was determined by calculating the relative mean absolute error between estimated and actual tonnage. Actual yields were adjusted for long term trends in harvest age, the extent of the area that receives irrigation, and any water restrictions. This was compared with the inter-annual coefficient of variation in actual yields to assess the potential value of the forecasts. The mean absolute error (MAE) for the industry estimate was 6. 6 % compared with an inter-annual variation in actual yield of 15. 4 %. This suggests that the industry cane <b>crop</b> <b>estimate</b> should be of value to decision-makers. On average, the MAE at the mill level was 12 %, and ranged from 26 % for Komatipoort to 8 % for Amatikulu. These results indicate that, although further improvements to estimates are needed for irrigated mill areas, the estimates for most dryland areas are sufficiently accurate to be of value to mill management...|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{approaches}} to the construction and widening of roads and highways are essential to offset negative influences on aquatic habitat and fish passage in the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayan Mountains in northern India. Evidence is growing that the expanding, poorly designed network of roads and trails in mountain areas, without giving due considerations to natural processes such as geological processes and climatic severity, such as heavy monsoon precipitation, is {{a major cause of}} habitat fragmentation and degradation of both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. These effects have been quantified for aquatic primary producers (periphyton), aquatic benthic insects, and Snow Trout, a Himalayan teleost (Schizothorax richardsonii, Gray; Schizothoraichthys progastus, McClelland) that dwells in the upper Ganges River, following Indian National Highway 58 (NH- 58) in the mountain region of Garhwal Himalaya, India (latitude 29 degree 61 minutes - 30 degree 28 minutes N; longitude 77 degree 49 minutes - 80 degree 6 minutes E). Indian Highway 58 {{is one of the most}} important highways, is 300 -km long, and passes along the Alaknanda River (230 km), which is one of the parent streams of the Ganges (70 km) in the fragile mountain ecosystem of Garhwal Himalaya of northern India. Keeping in mind the heavy traffic on the highway, a RS 450 million (US $ 100 million) widening project was launched in 2001. The widening of Highway 58 through massive cutting of mountain slopes, the disposal of tons of the cut material downhill into the waterways in an uncontrolled manner, and the improper water management of the slopes has resulted in intensive accumulation of soil and woody debris into the aquatic ecosystem from accelerated erosion, gulling, and landslides, resulting in drastic changes in the physico-chemical and biological profile of the aquatic habitat. Detrimental effects on transparency, current velocity, conductivity, bottom-substrate composition, dissolved oxygen, periphytonic production, and the production of benthic insect communities have been documented. Feeding, spawning, and the passage of the Snow Trout cold-water fish have been degraded or destroyed. Subsequent to the widening of Highway 58, the annual gross primary production (Pg) of periphyton declined from 8771 g C m- 3 yr- 1 (96. 48 k. cal m- 3 yr- 1) to a value of 5952 g C m- 3 yr- 1 (65. 47 k cal m- 3 yr- 1), a 32 -percent decrease in aquatic habitat. The maximum biomass (standing crop) of aquatic insects declined from a mean monthly biomass of 4. 926 g m- 2 (February) to 1. 848 g m- 2, a 62 -percent decrease, and a minimum monthly mean biomass of 0. 408 g m- 2 (August) to 0. 126 g m- 2, a 69 -percent decrease. Subsequent to widening of the highway, the standing <b>crop</b> <b>estimate</b> of Snow Trout declined from a maximum mean monthly biomass of 2. 955 g m- 2 (February) to 1. 201 g m- 2, a 59 -percent decrease, and a minimum monthly mean biomass (August) of 0. 244 g m- 2 to 0. 082 g m- 2, a 66 -percent decrease. Annual productivity of Snow Trout declined from 1. 309 g m- 2 to 0. 448 g m- 2, a 66 -percent decrease. This decline is believed to have been caused by increased turbidity accompanied by a decline in depth and dissolved oxygen, accumulation of fine silt and suspended solids, a decrease in primary productivity, a decrease in general benthic-aquatic insects productivity, depletion of the food supply, and loss of cover. We have recommended the following measures to restore habitat quality and connectivity of Snow Trout: • Stream restoration and stream bank stabilization using these structures: - Toe walls - Retaining walls - Stone layers - Stone arches - Terraces • Bioengineering methods by - Planting fast-growing plant species in combination with wire netting, gravel mining, and dredging in the impacted sites - Protecting riparian vegetation - Monitoring of water quality - Enhancement of fish food reserves - Sustainable {{approaches to}} road construction and widening - Proper drainage of water-saturated mountain slopes and spring runoff during monsoon season (July-August) - Sealing of side drains against underground water penetration alongside endangered sections of the highway - Construction of check dams for protection of steep gullies and side erosion of the river bed We also recommend establishment of a strong partnership among experienced, expert • Geologists • Civil engineers • Structural engineers • Environmental biologist...|$|E

40|$|Andalusia (southern Spain) is {{the largest}} olive (Olea europaea L.) oil {{producing}} region in the world. Th is study sought to identify the main factors influencing olive fruit production in this region, by modeling pollen release as an index of flowering intensity, field floral phenology data, and meteorological data over the fruiting season in three main olive-producing provinces of Andalusia: Jaén, Córdoba, and Granada. Field floral phenological data {{were used to determine}} the anthesis phase, to ascertain which period of the pollination records {{should be included in the}} models.

As the control, continuous flooding irrigation (CF) {{was applied to the}} conventional rice cultivation fields. Based on the observed water storage, Excel Solver was used to <b>estimate</b> <b>crop</b> evapotranspiration. <b>Estimated</b> <b>crop</b> evapotranspiration was used to compute Kc value, then the average Kc values at each growth stage were compared with that for the CF treatment. The estimation method was evaluated by comparing <b>estimated</b> <b>crop</b> evapotranspiration and the crop evapotranspiration derived by the well established FAO procedure. Excel Solver <b>estimated</b> <b>crop</b> evapotranspiration accurately with R 2 values higher than 0. 81.
