The structural consists in an hybrid coupled shear wall (HCSW), developed within the INNOHYCO project (Dall’Asta et al., 2014), obtained coupling an RC wall with two side steel columns by means of steel links where the energy dissipation takes place. The experimental results carried on a subsystem representing {{a portion of the}} shear wall, the dissipative link and one side column, showed that the global dissipative behavior is strongly affected by the characteristics of the link-to-column connection. In particular the prestressing force of the seat angle <b>connection</b> <b>bolts</b> influence in a decisive way the dissipative capacity of the system, especially for the low amplitude cycle.

40|$|Abstract—Bolt {{connection}} {{is one of}} the common connection methods in diesel engine. The {{purpose of this study is}} to verify the difference of considering the <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> or not in the shock response calculation. The methods applying in the study as following: first design the comparison test of welding <b>connection</b> and <b>bolt</b> connection; establish the diesel engine’s fasten component model of considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> and model without considering bolt connection; then calculate the shock response of the two kinds of model by DDAM method; and finally coupling the shock response in three direction. The above tests reach the result that: the natural frequency of model without considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> is higher than that of the model considering bolt connection; the rigid connection area will easily produce stress concentration; and the stress concentration can be effectively reduced by considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection.</b> Therefore, the study suggest that <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> should be considered in the study of shock response calculation of diesel engine frequency domain.

40|$|Robust frames require {{relatively}} weak beams, but strong connections and columns. Limit state design {{may provide the}} reverse. The composite beams used {{in the majority of}} steel framed buildings are shown to possess a ?hidden? reserve of strength. When subjected to the large sagging deformations associated with terrorist attacks, these beams are capable of resisting typically twice their design load. This creates a situation whereby the weak point in a frame can be transferred to the connections, leading to non-ductile and potentially catastrophic failures in the event of severe overloading. Furthermore, certain industry standard nominally pinned connections are shown to lack the ductility required to accommodate large beam end rotations. This lack of ductility could result in the premature failure of connections due to the high tensile forces generated in the <b>connection</b> <b>bolts.</b> To address these problems an alternative approach is advocated, whereby ductile beams are designed to resist only working loads, albeit elastically. Thereafter the upper-bound flexural strength is established. It is the corresponding upper-bound reactions that are used for the subsequent design of components lower down in the load path.

40|$|A {{finite element}} model with {{three-dimensional}} solid elements was established to investigate the bearing failure of cold-formed steel <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> under shear.

Furthermore, it was shown (Chung and Ip. Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Steel Structures, Praha, May 1999, p. 503 - 506) that stress-strain curves, contact stiffnesses and frictional coefficients between element interfaces, and clamping forces developed in bolt shanks were important parameters for accurate prediction of the deformation characteristics of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections.</b> This paper presents an extension of the finite element investigation onto the structural behaviour of cold-formed steel <b>bolted</b> <b>connections,</b> and three distinctive failure modes (Ip and Chung. Proceeding of the Second International Conference on Advances in Steel Structures, Hong Kong, December 1999) as observed in lap shear tests are successfully modelled: bearing failure; shear-out failure; and net-section failure. Furthermore, a parametric study on <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> with different configurations is performed to provide bearing resistances for practical design, and the results of the {{finite element model}}ling are also compared with four codified design rules.

The current design rules on <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed stainless steel are mainly based on those of carbon steel, and are applicable for room (ambient) temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperatures. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed stainless steel structures at elevated temperatures. The key {{findings of the investigation}} are described in the following paragraphs. A total of 25 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of three different grades of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. The stainless steels are austenitic stainless steel EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) and EN 1. 4571 (AISI 316 Ti having small amount of titanium) as well as lean duplex stainless steel EN 1. 4162 (AISI S 32101). Totally 434 tests on <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of stainless steel were performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the nominal strengths calculated from the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European codes for stainless steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the material properties at elevated temperatures were used in the design equations for room temperature. It is shown that the nominal strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. A total of 78 cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> were tested in post-fire condition. The test results were compared with those tested at room temperature. Generally, it is found that the <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> strengths in post-fire condition cooling down from 350 and 650 ºC are higher than those tested at room temperature for all three grades of stainless steel. Finite element models for single shear and double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> were developed and verified against the experimental results. Static analysis technique was used in the numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 450 specimens were performed using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing resistances of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing resistances of cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> were proposed based on both the experimental and numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC.

The laboratory test results were obtained by independent researchers for specimens where the applied loads were resisted by the 2 ̆ 2 block 2 ̆ 2 in shear only. The first set consists of five <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> specimens in the webs of wide flange sections where the tensile resistance planes had been sawn off. The second set consists of ten <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> specimens each in one leg of an angle section that had fractured completely along the net tensile plane through a block shear failure. Comparisons among the gross, net, and active shear planes against the independent laboratory test {{results showed that the}} critical shear planes of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> were best represented by the active shear planes rather than either the gross or the net shear planes. It is also pointed out that full or almost full shear strain hardening was generally achieved at the ultimate limit state of block shear failure of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> in hot-rolled steel plates or sections, irrespective of the connection length. Verification against independent laboratory test results of tee sections bolted at the web reinforces this point...|$|R
30|$|Results from testing {{were used}} {{as part of a}} second phase of {{research}} designed to develop a model for calculating the fire resistance of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> (Peng et al. 2012 b). A strength-reduction model was developed to calculate the load-bearing capacity of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> for given temperature profiles. Comparisons with experimental tests showed good agreement for predicting the fire resistance of <b>bolted</b> timber <b>connections.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstracts: The {{combined}} {{connection with}} welds and bolds has advantages of both welds and <b>bolts</b> <b>connections,</b> {{and can be}} widely used in reinforcing the joint in steel structure. In this paper, the Finite Element Method (FEM) was taken to analyze the carrying capacity of the combined <b>connection</b> with <b>bolts</b> and welds, and the results ware compared with those come from experimental investigation. Further analysis based on FEM ware performed to research the failure mode and bearing performance of the combined connection and the contribution of bolts and welds. Advice was provided for related design...|$|R
