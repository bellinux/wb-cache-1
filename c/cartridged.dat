40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{purposes}} of this study are: 1. To determine guidelines for producing 8 mm continuous loop films through the production of loop films for home economics classes. 2, To show how the 8 mm loop film as a visual technique is suited to home economics, especially to individualize instruction. 3. To compile a handbook for instructors to use in producing 8 mm loop films. An understanding of the procedures involved in producing an 8 mm film was gained from audiovisual classes, consultations with experts in the field, study of audiovisual journals and texts, study of current photographic publications, and study of instruction and operation manuals for equipment necessary for the production of motion pictures. As a basis for writing a handbook on 8 mm loop production, two films were produced for use in home economics classes. Part I of the review of literature provides background information for the use and production of loop films. Terms used to refer to short films are clarified. The terms, film loop and loop, refer to a <b>cartridged</b> film with beginning and end spliced together to facilitate continuous viewing. Regular 8 and Super 8 formats may be used in local production of loop films, the advantage of Super 8 being a 50 percent larger picture and a brighter screen image. The film is shown in a cartridge-loading projector which can be operated easily by the viewer. This projector can be used for individual, small group or large group instruction. A real advantage of the 8 mm loop is that it is particularly suited to individualize instruction allowing for independent study by students. Local production of audiovisual materials allows application of these materials to the specific situation. The individual preparing the materials gains a great satisfaction in producing products for use in his classroom. These audiovisual materials can be produced at a cost lower than comparable materials can be purchased. The principles of 8 mm loop use and production are applied to home economics instruction in Part II of the review of literature. A handbook for teachers to use in the production of 8 mm loop films provides illustrations and guidelines in the choice of equipment [...] camera, tripod, lighting, and backdrop. Steps in planning and producing a loop are discussed with guidelines presented for determining film specifications, choosing a topic, preparing a content outline, preparing titles, filming, processing, editing and splicing, cartridging, and evaluating. General guidelines emphasized in the handbook point out the value of a good home-movie-making booklet in answering questions and providing technical assistance...|$|E

However, even though less powerful than a traditional rifle <b>cartridge,</b> the ballistics are still sufficient for an effective range of 250 - 500 m, which are the maximum typical engagement ranges in combat.
