40|$|Exposure to male odors {{during the}} prepubertal period accelerates puberty, a {{phenomenon}} known as the Vandenbergh effect. This experiment identifies {{the parts of the}} olfactory pathway that respond to male odors in prepubertal female mice. Female mice were kept in a room free of adult male odors from birth until odor exposure. At post-natal day 21, 24 or 28, (ages representing time points early, intermediate, and late in the prepubertal period) mice were exposed to <b>clean</b> <b>bedding,</b> soiled bedding from castrated males, or soiled bedding from intact males. Each group was exposed to odor in separate rooms to prevent cross contamination. Ninety minutes after odor exposure, mice were sacrificed, the brains removed and prepared for c-Fos immunohistochemistry. The numbers of neurons expressing c-Fos were counted in a defined area of the following nuclei: AOB mitral layer, AOB granular layer, MOB, MEPV, MEPD, Aco, BNST, MPOA, and VMH. There was a significant effect of age on c-Fos-expression in the MEPV, MEPD, Aco, MPOA, BNST and piriform cortex. There was a significant effect of odor on c-Fos-expression in the MEPV, MEPD, Aco, MPOA, and VMH, showing that these areas are differentially sensitive to intact male odors vs. <b>clean</b> <b>bedding</b> and that these brain areas may be responsible for communicating odor information that drives puberty acceleration...|$|R

60|$|Of all hotels {{known to}} me, I am {{inclined}} {{to think that the}} Swiss are the best. The things wanted at a hotel are, I fancy, mainly as follows: a clean bed-room, with a good and <b>clean</b> <b>bed,</b> and with it also plenty of water. Good food, well dressed and served at convenient hours, which hours should on occasions be allowed to stretch themselves. Wines that shall be drinkable. Quick attendance. Bills that shall not be absolutely extortionate, smiling faces, and an absence of foul smells. There are many who desire more than this--who expect exquisite cookery, choice wines, subservient domestics, distinguished consideration, and the strictest economy; but they are uneducated travelers, who are going through the apprenticeship of their hotel lives; who may probably never become free of the travelers' guild, or learn to distinguish that which they may fairly hope to attain from that which they can never accomplish.|$|E

60|$|When {{we got up}} {{to breakfast}} in the morning, we were new men. For all this {{hospitality}} no strict charge was made. We could give something if we chose; we need give nothing, if we were poor or if we were stingy. The pauper and the miser are as free as any in the Catholic Convents of Palestine. I have been educated to enmity toward every thing that is Catholic, and sometimes, in consequence of this, I find {{it much easier to}} discover Catholic faults than Catholic merits. But there is one thing I feel no disposition to overlook, and no disposition to forget: and that is, the honest gratitude I and all pilgrims owe, to the Convent Fathers in Palestine. Their doors are always open, and there is always a welcome for any worthy man who comes, whether he comes in rags or clad in purple. The Catholic Convents are a priceless blessing to the poor. A pilgrim without money, whether he be a Protestant or a Catholic, can travel the length and breadth of Palestine, {{and in the midst of}} her desert wastes find wholesome food and a <b>clean</b> <b>bed</b> every night, in these buildings. Pilgrims in better circumstances are often stricken down by the sun and the fevers of the country, and then their saving refuge is the Convent. Without these hospitable retreats, travel in Palestine would be a pleasure which none but the strongest men could dare to undertake. Our party, pilgrims and all, will always be ready and always willing, to touch glasses and drink health, prosperity and long life to the Convent Fathers of Palestine.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{specimen}} of this bushwhacking, that [...] "shoe strike." [...] Now be it understood that I do not pretend {{to know all}} about the matter. I am merely going to speculate a little about some of its phases. And at the outset, I am {{glad to see that}} a system of labor prevails in New England under which laborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to work under all circumstances, and are not tied down and obliged to labor whether you pay them or not! I like the system which lets a man quit when he wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere. One of the reasons why I am opposed to slavery is just here. What is the true condition of the laborer? I take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can. Some will get wealthy. I don't believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than good. So, while we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else. When one starts poor, as most do in the race of life, free society is such that he knows he can better his condition; he knows that there is no fixed condition of labor for his whole life. I am not ashamed to confess that twenty-five years ago I was a hired laborer, mauling rails, at work on a flatboat--just what might happen to any poor man's son! I want every man to have a chance--and I believe a Black man is entitled to it--in which he can better his condition; when he may look forward and hope to be a hired laborer this year and the next, work for himself afterward, and finally to hire men to work for him! That is the system. Up here in New England, you have a soil that scarcely sprouts black-eyed beans, and yet where will you find wealthy men so wealthy, and poverty so rarely in extremity? There is not another such place on earth! I desire that if you get too thick here, and find it hard to better your condition on this soil, you may have a chance to strike and go somewhere else, where you may not be degraded, nor have your families corrupted, by forced rivalry with negro slaves. I want you to have a <b>clean</b> <b>bed</b> and no snakes in it! Then you can better your condition, and so it may go on and on in one endless round so long as man exists {{on the face of the}} earth! ...|$|E

60|$|Philip went to {{the public}} baths in Westminster and spent sixpence on a bath. Then he got himself {{something}} to eat. He {{did not know what}} to do with himself in the afternoon. He would not go back to the hospital in case anyone should ask him questions, and besides, he had nothing to do there now; they would wonder in the two or three departments he had worked in why he did not come, but they must think what they chose, it did not matter: he would not be the first student who had dropped out without warning. He {{went to the}} free library, and looked at the papers till they wearied him, then he took out Stevenson's New Arabian Nights; but he found he could not read: the words meant nothing to him, and he continued to brood over his helplessness. He kept on thinking the same things all the time, and the fixity of his thoughts made his head ache. At last, craving for fresh air, he went into the Green Park and lay down on the grass. He thought miserably of his deformity, which made it impossible for him to go to the war. He went to sleep and dreamt that he was suddenly sound of foot and out at the Cape in a regiment of Yeomanry; the pictures he had looked at in the illustrated papers gave materials for his fancy; and he saw himself on the Veldt, in khaki, sitting with other men round a fire at night. When he awoke he found that it was still quite light, and presently he heard Big Ben strike seven. He had twelve hours to get through with nothing to do. He dreaded the interminable night. The sky was overcast and he feared it would rain; he would have to go to a lodging-house where he could get a bed; he had seen them advertised on lamps outside houses in Lambeth: Good Beds sixpence; he had never been inside one, and dreaded the foul smell and the vermin. He made up his mind to stay in the open air if he possibly could. He remained in the park till it was closed and then began to walk about. He was very tired. The thought came to him that an accident would be a piece of luck, so that he could be taken to a hospital and lie there, in a <b>clean</b> <b>bed,</b> for weeks. At midnight he was so hungry that he could not go without food any more, so he went to a coffee stall at Hyde Park Corner and ate a couple of potatoes and had a cup of coffee. Then he walked again. He felt too restless to sleep, and he had a horrible dread of being moved on by the police. He noted that he was beginning to look upon the constable from quite a new angle. This was the third night he had spent out. Now and then he sat on the benches in Piccadilly and towards morning he strolled down to The Embankment. He listened to the striking of Big Ben, marking every quarter of an hour, and reckoned out how long it left till the city woke again. In the morning he spent a few coppers on making himself neat and clean, bought a paper to read the advertisements, and set out once more on the search for work.|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{development}} of male California voles (Microtus californicus) is delayed when voles are raised in bedding taken from their family. In these experiments {{the effects of}} this chemi-cally mediated puberty delay on male reproductive potential were examined. Males were paired with females for a 4 -day period; the resultant uterine weights constituted a measure of male potency. In Experiments 1 and 2, 45 -day-old males raised in <b>clean</b> or family <b>bedding</b> were paired with females. Regardless of whether cohabitation occurred in a clean, novel cage or in the male’s home cage, only males reared in <b>clean</b> <b>bedding</b> caused significant growth of the female reproduc-tive tract. In Experiment 3 the stimulus males were adults, either castrated or intact. Only cohabi-tation with an intact male stimulated female reproductive development. These data show that chemical cues present in family bedding impair the ability of young males to stimulate reproduc-tive development in females and suggest that this effect is due to low circulating androgen levels in reproductively delayed males. Since chemical cues in bedding from solitary males did not activate uterine growth, the androgen-dependent deficit in delayed males may be behavioral. The relevance of these phenomena to animals living in a natural environment is discussed...|$|R
