5|$|Construction {{began on}} Dmitrii Donskoi on 22 September 1880 at the New Admiralty Shipyard in St. Petersburg, {{although}} the formal keel-laying ceremony was not held until 21 May 1881. She was launched on 30 August 1882 and completed in early 1885. The ship's total <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> 3,421,468 rubles. The ship {{was named after}} Dmitry Donskoy, Grand Duke of Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{commenced}} on 11 February 1943, and {{was completed}} on 15 November. Stages of the P-9 distillation plant became operational between 29 May and 4 September 1943.

50|$|Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> {{that change}} in {{proportion}} to the good or service that a business produces. Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> also the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. They can also <b>be</b> considered normal <b>costs.</b> Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total cost. Direct <b>costs,</b> however, <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> that can easily be associated with a particular cost object. However, not all variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> direct <b>costs.</b> For example, variable manufacturing overhead <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> variable <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> indirect <b>costs,</b> not direct <b>costs.</b> Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.|$|R
5000|$|Historical <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> whereby {{materials}} and labor may be allocated based on past experience. Historical <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> a classification of costs by time.

5|$|The project {{expenditure}} through 1 October 1945 was $1.845billion, {{equivalent to}} less than nine days of wartime spending, and was $2.191billion when the AEC assumed control on 1 January 1947.

5|$|Adamant was one {{of eleven}} ships built to a 1767 design by John Williams, and one of five ordered between 1775-6. She was ordered from Peter Baker, of Liverpool, on 13 November 1776, and laid down on 6 September 1777.

5000|$|Resource Costs: Resources {{consist of}} labor, {{equipment}}, materials, subcontractors, trucking, {{and any other}} cost detail items. Labor and equipment <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> internal crew <b>costs,</b> whereas all other resource <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> received from vendors, such as material suppliers, subcontractors, and trucking companies. Labor <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> usually calculated from wages, benefits, burden, and workers compensation. Equipment <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> calculated from purchase price, taxes, fuel consumption, and other operating expenses.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{average cost}} curve {{will have a}} U-shape, because fixed <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> all {{incurred}} before any production takes place and marginal <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> typically increasing, because of diminishing marginal productivity. In this [...] "typical" [...] case, for low levels of production marginal <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> below average <b>costs,</b> so average <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> decreasing as quantity increases. An increasing marginal cost curve will intersect a U-shaped average cost curve at its minimum, after which point the average cost curve begins to slope upward. For further increases in production beyond this minimum, marginal <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> above average <b>costs,</b> so average <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> increasing as quantity increases. An example of this typical case would be a factory designed to produce a specific quantity of widgets per period: below a certain production level, average <b>cost</b> <b>is</b> higher due to under-utilized equipment, while above that level, production bottlenecks increase the average cost.|$|R

5|$|After {{assessing}} the devastation in Florida and Louisiana, U.S. President George H. W. Bush initially proposed a $7.1billion aid package to provide disaster benefits, small-business loans, agricultural recovery, food stamps, and public housing {{for victims of}} Hurricane Andrew. After the House of Representatives appropriated aid to victims of Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and Typhoon Omar in Guam, the <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> later increased to $11.1billion. The bill, which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time, was passed by Congress as House Resolution5620 on September18, and {{signed into law by}} President Bush on September23. The state of Florida alone received $9billion through the disaster relief bill.|$|E
5|$|As the condor's {{population}} {{continued to}} decline, discussion began about starting a captive breeding {{program for the}} birds. Opponents to this plan argued that the condors {{had the right to}} freedom, that capturing all of the condors would change the species' habits forever, and that the <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> too great. However, the project received the approval of the United States government, and the capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on Easter Sunday 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured. At that point, there were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half of the eighteenth century, The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high <b>cost,</b> <b>was</b> a bestseller. In 1799 it was in a fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a smaller and more {{affordable}} octavo size, and this was another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, and cheaper pirated American and Irish imports, there was room in the market for another edition in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E
30|$|Prices were {{calculated}} and reported in European Euros (€). Since all <b>costs</b> <b>were</b> realised approximately 12  months after treatment, a correction for differential timing of economic <b>costs</b> <b>was</b> not performed.

5|$|Between January and March 1916, Townshend {{launched}} several {{attacks in}} an attempt to lift the siege.

5|$|By 1835 {{the idea}} of {{building}} a railway from Glasgow into Ayrshire gained sufficient support for a survey to be commissioned from John Miller, {{a partner in the}} firm of Grainger and Miller, which had been heavily involved in the earlier railways in the west of Scotland. Miller proposed a route from Tradeston, in Glasgow {{at the south end of}} Glasgow Bridge, through Paisley and the Garnock Valley to Kilwinning and Ayr, with a branch from Dalry to Kilmarnock. The <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> to be £550,000 and a 10% return could be expected; notwithstanding the south-westerly course of the line, it was foreseen as a first step towards linking with railways in England.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the largest}} single <b>cost</b> <b>was</b> the {{purchase}} of the ship Terra Nova, for £12,500. Terra Nova had been in Antarctica before, as part of the second Discovery relief operation. Scott wanted to sail her as a Naval vessel under the White Ensign; to enable this, he obtained membership of the Royal Yacht Squadron for the sum of £100. He was thus able to impose Naval discipline on the expedition, and as a registered yacht of the Squadron, Terra Nova became exempt from Board of Trade regulations which might otherwise have deemed her unfit to sail.|$|E
