40|$|Background: In the Indian {{cultural}} scenario, {{the wife}} {{is the primary}} caregiver when the husband falls mentally sick. The caregiver burden and the gender issues make women more vulnerable to this particular situation. This study attempts {{to take a closer}} look at the <b>coping</b> styles, <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance,</b> and wellbeing of such a population and the interplay of the above variables. Aim: This study aims to determine correlations between <b>coping</b> styles, <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance,</b> and wllbeing of the women spouses of the mentally ill. Materials and Method: A passive observational design has been used. The tools used in this study are Life Change Event Inventory, AECOM Coping Scale Questionnaire, and PGI Well being scale. Statistical Analysis: Pearson&#x 2032;s product moment correlation is used to study the relationship between the variables. Result and Conclusions: It is concluded that the wives of mentally ill tend to use certain coping styles more than others and this preference lowers the stress experienced and enhance their sense of well being. It is also concluded that women with mentally ill spouses could be hardier due to the sociocultural expectations imposed on them where care giving of their mentally sick husbands are concerned...|$|R

To elucidate the possible role of <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance,</b> we examined 96 patients with MI (68 men and 28 women, age 40 – 90 years) with a <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> check list in which <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> was quantified as total points for 20 self-evaluated items, each scored between 1 and 4 points. Their scores were compared with control values obtained from persons not suffering from MI, and further analyzed by dividing them into 3 groups according to their grade of stress tolerance; that is, low (39 or less in score), moderate (40 – 49) and high (50 – 80). The mean <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> score (± SD) was significantly lower in the 96 MI patients (49. 5 ± 8. 90 points) than in the controls (60. 8 ± 7. 3 points). The <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> grade was low in 13 of the 96 (13. 5 %), moderate in 34 (35. 5 %) and high in 49 (51. 0 %).

The relative performance of genotypes under stress and control conditions can be used as an indicator to identify and map QTLs, which can be further used in breeding crop varieties for <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance,</b> rather than mapping QTLs based on phenotypic performance in stress environment alone (Raman et al. 2012). This has practical relevance since genotypes with low yield potential under control condition quite often show higher <b>tolerance</b> to <b>stress</b> than high yielding genotypes. Genomic regions governing salinity <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> was successfully mapped in rice using stress indices (Pandit et al. 2010, Kumar et al. 2015; Tiwari et al. 2016).

40|$|Marine bioinvasion {{has been}} {{increasing}} exponentially due to intensive human activities. To manage the threats posed by marine bioinvasion, {{it is important to}} understand the key factors for invasion success. <b>Stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> is thought to play an important role in the invasion process, however, little is known of the nature of this <b>tolerance,</b> particularly whether <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> is species- or population-specific. To determine this, laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate differential tolerance of populations of a cosmopolitan marine invasive mussel, Perna viridis, and whether <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> can be altered through pre-selection of individuals. Comparisons were firstly made between two local P. viridis populations from the intertidal and subtidal zones to test if <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> was population-specific. Individuals from the intertidal population had higher baseline heart rates, lower critical salinity values, Scrit, for cardiac activity and longer survival duration at low salinity than individuals from the subtidal population, supporting the presence of population level differences in <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Mortality of P. viridis was also compared at sites in both their introduced range (Hong Kong) and native range (Indonesia) which revealed that individuals from the Hong Kong population were more stress tolerant than their native counterparts in Indonesia. Using the same experimental approach, the effect of pre-selection to stress (a prior pre-selection to hypoxia and a subsequent exposure to heat) showed that <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> can be enhanced by pre-selection. The second part of this study investigated whether invasive mussels, Brachidontes variabilis and P. virdis, were more stress tolerant than the native, non-invasive, Septifer virgatus. Laboratory experiments compared the Scrit as well as critical temperature, Hcrit for cardiac activity. Mortality and byssus thread production were also measured in a factorial design with different combinations of temperature (16, 24 and 32 °C) and salinity (8, 16, 32 p. s. u) for 15 days. The two invasive mussels had a higher Hcrit and lower Scrit, which indicated a higher <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance,</b> than the non-invasive mussel. The mortality rate of P. viridis was faster than in B. variabilis and S. virgatus at 8 p. s. u. whereas S. virgatus was the only mussel that exhibited mortality in the medium hyposalinity (16 p. s. u.) and showed much slower byssus attachment than the invasive mussels, suggesting that the invasive mussels are more stress tolerant to heat and medium hyposalinity than the non-invasive species. Overall, <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> proved to be higher in the invasive than non-invasive species and was also population-specific with higher <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> in the invasive population, which may be attributed to the selection of more tolerant individuals during the invasion process. Such a process may occur when founding individuals successfully pass through an invasion process, which may increase the overall mean population-level of <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> and explain why invasive species are generally more stress tolerant than native species. Thus <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> plays an important role in invasion success and invasive species with high <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> may be favoured by climate change, including ocean warming and increased precipitation, which may extend their current distribution range. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

This study provides an evidence for a novel function of the PDH 45 gene in high salinity (NaCl) <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> in bacteria (Eschericia coli, BL 21 cells) also. Furthermore, it has been shown that the functionally active PDH 45 gene is required to show the <b>stress</b> <b>tolerance</b> in bacteria because the single mutants (E 183 G or R 363 Q) and the double mutant (E 183 G + R 363 Q) of the gene could not confer the same function.
