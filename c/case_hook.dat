In many <b>cases,</b> <b>hooks</b> are described by using these various parts of the hook. Example: Wide gap, 2X Long Shank, Hollow Point, Turned Down Ring Eye Bait hook.|$|R

Objectives: We {{describe}} 4 {{patients with}} proximal pedicle hook migration as a late complication (greater than 12 months postoperatively) of posterior correction surgery in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. We studied failure mechanisms and propose strategies for revision surgery. Summary of background data: Few published <b>cases</b> of <b>hook</b> migration into the spinal canal concern mainly intra-operative or early postoperative dislodgement. Re-operation rates for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis are 2 % to 10 %. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records and radiographic images in 4 patients with symptomatic pedicle hook migration into the spinal canal. We studied our scoliosis revision surgery rates {{over the past}} 10 years and reviewed the literature for instrumentation failure after scoliosis surgery. Results: Our total re-operation rate between January 2002 and April 2012 was 7. 0 % (56 of 800 procedures), with a mean follow-up of 61 months (range, 6 - 129 months). Proximal hook migration presented in 1. 0 % (8 of 800 procedures), including 4 into the spinal canal. These 4 patients presented with pain symptoms 19 - 78 months after uneventful index posterior correction surgery. In all 4 patients, radiographic imaging showed proximal pedicle hook migration into the spinal canal without proximal sagittal alignment problems. In all patients, spinal fusion was observed on computed tomographic imaging and at revision surgery. Revision surgery consisted of at least hook removal. In all 4 patients, symptoms completely resolved over time. Conclusions: Hooks can migrate and potentially cause neurologic impairment and pain long after index surgery, {{despite the presence of}} solid spinal fusion. We believe this is partly the result of the surgical technique we used and have since abandoned, and partly the proximal spine settling and fusion mass deformation over time, which we call ''proximal junctional scoliosis.

40|$|The {{accidental}} {{capture of}} sea turtles with longline {{is a frequent}} event in the Mediterranean sea. Frequently hooks are located in oral cavity or oesophagus and surgical removal is relatively easy; whereas in many other <b>cases</b> <b>hooks</b> and especially lines are located in lower digestive tract, often causing severe damages, as serious injuries on the intestinal wall. Recently, effective surgical techniques have been proposed for hook and line extraction from different districts of digestive tract. The access to the coelomic cavity through the prefemoral soft tissues allows the removal of hooks and lines from the caudal portions of the digestive tract and it is often employed in conjunction with cervical or axillary approach, if one or more hooks are located in oesophagus or stomach and lines cross the entire digestive tract. In this study, the left inguinal approach is compared to the right one, and results are reported concerning 97 turtles treated by these routes for the extraction of foreign bodies from digestive tract. The surgical approach through soft tissues of the right inguinal region was performed in 63 turtles. In 23 cases a unique approach {{was used to remove}} hooks lodged in the lower digestive tract and lines extended through the entire digestive tract. In 40 cases this approach was performed together with cervical and left axillary surgical approaches, to remove hooks lodged in oesophagus or stomach, and lines crossing the lower digestive tract. The surgical approach through the soft tissues of the left inguinal region was performed in 34 turtles. This technique was employed as a single approach in 5 <b>cases</b> to remove <b>hooks</b> stopped in the pyloric portion of the stomach, and in 10 cases to remove lines crossing the entire digestive tract. In the remaining 19 cases the left inguinal approach was employed additionally to the cervical one, to remove hooks lodged in the oesophagus and lines extended through the entire digestive tract. To remove hooks located in the intestine, we chose the side closest {{to the site of the}} foreign body. To remove line crossing all the digestive tract, the choice of the side access was initially random, but experience showed how the right inguinal approach is to be preferred. Indeed, we tested how this approach allows the exteriorization of longer tracts of intestine, whereas with the left inguinal approach is often difficult to expose the tract between jejunum and ileum, because this portion is more subject than others to plication, intussusceptions and severe lacerations of walls, because of the major tensions that line induces there. To guarantee the survival of the patient, our direct experience show definitely how it is important to operate as soon as possible, in particular when it could be present a line in the digestive tract. The choice of the surgical approach appears crucial to solve lifethreatening situations, in which lines cross the entire digestive tube...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} effects of the type and volume fraction of steel fibers on the mechanical behaviors of fiber-reinforced cement composites (FRCCs) with high strengths. Various FRCC mix cases were designed and tested in two steps. At the 1 st step, two types of steel fibers (straight and hooked) were examined with two different fiber volumes (1. 0 and 1. 5 %). The test variables of the 1 st step included the type and volume fraction of steel fibers, and the inclusion of coarse aggregate. At the 2 nd step, ultrahigh strength FRCC mix <b>cases</b> using <b>hooked</b> steel fibers only were tested with two different fiber volumes (1. 0 and 1. 5 %). Various mechanical tests were performed to evaluate the stress-strain behaviors of the FRCCs subjected to uniaxial compression, direct tension, and third-point bending.

5000|$|Adding {{a trailer}} hook or [...] "stinger" [...] hook (either a single or treble hook) behind the main spinnerbait hook {{is also a}} {{personal}} preference and may ensure a better hookup as well preventing fish that jump from throwing the bait.

We have {{been led to}} this discovery by a numerical exploration. We noted it {{in each of the}} irreducible representations of Sn up to n = 6. The calculations in these cases were carried out by constructing the corresponding Kazhdan-Lusztig graphs from tables (M.

To extend the calculations to n = 7 we have used graphs obtained by means of an algorithm given by Lascoux and Schützenberger (Polynomes de Kazhdan & Lusztig pour les Grassmanniennes, preprint). Remarkably, the same property holds also for these graphs. These findings appear to confirm the assertion made by these authors that their algorithm does indeed yield K-L graphs. For the <b>case</b> of <b>hook</b> shapes we have obtained an explicit construction of the transforming matrices, a result which was also suggested by our numerical data. For general shapes, the transforming matrices are less explicit and our proof is based on certain properties of the Kazhdan-Lusztig representations given in their article (Invent.
