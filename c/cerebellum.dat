5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the <b>cerebellum</b> was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the <b>cerebellum</b> and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the <b>cerebellum.</b> In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the <b>cerebellum</b> using functional MRI suggest {{that more than half of}} the cerebellar cortex is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cerebellum</b> {{is divided}} into an {{anterior}} lobe, a posterior lobe, and the flocculonodular lobe. The anterior and posterior lobes are connected in the middle by the vermis. The <b>cerebellum</b> has a much thinner outer cortex that is narrowly furrowed horizontally.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cerebellum</b> modulates {{the outputs}} of other brain systems, whether motor related or thought related, {{to make them}} certain and precise. Removal of the <b>cerebellum</b> does not prevent an animal from doing {{anything}} in particular, but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy. This precision is not built-in, but learned by trial and error. The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle {{is an example of}} a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the <b>cerebellum.</b> 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the <b>cerebellum</b> and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{variation in the}} size and shape of the <b>cerebellum</b> in different vertebrate species. In amphibians, it is little developed, and in lampreys, and hagfish, the <b>cerebellum</b> is barely distinguishable from the brain-stem. Although the spinocerebellum is present in these groups, the primary structures are small, paired-nuclei corresponding to the vestibulocerebellum. The <b>cerebellum</b> is a bit larger in reptiles, considerably larger in birds, and larger yet in mammals. The large paired and convoluted lobes found in humans are typical of mammals, but the <b>cerebellum</b> is, in general, a single median lobe in other groups, and is either smooth or only slightly grooved. In mammals, the neocerebellum is the major part of the <b>cerebellum</b> by mass, but, in other vertebrates, it is typically the spinocerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire <b>cerebellum</b> may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the <b>cerebellum</b> can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Even the {{earliest}} anatomists {{were able to}} recognize the <b>cerebellum</b> by its distinctive appearance. Aristotle and Herophilus (quoted in Galen) called it the parencephalis, {{as opposed to the}} encephalon or brain proper. Galen's extensive description is {{the earliest}} that survives. He speculated that the <b>cerebellum</b> was the source of motor nerves.|$|E
5|$|Further {{significant}} developments did {{not come}} until the Renaissance. Vesalius discussed the <b>cerebellum</b> briefly, and the anatomy was described more thoroughly by Thomas Willis in 1664. More anatomical work was done during the 18th century, {{but it was not}} until early in the 19th century that the first insights into the function of the <b>cerebellum</b> were obtained. Luigi Rolando in 1809 established the key finding that damage to the <b>cerebellum</b> results in motor disturbances. Jean Pierre Flourens in the first half of the 19th century carried out detailed experimental work, which revealed that animals with cerebellar damage can still move, but with a loss of coordination (strange movements, awkward gait, and muscular weakness), and that recovery after the lesion can be nearly complete unless the lesion is very extensive. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was widely accepted that the primary function of the <b>cerebellum</b> relates to motor control; the first half of the 20th century produced several detailed descriptions of the clinical symptoms associated with cerebellar disease in humans.|$|E
5|$|In normal development, {{endogenous}} sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid {{proliferation of}} cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) {{in the external}} granule layer (EGL). Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the early postnatal period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking during early development (postnatal day 7 in the mouse). As CGNPs terminally differentiate into <b>cerebellum</b> granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature <b>cerebellum</b> (by post-natal day 20 in the mouse). Mutations that abnormally activate Sonic hedgehog signaling predispose to cancer of the <b>cerebellum</b> (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse models.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cerebellum</b> is the {{youngest}} brain region (and body part) in centenarians according to an epigenetic biomarker of tissue age known as epigenetic clock: it is about 15 years younger than expected in a centenarian. Further, gene expression patterns in the human <b>cerebellum</b> show less age-related alteration than that in the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cerebellum</b> of {{cartilaginous}} and {{bony fishes}} is extraordinarily large and complex. In {{at least one}} important respect, it differs in internal structure from the mammalian cerebellum: The fish <b>cerebellum</b> does not contain discrete deep cerebellar nuclei. Instead, the primary targets of Purkinje cells are a distinct type of cell distributed across the cerebellar cortex, a type not seen in mammals. In mormyrid fish (a family of weakly electrosensitive freshwater fish), the <b>cerebellum</b> is considerably larger {{than the rest of}} the brain put together. The largest part of it is a special structure called the valvula, which has an unusually regular architecture and receives much of its input from the electrosensory system.|$|E
5|$|The {{circuits}} in the <b>cerebellum</b> {{are similar}} across all classes of vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. There {{is also an}} analogous brain structure in cephalopods with well-developed brains, such as octopuses. This has been taken {{as evidence that the}} <b>cerebellum</b> performs functions important to all animal species with a brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{hindbrain}} (or metencephalon) {{is particularly}} involved in swimming and balance. The <b>cerebellum</b> is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest {{part of the}} brain. Hagfish and lampreys have relatively small cerebellae, while the mormyrid <b>cerebellum</b> is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sense.|$|E
5|$|The human <b>cerebellum</b> {{changes with}} age. These changes {{may differ from}} those of other parts of the brain.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that the <b>cerebellum</b> is involved in pain processing. The <b>cerebellum</b> receives pain input from both descending cortico-cerebellar pathways and ascending spino-cerebellar pathways, through the pontine nuclei and inferior olives. Some of this information is transferred to the motor system inducing a conscious motor avoidance of pain, graded according to pain intensity.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence that the}} <b>cerebellum</b> plays {{an essential role in}} some types of motor learning. The tasks where the <b>cerebellum</b> most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed. There has, however, been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the <b>cerebellum</b> itself, or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures. Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the <b>cerebellum</b> are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus, who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses. Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened. Most subsequent cerebellar-learning models, however, have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal, and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened. Some of these later models, such as the Adaptive Filter model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the <b>cerebellum</b> to {{different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the <b>cerebellum.</b> The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs {{to different}} parts of the <b>cerebellum.</b> The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the <b>cerebellum</b> receives modulatory input from the inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E
5|$|The deep nuclei of the <b>cerebellum</b> are {{clusters}} of gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the <b>cerebellum.</b> They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output from the <b>cerebellum.</b> These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the <b>cerebellum</b> have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the <b>cerebellum.</b> They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the <b>cerebellum</b> is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E
5|$|Viewed from {{underneath}} {{between the two}} lobes is the third lobe the flocculonodular lobe. The <b>cerebellum</b> rests {{at the back of}} the cranial cavity, lying beneath the occipital lobes, and is separated from these by the cerebellar tentorium, a sheet of fibre.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have granule cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most influential speculation is that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate for changes in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly {{on the basis of these}} structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the <b>cerebellum</b> itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the <b>cerebellum</b> directly influences motor output in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} <b>cerebellum</b> has the {{appearance}} of a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the <b>cerebellum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Congenital malformation, {{hereditary}} disorders, {{and acquired}} conditions can affect cerebellar structure and, consequently, cerebellar function. Unless the causative condition is reversible, {{the only possible}} treatment is to help people live with their problems. Visualization of the fetal <b>cerebellum</b> by ultrasound scan at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy {{can be used to}} screen for fetal neural tube defects with a sensitivity rate of up to 99%.|$|E
5|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of gross anatomy, the cerebellar cortex {{appears to be a}} homogeneous sheet of tissue, and, from {{the viewpoint}} of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet appear to have the same internal structure. There are, however, a number of respects in which the structure of the <b>cerebellum</b> is compartmentalized. There are large compartments that are generally known as zones; these can be divided into smaller compartments known as microzones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first {{considered}} the brain to be {{the seat of the}} mind. Also in {{the fifth century}} BC in Athens, Hippocrates believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness. Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and <b>cerebellum.</b> Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the <b>cerebellum,</b> and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs. He concluded that, as the <b>cerebellum</b> was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers project {{directly}} to the deep nuclei, but also give rise to the following pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals {{directly to}} the deep nuclei. The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the <b>cerebellum</b> also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E
5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a <b>cerebellum</b> {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the <b>cerebellum</b> in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} <b>cerebellum,</b> giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one way or another.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to refine patterns of body movement by practicing, or more generally by repetition. A number of brain areas are involved, including the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and especially the <b>cerebellum,</b> which functions as a large memory bank for microadjustments of the parameters of movement.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} that are closely linked to cerebellar degeneration include the idiopathic progressive neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an autoimmune response that causes neuronal loss in the <b>cerebellum.</b> Cerebellar atrophy can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{original}} discovery in the rabbit hippocampus, LTP {{has been observed}} {{in a variety of}} other neural structures, including the cerebral cortex, <b>cerebellum,</b> amygdala, and many others. Robert Malenka, a prominent LTP researcher, has suggested that LTP may even occur at all excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{elaboration}} of the cerebral cortex {{carries with it}} changes to other brain areas. The superior colliculus, which {{plays a major role}} in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex. The <b>cerebellum</b> of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex, which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the brain}} and a person's {{intelligence}} are not strongly related. Studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations (averaging around 0.3 to 0.4) between brain volume and IQ. The most consistent associations are observed within the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the hippocampi, and the <b>cerebellum,</b> but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in IQ, which itself has only a partial relationship to general intelligence and real-world performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{arise from}} the subclavian artery, and run through the transverse foramen of the upper six vertebrae of the neck. After exiting {{at the level of}} the first cervical vertebra, its course changes from vertical to horizontal, and then enters the skull through the foramen magnum. Inside the skull, the arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which joins the circle of Willis. In total, three quarters of the artery are outside the skull; it has a high mobility in this area due to rotational movement in the neck and is therefore vulnerable to trauma. Most dissections happen {{at the level of the}} first and second vertebrae. The vertebral artery supplies a number of vital structures in the posterior cranial fossa, such as the brainstem, the <b>cerebellum</b> and the occipital lobes. The brainstem harbors a number of vital functions (such as respiration) and controls the nerves of the face and neck. The <b>cerebellum</b> is part of the diffuse system that coordinates movement. Finally, the occipital lobes participate in the sense of vision.|$|E
5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and anatomical remodeling of vestibular and proprioceptive nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce macroscopic anatomical remodeling of the hindbrain, including the <b>cerebellum.</b> The magnitude of this remodeling and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult neurogenesis to these changes.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} neuron play {{dominant}} {{roles in the}} cerebellar circuit: Purkinje cells and granule cells. Three types of axons also play dominant roles: mossy fibers and climbing fibers (which enter the <b>cerebellum</b> from outside), and parallel fibers (which are the axons of granule cells). There are two main pathways through the cerebellar circuit, originating from mossy fibers and climbing fibers, both eventually terminating in the deep cerebellar nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The <b>cerebellum,</b> {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The brain has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. Blood from the <b>cerebellum</b> and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E
