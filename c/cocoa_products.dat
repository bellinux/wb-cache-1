25|$|The cacao tree is {{native to}} the Americas. It {{originated}} in Central America and parts of Mexico. More than 5,000 years ago, it was consumed by pre-Columbian cultures along the Yucatán, including the Mayans, and {{as far back as}} Olmeca civilization in spiritual ceremonies. It also grows {{in the foothills of the}} Andes in the Amazon and Orinoco basins of South America, in Colombia and Venezuela. Wild cacao still grows there. Its range may have been larger in the past; evidence of its wild range may be obscured by cultivation of the tree in these areas since long before the Spanish arrived. New chemical analysis of residue extracted from pottery excavated at an archaeological site at Puerto Escondido, in Honduras, indicates that <b>cocoa</b> <b>products</b> were first consumed there sometime between 1500 and 1400 BC. Evidence also indicates that, long before the flavor of the cacao seed (or bean) became popular, the sweet pulp of the chocolate fruit, used in making a fermented (5% alcohol) beverage, first drew attention to the plant in the Americas. The cocoa bean was a common currency throughout Mesoamerica before the Spanish conquest.|$|E

2500|$|Often rules {{apply to}} all goods neutrally, but may have a greater {{practical}} effect on imports than domestic products. For such [...] "indirect" [...] discriminatory (or [...] "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional [...] "mandatory" [...] or [...] "overriding" [...] requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter {{if it was not}} cube shaped was disproportionate: it would [...] "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" [...] and labelling would protect consumers [...] "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that <b>cocoa</b> <b>products</b> that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as [...] "chocolate". It had to be [...] "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a [...] "chocolate substitute" [...] label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A 'neutral and objective statement' was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have [...] "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" [...] that [...] "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess whether}} antioxidant, {{anti-inflammatory}} and other cardio-protective effects attributed to cocoa are achieved when regularly consuming moderate amounts of a flavanol-rich soluble <b>cocoa</b> <b>product,</b> a non-randomized, controlled, crossover, free-living study {{was carried out}} in healthy (n = 24; 25. 9 ± 5. 6 years) and moderately hypercholesterolemic (200 - 240 mg dL- 1; n = 20; 30. 0 ± 10. 3 years) volunteers. Participants consumed two servings per day (7. 5 g per serving) of a soluble <b>cocoa</b> <b>product</b> (providing 45. 3 mg flavanols per day) in milk, which was compared with consuming only milk during a 4 week period. The effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were determined, as well as on serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles, interleukins (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), vascular (VCAM- 1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecules (ICAM- 1), serum malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl groups (CG), ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and free radical scavenging capacity (ABTS). During the study, the volunteers' diets and physical activity were also evaluated, as well as any changes in weight, skin folds, circumferences and related anthropometric parameters. Cocoa and certain polyphenol-rich fruits and vegetables and their derivatives were restricted. After consuming the <b>cocoa</b> <b>product</b> positive effects were observed such as an increase in serum HDL-C (p < 0. 001) and dietary fiber intake (p = 0. 050), whereas IL- 10 decreased (p = 0. 022). Other cardiovascular-related biomarkers and anthropometric parameters were unaffected. We have therefore concluded that regular consumption of this <b>cocoa</b> <b>product</b> in a Spanish-Mediterranean diet may protect against cardiovascular disease in healthy and hypercholesterolemic subjects without producing any weight gain or other anthropometric changes. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
