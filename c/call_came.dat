5|$|The victims' {{bodies were}} found {{floating}} in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989. The first body was found when several people on board a sailboat, crossing under the Sunshine Skyway, saw an object in the water. The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles north from the first. While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body, a <b>call</b> <b>came</b> in about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards to the east. All three female {{bodies were found}} face down, bound with a rope around the neck, and naked below the waist.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the service, {{lifeboat}} launch and recovery was usually undertaken by women. There were deeply-held views about women actually crewing the boats themselves – it was considered extremely bad luck. Along all parts part of the coastline, women supported their men on the lifeboat crews by working together to get the lifeboat afloat and then later recovering it from the water in readiness for when the next <b>call</b> <b>came.</b> While lifeboat crew are still predominantly male (92%), the first female (inshore) crew member was Elizabeth Hostvedt in 1969, and Frances Glody was the first woman crew member on an all-weather lifeboat, at Dunmore East Lifeboat Station, in 1981. Lauren McGuire, at the age of 27, became the RNLI's youngest station manager in 2011, at Clovelly, Devon.|$|E
5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first <b>call</b> <b>came</b> from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E

He was waiting for orders when the <b>call</b> <b>came</b> in for a commando operation to get Hambleton out. Norris was immediately dispatched to lead an operation to rescue Hambleton. He recruited five Vietnamese Sea Commando frogmen from the Lien Doc Nguoi Nhia (LDNN), Naval Advisory Detachment (NAD) in Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|The match itself {{swirled around}} {{controversy}} between Abiodun Okulaja's (the center referee) calls and officiating. The most questionable calls were associated {{the severity of}} cards distributed to players and a late-match decision to award a penalty kick to the United, in which many claimed was a fake trip in the box. One controversial <b>call</b> <b>came</b> from a reckless challenge by Galaxy midfielder, Beckham, to United forward, Josh Wolff in the 40th minute. Following the referee stopping play to call the foul, a verbal exchange between Beckham and United's Santino Quaranta resulted in a swarm of United and Galaxy players coming in to push the two apart. While Quaranta was not carded for his exchange with Beckham, Beckham was carded for his foul against Wolff in the 37th minute and Davies' penalty kick in the 91st. The goal received much national attention from the controversy surrounding the decision to award a penalty, and Davies' celebration for successfully converting the kick. Subsequent to the match, center referee Abiodun Okulaja ejected Galaxy midfielder Jovan Kirovski for cursing at him while sniping his decision.|$|E
25|$|Marie Carthy's <b>call</b> <b>came</b> in {{response}} to two developments: firstly, the Garda investigation announced {{on the evening of}} the shooting on 20 April 2000 and, secondly, and more importantly, the Gardaí revelation that they would not make this report public.

25|$|The {{first to}} arrive on the scene were nurses and doctors from nearby Bucur Maternity Hospital, who were on duty that Friday night. They heard the screams of the injured {{and went out to}} the street in robes and {{slippers}} to provide first aid. The first 112 <b>call</b> <b>came</b> at 10:32p.m., and the first emergency service arrived 11 minutes after the call.

Following the game, teammate Samari Rolle made accusations of disrespectful language by the official involved. In his final year with Baltimore, Scott again started all 16 games contributing with 104 tackles, 1.5 sacks and five passes defended.|$|E
25|$|This province, as a British colony, {{fought against}} the French during King George's War. The {{assembly}} was determined to control expenditures for this war and only weak support was given. When the <b>call</b> <b>came</b> for New York to help raise an expeditionary force against Louisburg, the New York assembly refused to raise troops and only appropriated a token three thousand pounds. The assembly was opposed to a significant war effort because it would interrupt trade with Quebec and would result in higher taxes. The French raid on Saratoga in 1745 destroyed that settlement, killing and capturing {{more than one hundred}} people. After this attack the assembly was more generous and raised 1,600 men and forty thousand pounds.|$|E
25|$|Statements {{described}} Murray {{as someone}} using a non-standard CPR technique on Jackson. During {{the tape of}} the emergency call, released on June 26 one day after Jackson's death, the doctor was described as administering CPR on a bed, not on a hard surface such as a floor, which would be standard practice. The doctor's attorney said that Murray placed one hand underneath Jackson and used the other hand for chest compression, where the standard practice is to use both hands for compression. A Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) spokesperson said the 911 <b>call</b> <b>came</b> in at 12:21:04p.m. PDT (19:21:04UTC). Paramedics reached Jackson at 12:26p.m. and found that he still was not breathing.|$|E

25|$|Mobbing {{calls are}} signals {{made by the}} mobbing species while harassing a predator. These differ from alarm calls, which allow con-specifics {{to escape from the}} predator. The great tit, a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when prey species are in flight, they employ an alarm signal in the 7–8kHz range. This call is less {{effective}} at traveling great distances, but is much more difficult for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which the <b>call</b> <b>came).</b> In the case of the alarm call, it could be disadvantageous to the sender if the predator picks up on the signal, hence selection has favored those birds able to hear and employ calls in this higher frequency range.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 20 March 1972, at 11.45 a.m., a local carpet dealer {{received}} {{a telephone call}} with a warning that a bomb would explode in Belfast city centre's Church Street which was crowded with shoppers, office workers on lunch breaks, and schoolchildren. British Army troops and the RUC were alerted and immediately began to evacuate the people into nearby Lower Donegall Street. The second call to the Irish News newspaper seven minutes later also gave Church Street as the location for the device. When a final <b>call</b> <b>came</b> at 11.55 advising the Unionist News Letter newspaper that the bomb was instead placed outside its offices in Lower Donegall Street to where the crowds were being sent, the warning arrived {{too late for the}} security forces to clear the street. The staff working inside the News Letter were told by the caller that they had 15 minutes in which to leave the building, but they {{never had a chance to}} evacuate.|$|E
25|$|Omar {{was born}} in Riyadh, growing up there in a working-class environment, to a family of Hadhrami descent from the Hadhramaut Governorate. His father Abdulrahman Ahmed was a former player, he the {{youngest}} of two sisters and three older brothers, Ahmad, Khaled and Mohammed. He began playing football {{at a very young}} age and was playing most of his time in Riyadh neighborhoods. He drew attention from scout Abdulrahman Eissa, who saw him by chance at Al Malaz yard near Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium and admired his talent and asked about the club that he played for. The answer was that he was not playing for any club and also did not hold Saudi nationality. After Abdulrahman Eissa began to contact him and his brother, he then began participating in tournaments and courses alongside Yahya Al-Shehri. In 2000, he went on a trial with Al Hilal who were very interested in signing him. However, as full Saudi nationality was only offered to him and not his entire family, his father rejected the offer. Then a <b>call</b> <b>came</b> to Abdulrahman Eissa's friend Ahmed Al Garoon from Honorary member of Al Ain, Nasser bin Thaloub who was searching for young talented players. Abdulrahman Eissa told him about Omar's talent and his brothers Mohammed and Khalid. He asked for their passports and they joined the external Al Ain camp in Germany. Al Ain agreed to grant citizenship to his whole family who then moved to the United Arab Emirates. Omar joined the club with two of his brothers and enrolled in the club's youth academy.|$|E

500|$|Sultan Iskandar's public call {{to support}} Abdullah Badawi's {{administration}} in October 2006 created a minor stir among Mahathir's supporters, when he remarked that [...] "Mahathir should {{act like a}} pensioner". The <b>call</b> <b>came</b> {{at a time when}} Mahathir's spate of criticisms against Abdullah's were at its most vociferous period. The Sultan was the first state ruler to publicly defend the policy of the government during the period of Mahathir's criticisms against the Abdullah administration. Earlier sources however, noted Sultan Iskandar's concerns with the deepening rift between Mahathir and Abdullah and had asked to be photographed together with the two leaders during the United Malays National Organisations (UMNO) 60th anniversary celebrations in Johor Bahru.|$|E
500|$|One log {{shows that}} Bamber rang Chelmsford police station—rather than the {{emergency}} number (999)—and spoke to PC Michael West {{in the information}} room. As a result West began an [...] "event log". This states that Bamber's <b>call</b> <b>came</b> in at 3.36am on 7 August 1985. The timing is important; Bamber maintains that he telephoned 10 minutes after his father phoned him. But at trial it was accepted that West had misread a digital clock, and that the call had probably come in just before 3:26am, because that was when West asked a civilian dispatcher, Malcolm Bonnett, to send a car to the scene. The car, Charlie Alpha 5, was dispatched at 3:35 am. The event log noted a call from: ...|$|E
50|$|About 70 {{percent of}} 9-1-1 <b>calls</b> <b>came</b> from cell phones in 2014, {{and finding out}} where the <b>calls</b> <b>came</b> from {{required}} triangulation. A USA Today study showed that where information was compiled on the subject, many of the calls from cell phones did not include information allowing the caller to be located. Chances of getting as close as 100 feet were higher in areas with more towers. But if a call was made from a large building, even {{that would not be}} enough to precisely locate the caller. New federal rules, which service providers helped with, require location information for 40 percent of calls by 2017 and 80 percent by 2021.|$|R
