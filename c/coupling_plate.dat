Built-up column steel structure also can be formed by various profile. However the column subjected to compression load will occur buckling which is related to element stiffness of structure. An element which has low stiffness is easier to buckle than element with high stiffness. The objective {{of this research is}} to characterize stiffness of built up column.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{presents}} research aims {{to improving}} the dynamic modelling of <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures across a wide frequency range by using analytical, statistical and experimental methods. The analytical waveguide method is used to model the flexural displacement of <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures which are simply supported along two parallel edges. A method of quickly predicting the average energy level in a plate from details of the waveguide model is described, and used for comparison with SEA models. The Poynting and Impedance methods of predicting the energy flow in <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures are investigated. Transmission coefficients for <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures are evaluated using the analytical waveguide method for both semi-infinite and finite <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures. Finite transmission coefficients have traditionally been more difficult to evaluate due {{to the presence of}} a reverberant field, but in this work a novel method of separating the reverberant field using a scattering matrix method is presented. The transmission coefficients for semi-infinite and finite structures are then compared for L-shaped plates. A modal transmission coefficient is also defined and for the cases considered, and is used to develop an alternative method of deriving the transmission coefficient in a finite structure. Frequency averaged transmission coefficients are also considered, and the transmission coefficients derived for finite and semi-infinite structures are found to be very similar after frequency averaging. Statistical Energy Analysis models of <b>coupled</b> <b>plates</b> are evaluated using transmission coefficients derived from waveguide models. The results of the SEA models are compared to those predicted by the analytical waveguide method. A modal transmission coefficient based SEA model is also investigated. In an attempt to validate the numerical work presented in this thesis, experiments have been conducted.

40|$|AbstractIsolated {{reception}} plates {{provide an}} engineering approach {{to quantify the}} structure-borne sound power input from machinery through the measurement of the spatial-average velocity level and structural reverberation times. For applications in building acoustics there are practical and economic reasons to consider using <b>coupled</b> reception <b>plates</b> formed by solid heavyweight walls or floors that are structurally coupled to other building elements. This paper uses transient and steady-state statistical energy analysis to investigate how the errors depend upon the building structure to which the <b>coupled</b> reception <b>plate</b> is connected. It is shown {{that the problem is}} twofold. Firstly, in the low- and mid-frequency ranges, the steady-state velocity level on the <b>coupled</b> reception <b>plate</b> is increased by energy returning from other <b>coupled</b> <b>plates.</b> Secondly, the structural decays on the <b>coupled</b> reception <b>plate</b> have significant curvature due to returning energy; hence short evaluation ranges are needed to minimise the error when determining the total loss factor. This leads to a problematic situation where the <b>coupled</b> reception <b>plate</b> appears to give the correct answer due to the error in the energy cancelling out the error in the total loss factor. The latter error can be minimised using short evaluation ranges for the structural reverberation time...|$|R
40|$|Prediction of {{bending wave}} {{transmission}} across systems of <b>coupled</b> <b>plates</b> which incorporate periodic ribbed plates is considered using Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) in the low- and mid-frequency ranges and Advanced SEA (ASEA) in the high-frequency range. This paper investigates the crossover from prediction with SEA to ASEA through comparison with Finite Element Methods. Results from L-junctions confirm that this crossover occurs near the frequency band containing the fundamental bending mode {{of the individual}} bays on the ribbed plate when ribs are parallel to the junction line. Below this frequency band, SEA models treating each periodic ribbed plate as a single subsystem were shown to be appropriate. Above this frequency band, large reductions occur in the vibration level when propagation takes place across successive bays on ribbed plates when the ribs are parallel to the junction. This is due to spatial filtering; hence {{it is necessary to}} use ASEA which can incorporate indirect coupling associated with this transmission mechanism. A system of three <b>coupled</b> <b>plates</b> was also modelled which introduced flanking transmission. The results show that a wide frequency range can be covered by using both SEA and ASEA for systems of <b>coupled</b> <b>plates</b> where {{some or all of the}} plates are periodic ribbed plates...|$|R

40|$|This PhD thesis {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental investigation using active control to attenuate the vibration responses associated with <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures. Three plate structures were examined, which corresponded to an L, T and X shaped plate. The plate theory {{used to determine}} the dynamic and controlled responses of the <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures is presented for a generic structure consisting of four finite plates joined together at right angles in a X-shape. The theory for active vibration control of the <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> using single and multiple control actuators and error sensors is also presented for both dependent and independent control. The use of multiple actuators and error sensors in various arrangements to attenuate the response of various <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures is demonstrated. The number and location of the control forces and error sensors are varied, and their effects on the control performance are compared. In addition, the effect of the control forces driven dependently and independently was investigated. For active control at discrete resonance frequencies, the global response of the structure was observed. Experiments were conducted in order to validate theoretical results on the active control of the global response at a low resonance frequency. The results showed excellent correlation, validating the effectiveness of the active control application. An energy method to predict the vibrational response and its transmission between coupled structures in the medium to high frequency ranges is Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). In this thesis, SEA is used to model several built-up structures and estimate their vibrational response using energy flow relationships. Energy levels of the L, T, X-shaped plates, and a 7 -plate structure, predicted from the exact analytical waveguide model are compared with those of conventional SEA models. A hybrid approach between the two techniques is also presented. The hybrid method uses the analytical waveguide method to estimate the input power and coupling loss factors used in the conventional SEA equations. The energy levels in individual plate subsystems using the exact analytical method, SEA, and the hybrid technique are compared...|$|R

SAMPLE 20 femurs from cadavers of 10 mixed-breed adult dogs. PROCEDURES 1 femur from each cadaver was stabilized with a conical <b>coupling</b> <b>plating</b> system-rod construct, and the contralateral femur was stabilized with a locking compression plate (LCP) -rod construct. An intramedullary Steinmann pin was inserted in each femur. A 40 -mm gap then was created; the gap was centered beneath the central portion of each plate. Cyclic axial loading with increasing loads was performed. Specimens that did not fail during cyclic loading were subjected to an acute load to failure. RESULTS During cyclic loading, significantly more LCP constructs failed (6 / 10), compared {{with the number of}} conical <b>coupling</b> <b>plating</b> system constructs that failed (1 / 10). Mode of failure of the constructs included fracture of the medial or caudal aspect of the cortex of the proximal segment with bending of the plate and pin, bending of the plate and pin without fracture, and screw pullout. Mean stiffness, yield load, and load to failure were not significantly different between the 2 methods of stabilization.

40|$|The {{ability to}} predict the effect of {{dimension}} and thickness variability on the dynamic response of realistically uncertain engineering structures is examined in this thesis. Initially, available methods for predicting key response statistics and probabilities, for both low and high frequencies are examined to establish their strengths and limitations for specified levels of random dimension variability. For low frequency applications, the ability of Direct Integration (DI) and the First-Order Reliability Method (FORM) to predict exceedance probability is examined. For high frequency applications, {{the ability of the}} methods of Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) and DI {{to predict the}} mean and standard deviation of the energy response is examined. The use of Extreme Value (EV) theory is included as a way to bound responses using simulated or measured responses. The strengths and limitations of Monte Carlo simulation methods are explored for both low and high frequency responses of randomly uncertain structures using both simple mode superposition plate-structure solutions and (commercially available) finite element solutions for <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures. To address, without the need to undertake expensive Monte Carlo simulation, the problem of predicting response bounds for structures with varying levels of uncertainty, a novel DI-EV method is developed and examined. It is tested first on a simple plate structure, then on a <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structure, with low-level and high-level random dimension and thickness uncertainty. In addition, the method is compared with the SEA-EV method. The thesis shows that the results from the existing SEA-EV bounding approach gives good bounds only at particular frequencies and mainly for low levels of dimension variability. In contrast, the proposed DI-EV bounding approach compare extremely well with Monte Carlo simulations, which is not only at all frequencies but also with both low-level and high-level uncertainties, for simple and <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> structures with dimension and thickness variation...|$|R

The <b>coupled</b> <b>plates</b> are simply supported along two parallel sides, and free at the other two ends. Point forces are used to generate the primary and secondary excitation of the plates. The flexural wave coefficients are determined from the boundary conditions, continuity equations at the driving force locations, and continuity equations at the corner junction of the two plates. Bending, shearing, and longitudinal effects are taken into consideration at the corner junction. Under broadband frequency control at a discrete location in plate 2, both the control shaker and the error sensor are optimally located to achieve the best control performance. Results show that when the control force and error sensor are arbitrarily located, the control performance {{is dependent on the}} excitation frequency. When both the control force and error sensor are optimally located with respect to the primary shaker location in a symmetrical arrangement, the control performance is both maximized and independent of the excitation frequency. Using single-frequency control to attenuate the total vibrational response of the <b>coupled</b> <b>plates,</b> the error sensor location is strongly mode dependent.

Using the generalized expressions, both point and distributed mechanical loads on {{one or both of}} the plates can be considered. The generalized approach is extended to deal with acoustic excitation of one of the plate substructures. In this case, the forces (acoustic pressures) acting on the structure are dependent on the response of the structure because of the scattered pressure component. The interaction between the plate structure and the acoustic fluid leads to the derivation of a corrected mode shape for the plates' normal surface velocity and also for the structure mobility functions. The determination of the scattered pressure components in the expressions for the power flow represents an additional component in the power flow balance for the source plate and the receiver plate. This component represents the radiated acoustical power from the plate structure. For a number of <b>coupled</b> <b>plate</b> substrates, the acoustic pressure generated by one substructure will interact with the motion of another substructure.
