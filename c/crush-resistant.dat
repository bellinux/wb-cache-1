50|$|Freshwater snails (Physa virgata), {{provide an}} example of when {{phenotypic}} plasticity can be either adaptive or maladaptive. In {{the presence of a}} predator, bluegill sunfish, these snails make their shell shape more rotund and reduce growth. This makes them more <b>crush-resistant</b> and better protected from predation. However, these snails cannot tell the difference in chemical cues between the predatory and non-predatory sunfish. Thus, the snails respond inappropriately to non-predatory sunfish by producing an altered shell shape and reducing growth. These changes, {{in the absence of a}} predator, make the snails susceptible to other predators and limit fecundity. Therefore, these freshwater snails produce either an adaptive or maladaptive response to the environmental cue depending on whether the predatory sunfish is actually present.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the bioequivalence of oxymorphone extended-release (Oxy-ER) and a <b>crush-resistant</b> {{formulation of}} oxymorphone extended-release (Oxy-CRF). Methods: In three open-label, randomized studies, healthy adults at a clinical research center received two single oral doses of Oxy-ER and two single doses of Oxy-CRF, each separated by a &ge; 7 -day washout. Doses were administered under fasted conditions (study 1, 5 mg doses; study 2, 40 mg doses) or after a high-fat breakfast (study 3, 40 mg doses). Subjects administered 40 mg doses also received naltrexone. The primary endpoint was systemic oxymorphone exposure; the bioequivalence criterion was met if the 90 % confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratio (Oxy-CRF/Oxy-ER) for oxymorphone area under the curve from time 0 to the last measured concentration (AUC 0 &ndash;t), AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0 &ndash;inf), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) were within 0. 8 &ndash; 1. 25. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events. Results: In studies 1, 2, and 3, the safety population comprised 30, 37, and 36 subjects and the pharmacokinetics population comprised 27, 30, and 29 subjects, respectively. Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF produced similar mean &plusmn; standard deviation oxymorphone AUC 0 &ndash;t (study 1, 5. 05 &plusmn; 1. 55 versus 5. 29 &plusmn; 1. 52 ng&nbsp;&middot; h/mL; study 2, 31. 51 &plusmn; 10. 95 versus 31. 23 &plusmn; 10. 33 ng&nbsp;&middot; h/mL; study 3, 50. 16 &plusmn; 14. 91 versus 49. 01 &plusmn; 14. 03 ng&nbsp;&middot; h/mL) and Cmax (0. 38 &plusmn; 0. 11 versus 0. 37 &plusmn; 0. 12 ng/mL; 2. 37 &plusmn; 1. 20 versus 2. 41 &plusmn; 0. 94 ng/mL; 5. 87 &plusmn; 1. 99 versus 5. 63 &plusmn; 2. 26 ng/mL) under all conditions. The 90 % confidence intervals for plasma oxymorphone AUC 0 &ndash;t, AUC 0 &ndash;inf, and Cmax fulfilled the bioequivalence criterion. Adverse event rates were similar with Oxy-ER and Oxy-CRF (study 1, 25 % versus 23 %; study 2, 9 % versus 16 %; study 3, 20 % each group). Conclusion: Oxy-CRF and Oxy-ER (5 mg and 40 mg) are bioequivalent under fasted and fed conditions, suggesting that Oxy-CRF will have clinical efficacy and safety equivalent to Oxy-ER.

40|$|Objective. The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} 1) to develop standard testing practices to be used when evaluating crush resistance properties of abuse deterrent formulations, and 2) to determine which methods of particle size reduction (manual or electrical) are the most discriminatory for measuring crush resistance of tablet dosage forms. Background. Crushing, or particle size reduction, is often the first step to make a medication easier to snort, to dissolve for injection, or to destroy slowrelease mechanisms in order to achieve greater euphoric effects. However, no standard methods exist on testing crush resistant properties of prescription medications susceptible to abuse. Such testing is crucial for comparative purposes and to obtain abuse-deterrent labelling for the newly-marketed abuse-deterrent products. Methods. Tablets containing poly(ethylene oxide) as a deterrent agent and acetaminophen as model drug were formulated on tablet press (2000 pounds) before undergoing a post compaction thermal process reported for a <b>crush-resistant</b> marketed formulation. Crush resistance was then assessed using manual (i. e., pill crusher, pestle-mortar) and mechanical (i. e., hardness tester, ball mill, high shear grinder, domestic blender) methods at different time durations and sample mass. The resultant product was then analyzed by sieve analysis. Results. Significant differences were observed between the particle size distributions using different methods. The domestic blender and high shear grinder had better ability to differentiate products compared to other tooling. Conclusion. There is no universal method to measure crush resistance, and methods used to perform particle size reduction can display different level of resistance to manipulation Grants.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{lightweight}} crush resistant structures has inspired researchers to conduct both experimental and numerical studies on axial crush characteristics of aluminium tubes {{as well as}} polymer matrix composite tubes. Recent experimental {{studies have shown that}} hybrid tubes containing a composite overwrap over an aluminium tube have higher energy absorption than either aluminium or composite tubes. However, the published research on hybrid tubes was limited in scope and the beneficial effect of combining composite and aluminium has not been fully investigated. The objective of this research was to conduct a systematic numerical study on the axial crush characteristics of both square aluminium and square aluminium-composite hybrid tubes over a wide range of design parameters, such as triggering mechanism, aluminium tube thickness, overwrap thickness and fiber orientation angle in the overwrap. The numerical models were developed using LS-DYNA and validated using the experimental data available on aluminium and aluminium-composite hybrid tubes. The parametric study involved both aluminium and aluminium-composite hybrid tubes. It was shown that the transition from symmetric to asymmetric folding pattern occurred at lower aluminium tube thickness when a composite overwrap was used on the aluminium tube. For the aluminium-composite hybrid tubes, the folding initiation force, mean crush force and energy absorbed of the hybrid tubes were significantly higher than those of the aluminium tubes. These three crush resistance parameters depended on overwrap thickness as well as fiber orientation angle. As the fiber orientation angle increased toward the loading path, the mean crush force decreased linearly. The contribution of this research is {{in the development of a}} numerical technique for modeling quasi-static crushing aluminium-composite hybrid tubes. In addition, parametric studies were conducted using the aforementioned design parameters. Empirical equations were developed to predict the mean crush force of aluminium-composite hybrid tubes, which would be beneficial in designing <b>crush-resistant</b> structural members.
