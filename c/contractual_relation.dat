50|$|A key {{concept of}} Rational Choice Institutionalism is the principal-agent model {{borrowed}} from Neo-classical economics. The concept {{assumes that the}} principal enters into a <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> with a second party, the agent, and delegates responsibility to the latter to fulfil certain responsibilities or a set of tasks {{on behalf of the}} principal. Problems occur due to an asymmetric distribution of information which favours the agent. The latter enables the agent to pursue its own interest and engage in opportunistic behaviour - shirking - at the cost of the principal’s interest. The principal’s problem is how to control and limit shirking by the agent.|$|E

40|$|Several {{national}} health systems in Latin America embarked on health reforms to tackle widespread criticisms for low equity and efficiency. These reforms have included contracting by public purchasing agencies of external providers. This paper seeks to propose an analytical framework to support {{decision making and}} orient future search for evidences. It was built upon a literature review and four illustrations from Costa Rica Guatemala, Nicaragua and Salvador which focus on primary care providers. A preliminary literature review helped in proposing an initial framework with basic dimensions. Thereafter, we used four illustrations of <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> between public purchasers and external primary care providers in Central America to further develop the framework. Two types of themes emerged.

30|$|In an {{ordinary}} <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> diverse contingencies {{may lead to}} disputes between the contractual partners that may be best solved by an arbitrator or {{an ordinary}} court. For those contractual disputes it is pivotal that they typically occur infrequently and that they usually terminate the <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> by sorting out the invested assets and accrued profits. That is different with regard to meta-organizations where a whole network of contracts is established {{and the purpose of}} the meta-organization is specified in less detail than in an ordinary business contract. Insofar as meta-organizations are more similar to a company where the business strategy, product portfolio etc. are also not specified in the corporate contract itself, but the business strategy {{is the result of the}} whole business activity over time. But apparently a meta-organization is also not a regular company with a clearly defined hierarchy, because it has no board that holds the whole bundle of residual property rights and can take decisions independently. Hence the coordination of assets remains the weak spot of meta-organizations.|$|E

40|$|Several {{national}} health systems in Latin America initiated health reforms to counter widespread criticisms of low equity and efficiency. For public purchasing agencies, these reforms often consisted in contracting external providers for primary care provision. This paper intends to clarify both {{the complex and}} intertwined issues characterizing such contracting as well as health system performances {{within the context of}} four Central American countries. It results from a European Commission financed project lead between 2002 and 2005, involving participants from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Salvador, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Belgium, whose aim was to promote exchanges between these participants. The findings presented in this paper are the results of a two stage process: (a) the design of an initial analytical framework, built upon findings from the literature, interlinking characteristics of <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> with health systems performances criteria and (b) the use of that framework in four case studies to identify cross-cutting issues. This paper reinforces two pivotal findings: (a) contracting requires not only technical, but also political choices and (b) it cannot be considered as a mechanical process. The unpredictability of its evolution requires a flexible and reactive approach. This should be better assimilated by national and international organizations involved in health services provision, so as to progressively come out of dogmatic approaches in deciding to initiate <b>contractual</b> <b>relation</b> with external providers for primary care provision. ...|$|E
