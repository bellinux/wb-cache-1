40|$|CO 2 {{gasification}} {{of petroleum}} coke using black liquor {{as a catalyst}} was performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) under temperatures 1223 - 1673 Â K at ambient pressure to evaluate the effect of black liquor loading on petroleum coke gasification. It {{was found that the}} gasification reactivity of petroleum coke was improved greatly by black liquor. The gasification reactivity was affected by different loading methods in the order: wet grindingÂ >Â dry grindingÂ >Â physical impregnationÂ >Â dry mix. The catalytic activity of black liquor was higher than that of pure alkali metal. The effect of temperature on the gasification reactivity of petroleum coke was changed by black liquor. The reactivity reaches its maximum at 1573 Â K. The reactivity of petroleum coke was found higher than that of Shenfu coal when black liquor loading is 5 Â wt. % (of petroleum coke), clearly demonstrating that black liquor could be an effective catalyst for petroleum coke gasification.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to analyze color {{stability}} of monocrystalline and polycrystalline ceramic brackets after immersion in dye solutions. METHODS: Seven ceramic brackets of four commercial brands were tested: Two monocrystalline and two polycrystalline. The brackets were immersed in four dye solutions (coffee, red wine, <b>Coke</b> and <b>black</b> tea) and in artificial saliva for the following times: 24 hours, 7, 14 and 21 days, respectively. Color changes were measured by a spectrophotometer. Data were assessed by Multivariate Profile Analysis, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Multiple Comparison Tests of means. RESULTS: There was a perceptible change of color in all ceramic brackets immersed in coffee (&# 916;E* Allure = 7. 61, Inspire Ice = 6. 09, Radiance = 6. 69, Transcend = 7. 44), black tea (&# 916;E* Allure = 6. 24, Inspire Ice = 5. 21, Radiance = 6. 51, Transcend = 6. 14) and red wine (&# 916;E* Allure = 6. 49, Inspire Ice = 4. 76, Radiance = 5. 19, Transcend = 5. 64), but no change was noticed in Coke and artificial saliva (&# 916;E < 3. 7). CONCLUSION: Ceramic brackets undergo color change when exposed to solutions of coffee, black tea and red wine. However, the same crystalline structure, either monocrystalline or polycrystalline, do not follow the same or a similar pattern in color change, varying according to the bracket fabrication, which shows a lack of standardization in the manufacturing process. Coffee dye produced the most marked color changes after 21 days of immersion for most ceramic brackets evaluated...|$|R

In Czech republic coal is except else widely used as a fuel for combustion in a small boilers (up to 50 kW). Low efficiency of the small boilers which is often below 50 % together with high emissions of the harmful substances into near surroundings cause in average 40  70 % of total local air pollution. The research was performed in a scope of the Grant no. 101 / 98 / 0820 of Grant Agency of Czech Republic was focused on quality of combustion process related to combustion efficiency and creation of harmful substances at combustion of domestic fuels. Experiments were performed to compare combustion of brown coal, clack coal, <b>coke</b> and <b>black</b> coal slurry. Extremely high creation of harmful substances (CO, NOX, solid particles and organic substances) was measured when the black coal slurry was used as a fuel, measured in kg of emissions per GJ of burned fuel. Combustion of brown coal produced significant emissions of solid particles which bond harmful substances as metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and others) together with high emissions of SO 2. Strong dependence between emissions of CO and low quality of combustion given by low combustion temperature, shortage of combustion air, not suitable design of after-combustion chamber and short duration of fuel presence in a combustion area was found out. Emissions of wide range of metals were investigated.

The completion time of petroleum coke steam gasification at 900 degrees C decreased from 120 min for pure coke to about 40 min for the coke blended with 10 wt. % BL The corresponding hydrogen fraction in the produced syngas increased by 9 vol. %. The gasification reaction was further enhanced by introducing {{a small amount of}} oxygen into the steam. The shrinking core model (SCM) and homogenous model (HM) were used to calculate the kinetics of petroleum coke gasification, finding that SCM enabled the better correlation with experimental data than HM did. Using SCM the activation energy was 77 kJ. mol(- 1) for coke gasification with 10 wt. % BL as catalyst, which was much lower than 120 kJ. mol(- 1) for the case without BL blended. The activation energy was further reduced to about 63 kJ-mol(- 1) by adding 5 % oxygen into the steam, showing a synergistic effects of BL and O- 2 on petroleum coke gasification. The study also justified the feasibility of syngas production from petroleum coke via fluidized bed gasification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} is {{an ideal}} non-destructive technique for the characterization {{of a variety of}} carbonaceous materials because it is sensitive to crystalline and amorphous structures, allowing the study of highly disordered materials, such as carbon-based pigments [9, 10]. The Raman spectrum of crystalline graphite consists of a narrow band at 1, 580  cm− 1 known as G band (‘graphite’) while disordered or microcrystalline graphite presents an additional band around 1, 350  cm− 1 known as D band, often called the ‘disorder’ band. Raman spectra of amorphous carbons are characterized by broad bands around 1, 550 and 1, 350  cm− 1 and several spectral parameters of these bands such as their positions, relative intensities, and band widths provide structural information and have helped to discriminate between samples from different origins [9 – 11]. Recently, we have studied by Raman microscopy seven carbon-based pigments used in art and as references for archaeometric studies, together with a sample of commercial vegetable charcoal, in order to find relevant parameters to distinguish between the pigments [12]. These references had been selected from ten carbon-based pigments previously studied in detail by a combination of FTIR-ATR, SEM–EDS microscopy and XRD to determine their structures and compositions [13]. The selected pigments comprised graphite (crystalline carbon), lampblack and bistre (flame carbons), bitumen and ivory <b>black</b> (<b>cokes),</b> commercial wood charcoal (char), and Vandyke brown and Cassel earth (black earths). Reference carbon-based pigments from different sources showed similar Raman spectra with characteristic G and D bands in the range 1, 350 – 1, 600  cm− 1 that differed clearly in position, width and relative intensity. The combined analysis of the spectral parameters showed that Raman microscopy allowed the discrimination of most of the reference pigments as well as the identification of carbon-based black pigments in two South American colonial paintings dated from the early 18 th century [13].|$|R

40|$|Restricted until 06 Aug. 2011. Diseases like Retinitis Pigmentosa and Age-related Macular Degeneration {{result in}} a gradual and {{progressive}} loss of photoreceptors leading to blindness. A retinal prosthesis device imparts partial and artificial vision to patients in the central 15 - 20 degrees of the visual field by electrically activating the remaining healthy cells of the retina using electrical currents and an electrode array. Many visual aids available commercially aid blind patients with their day to day activities and navigation tasks. Most of these technologies have equipment or infrastructure overhead and are designed for indoor or outdoor use. The retinal prosthesis system design consists of an image processing module that can be utilized to process camera images in indoor and outdoor environments using algorithms {{to provide information about}} the surroundings and aid patients in their daily activities. This thesis presents work towards developing, validating and testing image processing algorithms for a retinal prosthesis system {{that could be used to}} aid retinal prosthesis recipients in navigation and search tasks.; A computationally efficient implementation of a saliency detection algorithm is presented. This is a bottom-up algorithm that can be used to detect the presence of objects in the peripheral visual field of the patients and direct the attention of the patients towards these objects using cues. Implementing the algorithm on the TMS 320 DM 642 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) shows that the execution rate is approximately 10 times faster than an earlier visual attention model. To validate the algorithm outputs, for a set of images, the areas computed as salient by the algorithm are compared to areas gazed at by human observers. The results show that the algorithm predicts regions of interest better than chance. To optimize algorithm performance in scenarios when patients are searching for an object of interest, the bottom-up model is also integrated with a top-down information module. The integrated algorithm uses the information about the features of objects of interest also, and enhances the computed salience maps to give greater weights to the objects of interest. Testing the integrated algorithm with everyday objects like a red colored <b>coke</b> can and <b>black</b> cell phone show that the integrated model indeed detects the objects of interest sooner than the bottom-up only model.; To test the anticipated benefits that could be offered by a saliency based image processing algorithm to retinal prosthesis recipients in navigation and search tasks, simulated vision experiments with normal sighted volunteers were conducted. The subjects were provided with 6 x 10 pixels vision in the central 15 degrees of their visual field and their performance measured when they performed navigation and search tasks. Results show that for all tasks, the cumulative head movements and the errors of the subjects using help from the saliency algorithm are significantly lower when compared to subjects using natural head scanning. Time was significantly lower for the cueing group subjects only for search tasks. The greatest improvement in the performance of the cueing group over the no cueing group was observed in the initial trials in new environments, which implies that such a system may benefit the patients most in new and unfamiliar surroundings. A cueing system may provide additional confidence to the patients in their day to day activities.; This thesis discusses the computational limitations for possible image processing algorithms to be used for a retinal prosthesis system. Generic as well as customized versions of the saliency based image processing are discussed for use by the subjects according to the relevant tasks at hand. The experiments discussed in this thesis are one of the first to explore the advantages of having additional help from image processing algorithms for retinal prosthesis implant recipients and give insights into ways in which additional information through such algorithms might benefit users of the system...|$|R
