Students’ Ability in Mastering The Vocabulary of <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> Network of The Eleventh Grade of <b>Computer</b> Technique <b>and</b> Program at SMKN 2 Banjarmasin on The Academic Year 2013 / 2014. Thesis, English Education Department, Tarbiyah and Teachers Training Faculty. Advisors : Rusnadi, S. Pd. I, M. Pd. I, M. A Keywords: ability, mastery, {{vocabulary}} for <b>computer</b> <b>and</b> network, <b>computer</b> technique <b>and</b> network program. <b>Computer</b> has a {{very important}} role. With computer everything becomes easy to do, but the user found most problems about opperating the computer system, which computer is English language which have different meaning with English language they had learned as single subject in their school. Therefore the students get some difficulty, because the different meaning both of them. Therefore to help us to opperate the computer well we must know some vocabulary of <b>computer</b> <b>and</b> network. The problem formulations of this research are: How {{the ability of the}} eleventh grade of <b>Computer</b> Technique <b>and</b> Network Program of SMKN 2 Banjarmasin in mastering the vocabulary of <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> Network is and What factors that influence the ability of the students in mastering the vocabulary of <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> Network of the Eleventh grade of <b>Computer</b> Technique <b>and</b> Network program at SMKN 2 Banjarmasin. The population of this research is 81 Students and the sample is 45 students was gotten from Slovin formula by proportional random sampling method. While the object of this research is students’ ability in astering the vocabulary for <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> Network and the factors that influence students’ ability in mastering the vocabulary of <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> Network. To collect the data, the writer uses some techniques such as observation, Questionnaire, test (written test), documentary, and interview. Data processing in this study is divided into three phases: editing, scoring, coding, tabulating, and interpreting. Then, all the data are analyzed descriptively, quantitatively and concluded inductively. The result of this research states that the students’ ability in mastering The vocabulary of <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> Network is good category. It is based on the mean score of the students that is 71. 78. Students’ interest, students’ motivation, learning facility, learning styles, and learning strategies are the strong factors that influence students ability in mastering the vocabulary for <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> Network in high categorized but First language acquisition, and teacher competence are not influence students ability in mastering the vocabulary for <b>Computer</b> <b>and</b> Network...|$|R
