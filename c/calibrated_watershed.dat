40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to relate the chloride concentration of highway runoff through specific conductivity measurements and to characterize the role that the pavement surface texture has in the dissolution kinetics of the chloride residing in this layer. The quantity of deicing agents applied throughout the winter season is correlated to the concentration of chloride in highway runoff and linked to the length of time since application. A unit hydrograph was developed from precipitation measurements and the resulting hydraulic parameters were calibrated for use in a specific conductivity flux model. From this model a pollutograph was developed characterizing a specific conductivity flux source term and a first flush value. These two terms are optimized to characterize the dissolution kinetics and predict chloride runoff concentrations. The runoff decay constants optimized for all three sites reduced to very similar averages of 3. 02 x 10 - 4, 4. 21 x 10 - 4, and 3. 6 x 10 - 4 s- 1 respectively for Andover, Cohasset and Plymouth from ranges of three orders of magnitude for each site between individual events over the five year period. The depression storage layers were 0. 9, 1. 3, and 3. 0 mm respectively for Andover, Cohasset and Plymouth indicating a connection between pavement age and texture as Andover is the new of all pavements. Along with the similar calibrated hydraulic parameters, the three sites had very similar optimized chloride source parameters of 5. 64 x 10 - 4, 1. 30 x 10 - 4, and 2. 16 x 10 - 4 mg/m 2 -s for Andover, Cohasset and Plymouth respectively. The 177 storms modeled between all three sites had source terms ranging from 10 - 3 to 10 - 8 and averaged to the above optimized values. A clear indication the lumped parameter linear reservoir approach is applicable to storage facilities and active highway routes. This research provides support understanding the role impervious surface texture has in the chloride dissolution kinetics controlling stormwater runoff quality. A common model {{has been shown to be}} able to characterize stormwater runoff hydraulics and chloride flux from both salt storage facilities and heavily traveled highway lanes. Seasonal stormwater quality trends as well as event first flush concentrations have been identified and characterized with <b>calibrated</b> <b>watershed</b> parameters. Automated samplers coupled with continuous monitoring equipment have shown per storm or seasonal correlation between pavement texture, meteorological data, distributed deicing agent data, and water quality information at different Eastern Massachusetts locations...|$|E
40|$|Quantification of {{the various}} {{components}} of hydrological processes in a watershed remains a challenging topic as the hydrological system is altered by internal and external drivers. This study investigates hydrological behavior of the Upper Tiber River Basin (UTRB) in central Italy under climate change scenarios. It addresses {{the response of the}} watershed by evaluating the relative changes in magnitudes of various hydrological processes using downscaled climate data in a watershed model. The observed data from regional concerned offices of the basin and the readily available global and regional climate model data were collected for analysis. First, the reliability of the precipitation and temperature data through two statistical downscaling methods are evaluated. The Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) and the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARSWG) are used to downscale the HadCM 3 GCM predictions of the A 2 and B 2 scenarios for the Chiascio sub-basin in the UTRB. The results show that the downscaling methods used have different performance to reproduce the precipitation patter but they agree on both minimum and maximum temperature. However it is difficult to choose which method is of downscaling as both have their own limitations and associated uncertainties Second, a physically-based watershed simulation model called Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to understand the hydrologic behavior of the basin. The model is successfully calibrated for the period of 1963 - 1970 and validated for the period of 1971 - 1978 using observed weather and flow data. A total of eighteen hydrologic parameters are evaluated and the model showed high relative sensitivity to groundwater flow driven parameters than the surface flow driven parameters. The objective function for model evaluation statistics showed coefficient of determination (R 2) from 0. 68 to 0. 81 and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (ENS) between 0. 51 and 0. 8 for the validation period. Based on the calibrated parameters the model is proved to be capable of predicting impact of climate changes in water resources planning and management. Third, the <b>calibrated</b> <b>watershed</b> model is used to evaluate the response of the basin under different climate change scenarios. Bias correction to three regional climate model (RCM) from the PRUDENCE including RegCM, RCAO, and PROMES outputs are applied. The current (1961 - 1990) and future (2071 - 2100) time periods were considered for the analysis. The result indicated that there will be significant decrease in the hydrologic components and water yields of the basin which resembles some previous findings in the basin. The result of the present study is different from the others in that most of them used indices based on observation. However, future work on the uncertainty issues related to projected climate variables is highly recommended. Despite some common limitations, this study is relevant to assist the development of climate change adaptation in the study...|$|E
40|$|The complex {{interaction}} between flow, vegetation and sediment drives the never settled changes of riverine system. Vegetation intercepts rainfall, adds resistance to surface flow, and facilitates infiltration. The magnitude {{and timing of}} flood flow {{are closely related to}} the watershed vegetation coverage. In the meantime, flood flow can transport a large amount of sediment resulting in bank erosion, channel degradation, and channel pattern change. As climate changes, future flood frequency will change with more intense rainfalls. However, the quantitative simulation of flood flow in vegetated channel and the influence of climate change on flood frequency, especially for the arid and semi-arid Southwest, remain challenges to engineers and scientists. Therefore, this research consists of two main parts: simulate unsteady flow and sediment transport in vegetated channel network, and quantify the impacts of climate change on flood frequency. A one-dimensional model for simulating flood routing and sediment transport over mobile alluvium in a vegetated channel network was developed. The modified St. Venant equations together with the governing equations for suspended sediment and bed load transport were solved simultaneously to obtain flow properties and sediment transport rate. The Godunov-type finite volume method is employed to discretize the governing equations. Then, the Exner equation was solved for bed elevation change. Since sediment transport is non-equilibrium when bed is degrading or aggrading, a recovery coefficient for suspended sediment and an adaptation length for bed load transport were used to quantify the differences between equilibrium and non-equilibrium sediment transport rate. The influence of vegetation on floodplain and main channel was accounted for by adjusting resistance terms in the momentum equations for flow field. A procedure to separate the grain resistance from the total resistance was proposed and implemented to calculate sediment transport rate. The model was tested by a flume experiment case and an unprecedented flood event occurred in the Santa Cruz River, Tucson, Arizona, in July 2006. Simulated results of flow discharge and bed elevation changes showed satisfactory agreements with the measurements. The impacts of vegetation density on sediment transport and significance of non-equilibrium sediment transport model were accounted for by the model. The two-dimensional surface flow model, called CHRE 2 D, was improved by considering the vegetation influence and then applied to Santa Cruz River Watershed (SCRW) in the Southern Arizona. The parameters in the CHRE 2 D model were calibrated by using the rainfall event in July 15 th, 1999. Hourly precipitation data from a Regional Climate Model (RCM) called Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), for three periods, 1990 - 2000, 2031 - 2040 and 2071 - 2079, were used to quantify the impact of climate change on the magnitude and frequency of flood for the Santa Cruz River Watershed (SCRW) in the Southern Arizona. Precipitation outputs from RCM-WRF model were bias-corrected using observed gridded precipitation data for three periods before directly used in the watershed model. The watershed model was calibrated using the rainfall event in July 15 th, 1999. The <b>calibrated</b> <b>watershed</b> model was applied to SCRW to simulate surface flow routing for the selected three periods. Simulated annual and daily maximum discharges are analyzed to obtain future flood frequency curves. Results indicate that flood discharges for different return periods are increased: the discharges of 100 -year and 200 -year return period are increased by 3, 000 and 5, 000 cfs, respectively...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Hydrologic/water–quality models {{often need}} {{calibration}} to minimize differences between observed and predicted watershed responses. Often the measured {{data from the}} watershed where the models are applied are not available. Under this condition, models are calibrated using data from a different watershed having similar land use, soil, and hydrologic conditions. However, if the watershed used for model calibration {{is not the same}} as the watershed where the model is applied for hydrologic/water–quality predictions, then differences in watershed characteristics may induce errors in model output. The objective of this study was to quantify the error in model predictions when the modeled watershed is not the <b>calibrating</b> <b>watershed.</b> The Agricultural Non–Point Source (AGNPS) model was used to quantify model errors using measured data from watersheds of varying sizes within the Little Washita Basin in Oklahoma. The study indicates that error in model outputs results when a watershed different than the one of interest is used for model calibration. A significant difference in prediction error was observed between scaling–up and scaling–down conditions with mean relative error of runoff prediction being 153 % for the scaling–down condition and 69 % for the scaling–up condition. However, relative error of prediction showed no particular trend with the scaling ratios. A watershed having significantly higher or lower average curve number and slope condition was not a candidate <b>watershed</b> for <b>calibrating</b> the AGNPS model...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{development}} of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) requires evaluating existing constituent loads in streams. Accurate estimates of constituent loads {{are needed to}} <b>calibrate</b> <b>watershed</b> and reservoir models for TMDL development. The best approach to estimate constituent loads is high frequency sampling, particularly during storm events, and mass integration of constituents passing a point in a stream. Most often, resources are limited and discrete water quality samples are collected on fixed intervals and sometimes supplemented with directed sampling during storm events. When resources are limited, mass integration is not an accurate means to determine constituent loads and other load estimation techniques such as regression models are used. The objective of this work was to determine a minimum number of water–quality samples needed to provide constituent concentration data adequate to estimate constituent loads at a large stream. Twenty sets of water quality samples with and without supplemental storm samples were randomly selected at various fixed intervals from a database at the Illinois River, northwest Arkansas. The random sets were used to estimate total phosphorus (TP) loads using regression models. The regression–based annual TP loads were compared to the integrated annual TP load estimated using all the data. At a minimum, monthly sampling plus supplemental storm samples (six samples per year) was needed to produce a {{root mean square error}} of less than 15 %. Water quality samples should be collected at least semi–monthly (every 15 days) in studies less than two years if seasonal time factors are {{to be used in the}} regression models. Annual TP loads estimated from independently collected discrete water quality samples further demonstrated the utility of using regression models to estimate annual TP loads in this stream system...|$|R

40|$|Comprehensive {{environmental}} models {{such as the}} Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) {{are becoming}} {{an integral part of}} decision making processes for effective planning and management of natural resources. Before their use as decision making aid, however, models must be properly evaluated to improve their prediction accuracy and reduce the likelihood of making decisions that could lead to undesirable policy outcomes. Model evaluation refers to practices such as quality analysis of input data, sensitivity analysis, calibration and verification, and uncertainty analysis. Many methodologies have been developed for model evaluations over the years. One of the major limitations of the existing model evaluation methods, in particular model calibration methods, is their computational inefficiency, especially when used to <b>calibrate</b> comprehensive <b>watershed</b> simulation models. It may take weeks to months of CPU time, depending on the problem size, to successfully <b>calibrate</b> a comprehensive <b>watershed</b> simulation model on a standard PC. In this study, two sensitivity analysis methods and four calibration methods are used to evaluate SWAT to improve its streamflow prediction accuracy for the Morro Bay watershed located on the central coast of California. Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed using step-wise-regression analysis and the one-factor-at-a time screening method. Calibration was performed using PEST, Genetic Algorithms, the Shuffled Complex Evolution, and the Dynamically Dimensioned Search using observed data from multiple sites in the watershed. The model evaluation methods are compared in terms of their computational efficiency as well as effectiveness to determine “accurate” results. The developed SWAT model can be used to evaluate effectiveness of the Best Management Practices installed in the Morro Bay watershed, and to also prioritize sites where BMPs may be implemented in the future to further improve ecological integrity of the Morro Bay Estuary, {{which is one of the}} most important wetlands in California as it supports wide variety of habitats including numerous sensitive and endangered plant and animal species...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVariations {{of water}} {{stocks in the}} upper Zambezi river basin have been {{determined}} by 2 different hydrological modelling approaches. The purpose was to provide preliminary terrestrial storage estimates in the upper Zambezi for comparison with estimates derived from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE). The first modelling approach is GIS-based, distributed and conceptual (STREAM). The second approach uses lumped elementary watersheds identified and modelled conceptually (LEW). The STREAM model structure has been assessed using GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) a posteriori to determine parameter identifiability. The LEW approach could, in addition, be tested for model structure, because computational efforts of LEW are low. Both models are threshold models, where the non-linear behaviour of the Zambezi river basin is explained {{by a combination of}} thresholds and linear reservoirs. The models were forced by time series of gauged and interpolated rainfall. Where available, runoff station data was used to calibrate the models. Ungauged watersheds were generally given the same parameter sets as their neighbouring <b>calibrated</b> <b>watersheds.</b> It appeared that the LEW model structure could be improved by applying GLUE iteratively. Eventually, it led to better identifiability of parameters and consequently a better model structure than the STREAM model. Hence, the final model structure obtained, better represents the true hydrology. After calibration, both models show a comparable efficiency in representing discharge. However the LEW model shows a far greater storage amplitude than the STREAM model. This emphasizes the storage uncertainty related to hydrological modelling in data-scarce environments such as the Zambezi river basin. It underlines the need and potential for independent observations of terrestrial storage to enhance our understanding and modelling capacity of the hydrological processes. GRACE could provide orthogonal information that can help to constrain and further enhance our models. In the near future, other remotely sensed data sources will be used to force modelling efforts of the Zambezi (e. g. satellite rainfall estimates) and to identify individual storage components in the GRACE observations (e. g. altimeter lake levels and microwave soil moisture). Ultimately, this will create possibilities for state updating of regional hydrological models using GRACE...|$|R

However, rarely does model calibration result in a unique parameter set. Parameter nonuniqueness can lead to predictive nonuniqueness.

Using models built for four neighboring watersheds in the Neuse River Basin of North Carolina, the application of the automated parameter optimization software PEST in conjunction with the Hydrologic Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF) is demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract — Understanding hydrologic {{systems at}} {{the scale of}} large {{watersheds}} and river basins is critically important to society when faced with extreme events, such as floods and droughts, or with concerns about water quality. A critical requirement of watershed modeling is model calibration, in which the computational model’s parameters are varied during a search algorithm {{in order to find}} the best match against physicallyobserved phenomena such as streamflow. Because it is generally performed on a laptop computer, this calibration phase can be very time-consuming, significantly limiting the ability of a hydrologist to experiment with different models. In this paper, we describe our system for watershed model calibration using cloud computing, specifically Microsoft Windows Azure. With a representative watershed model whose calibration takes 11. 4 hours on a commodity laptop, our cloud-based system <b>calibrates</b> the <b>watershed</b> model in 43. 32 minutes using 16 cloud cores (15. 78 x speedup), 11. 76 minutes using 64 cloud cores (58. 13 x speedup), and 5. 03 minutes using 256 cloud cores (135. 89 x speedup). We believe that such speed-ups offer the potential toward real-time interactive model creation with continuous calibration, ushering in a new paradigm for watershed modeling.

40|$|Process based, {{distributed}} watershed models {{possess a}} large number of parameters that are not directly measured in field and need to be calibrated, in most cases through matching modeled in-stream fluxes with monitored data. Recently, concern has been raised regarding the reliability of this common calibration practice, because models that are deemed to be adequately calibrated based on commonly used metrics (e. g., Nash Sutcliffe efficiency) may not realistically represent intra-watershed responses or fluxes. Such shortcomings stem from the use of an evaluation criteria that only concerns the global in-stream responses of the model without investigating intra-watershed responses. In this study, we introduce a modification to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, and a new calibration technique that collectively reduce the chance of misrepresenting intra-watershed responses. The SWAT model was modified to better represent NO 3 cycling in soils with various degrees of water holding capacity. The new calibration tool has the capacity to <b>calibrate</b> paired <b>watersheds</b> simultaneously within a single framework. It was found that when both proposed methodologies were applied jointly to two paired watersheds on the Delmarva Peninsula, the performance of the models as judged based on conventional metrics suffered, however, the intra-watershed responses (e. g., mass of NO 3 lost to denitrification) in the two models automatically converged to realistic sums. This approach also demonstrates the capacity to spatially distinguish areas of high denitrification potential, an ability that has implications for improved management of prior converted wetlands under crop production and for identifying prominent areas for wetland restoration...|$|R

From 1979 to 1985, a study involving nine small (~ 2. 5 ha) forested watersheds was conducted near Alto, Texas in the upper western Gulf-Coastal Plain to evaluate the impacts then-current silvicultural practices on water quality. In the years following the study, silvicultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) including Streamside Management Zones (SMZs) and other erosion control practices evolved and questions arose about the applicability of earlier results to current practices. In 1999, these same watersheds were reinstrumented to evaluate the water quality effects of intensive silviculture using modern BMPs. Three years of pre-treatment data were collected to <b>calibrate</b> the <b>watersheds.</b> During the calibration phase, in June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison struck southeastern Texas, dumping almost 11. 8 cm of rainfall on saturated soils in about 3 hours.

In a little over three hours, the watersheds clearcut and chopped in 1980 generated over 2. 5 times more sediment that the entire year following harvest and site-preparation. 1 Comparisons of data from the 1979 Alto Watershed study with pretreatment data from the current study suggest that these watersheds have a high potential for geologic erosion even with mature forest cover.

In this study we explore the potential for using process-based rainfall-runoff models to simulate the timing of water flow and runoff-generated debris flows in recently burned areas. Two different spatially distributed hydrologic models with differing levels of complexity were used: the full shallow water equations and the kinematic wave approximation. Model parameter values were calibrated in two different watersheds, spanning two orders of magnitude in drainage area. These watersheds were affected by the 2009 Station Fire in the San Gabriel Mountains, CA, USA. Input data for the numerical models were constrained by time series of soil moisture, flow stage, and rainfall collected at field sites, as well as high-resolution lidar-derived digital elevation models. The calibrated parameters were used to model a third watershed in the burn area, and the results show a good match with observed timing of flow peaks. The calibrated roughness parameter (Manning's n) was generally higher when using the kinematic wave approximation relative to the shallow water equations, and decreased with increasing spatial scale. The <b>calibrated</b> effective <b>watershed</b> hydraulic conductivity was low for both models, even for storms occurring several months after the fire, suggesting that wildfire-induced changes to soil-water infiltration were retained throughout that time.

40|$|International audienceUntil recently, {{aquifers}} {{located in}} hard rock formations (granite, gneiss, schist) were {{considered as a}} highly heterogeneous media, and no adequate methodology for groundwater management was available. Recent research {{studies have shown that}} when hard rocks are exposed to regional and deep-weathering processes and when the geology is relatively homogenous, a typical hard rock aquifer is made of two main superimposed hydrogeological layers each characterized by quite homogeneous specific hydrodynamic properties: namely the saprolite and the fissured layers. Therefore, for these cases, hard rock aquifers can be considered as a multi-layered system. Based on these works, an operational decision support tool (DST-GW) designed for the management of groundwater resources in hard rock area under variable agro-climatic conditions has been developed. The tool focuses on the impact of changing cropping pattern, artificial recharge and rainfall conditions on groundwater levels at the scale of small watersheds (10 to about 100 km 2 in case well-developed weathering profile). DST-GW is based on the groundwater balance and the ‘water table fluctuation method', which are well-adapted methods in hard rock and semi-arid contexts. Based on field data from an overexploited South Indian watershed (58 km 2), the model allows <b>calibrating,</b> at <b>watershed</b> scale, the variation in specific yield of the aquifer with depth, as well as the rainfall-aquifer recharge relationship. Seasonal basin-scale piezometric levels are computed with an average deviation of ± 0 · 56 m compared to measurements from 2001 to 2005. The model shows that, if no measure is taken, the water table depletion will induce the drying-up of most of the exploited borewells by the year 2012. Scenarios of mitigation measures elaborated with the tool show that change in cropping patterns could rapidly reverse the tendency and lead to a sustainable management of the resource.

40|$|An {{integrative}} Hydrological and Ecological {{modeling system}} at regional scale {{was developed to}} assess water resources use and ecosystem production in arid and semi-arid areas. Hydrological model in the integrative modeling system was adapted from Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to simulate the water balance in terms of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, streamflow, and groundwater table change. An ecological model was integrated into the hydrological model to compute the ecosystem production of biomass and yield for different land use types. An indicator was estimated to quantify gross benefit of water management in terms of monetary value of ecosystem production and water productivity. The modeling system was implemented in a holistic approach, and able to produce simulation results at daily time steps with a spatial resolution of hydrological response unit (HRU). After identifying the sensitive parameters, the modeling system was calibrated using an automatic calibration procedure based on conventional Monte Carlo sampling method together with a multi-objective criterion for calibration over multi-site and multi-output. ^ The modeling system was tested in the upper and middle parts of the Yellow River basin, China. The simulated results revealed that water use {{in the study area}} had largely reduced the streamflow {{in many parts of the}} area except for that in the riverhead. Spatial distribution of water yield, crop yield, and water productivity showed a strong impact of irrigation on agricultural production. Water management scenario analyses suggested that a sustainable water supply requires a mixed management that consists of improving irrigation efficiency, allocating water for ecosystems, and balancing human water demand and basin water availability. In general, the simulation results from this study indicated that the model was capable of tracking the temporal and spatial variability of pertinent water balance variables, ecosystem dynamics, and regional economy, and provided a useful simulation tool in evaluating long-term water resources management strategies at the basin scale.

40|$|The Hydrological Simulation Program FORTRAN (HSPF) {{model was}} {{calibrated}} for the South Nation watershed located in Eastern Ontario. Three nonlinear automatic optimization techniques were applied and compared: Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg (GML) method, Random Multiple Search Method (RSM), and Shuffled Complex Evolution method {{developed at the}} University of Arizona (SCE-UA). The best GML, RSM, and SCE-UA variable values beyond which objective function improvement is insignificant were suggested. It was {{found that more than}} one parameter set is able to maintain the model in a calibrated state which reflects correlation among model parameters and equations. The lowest value of the objective function (OF) does not necessarily correspond to the optimum solution. Comparison of scatter plots, graphs of residuals, and plots of cumulative differences are required to determine the best model parameter set. Combination of Nash and Sutcliffe (NS) model fit, coefficient of efficiency, and index of agreement proved to be the best statistics for model comparison. Proper definition of the OF is crucial to successful model calibration. Over 60 single and compound OFs were compared. The OF expressed as a log of observed and simulated flows was found to be the most appropriate single OF. A compound OF expressed as a sum of squared residuals of equally weighed log-transformed maximum (top 1 % of flows), minimum (bottom 20 % of flows), and middle flows was found to be best for most general model applications. Uncertainty of HSPF parameters was explored by the method of moments (MM), Monte Carlo (MC) with Latin hypercube and induced correlation, and response surface (RS) methods. Typically, the MM results in the most conservative uncertainty. The 95 % confidence intervals of parameter uncertainty correspond to up to 10 % variations in spring maximum flows. The predictive confidence interval and predictive noise for spring maximum and autumn minimum flows using single and compound OFs were computed. The predictive intervals were computed from the 95 % confidence limits of the OF. It was found that HSPF can be an efficient tool to predict flows in ungaged watersheds with parameter transfer from <b>calibrated</b> neighbouring <b>watersheds.</b> The impact of DEM resolution on HSPF topographical parameters was studied...|$|R

The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate the stream flow for different scenarios of subdivisions of the catchment and corresponding Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs). Model runs were conducted using the metereological data for the period 01 / 01 / 1994 - 31 / 12 / 2002. The model was <b>calibrated</b> using the <b>watershed</b> configuration with 8 sub-basins and 65 HRUs. A Multi-step Automatic Calibration Scheme (MACS) using the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) optimization algorithm was applied for model calibration. The calibration covered a five-year period (01 / 01 / 1999 - 31 / 12 / 2002) and the validation phase a four-year period (01 / 01 / 1994 - 12 / 31 / 1998). The calibrated model parameters were used for all scenarios with a different number of sub-catchment and HRUs delineations. The number of HRUs was defined on the basis of land use and dominant soil type per sub-catchment division. The results indicate that the level of spatial distribution of model input has a minor impact on the prediction of the daily average component values of stream flow. The statistical analysis at the other hand revealed that the Nash and Sutcliffe (EF) coefficient for the prediction of the total flow varied when changing the number of sub-watersheds.

As a first step in understanding the impact of climate change in Iowa watersheds, historical streamflow observations and model-derived time series of soil moisture, frozen ground and snow cover for ten Iowa watersheds were analyzed. The modeled data were generated using precipitation and temperature data spanning 1948 to 2003 as inputs to the conceptually-based hydrologic models of the National Weather Service river forecasting system. The models were <b>calibrated</b> for each <b>watershed</b> using observed discharge data. The time series were tested for trend significance using the Mann-Kendall test with the Trend-Free Pre-Whitening procedure at a p = 0. 1 significance level. Results show an increasing trend in mean daily discharge, peak flow from rain, and low flows over the last 50 years. Monthly soil moisture content is also increasing, and is strongest during the warm seasons. Maximum daily flow from snow displays a decreasing trend and tendency to occur earlier in the year suggesting an earlier melt of the snowpack in the region. Results for frozen ground and snow cover show that the onset and conclusion has shifted to earlier in the year with more melt days occurring over the snow season. Although several of the hydrologic variables examined did not show statistical significance, trends in most hydrologic processes were observed. Different model calibration periods were tested and found to have minor influence on the average simulation accuracy, but did impact the simulated trends in streamflow. Model results from three calibrations indicate that the modeling system responds to changes in climate, but other factors that the model cannot account for (e. g. land-use change) may be reflected in the observed discharge from several basins...|$|R
40|$|Presented at The Oregon Water Conference, May 24 - 25, 2011, Corvallis, OR. A key {{challenge}} for resource and landscape managers is {{to predict the}} consequences of climate warming on streamflows and water resources. Different approaches are being developed to forecast the direction, magnitude, and timing of future streamflow changes in specific landscapes. One approach that is being utilized in the Pacific Northwest involves coupling downscaled climate predictions to macroscale hydrologic models, such as the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. VIC is typically parameterized and <b>calibrated</b> in selected <b>watersheds,</b> and then applied to a regional scale that includes larger population of uncalibrated watersheds. Summer streamflows are sensitive to both changes in the timing of snowpack accumulation and melt, and intrinsic, geologically-mediated differences in the efficiency of landscapes in transforming recharge (either as rain or snow) into discharge. Here we explore {{the importance of this}} effect by using geologically focused “bottom-up” approach to empirically characterize the sensitivity of late-summer streamflows to climate warming for a range of basins across Oregon. We define sensitivity as the slope of the relation between annual precipitation and summer streamflow, characterized as 7 -day low flow and total summer flow. Drainage efficiency was defined in terms of the: 1) rate of recession (K) of the streamflow hydrograph; and 2) ratio of base flow to total flow (Base Flow Index or BFI). We compare our sensitivity results with those derived from VIC simulated streamflow. Using the bottom-up approach, we found that the both K and BFI are good predictors for streamflow sensitivity to climate change. Fast-draining basins (high K / low BFI) are much less sensitive to changes in annual precipitation, whereas slow-draining basins (low K / high BFI) are much more sensitive. For basins where VIC was calibrated, downscaled VIC simulations are similar to empirical data. Uncalibrated basins, however, do not show a clear relationship with drainage efficiency, meaning that VIC may under predict sensitivity of summer stramflows to climate change in uncalibrated groundwater-dominated watersheds. This implies that spatial heterogeneity in aquifer properties must be explicitly incorporated into parameterization and calibration schemes if the full range of hydrologic response to warming is to be captured across the landscape...|$|R

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was built for the Pottawatomie Creek Watershed in eastern Kansas, independently <b>calibrated</b> at the <b>watershed</b> outlet for streamflow and at a pasture site for nutrients and sediment runoff, and also employed to simulate pollutant loads in a synthetic pasture. The pasture was divided into several subareas including stream, riparian zone, and two grazing zones. Five scenarios applied to both a synthetic pasture and a whole watershed were simulated to assess various combinations of widely used pasture BMPs: (1) baseline conditions with an open stream access, (2) an off-stream watering site installed in individual subareas in the pasture, and (3) stream or riparian zone fencing with an off-stream watering site. Results indicated that pollutant loads increase with increasing stocking rates whereas off-stream watering site and/or stream fencing reduce time cattle spend in the stream and nutrient loads. These two BMPs lowered organic P and N loads by more than 59 % and nitrate loads by 19 %, but TSS and sediment-attached P loads remained practically unchanged. An effectiveness index (EI) quantified impacts from the various combinations of off-stream watering sites and fencing in all scenarios. Stream bank contribution to pollutant loads was not accounted in the methodology due to limitations of the SWAT model, but can be incorporated in the approach if an amount of bank soil loss is known for various stocking rates. The proposed methodology provides an adaptable framework for pasture BMP assessment and was utilized to represent a consistent, defensible process to quantify the effectiveness of BMP proposals in a BMP auction in eastern Kansas...|$|R

This work is part of the IP 3 Network, which has the overall goal to evaluate and demonstrate improved predictions of hydrological and atmospheric fields for cold regions. As such this thesis involves a series of calibration and validation experiments on the MESH hydrological model (used by IP 3 for predictions) with two cold region case studies. The first case study is the very well instrumented Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in Idaho, USA and the second case study is the Wolf Creek watershed in the Yukon Territory. As the MESH model is still in the development phase, a critical component of model development is a thorough analysis of model setup and performance. One intention of this research is to provide feedback for future development of the MESH hydrological model. The Reynolds Creek site was modeled as part of this thesis work. This site was chosen based on the long term, highly distributed and detailed data set. The second site, Wolf Creek, was used for a simplified case study. Models of both case study sites were calibrated and validated to carefully evaluate model performance. Reynolds Creek was calibrated as a single objective problem as well as multi-objective problem using snow water equivalent data and streamflow data for multiple sites. The hydrological simulations for Wolf Creek were fair; further calibration effort and a more detailed examination of the model setup would have likely produced better results. Calibration and validation of Reynolds Creek produced very good results for streamflow and snow water equivalent at multiple sites though out the <b>watershed.</b> <b>Calibrating</b> streamflow generated a very different optimal parameter set compared to calibrating snow water equivalent or calibrating to both snow water equivalent and streamflow in a multi-objective framework.

First, the model is <b>calibrated</b> for each <b>watershed</b> with respect to each rainfall product input for the period 2003 – 2004. Then daily streamflow simulations for the validation period 2006 – 2007 are made from SWAT using rainfall input from each source and corresponding model parameters; comparison of the simulations to the observed streamflow at the outlet of each watershed forms {{the basis for the}} conclusions of this study. Results reveal that the utility of satellite rainfall products as input to SWAT for daily streamflow simulation strongly depends on the product type. The 3 B 42 RT and CMORPH simulations show consistent and modest skills in their simulations but underestimate the large flood peaks, while the 3 B 42 and PERSIANN simulations have inconsistent performance with poor or no skills. Not only are the microwave-based algorithms (3 B 42 RT, CMORPH) better than the infrared-based algorithm (PERSIANN), but the infrared-based algorithm PERSIANN also has poor or no skills for streamflow simulations. The satellite-only product (3 B 42 RT) performs much better than the satellite-gauge product (3 B 42), indicating that the algorithm used to incorporate rain gauge information with the goal of improving the accuracy of the satellite rainfall products is actually making the products worse, pointing to problems in the algorithm. The effect of watershed area on the suitability of satellite rainfall products for streamflow simulation also depends on the rainfall product. Increasing the watershed area from 299 km 2 to 1656 km 2 improves the simulations obtained from the 3 B 42 RT and CMORPH (i. e. products that are more reliable and consistent) rainfall inputs while it deteriorates the simulations obtained from the 3 B 42 and PERSIANN (i. e. products that are unstable and inconsistent) rainfall inputs...|$|R

The main characteristics considered for the classification of waterbodies were designated use of the waterbody, land use distribution, density of stream network, average distance of a land of a particular use to the closest stream, household population, density of on-site sewage facilities (OSSF), bacterial loading due to the presence of different types of farm animals and wildlife, and average climatic conditions. The availability of observed in-stream fecal coliform bacteria concentration data was evaluated to obtain subgroups of data-rich and data-poor watersheds within a group. The climatic data and observed in-stream fecal coliform bacteria concentrations were analyzed to find out seasonal variability of the water quality. The watershed characteristics were analyzed using the multivariate statistical analysis techniques such as factor analysis/principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and discriminant analysis. Six groups of watersheds were formed as result of the statistical analysis. The main factors that differentiate the clusters were found to be bacterial contribution from farm animals and wildlife, density of OSSF, density of households connected to public sewers, and the land use distribution.

40|$|Fine sediments or {{particles}} are important determinants of {{water quality and}} ecosystem health. Various contaminants such as nutrients and heavy metals are transported by fine particles and the deposition of fine particles at the surface of stream beds often causes serious impairments of benthic ecosystems. For these reasons understanding fine particle transport within watersheds and interaction with the stream bed are important for assessing impairment of water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Besides a qualitative understanding, restoration and remediation efforts would benefit from quantitative models that predict fine particle dynamics. This thesis adopted an approach that first explored the patterns of fine particle transport within California watersheds, from those patterns processes were investigated that dominated particle transport, and then finally, developing a quantitative model with the goal being able to predict particle dynamics that replicated observed patterns and represented dominant processes. The rich data base of US Geological Survey stream monitoring data within California provided opportunities for recognizing common patterns in fine sediment loading rates {{as a function of}} flow rate. The majority of 38 minimally developed watersheds with extensive flow and particle transport data illustrated a common dependence of particle loading rate on flow rate. Physical surveys of watersheds, collection of stage-discharge data from historical gauging records, and sediment bed analysis revealed that gravel-bedded streams underwent a transition to accelerated rates of fine particle transport above a flow rate sufficient to initiate mobilization of bed sediments. Additionally, continuous flow and turbidity data had hysteresis loops when fine particle concentration is plotted against flow rate that demonstrated stream bed release of fine particles and a limited supply of those particles. These patterns were in qualitative agreement with observations by others over the last 75 years. The transition from pattern recognition to process analysis required incorporation of the dominant processes controlling fine particle dynamics within gravel-bedded streams into a model. The process analysis was guided by the use of continuous flow and turbidity data at two locations on the Russian River in California to test process descriptions and then calibrate a quantitative model to represent those processes. The resulting process model coupled fine particle retention within the sediment bed by filtration and sedimentation with the release of accumulated fine particles in response to flood events. Model parameters such as a critical flow rate required to initiate sediment bed fluidization, the maximum fine particle storage capacity within the watershed, and background particle concentration for the watershed were identified directly from monitoring data. Model calibration consisted of optimizing the filtration parameter and the sediment bed fluidization parameter over two or three years of data. Overall the modeled fine particle release was within 5 % of what was measured during flood events. The successful process modeling for two sites formed the basis for partially validating the model for data not used in calibration within the Russian River of California and testing its applicability to other <b>watersheds.</b> The <b>calibrated</b> model parameters combined with over a year of 15 -minute flow data was able to replicate within 35 % the observed fine particle release by flood events. Six other watersheds were utilized in testing the calibration of the model and providing a preliminary analysis of the sensitivity of the two model parameters representing filtration and fluidization. The model could be successfully <b>calibrated</b> to these <b>watersheds,</b> and there was a limited range observed for the fluidization parameter and a possible watershed area dependency on the filtration parameter. As a further test of the model, particle loading rates were generated from measured flow data and these loading rates were similar to those observed. This agreement provided a demonstration that the model was able to quantitatively replicate the shape and scatter of particle loading observations, both under current and historical conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of soil moisture is of pronounced importance in various applications e. g. flood control, agricultural production and effective water resources management. These applications require the {{knowledge of}} spatial and temporal variation of the soil moisture in the watershed. There are three approaches of estimating/measuring soil moisture namely,(i) in-situ measurements,(ii) remote sensing, and(iii) hydrological modelling. The in situ techniques of measurement provide relatively accurate information at point scale but are not feasible to gather in large numbers relevant for a watershed. The soil moisture can be simulated by hydrological models at the desired spatial and temporal resolution, but these simulations would often {{be affected by the}} uncertainties in the model physics, parameters, forcing, initial and boundary conditions. The remote sensing provides an alternative to retrieve the soil moisture of the surface (top few centimeters) layer, but even this data is limited by the spatial or temporal resolution, which is satellite dependant. Hydrological models could be improved by assimilating remotely sensed soil moisture, which requires a retrieval algorithm. In order to develop a retrieval algorithm the satellite data need to be calibrated/validated with the in-situ ground measurements. The retrieval of surface soil moisture from microwave remote sensing is sensitive to surface conditions, and hence requires calibration/validation specific to a site/region. The improvement in the hydrological variables/fluxes is sensitive to the framework adopted during the assimilation of remotely sensed data. The main focus {{of the study was to}} assess the retrieval algorithm for the surface soil moisture from both active (ENVISAT,RADARSAT- 2) and passive(AMSR-E) microwave satellites in a semi-arid tropical watershed of South India. Further, the usefulness of these retrieved remotely sensed products for the estimation of recharge was investigated by developing a coupled hydrological model and an assimilation framework. A brief introduction was made in Chapter 1 on the importance of surface soil moisture and evapotranspiration in hydrology, and the feasible options available for the retrieval from microwave remote sensing. A detailed review of the literature is presented in Chapter 2 to establish the state-of-the-art on the following:(i) retrieval algorithms for the surface soil moisture from active and passive microwave remote sensing,(ii) estimation of actual evapotranspiration from optical remote sensing(MODIS),(iii) coupled surface-ground water hydrological models,(iv) estimation of soil hydraulic properties with their uncertainties, and(v) assimilation framework specific to hydrological modelling. To calibrate/validate the retrieval algorithms and to test the coupled model and the assimilation framework developed, field measurements were carried out in the BerambadI experimental watershed located in the Kabini river basin. The surface soil moisture in 50 field plots, profile soil moisture up to 1 m depth in 20 field plots, and ground water level in 200 bore wells were measured. Twelve images of ENVISAT, seven teen images of RADARSAT- 2, along with AMSR-E and MODIS data were used. These data pertained to different durations during the period 2008 to 2011,the details of which are given in Chapter 3. The approach for the retrieval of surface soil moisture and the associated uncertainty from active and passive microwave remote sensing is given in Chapter 4. Surface soil moisture was retrieved for six vegetation classes using the linear regression model and copulas. Three types of copulas(Clayton, Frank and Gumbel) were investigated. It was found that the ensemble mean simulated using the linear regression model and three copulas was nearly same. The copulas were found to be superior than the linear regression model when comparing the distributions of the mean of the generated ensemble. Among the copulas it was observed that the Clayton copula performed better in the lower and middle ranges of backscatter coefficient, while the Gumbel and Frank copulas were found to be superior in the upper ranges of backscatter coefficients. The range of RMSE was approximatively 4 cm 3 cm− 3 indicating that the retrieval from ENVISAT/RADARSAT- 2 was good. ACDF based approach was proposed to retrieve the surface soil moisture map for the watershed with a spatial resolution of 100 m x 100 m (i. e one hectare). The map of the uncertainty in the retrieved surface soil moisture was also prepared using the Clayton copula. The AMSR-E surface soil moisture product was <b>calibrated</b> for the <b>watershed</b> during the period 2008 to 2011, using the map generated from the ENVISAT/RADARSAT data. They Clayton copula was used to generate the ensemble of the corrected AMSR-E surface soil moisture. The standard deviation of the generated ensemble varied from 0. 01 to 0. 03 cm 3 cm− 3,hence the derived surface soil moisture product for Berambadi was found to be good. In the Chapter 5, a one dimensional soil moisture model was developed based on the numerical solution of the Richards’ equation using finite difference method and inverse modeling was carried out using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation(GLUE) approach for estimating the soil hydraulic parameters of the van Genuchten(VG) model and their uncertainty. The parameters were estimated from the two field sites(Berambadi and Wailapally watershed in South India) and from laboratory evaporation experiment for the Wailapally site. It was found that the GLUE approach was able to provide good uncertainty bounds for the soil hydraulic parameters. The uncertainty in the estimates from the field experiment was found to be higher than from the laboratory evaporation experiment for both water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. The saturated soil moisture(θs) and shape parameter (n) of VG model estimated from the laboratory evaporation and field experiment were found to be the same, and further more they showed a lower uncertainty from both the experiments. Moreover, the residual soil moisture (θr), inverse of capillary fringe thickness (α) and saturated hydraulic conductivity(KS) showed a relatively higher uncertainty. In the Berambadi watershed,the inverse modeling was performed in three bare field plots, and it was found that ﬁeld plots which had higher θs showed a relatively higher actual evapotranspiration (AET) and lower potential recharge. In Chapter 6, the retrieval of profile soil moisture up to 2 m by assimilation of surface soil moisture was investigated by performing synthetic experiments on six soil types. The measured surface soil moisture over top 5 cm depth was assimilated into the one dimensional soil moisture model to retrieve the profile soil moisture. Even though the assimilation of surface soil moisture helped in improving the profile soil moisture for the six soil types, the bias was observed. To reduce the bias, pseudo observations of profile soil moisture were generated and used in addition to the surface soil moisture in the assimilation altogether. These pseudo observations were generated using the linear relationship existing between the surface and profile soil moisture. A significant bias reduction was found to be feasible by using this method when pseudo observations beyond 75 cm depth were used then there was no significant improvement. A coupled surface-ground water model was developed, which had 5 layers for the vadose zone and one layer for the ground water zone, in order to consider the major hydrological processes from ground surface to ground water table in a semi-arid watershed. The details of the coupled model were described in Chapter 7. The major aim of this model was to be able to use remotely sensed data of surface soil moisture and evapotranspiration to simulate recharge. The model was tested by applying in a lumped framework to the field data set in the Berambadi watershed for the year 2010 to 2011. The performance of the model was evaluated with the measured watershed average root zone soil moisture and ground water levels. The watershed average root zone soil moisture was obtained by averaging the field measurements from 20 plots and average ground water level was obtained by averaging the field measurement from 200 bore wells. In order to assimilate the AET into the coupled model, the daily AET at a spatial resolution of 1 km was estimated from MODIS data. The AET was validated in one forested and four agricultural sites in the watershed. The validation was based on the comparison with AET simulated from water balance models. For agricultural plots the STICS (crop model) and for the forested site the COMFORT (hydrological) model were used. The AET from the MODIS showed a reasonably good match with both the forested and agricultural plots at the annual scale (for the crop model approximately 4 - 5 months). Model simulations were carried out with and without assimilating the remotely sensed data and the performance was evaluated. It was found that the assimilation helped in capturing the trends in deeper layer soil moisture and groundwater level. At the end, in Chapter 8 the major conclusions drawn from the various chapters are summarized...|$|R
