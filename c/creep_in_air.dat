40|$|In {{this paper}} we review {{a number of}} studies of stress-induced diffusional matter {{transport}} in perovskites, with an emphasis on creep studies used as a means of studying defect chemistry on the cation sublattices. Studies of diffusional <b>creep</b> <b>in</b> <b>air</b> or fixed atmospheres are reviewed first, and the common characteristics among these perovskites are identified. Creep studies of several perovskite-related or perovskite-like structures are reviewed next, and the similarities/dissimilarities to perovskites are outlined. The diffusional creep studies in controlled atmosphere are reviewed next, with the emphasis on defect chemistry modeling from creep data. The paper presents a detailed review of two creep studies in oxygen controlled atmosphere that show particularly interesting and remarkedly different behavior from that predicted by standard defect chemistry models. Defect chemistry modeling from creep data is presented for these two cases. The potential and limitations of using creep experiments for studying diffusional matter transport and cation defect chemistry are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Present paper {{deals with}} the delayed {{fracture}} in woven GFRP underwater at elevated temperature. The tensile test of GFRP after water immersion was conducted to evaluate the residual strength ater immersion at various water temperatures. The residual strength of GFRP decreased {{with the increase in}} the water temperature and the immersion time. In fact, the transition in failure mode with water immersion was ascertained from SEM observation of the fracture surface.

The influence of flowing sodium on creep rupture behaviour of the steel has been investigated and results are compared with those obtained on carrying out <b>creep</b> test <b>in</b> <b>air</b> environment. <b>Creep</b> test on the material both in flowing sodium and <b>in</b> <b>air</b> were carried out at 873 K over a stress range of 225 - 305 MPa. Sodium velocity across the creep specimen was maintained around 2. 5 m/s. The testing environment was found not to change the rate of steady state creep deformation significantly. The tertiary stage of creep deformation of the steel was found to change significantly by the testing environment.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper first {{describes}} a creep damage mechanics model {{that shows a}} marked performance for both steady-state creep and tertiary creep, as evidenced by comparisons with creep test results for two metallic materials. Then, using the creep damage mechanics model as a foundation, a framework is presented for treating the phenomenon of stress-accelerated grain-boundary oxygen embrittlement (SAGBO) in metals (e. g. superalloys) at elevated temperatures and under oxidizing environ-ments. This framework establishes a combined creep and oxygen embrittlement damage model that incorporates the effect of oxygen diffusion along grain boundaries and oxidation-accelerated cavitation. The damage model {{has been applied to}} round-bar creep tests of a steel alloy that exhibits the SAGBO phenomenon. Predictions of the <b>creep</b> curve <b>in</b> <b>air</b> and its dependence on the bar size have been obtained based on a simplified analysis of the tests.

Treatments were performed for 1 h at a working pressure of 4 mbar and negative high voltage pulses of 7. 5 kV, 30 mu s and 500 Hz were applied on the specimens heated at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C, respectively. Microstructural characterization of the treated samples revealed the formation of nitrided layers, with simultaneous formation of TiN and Ti 2 N. the most intense peaks of these compounds were obtained at higher treatment temperature, {{probably due to the}} diffusion of nitrogen into titanium. the presence of nitrides caused surface hardening up to three times higher in comparison with untreated alloy. Constant load creep tests were conducted on a standard <b>creep</b> machine <b>in</b> <b>air</b> atmosphere, at stress level of 319 MPa at 600 degrees C. Significant reductions of the steady-state creep rates (epsilon) were measured for martensitic Ti- 6 Al- 4 V treated by nitrogen HTPBII, reaching minimum creep rates of 0. 0318 h(- 1) in comparison with 0. 1938 h(- 1) for untreated sample. the improvement of the creep resistance seems {{to be associated with the}} formation of a thick nitrided layer, which acts as a barrier to oxygen diffusion into the material. in addition, the increase of the grain size generated by the heating of the substrate during the treatment can affect some creep mechanisms, leading to a significant reduction of epsilon.
