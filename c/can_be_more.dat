5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} a plant that attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral venography and manometry. Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to be}} rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers.

This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and {{are less likely to be}} degraded.|$|E

Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities. Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.|$|E

Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E

5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … {{there is no question that}} American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{small number}} of embassies, Azerbaijan <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{difficult}} to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem. In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted.

Excess iodine <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E
