The electronic databases searched were: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, CINAHL and PsycINFO. The search was limited to publications in English, but was not limited by date of publication or geographical location. Non-systematic reviews, opinions, books, book chapters, discussions and letters were excluded. Other meta-reviews were cited and compared with this study, but not included in data analysis.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} text mining {{application}} that exploits the MeSH heading subheading combinations present in MEDLINE records.

A parallel process using SemRep, a linguistic tool, also extracts conceptually related concept pairs from the titles of MEDLINE records. The pairs extracted via MeSH and the pairs extracted via SemRep are compared to yield a high confidence subset. These pairs are then combined to project a summary view associated with the selected subheading pair. For each concept the "diversity" in the set of related concepts is assessed. We suggest that this summary and the diversity indicators will be useful a health care practitioner or researcher. We illustrate this application with the subheading pair "drug therapy" and "therapeutic use" which approximates the treatment relationship between Drugs and Diseases...|$|R

The {{extent to which a}} CD-ROM product preserves and exploits important MEDLINE strengths should be assessed, e. g., the MeSH controlled vocabulary, the designation of major and minor MeSH emphasis, and the use <b>of</b> <b>subheadings.</b> Search software characteristics that affect ease of searching and quality of results also need to be examined, e. g., the ability to truncate search terms and the order of precedence in which Boolean operators are evaluated.

40|$|Objective: This paper {{reports on}} the latest results of an Indexing Initiative effort {{addressing}} the automatic attachment <b>of</b> <b>subheadings</b> to MeSH main headings recommended by the NLM’s Medical Text Indexer. Material and Methods: Several linguistic and statistical approaches are used to retrieve and attach the subheadings. Continuing collaboration with NLM indexers also provided insight on how automatic methods can better enhance indexing practice. Results: The methods were evaluated on corpus of 50, 000 MEDLINE citations. For main heading/subheading pair recommendations, the best precision is obtained with a post-processing rule method (58 %) while the best recall is obtained by pooling all methods (64 %). For stand-alone subheading recommendations, the best performance is obtained with the PubMed Related Citations algorithm. Conclusion: Significant {{progress has been made}} in terms of subheading coverage. After further evaluation, some of this work may be integrated in the MEDLINE indexing workflow...|$|R
