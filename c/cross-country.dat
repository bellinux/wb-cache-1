5|$|The {{sport of}} <b>cross-country</b> skiing {{encompasses}} {{a variety of}} formats for <b>cross-country</b> skiing races over courses of varying lengths according to rules sanctioned by the International Ski Federation and by various national organizations, such as the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA) and Cross Country Ski Canada. International competitions include the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, the FIS <b>Cross-Country</b> World Cup, and at the Winter Olympic Games. Such races occur over homologated, groomed courses designed to support classic (in-track) and freestyle events, where the skiers may employ skate skiing. It also encompasses <b>cross-country</b> ski marathon events, sanctioned by the Worldloppet Ski Federation, and <b>cross-country</b> ski orienteering events, sanctioned by the International Orienteering Federation. Related forms of competition are biathlon, where competitors race on <b>cross-country</b> skis and stop to shoot at targets with rifles, and paralympic <b>cross-country</b> skiing that allows athletes with disabilities to compete at <b>cross-country</b> skiing with adaptive equipment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cross-country</b> {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. <b>Cross-country</b> skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of <b>cross-country</b> skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
5|$|Eight new {{events were}} introduced: {{snowboard}} cross, team pursuit (speed skating), team sprint (<b>cross-country</b> skiing), and the mass-start race (biathlon). The team sprint events replaced the classical men's 30kilometers (km) and women's 15km <b>cross-country</b> distances, {{held at the}} previous Winter Games in 2002. In total, there were six more events than in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, United States.|$|E
5|$|Paralympic <b>cross-country</b> ski {{competition}} is {{an adaptation of}} <b>cross-country</b> skiing for athletes with disabilities. Paralympic <b>cross-country</b> skiing includes standing events, sitting events (for wheelchair users), and events for visually impaired athletes under {{the rules of the}} International Paralympic Committee. These are divided into several categories for people who are missing limbs, have amputations, are blind, or have any other physical disability, to continue their sport.|$|E
5|$|Recreational <b>cross-country</b> skiing {{includes}} ski touring and groomed-trail skiing, typically at resorts or in parklands.

5|$|Van Cortlandt Park is {{a popular}} site for <b>cross-country</b> running, owing to its miles of cinder trails and hills {{as well as its}} steep terrain. One legend has it that a <b>cross-country</b> coach thought that Van Cortlandt Park's tracks were too hard and instead went to the New Jersey Meadowlands to train. Its courses {{are some of the most}} {{utilized}} <b>cross-country</b> courses in the United States.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} sports, some {{competitors}} in <b>cross-country</b> skiing {{have chosen to}} enhance their performance through doping. Anti-doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari Isometsä, Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a blood plasma expander usually used {{to cover up the}} use of erythropoietin (EPO). EPO boosts the oxygen-carrying capability of hemoglobin. In addition, the team head coach left needles and drip bags at a public location near the Helsinki airport. At the Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Austrian <b>cross-country</b> skier Johannes Duerr was ejected from competition after testing positive for the blood booster EPO. In 2007, The International Olympic Committee banned biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, and the <b>cross-country</b> skiers, Martin Tauber, Jürgen Pinter, Johannes Eder, Roland Diethart and Christian Hoffmann, from all future Olympic competition.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cross-country</b> ski {{competitors}} employ {{one of two}} techniques, {{according to}} the event: classic and skating (in freestyle races, where all techniques are allowed). Skiathlon combines the two techniques in one race.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin became {{notable for}} a scandal {{involving}} the emerging trend of blood doping, {{the use of}} blood transfusions or synthetic hormones such as Erythropoietin (EPO) to improve oxygen flow and thus reduce fatigue. The Italian police conducted a raid on the Austrian <b>cross-country</b> ski team's residence during the Games where they seized blood-doping specimens and equipment. This event followed the pre-Olympics suspension of 12 <b>cross-country</b> skiers who tested positive for unusually high levels of haemoglobin, which is evidence of blood doping.|$|E
5|$|The Scandinavian {{countries}} attained considerable {{success in}} <b>cross-country</b> skiing, with the Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish teams winning 12 {{of the available}} 18 medals and the remaining six medals being won by the Soviet Union.

5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider <b>cross-country</b> and of handling more difficult weather. <b>Cross-country</b> flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E
5|$|As is customary, the men's {{marathon}} medals (at the Summer Olympics) or the men's 50km and woman´s 30km <b>cross-country</b> skiing medals (at the Winter Olympics) {{are presented}} {{as part of the}} Closing Ceremony, which take place on the penultimate and the last days, in the Olympic Stadium, and are thus the last medal presentation of the Games.|$|E
5|$|Athletes {{train to}} achieve endurance, strength, speed, skill and {{flexibility}} {{at different levels}} of intensity. Offseason training often occurs on dry land, sometimes on roller skis. The organization of <b>cross-country</b> ski competitions aims to make those events accessible both to spectators and television audiences. As with other sports that require endurance, strength and speed, some athletes have chosen to use banned performance-enhancing drugs.|$|E
