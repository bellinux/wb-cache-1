30|$|The arcs in the FCM which {{represent}} the domain concepts’ dependencies of the domain knowledge are bidirectional. Furthermore, {{the value of}} the arc Ci[*]→[*]Cj is not essentially equal to {{the value of the}} arc Cj[*]→[*]Ci. This is happened {{due to the fact that}} changes on the knowledge level of Ci may affect the knowledge level of Cj in a different degree than changes on the knowledge level of Cj affect the knowledge level of Ci. For example, in the field of algorithms, if a learner knows how to calculate an average in an iterative structure with <b>concrete</b> <b>number</b> of loops, it implies that s/he knows also how to calculate a sum in an iterative structure with no <b>concrete</b> <b>number</b> of loops, since calculating an average incorporates calculating the corresponding sum. Similarly, if a student excels at calculating a sum in an iterative structure with no <b>concrete</b> <b>number</b> of loops, it implies that s/he knows partly how to calculate an average in an iterative structure with <b>concrete</b> <b>number</b> of loops, since calculating the sum is the base for calculating an average. However, these two domain concepts do not affect each other in the same degree. The knowledge level of calculating an average in an iterative structure with <b>concrete</b> <b>number</b> of loops affects 100 % (the value of the corresponding arc is 1) the knowledge level of calculating a sum in an iterative structure with no <b>concrete</b> <b>number</b> of loops, while the knowledge level of calculating a sum in an iterative structure with no <b>concrete</b> <b>number</b> of loops affects 80 % (the value of the corresponding arc is 0.8) the knowledge level of calculating an average in an iterative structure with <b>concrete</b> <b>number</b> of loops.

In this work we propose {{a wide variety}} of other approaches to building efficient MACs, without going through a PRF first. In particular, unlike deterministic PRF-based MACs, where each message has a unique valid tag, we give a number of probabilistic MAC constructions from various other primitives/assumptions. Our main results are summarized as follows: • We showseveralnew probabilisticMAC constructionsfromavarietyofgeneralassumptions, including CCA-secure encryption, Hash Proof Systems and key-homomorphic weak PRFs. By instantiating these frameworks under <b>concrete</b> <b>number</b> theoretic assumptions, we get several schemes which are more efficient than just using a state-of-the-art PRF instantiation under the corresponding assumption. For example, we obtain elegant DDH-based MACs with much shorter keys than the quadratic-sized key of the Naor-Reingold PRF. We also show that several natural (probabilistic) digital signature schemes, such as those by Boneh-Boyen and Waters, can be significantly optimized when “downgraded ” into a MAC, both i...|$|E
40|$|Level of {{representativeness}} {{of electoral}} systems have polarised the academia between the Proportional Representation (PR) and First-Past-the-Post (FPTP). The UK {{is one of}} the few examples in Europe that uses FPTP as an electoral system and it has heavily been criticised by the scholars about the lack of representativeness of such system. The 2010 General elections have triggered the debate on the level of representativeness when Liberal Democrats could not obtain the expected number of seats when compared to the vote they have won. The 2015 General election have resulted in the traditional way of having two parties dominating the parliament, but this time UKIP obtained 12 % but only 1 seat, which is an example of disproportionality. This paper also calculates the possible outcome of 2015 elections if the UK was using PR as a system.
