Among his <b>childhood</b> <b>memories</b> was finding a lynched man hanged from a tree while walking in the woods near his home.

50|$|<b>Childhood</b> <b>memory</b> {{refers to}} <b>memories</b> formed during <b>childhood.</b> Among its other roles, memory {{functions}} to guide present behaviour and to predict future outcomes. <b>Memory</b> in <b>childhood</b> is qualitatively and quantitatively {{different from the}} memories formed and retrieved in late adolescence and the adult years. <b>Childhood</b> <b>memory</b> research is relatively recent {{in relation to the}} study of other types of cognitive processes underpinning behaviour. Understanding the mechanisms by which <b>memories</b> in <b>childhood</b> are encoded and later retrieved has important implications in many areas. Research into <b>childhood</b> <b>memory</b> includes topics such as <b>childhood</b> <b>memory</b> formation and retrieval mechanisms in relation to those in adults, controversies surrounding infantile amnesia and the fact that adults have relatively poor <b>memories</b> of early <b>childhood,</b> the ways in which school environment and family environment influence memory, {{and the ways in which}} memory can be improved in childhood to improve overall cognition, performance in school, and well-being, both in childhood and in adulthood.|$|R

The middle child of seven, she has four brothers and two sisters. After moving from one army base to another, Adams' family settled in Castle Rock, Colorado, when she was eight years old. After leaving the army, her father sang professionally in nightclubs and restaurants. She has described going to her father's shows and drinking Shirley Temples at the bar as among her fondest <b>childhood</b> <b>memories.</b> The family had limited financial means, but they camped and hiked together, and would put up amateur skits that were usually written by her father, and sometimes by her mother.

5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy <b>childhood</b> <b>memories.</b> Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E

5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his <b>Childhood</b> <b>Memories,</b> Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the <b>childhood</b> <b>memories</b> are revealed.|$|E
