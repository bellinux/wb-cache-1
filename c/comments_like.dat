[...] Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: [...] "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that— and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout <b>comments</b> <b>like,</b> 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well'...

[...] A 3:15 edited {{version of the}} song without the added audience noises was released as a single, {{but it did not}} appear on the record charts. [...] The song continues to be a highlight of the group's shows and the album version has become a staple of album-oriented rock and classic rock radio. [...] It has become so identified with Aerosmith, that when Jeff Beck (whose 1965 and 1966 recordings with the Yardbirds inspired Tyler and Perry) occasionally performs it, he often hears <b>comments</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Hey, I like your angle on the Aerosmith tune".|$|E

They [...] don't want me as their king, but I'll be back as their leader." [...] He was reported as saying that [...] "it would be a tragic thing for the world if Hitler was overthrown". <b>Comments</b> <b>like</b> these reinforced the belief that the Duke and Duchess held Nazi sympathies and the effect of the abdication crisis of 1936 was to force off the throne a man with extreme political opinions. Claims that Edward would have been a threat or that he was removed by a political conspiracy to dethrone him remain speculative and [...] "persist largely because since 1936 the contemporary public considerations have lost most of their force and so seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation for the King's departure".|$|E
500|$|The Pounds {{settled in}} Paris in January 1921, and {{several months later}} moved into an {{inexpensive}} apartment at 70 bis [...] Pound became friendly with Marcel Duchamp, Tristan Tzara, Fernand Léger and others of the Dada and Surrealist movements, as well as Basil Bunting, Ernest Hemingway and his wife, Hadley Richardson. He {{spent most of his}} time building furniture for his apartment and bookshelves for the bookstore Shakespeare and Company, and in 1921 the volume Poems 1918–1921 was published. In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of The Waste Land, then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound, who blue-inked the manuscript with <b>comments</b> <b>like</b> [...] "make up yr. mind..." [...] and [...] "georgian". Eliot wrote: [...] "I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Human Nature" [...] also {{received}} nine official remixes clocking {{a total of}} 53 minutes and 26 seconds. Most of the remixes turned the R sounding song into a house one. The radio edit omitted the line [...] ""I'm not your bitch/Don't hang your shit on me" [...] but AllMusic's Jose F. Promis felt that the removal made the version repetitive and made it [...] "lack the punchline". The [...] "Runway Club Mix" [...] is stripped down while the [...] "I'm Not Your Bitch Mix" [...] replaced the verse and the chorus with whispered <b>comments</b> <b>like</b> [...] "I have no regrets", [...] "I'm not your bitch", [...] "Deal with it" [...] and [...] "I'm HIV negative" [...] which are added over a much deeper house groove. The hip hop mixes include one clean and one adult rated version. According to Promis, the [...] "Love is the Nature Mix" [...] was the best remix created, describing it as containing [...] "swirling instruments", which converted the song into a dance track.|$|E

David Browne from Entertainment Weekly {{said that it was}} fluid in nature and called Madonna as a [...] "restless soul aching to connect" [...] in the song. Jason Shawhan from About.com also complimented the song by {{describing}} it as a [...] "weird and wonderful number." [...] Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork Media wrote: [...] "On 'Get Together', as Price's synths ebb and flow moodily, Madonna asks the eternal question, 'Do you believe in love at first sight?', over a tripping vocal melody." [...] Joan Morgan of The Village Voice wrote: [...] "The momentum builds rapidly with a seamless transition into the wicked alchemy of 'Get Together', where Madge and Price offer up an irresistible manipulation of rather sweet vocals laced over thumping percussion, seductive synthesizers, and a few subtle soul-claps thrown in for good measure." ...|$|E
500|$|Hergé did {{not make}} use of speech bubbles to convey into the comic, an {{innovation}} that was yet to become widespread in Europe, and instead his captions were accompanied by captions of three to five lines long. He would begin to add simple speech bubbles into the series, stating simple <b>comments</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Eureka!", [...] "Bang!", and [...] "Hip! Hip! Hip! Hurrah!". Hergé later noted that [...] "From time to time... I risked a timid question mark, or perhaps a few stars, when, for example, a character was punched. I must have seen that in L'Éatant or Les Belles Images, the illustrated papers of the time." [...] Hergé had come {{under the influence of}} other comic strips, such as those of the French author Alain Saint-Ogan, and British comic magazine The Rainbow. He was also influenced by the contemporary American comics that reporter Léon Degrelle had sent back to Belgium from Mexico, where he was stationed to report on the Cristero War. These American comics included George McManus's Bringing Up Father, George Herriman's Krazy Kat and Rudolph Dirks's Katzenjammer Kids.

500|$|School Library Journal notes that, [...] " [...] catchy songs hook K-12 {{students}} {{in a way that}} textbooks can't." [...] A reporter for The Wall Street Journal visited classrooms where Flocabulary was being used and remarked that, [...] "When third-grade teachers asked questions about the videos and vocabulary, the problem wasn’t getting children to raise their hands, but to put them down." [...] A reporter for FastCompany writes that [...] "As a lesson supplement, it gets the job done —not every memory tool inspires <b>comments</b> <b>like</b> [...] "JAMMIN" [...] on YouTube." [...] BuzzFeed called a series of Flocabulary videos created for Black History Month, [...] "the coolest way to teach." [...] Academics Howard Zinn and Cornel West endorsed Hip-Hop U.S. History. Menchville High reported that use of Flocabulary increased SAT scores from 420 to 477, though the principle said the school can't verify to what extent Flocabulary did or didn't have an influence. A study conducted across six US states by former International Reading Association president Roger Farr demonstrated improvement in reading and writing skills among middle schools students who studied with Flocabulary.

500|$|On 31 July 2009, Digital Spy {{conducted}} a poll asking {{if it was}} [...] "time to move on" [...] from Ianto. However, a week later the website did not immediately publish the results, announcing [...] "unfortunately it seems that this particular Poll {{was the subject of}} a campaign by diehard fans to distort the outcome". Neil Wilkes opined that this action by the fans [...] "suggests the answer to the question 'Have people overreacted to Ianto's death?' is quite obvious". Later, a footnote amendment noted that 31.4% said it was time to move on, [...] "while the remainder demanded RTD's head on a plate", a reference to his own wording of the original poll, which gave readers the option of moving on from Ianto, or the executive producer's head on a plate. James McCarthy of Wales Online described the reaction from some fans as [...] "sickening" [...] and quoted [...] "crazed" [...] fans on DeviantArt and Facebook who made explicit death threats against the Children of Earth writers. Gareth David-Lloyd stated he was very disappointed in those fans, whose message board conduct he does not support at all and called [...] "completely unacceptable". David-Lloyd added that he [...] "would hope the writers would be able to ignore <b>comments</b> <b>like</b> that". A number of fans were upset by the tone of the first Wales Online article, and their response prompted a follow up from McCarthy. In their comments, fans pointed out that his article disproportionately highlights what they called the [...] "ill-conceived, knee-jerk reactions" [...] of a few individuals, and stressed that these reactions in no way represent the movement to bring Ianto Jones back, which they hold as fundamentally respectful towards the show's actors and writers. Fans have distanced themselves from the small minority of extremists, and have been keen to stress their peaceful activism, described as [...] "thousands of fans who are raising money for charity, sending polite letters, and doing what we can to be supportive of the character and actor". In 2010, Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat told fans who contacted him that he wouldn't want to resurrect Ianto even if he could: [...] "Not reversing it. Stop asking." [...] In a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live Interview with writer John Fay, 70% of respondents replied that the decision to kill Ianto had been the right one, with 19% responding [...] "indifferent" [...] and only 11% stating that it had been the wrong decision, contrasting with the initial fan response. In response to a question, Fay also stated that he had not been affected by the [...] "scary" [...] fan reaction, maintaining that [...] "a universe in which fictional characters aren't 'allowed' to die is ridiculous and limiting".|$|E

40|$|It is {{imperative}} {{for companies to}} engage in social media marketing as consumers are often dependent on online information and electronic word-of-mouth. Past literature claims that consumers evaluate the influence of communications differently on social media than they would in a traditional environment {{because of the nature}} of the internet. This study aims to analyze user’s perceptions of social media marketing influence and determines if user’s perception of influence changes based on the number of social media metrics (<b>likes,</b> <b>comments,</b> and shares) that accompany a Facebook post. The study also investigates if perceptions of influence vary depending on a user’s level of involvement in the situation. A 2 x 2 factorial design is utilized to manipulate both level of involvement and amount of <b>likes,</b> <b>comments,</b> and shares that accompany a Facebook post. The results contend that a high number of <b>likes,</b> <b>comments,</b> and shares on Facebook leads to increased perceptions of source credibility and information usefulness. In particular, the results prove that a high number of <b>likes,</b> <b>comments,</b> and shares on Facebook leads to increased purchase intention in a low-involvement situation. These results are essential to marketers as they prove the importance of curating engaging content on company’s Facebook pages in order to generate high amounts of <b>likes,</b> <b>comments,</b> and shares. Increasing the amount of <b>likes,</b> <b>comments,</b> and shares on Facebook will make the post more influential to users...|$|R
