5|$|Redundant {{staff members}} are often laid off {{as part of}} the {{consolidation}} process, and the sharing of news content reduces the number of unique editorial voices in the market. This in particular is one of the caveats of pushes to ban outsourcing agreements by media consolidation critics, who also suggest that LMAs result in a decreased amount of local news <b>coverage</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brokered station.|$|E

S is adsorbed in atop, bridge, and 4 -fold hollow sites {{on one side}} of the interface in c(2 x 2) and p(1 x 1) arrangements, corresponding to coverages of 1 / 2 and 1 monolayer, respectively. The calculated adhesion energy values at different interfacial separations are fitted to the universal binding energy relation [Rose et al. Phys. Rev. B 1983, 28, 1835], and the effect of <b>the</b> S <b>coverages</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> adhesive strength is analyzed. The effect of relaxation of the interfaces at equilibrium is also investigated, and the resulting interfacial structures and related magnetic and charge density properties are compared...|$|R

5|$|On September 18, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued heavy {{rainfall}} and wind warnings for portions of southern Ontario. A gale warning was also issued for Lake Ontario, eastern Lake Erie, the Saint Lawrence River and Georgian Bay. A news report on September 14 warned conditions could {{be similar to}} the disaster caused by Hurricane Hazel 49years prior, resulting in widespread media <b>coverage</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hurricane. Researchers on a Convair 580 flight studied the structure of Isabel transitioning into an extratropical storm, after two similar studies for Hurricane Michael in 2000 and Tropical Storm Karen in 2001. While flying in a thunderstorm, ice build forced the plane to descend.|$|E
5|$|Population declines of 50% in the Terre Adélie {{region have}} been {{observed}} due to increased adult mortality, especially of males, during an abnormally prolonged warm period in the late 1970s, which resulted in reduced sea-ice <b>coverage.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, egg hatching success rates declined when the sea-ice extent increased.

5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest {{approach to the}} island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous <b>coverage</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was well informed of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm {{and as a result}} of its impact, around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. This included 1,190residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six medical assistance teams, three medical support teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days' worth of food in schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Before the hurricane's arrival, U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency. In St. Croix, 309people rode out the storm in shelters. Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands. There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.|$|E
