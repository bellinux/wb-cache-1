50|$|The older Cronquist system only {{included}} four families (Betulaceae, <b>Corylaceae,</b> Fagaceae, Ticodendraceae; <b>Corylaceae</b> {{now being}} included within Betulaceae); this arrangement is followed by, for example, the World checklist of selected plant families (see external link below). The other families were split into three different orders, placed among the Hamamelidae. The Casuarinales comprised the single family Casuarinaceae, the Juglandales comprised the Juglandaceae and Rhoipteleaceae, and the Myricales comprised the remaining forms (plus Balanops). The change {{is due to}} studies suggesting the Myricales, so defined, are paraphyletic {{to the other two}} groups.|$|E
50|$|Food plants include Salix alba (White Willow), Salix viminalis, Salix caprea, Salix pentandra, Salix cinerea, Salix myrsinifolia, Salix fragilis, Populus nigra (Salicaceae), Corylus avellana (<b>Corylaceae),</b> Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, Alnus incana (Betulaceae).|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{the family}} was often divided into two families, Betulaceae (Alnus, Betula) and <b>Corylaceae</b> (the rest). Recent treatments, {{including}} the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, have described these two groups as subfamilies within an expanded Betulaceae: Betuloideae and Coryloideae. Diagnostically, Betulaceae {{is very similar to}} Rosaceae and other rose motif families.|$|E
50|$|The hazel (Corylus) is a genus of {{deciduous}} {{trees and}} large shrubs {{native to the}} temperate Northern Hemisphere. The genus is usually placed in the birch family Betulaceae, though some botanists split the hazels (with the hornbeams and allied genera) into a separate family <b>Corylaceae.</b> The fruit of the hazel is the hazelnut.|$|E
50|$|While the {{division}} of the extant members of the Betulaceae into six genera is uncontroversial, the placement of these genera into higher taxonomic ranks and the level of these ranks are debated. Extensive studies on the basis of ribulose- 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) sequences, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, morphology, and various combined data sets support the dichotomy of the Betulaceae into two major clades. A few authors have divided the genera into two families, the Betulaceae (Alnus, Betula) and <b>Corylaceae</b> (Carpinus, Ostrya, Corylus, Ostryopsis). Many modern authors recognize two separate clades within the family, either as tribes Betuleae and Coryleae or subfamilies Betuloideae and Coryloideae. There has also been debate on the further division of the Coryloideae into two tribes: Coryleae (Corylus) and Carpineae (Ostryopsis, Carpinus, Ostrya).|$|E

There {{is evidence that the}} prevalence of sensitization to “new” tree pollens (Betulaceae, <b>Corylaceae,</b> Cupressaceae, Taxodiaceae, and other families) is increasing in the recent years in Italy. Allergenic plants are often imported from foreign countries, therefore low-allergenic species must be recognized in order to prevent new pollen sensitizations.

30|$|True truffles, {{belonging}} to the genus Tuber (Tuberaceae, Pezizales, Pezizomycetes), produce hypogeous ascocarps, which are formed in soil or sometimes within layers of leaf litter. They have {{lost the ability to}} actively discharge ascospores (Bonito and Smith 2016). They are symbiotic fungi that develop association with fine roots of specific host trees (T. oregonense Trappe, Bonito and P. Rawl. with Douglas fir) or broad host ranges (T. aestivum (Wulfen:Fr.) Spreng. with some plant species in Betulaceae, <b>Corylaceae,</b> Fagaceae, Tiliaceae, Pinaceae and Cistaceae) (Hall et al. 2007). The unique aroma makes some species greatly sought after as high-end culinary ingredients throughout the world, especially in Europe (Hall et al. 2007). The scarcity and irreplaceably scent of French Périgord black truffle (T. melanosporum Vittad.) and Italian Alba white truffle (T. magnatum Pico.) render them among the most famous and demanding truffles in the world (Hall et al. 2007; Bonito et al. 2010 a).|$|E
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the first edition of Smartweeds to Hazelnuts in 1987, thirteen additional species and one hybrid have been discovered in Illinois. In addition, numerous nomenclatural changes have occurred for plants already known. This second edition updates the status of the Polygonaceae, Hamamelidaceae, Platanaceae, Fagaceae, Betulaceae, and <b>Corylaceae</b> in Illinois. Each of the newly discovered species has been added and is fully illustrated. Updated nomenclature as well as Illinois distributional data are included for each species. In addition to the fourteen new plant illustrations, the appendix contains new information on the descriptions and the geographical locations of plants in the first edition, and revised identification keys. Robert H. Mohlenbrock and Paul M. Thomson Jr. have included a complete description, illustrations showing diagnostic features, distribution maps, and ecological notes for each plant included in this volume.

40|$|Corylus avellana var. avellana (<b>Corylaceae)</b> has a {{widespread}} {{distribution in the}} Central Black Sea Region of Turkey and is very valuable in the food industry and {{plays an important role}} in the economy of the Black Sea Region of Turkey. In this study, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations along a topographical gradient (from sea level to 550 m) and through the growing season (from April to October) were investigated. In addition to this, foliar resorption was also studied as resorption efficiency (RE) and resorption proficiency (RP) which is defined as the proportion of nutrients withdrawn from leaves and the N and P concentrations in senesced leaves, respectively. Statistically significant differences were not found with respect to leaf N concentration and SLA during the growing season although leaf P concentration, leaf N/P ratio and SLA were significantly changed during the growing season. Except for NRE, PRE, ARP, and PRP all of the leaf traits were significantly changed along the topographic gradient. The N/P ratio which is an indicator of N- and P- limitation decreased during the growing season and along the topographic gradient. The N and P concentrations in the senescent leaves of C. avellana was below 50 μg cm- 2 and 3 μg cm- 2, respectively along the topographic gradient and this species is N and P-proficient according to the threshold values. Soil properties along the topographic gradient also changed...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} the single species of Canacomyrica (hitherto not studied) shows that it belongs in Myricaceae, {{although}} it differs from other genera in several respects (axial parenchyma grouped in bands or columns as well as diffuse; Heterogeneous Type I rays; more numerous bars per perforation plate). The latter two features are primitive for the family. The four genera (Canacomyrica. Comptonia, Morella, and Myrica s. s.) differ from each other not only by qualitative features but by quantitative features (feature means in genera mostly non- overl apping). Wood of Comptonia and Myri ca s. s. lacks chambered crystals in axial parenchyma and ray crystals. Wood of Myrica s. s. has tracheids in latewood but fiber-tracheids in earl ywood. Diagnostic generic summaries are presented. Features of Myricaceae such as scalarifom perforation plates, presence of (true) tracheids, ray types, chambered encapsulated crystals in axial parenchyma, and bark anatomy correspond with character states and expressions in Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, <b>Corylaceae,</b> Juglandaceae (including Rhoipteleaceae), Ticodendraceae and, to a lesser extent, Fagaceae and Nothofagaceae. This grouping of families can be found as Fagales in recent DNA trees. The predominance of tracheids in basal Fagales such as Myricaceae and Ticodendraceae suggests that origin of vasicentric tracheids which occur in combination with libriform fibers in Fagaceae {{is the product of}} tracheid dimorphism. Low imperforate tracheid length to vessel element length ratios (FN ratios) in Myricaceae are a probable indication of wood primitiveness. Quantitative vessel features of Myricaceae, as combined in Mesomorphy Ratio values, characterize wood of Myricaceae as a whole, but at the species level such values correspond to respective habitats; notably high vessel density in Comptonia may represent greater conductive safety appropriate to relatively dry habitats...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Air {{pollution}} {{can cause}} respiratory symptoms or exacerbate pre-existing respiratory diseases, especially in children. This study {{looked at the}} short-term association of air pollution concentrations with Emergency Room (ER) admissions for respiratory reasons in pediatric age (0 – 18 years). Methods Daily number of ER admissions in a children’s Hospital, concentrations of urban-background PM 2. 5, NO 2, O 3 and total aeroallergens (<b>Corylaceae,</b> Cupressaceae, Gramineae, Urticaceae, Ambrosia, Betula) were collected in Turin, northwestern Italy, for the period 1 / 08 / 2008 to 31 / 12 / 2010 (883  days). The associations between exposures and ER admissions were estimated, at time lags between 0 and 5  days, using generalized linear Poisson regression models, adjusted for non-meteorological potential confounders. Results In the study period, 21, 793 ER admissions were observed, mainly (81  %) for upper respiratory tract infections. Median air pollution concentrations were 22. 0, 42. 5, 34. 1  μg/m 3 for urban-background PM 2. 5, NO 2, and O 3, respectively, and 2. 9 grains/m 3 for aeroallergens. We found that ER admissions increased by 1. 3  % (95 % CI: 0. 3 - 2. 2  %) five days after a 10  μg/m 3 increase in NO 2, and by 0. 7  % (95 % CI: 0. 1 - 1. 2  %) one day after a 10 grains/m 3 increase in aeroallergens, while they were not associated with PM 2. 5 concentrations. ER admissions were negatively associated with O 3 and aeroallergen concentrations at some time lags, but these association shifted to the null when meteorological confounders were adjusted for in the models. Conclusions Overall, these findings confirm adverse short-term health effects of air pollution on the risk of ER admission in children and encourage a careful management of the urban environment to health protection...|$|E
40|$|The Mount Jinggangshan {{region is}} located between Jiangxi and Hunan provinces in southeastern China {{in the central}} section of the Luoxiao Mountains. A {{detailed}} investigation of Mount Jinggangshan region shows that the seed plant flora comprises 2, 958 species in 1, 003 genera and 210 families (Engler's system adjusted according to Zhengyi Wu's concept). Among them, 23 species of gymnospermae belong to 17 genera and 9 families, and 2, 935 species of angiosperms are in 986 genera and 201 families. Moreover, {{they can also be}} sorted into woody plants (350 genera and 1, 295 species) and herbaceous plants (653 genera and 1, 663 species). The dominant families are mainly Fagaceae, Lauraceae, Theaceae, Hamamelidaceae, Magnoliaceae, Ericaceae, Styracaceae, Aquifoliaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Aceraceae, Rosaceae, <b>Corylaceae,</b> Daphniphyllaceae, Symplocaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Pinaceae, Taxodiaceae, Cupressaceae and Taxaceae. Ancient and relic taxa include Ginkgo biloba, Fokieniahodginsii, Amentotaxusargotaenia, Disanthuscercidifolia subsp. longipes, Hamamelismollis, Manglietiafordiana, Magnoliaofficinalis, Tsoongiodendronodorum, Fortuneariasinensis, Cyclocaryapaliurus, Eucommiaulmoides, Sargentodoxacuneata, Bretschneiderasinensis, Camptothecaacuminata, Tapisciasinensis, etc. The flora of Mount Jinggangshan region includes 79 cosmopolitan genera and 924 non-cosmopolitan genera, which are 7. 88 % and 92. 12 % of all genera. The latter includes 452 tropical genera (48. 92 %) and 472 temperate genera (51. 08 %). The temperate elements include 44 genera endemic to China, accounting for 4. 76 % of all genera. Among 1, 003 genera, 465 have only a single species and 401 are oligotypic genera (with 2 - 5 species). These genera account for 86. 34 % of all genera. The floristic analysis indicates that the flora of Mount Jinggangshan region is closely related to the flora of Mount Wuyishan region in southeastern China. The flora of Mount Jinggangshan region also contains many elements of central and southern China. Mount Jinggangshan region is an important north-south floristic passageway and is also a boundary between the floras of eastern, central and south China...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of long-term {{observations of the}} arach-noentomofauna of birch stands in {{the conditions of the}} forest district Sněžník (Děčín) was to evaluate the indi-vidual animal groups attracted to these forest ecosystems that were established in the disturbed site conditions. We were already engaged with spiders (KULA 1997 g), bugs (KULA 1999 b), ground beetles (KULA 1997 e), rove bee-tles (KULA 1997 f), weevils (KULA 1990 / 1991), butterflies (KULA 1997 a,b,c, 1999 a) and syrphids (KULA 1997 h; KULA, SCHOLZ 1995; KULA, LÁSKA 1997) and now it is the turn of leafhoppers. The most abundant numbers of leafhoppers live in fields and meadows, in steppes and in broad-leaved for-ests. Coniferous forests are relatively poor in leafhoppers. Monophagous species are mostly arboricolous while the oligophagous species are attracted to grasslands; some of them belong to polyphagous species. VIDANO and ARZONE (1987 a,b,c) studied the ecology and ethology as well as the feeding habits of leafhoppers on <b>Corylaceae,</b> Fagaceae, Betulaceae and alder. MATERIAL AND METHODS Leafhoppers were studied systematically in birch stands (Betula pendula Roth) of the forest district Sněžník during the entire vegetation period (April–October) in 1988 – 1998 applying the method of shaking down, photoeclectors and ground traps. In 14 -day intervals the crown leafhoppers were shaken down onto 2 × 2 m sheets from five trees of each of the 6 birch stands. The individual specimens abandoning the soil and, as a rule, bound to the herb layer, were controlled in 7 -day intervals using photoeclectors. Before the onset of the vegetation period, seven 1 m 2 photoeclectors were placed under the birch crowns in 6 birch stands. The material that was collected in 7 -day intervals from 10 ground traps in each area was included in the evaluations. In the course of 11 years we collected 2, 745 imagoes and larvae of leafhoppers from the tree crowns, 11, 897 from the photoeclectors and 9, 213 leafhoppers from the ground traps. Our sincere thanks go to Dr. JIŘÍ DLABOLA, CSc., for his great willingness to help determine such a huge amount of material. However, not all the larvae species were determined, only the genus and family. In the tables these data are listed in the column “others”...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} biological component of ambient air is pollen, and its allergens {{are the main}} cause of airborne allergic respiratory diseases (1). In Europe, emissions of some air pollutants have decreased over past decades (2). Nevertheless, this does not always produce a corresponding drop in atmospheric concentrations, especially for particulate matter and ozone, which have significant impact on human health (2). Chemical air pollutants and anthropogenic aerosols can alter the impact of allergenic pollen, while pollen production rises in higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (3, 4). Changes in plant flowering season due to climate change will probably result in an increase in the duration and severity of the pollen season, alongside a higher frequency of episodes of urban air pollution (1). Therefore, exacerbations of allergic respiratory diseases will have a more pronounced effect in coming decades (5). In this context, AIS LIFE project ([URL] aims to develop an information base, to enable policy-makers dealing with environment and health issues to better manage pollen-related allergic respiratory diseases, {{improve the quality of life}} of patients suffering from them, reduce health system costs, and increase awareness among sufferers of pollen-related allergic respiratory diseases. Expected results: Establishment and consolidation of a multidisciplinary, transnational network of experts, with particular attention to pollen-related allergic respiratory health; implementation and dissemination of an Integrated Information System (IIS) and an enhanced Personalised Information Systems (PPI) in Italy, France and Austria; the widening of the Tuscan monitoring network for aerobiological components, by activating a sampling station in Pisa (Italy); educational campaigns (Italy, France and Austria) on the use of the Aerobiological Information System (AIS), promotion of improved lifestyles, and prevention of respiratory allergic diseases; raised awareness concerning the effects of interactions between pollens and chemicals on allergic symptoms across Europe, to guide environmental and health policy decisions. The aerobiological monitoring is in function since 1 st June 2014 in Italy, France and Austria, with the continuous collecting of the data on the {{most important}} allergenic botanical families and fungal spores: Asteraceae, Betulaceae, <b>Corylaceae,</b> Cupressaceae - Taxaceae, Fagaceae, Oleaceae, Platanaceae, Poaceae, Urticaceae and Alternaria.
