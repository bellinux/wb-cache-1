40|$|Maturation of the {{developing}} renal glomerulus with respect to basement membrane proteoglycans. Maturation of extracellular matrices in relation to heparan sulfate proteoglycans was investigated during glomerular development. Antibodies directed against the core–protein (Mr = 18, 000) of the basement membrane heparan sulfate–proteoglycan were utilized. The IgG fraction of the antibodies was conjugated with either fluorescein or rhodamine or 125 I-iodine. The fluoresceinated and radioiodinated antibodies were given intravenously to three–day–old rats; their kidneys were obtained 6, 48, and 120 hours later and processed for immunohistochemical and tissue autoradiographic studies. At six hours (day 0), matrices of all the stages were labeled. The labeling was lowest in the vesicle stage and highest in the <b>capillary</b> <b>stage.</b> The autoradiographic grain–densities of vesicle, S-shaped, precapillary, and capillary stages were 10. 62 ± 0. 54, 7. 44 ± 0. 65, 11. 37 ± 1. 03, and 18. 35 ± 1. 97, respectively. After 48 hours (day 5), the grain–density for S-shaped body decreased from 7. 44 ± 0. 65 to 4. 38 ± 0. 61, while no appreciable change in the precapillary and capillary stages was observed. At this time interval, the fluorescein–labeled glomeruli were seen in the deeper cortex only. After 120 hours (day 8), the grain–density for the <b>capillary</b> <b>stage</b> decreased from 18. 35 ± 1. 97 to 2. 82 ± 0. 92. The double–labeling experiments included a second injection of rhodaminated antibody at 48 hours (day 5). In these experiments, newly developed glomeruli of varying stages were seen in the superficial cortex. With the use of double filters, the immature glomeruli in the superficial cortex and mature ones in the deeper cortex were visualized. These data indicate the following: (a) during development, there is a concomitant appearance of extracellular matrices and proteoglycans; (b) the concentration of proteoglycans, as {{measured in terms of}} absolute number of autoradiographic grains, seems to rise dramatically at the time of epithelial–mesenchymal cells interaction, that is, at the S-shaped body stage; and (c) removal of the antibody bound to the core–protein or, alternatively, the turnover of the core–peptide of proteoglycan appears to be of a few days' duration...|$|E
40|$|The site of {{cellular}} synthesis of glomerular proteoglycans {{was investigated in}} developing glomeruli of 4 - to 5 -day-old rats. [35 S]Sulfate was administered intravenously and animals were sacrificed 15 min to 12 hr later. The outermost layers of the kidney cortices were utilized for characterization of proteoglycans and electron microscopic autoradiography. Sepharose CL- 6 B chromatography and cellulose acetate electrophoresis revealed that most (approximately equal to 96 %) of the radioactivity was associated with heparan sulfate-proteoglycan synthesized during maturation of glomerular capillaries. Tissue autoradiography revealed the following: (i) during the S-shaped body stage, there is rapid incorporation of [35 S]sulfate by mesenchymal cells into the cleft region (site for development of future glomerular extracellular matrices); (ii) during the precapillary stage, mesenchyme-derived cells showed higher incorporation of radioisotope than did epithelial cells; and (iii) during the mature <b>capillary</b> <b>stage,</b> all glomerular cell types (mesangial, endothelial, and epithelial) incorporated [35 S]sulfate, incorporation by mesangial cells being the greatest. Radiolabeling was also higher in the mesangial matrix than in {{the glomerular basement membrane}} of peripheral capillary loops. Synthesis of a single major species of sulfated glycosaminoglycan by cells of different embryologic origin may be unique to glomerular capillaries...|$|E
40|$|Many speleothems can be {{assigned}} to one of two morphological groups: massive speleothems, which consist of compact bulks of material, and coralloids, which are domal to digitate in form. Faster growth on protrusions of the substrate occurs in the typical growth layers of coralloids (where those layers are termed “coralloid accretions”), but it is not observed in the typical layers of massive speleothems, which in contrast tend to smoothen the speleothem surface (and can therefore be defined as “smoothing accretions”). The different growth rates on different areas of the substrate are explainable by various mechanisms of CaCO 3 deposition (e. g., differential aerosol deposition, differential CO 2 and/or H 2 O loss fromacapillary filmof solution, deposition in subaqueous environments). To identify the causes of formation of coralloids rather than massive speleothems, this article provides data about δ 13 C and δ 18 O at coeval points of both smoothing and coralloid accretions, examining the relationship between isotopic composition and the substratemorphology. In subaerial speleothems, data showenrichment in heavy isotopes both along the direction ofwater flow and toward the protrusions. The first effect is due toH 2 OevaporationandCO 2 degassing during a gravity-driven flowof water (gravity stage) and is observed in smoothing accretions; the second effect is due to evaporation and degassing duringwatermovement by capillary action from recesses to prominences (<b>capillary</b> <b>stage)</b> and is observed in subaerial coralloids. Both effects coexist in smoothing accretions interspersed among coralloid ones (intermediate stage). Thus this study supports the origin of subaerial coralloids from dominantly capillary water and disproves their origin by deposition of aerosol fromthe cave air. On the other hand, subaqueous coralloids seem to form by a differential mass-transfer from a still bulk of water toward different zones of the substrate along diffusion flux vectors of nutrients perpendicular to the iso-depleted surfaces. Finally, this isotopic method has proved useful to investigate the controls on speleothem morphology and to obtain additional insights on the evolution of aqueous solutions inside caves...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Congenital {{nephrotic}} syndrome of the Finnish type (NPHS 1, CNF) is an autosomal recessive disease that affects 1 : 8000 newborns in Finland. NPHS 1 is characterised by heavy proteinuria already in utero and typical signs of {{nephrotic syndrome}} (NS) are present at or soon after birth. Due to the evident absence of extrarenal symptoms, NPHS 1 {{has been considered}} a model disease for NS. In this study, the NPHS 1 locus on chromosome 19 q 13. 1 was sequenced and analysed with computer programs to identify new genes in the region. Genes were further characterised and sequenced from NPHS 1 patient samples, {{as well as from}} controls. Analysis of the data resulted in the identification of the affected gene with two mutations that were found to explain 94 % of the Finnish NPHS 1 cases. The NPHS 1 gene was found to encode a novel single-pass transmembrane protein, termed nephrin, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. The NPHS 1 gene was cloned and recombinant nephrin fragments were produced in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems. These fragments were used to raise antibodies that were utilized to characterise the spatial and temporal expression of nephrin in kidney glomeruli. Nephrin was localised by electron microscopy (EM) in ladder-like structures of the early junctional complexes of developing columnar podocytes at the <b>capillary</b> <b>stage.</b> In mature glomeruli, nephrin was localised to the slit diaphragm (SD) between adjacent glomerular podocyte foot processes. In order to investigate the more general involvement of nephrin in proteinuric disease, its expression was studied in primary acquired NS by immunofluorescence microscopy. The level of nephrin expression was found to be significantly reduced in membranous glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease and in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The known effects of nephrin mutations, together with the structure predicted from its sequence and localisation of the protein to the SD, emphasizes its indispensable role in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. The glomerular basement membrane has long been considered to possess the size-selective filtration property of the filtration barrier. However, the identification of nephrin in the SD, as well as its alterations in proteinuria, has led us to reconsider SD as the final decisive size-selective filter...|$|E
40|$|Summary: We {{report a}} {{transgenic}} mouse line that expresses Cre recombinase exclusively in podocytes. Twenty- four transgenic founders were generated in which Cre recombinase was {{placed under the}} regulation of a 2. 5 -kb fragment of the human NPHS 2 promoter. Previously, this fragment was shown to drive beta-galactosidase (Β-gal) expression exclusively in podocytes of transgenic mice. For analysis, founder mice were bred with ROSA 26 mice, a reporter line that expresses Β-gal in cells that undergo Cre recombination. Eight of 24 founder lines were found to express Β-gal exclusively in the kidney. Histological analysis of the kidneys showed that Β-gal expression was confined to podocytes. Cre recombination occurred during the <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> in glomerular development.

40|$|Glomerular endothelial {{cells and}} podocytes jointly {{synthesize}} laminin- 1 and - 11 chains. BackgroundThe {{glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM) originates in development from fusion of subendothelial and subepithelial matrices. Subsequently, newly synthesized subepithelial matrix is added as glomerular capillary loops expand. During GBM assembly, the laminin- 1 heterotrimer (α 1, β; 1, and γ 1 chains), initially expressed in vascular clefts of comma- and S-shaped bodies, is eventually replaced by laminin- 11 (α 5, β; 2, and γ 1 chains), which persists into maturation. The cellular source(s) of these laminins is not known and prompted this study. MethodsTo determine which cells synthesize the various laminin chains, postfixation immunoelectron microscopy of developing mouse kidney was performed using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognized laminin α 1, β; 1, α 5, or β; 2 chains. ResultsIntracellular labeling for laminin α 1, β; 1 (laminin- 1), and α 5 and β; 2 (laminin- 11) chains was observed in developing glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes of comma- and S-shaped nephric figures. Laminin- 1 was also seen in unfused GBMs at this stage, whereas laminin- 11 was only found intracellularly. In <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> GBMs, laminin α 1 chain was completely absent, whereas labeling for laminin α 5 was intense, indicating rapid substitution between α chains. In contrast, laminin β; 1 chain labeling remained strong both intracellularly and in GBMs of <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> glomeruli, and β; 2 was up-regulated as well. In maturing stage glomeruli, β; 1 labeling declined, and α 5 and β; 2 remained at high levels intracellularly in both endothelial cells and podocytes and in GBMs. ConclusionsOur results show that both endothelial cells and podocytes synthesize laminin- 1 and - 11 chains throughout glomerular development. The sustained and comparatively high level of laminin synthesis by endothelial cells was unexpected, suggesting that the endothelium {{may be an important}} source of GBM proteins in glomerular disease...|$|R
40|$|Brain microvasculature plays a {{critical}} role in the regulation of homeostasis of neural tissues. The present study focuses on characteristic microvascular basement membrane (bm) aberrations in the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) and their relation to aging. The PAG can be considered a caudal extension of the limbic system and is a key structure in the regulation of a myriad of autonomic and motor control functions. In an ultrastructural study, morphologic changes in mesencephalic PAG capillaries were assessed in aged and young hamster and compared with those in caudal brainstem areas. Bm aberrations were studied in 1200 capillaries (n = 600 young hamsters; n = 600 aged hamsters). A new, never reported variant of bm degeneration was found that presented itself as foamy-like structures accumulating within the lamina densa of notably PAG capillaries. We classified these foamy structures as ‘spumiform basement membrane degenerations’ (sbmd) in which we could distinguish 4 stages depending on the size and intramembranous localization, ranging from split bm (stage I), intermediate stages II and III, to extensive stage IV, affecting almost the complete capillary bm outline. In the PAG of senescent animals various stages of sbmd were observed in 92 ± 3 % of all <b>capillaries.</b> <b>Stage</b> II was most prominently present (59 %), followed by stage III (20 %), and stage IV (13 %). These bm aberrations were clearly age-dependent because in young animals, only 5 % of the PAG capillaries showed characteristics of sbmd. For comparison, in the pontine reticular formation at the PAG-level, 41 % of the capillaries showed a form of sbmd, but these defects were significantly less severe (stages I–II, 98 %), and caudal brainstem structures displayed no sbmd at all. In addition to sbmd, diffuse endothelial changes, disrupted tight junctions, thickening of the bm, pericyte degeneration, and gliosis were observed in PAG capillaries. It is hypothesized that selective bm permeability of PAG capillaries results in a sequence of bm damage events that start with split bm, gradually changing into more and more extensive sbmd accumulations that eventually almost completely surround the capillary. Progressive sbmd in PAG capillaries might lead to a loss of bloodebrain barrier function and consequently to impairment of autonomic and motor control functions exerted by the PAG. ...|$|R

In mice, starvation upregulated glomerular LAT 3, phosphorylated AKT 1, reconstituted the actin network, and elongated foot processes. In the fetal kidney, we observed intense LAT 3 expression at the <b>capillary</b> loops <b>stage</b> of renal development.

Members of the Eph–ephrin-B family have recently been reported to regulate the paracellular permeability of epithelial cells. In this study, we analyzed the expression and the function of ephrin-B 1 in glomeruli. Using immunofluorescence (IF), we found that ephrin-B 1 was expressed along the glomerular capillary loop. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that ephrin-B 1 expression was restricted at the slit diaphragm. Dual labeled IF showed ephrin-B 1 colocalized with the slit diaphragm proteins nephrin and CD 2 -associated protein. Ephrin-B 1 colocalized with nephrin at the late <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> of kidney development. Additionally, injection of rats with a nephritogenic anti-nephrin antibody (ANA) reduced ephrin-B 1 expression. When podocytes were cultured in vitro, they extruded processes that co-stained for ephrin-B 1 and for CD 2 -associated protein. When these podocytes were treated in culture with small interfering RNA for ephrin-B 1, CD 2 -associated protein was reduced in the processes, with a remaining faint perinuclear staining.

40|$|Nephrin is a cell {{adhesion}} protein {{located at the}} slit diaphragm area of glomerular podocytes. Mutations in nephrin-coding gene (NPHS 1) cause congenital nephrotic syndrome (NPHS 1). We studied the developmental expression of nephrin, ZO- 1 and P-cadherin in normal fetal kidneys and in NPHS 1 kidneys. We used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry at light and electron microscopic levels. Nephrin and zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) were first expressed in late S-shaped bodies. During <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage,</b> nephrin and ZO- 1 localized at the basal margin and in the cell-{{cell adhesion}} sites between developing podocytes, especially in junctions with ladder-like structures. In mature glomeruli, nephrin and ZO- 1 concentrated at the slit diaphragm area. P-cadherin was first detected in ureteric buds, tubules, and vesicle stage glomeruli. Later, P-cadherin was seen at the basal margin of developing podocytes. Fetal NPHS 1 kidneys with Fin-major/Fin-major genotype did not express nephrin, whereas the expression of ZO- 1 and P-cadherin was {{comparable to that of}} control kidneys. Although early junctional complexes proved structurally normal, junctions with ladder-like structures and slit diaphragms were completely missing.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK 5) has been shown to influence several cellular processes in other terminally differentiated cells, in particular neurons. In this study, we examined the role of CDK 5 in podocyte differentiation, proliferation, and morphology. In conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes in culture, CDK 5 increased in association with podocyte differentiation. During mouse glomerulogenesis in vivo, CDK 5 expression was predominantly detected in podocytes from the <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> to maturation and persisted in the podocytes of adult glomeruli. In contrast, CDK 5 was markedly decreased in the proliferating and dedifferentiated podocytes of mice with anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis and in human immunodeficiency virus transgenic mice. p 35, the activator of CDK 5, was also detected in podocytes and the p 35 /CDK 5 complex was active. Cell fractionation studies showed that active p 35 /CDK 5 was mainly localized to the plasma membrane. Specific inhibition of CDK 5 in differentiated cultured podocytes, either pharmacologically or with siRNA, induced shape changes, with cellular elongation and loss of process formation compared to the characteristic arborized phenotype. These data suggest a role for CDK 5 as a regulator of podocyte differentiation, proliferation, and morphology...|$|R

BackgroundPodocyte proliferation is an uncommon response to glomerular injury and its lack may underlie {{the development of}} glomerulosclerosis. However, whether podocytes {{have the capacity to}} enter and finish mitosis and cytokinesis is not known. MethodsThe expression of mitotic cell cycle proteins (phosphorylated Histone 3, Cdc 2, cyclin B 1 and B 2) was examined by immunohistochemistry in kidneys of embryonal mice, transgenic HIV-mice, and rats with experimental membranous nephropathy (passive Heymann nephritis, PHN). Mitotic proteins also were measured by Western blot in glomerular protein from PHN-rats and the activity of mitotic cyclins was quantified by histone kinase assay. ResultsMitotic proteins were increased in embryonal mouse glomeruli during the S- and comma-shaped stages and were absent at the <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> and in mature rodent glomeruli. There was an increase in podocyte expression of Cdc 2, cyclin B 1 and B 2 and phosphorylated histone 3 in PHN rats, and in HIV transgenic mice. ConclusionsPodocytes have the ability to increase cell cycle proteins required for mitosis. Without obvious differences in the expression of the major mitotic proteins in PHN- and HIV-nephropathy, a regulatory disturbance in cytokinesis might be responsible for the development of polynucleated cells and a lack of podocyte proliferation in experimental glomerular disease...|$|R

Given its similarity with the stomatin family proteins, podocin {{is predicted to}} be an integral membrane protein with a single membrane domain forming a hairpin-like structure placing both N- and C-termini in the cytosol. Here, we show by in situ hybridization, that during development, the NPHS 2 transcript is first expressed in mesonephric podocytes from the S-shaped body and, later, in the metanephric kidney, in the future podocytes at the late S-shaped body stage. In the mature kidney, NPHS 2 is exclusively expressed in the podocytes of mature glomeruli. We generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against fusion proteins derived from the N- and the C-terminal regions of podocin which detected a single band of 49 -kd in transfected HEK 293 cell lysates by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. By immunohistology, podocin was detected in podocytes from the early <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> in the developing nephrons, and at the basal pole, along the GBM, in mature glomeruli. By electron microscopy, we demonstrate that podocin is facing the slit diaphragm with its two ends in the cytoplasm of the foot processes, in agreement with its predicted structure.

These animals also develop abnormalities in glomerulogenesis. In both wild-type and mutant animals (lama 3 −/−), podocytes secrete glomerular basement membrane and develop foot processes. Endothelial cells migrate into this scaffolding and secrete a layer of basement membrane that fuses with the one formed by the podocyte. In lama 3 −/− animals, glomerular maturation arrests at this stage. Endothelial cells do not attenuate, develop fenestrae, or form typical lumens, and mesangial cells (MCs) were not identified.

Hypothesizing that deletion of podocyte VHL would result in HIFα hyperstabilization, we crossed podocin promoter-Cre transgenic mice, which express Cre recombinase in podocytes beginning at the <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> of glomerular development, with floxed VHL mice. Vascular patterning and glomerular development appeared unaltered in progeny lacking podocyte VHL. However, urinalysis showed increased albumin excretion by 4 weeks when compared with wild-type littermates with several sever cases (> 1000 μg/ml). Many glomerular ultrastructural changes were seen in mutants, including focal subendothelial delamination and widespread podocyte foot process broadening, and glomerular basement membranes (GBMs) were significantly thicker in 16 -week-old mutants compared with controls. Moreover, immunoelectron microscopy showed ectopic deposition of collagen α 1 α 2 α 1 (IV) in GBM humps beneath podocytes. Significant increases {{in the number of}} Ki- 67 -positive mesangial cells were also found, but glomerular WT 1 expression was significantly decreased, signifying podocyte death and/or de-differentiation. Indeed, expression profiling of mutant glomeruli suggested a negative regulatory feedback loop involving the HIFα prolyl hydroxylase, Egln 3. In addition, the brain oxygen-binding protein, Neuroglobin, was induced in mutant podocytes.

Staining intensity increased with further maturation and was restricted to the visceral epithelial cells. On immunoelectron microscopy, the antigen was seen along the basal and lateral surfaces below occluding junction at the early <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> and later, with the interdigitation of foot processes, became concentrated in the slit pores. At no stage was p 51 seen on the apical surface. p 51 and ZO- 1 were closely localized in the mature glomerulus but arrived at their final positions from opposite directions. p 51 was on basal and podocalyxin was on apical sides of the glomerular epithelium from the S-shaped body stage onwards. Metabolic labeling studies showed that p 51 is actively synthesized during initial glomerular development and that the rate of synthesis declines substantially with maturation. We conclude that p 51 is primarily synthesized during the initial glomerular development, becomes concentrated in the slit pores of mature podocytes, and serves as a basal differentiation marker for podocytes...|$|R

This platform may be of use to generate geometrically defined vascular networks for tissue engineering applications as well as a means to better understand the process of endothelial tubulogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Protein A-gold {{immunocytochemistry}} {{was applied}} {{in combination with}} morphometrical approaches to reveal the alpha 1 (IV), alpha 2 (IV), and alpha 3 (IV) chains of type IV collagen as well as entactin on renal basement membranes, particularly on the glomerular one, during maturation. The results have indicated that a heterogeneity between renal basement membranes appears during the maturation process. In the glomerulus at the <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage,</b> both the epithelial and endothelial cell basement membranes were labeled for the alpha 1 (IV) and alpha 2 (IV) chains of type IV collagen and entactin. After fusion, both proteins were present on the entire thickness of the typical glomerular basement membrane. At later stages, the labeling for alpha 1 (IV) and alpha 2 (IV) chains of type IV collagen decreased and drifted towards the endothelial side, whereas the labeling for the alpha 3 (IV) chain increased and remained centrally located. Entactin remained on the entire thickness of the basement membrane during maturation and in adult stage. The distribution of endogenous serum albumin in the glomerular wall was studied during maturation, as a reference for the functional properties of the glomerular basement membrane. This distribution, dispersed through the entire thickness of the basement membrane at early stages, shifted towards the endothelial side of the lamina densa with maturation, demonstrating a progressive acquisition of the permselectivity. These results demonstrate that modifications in the content and organization of the different constituents of basement membranes occur with maturation and are required {{for the establishment of}} the filtration properties of the glomerular basement membrane...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} glomeruli, laminin α 5 replaces laminin α 1 in the glomerular {{basement membrane}} (GBM) at the <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage,</b> a transition required for glomerulogenesis. To investigate domain-specific functions of laminin α 5 during glomerulogenesis, we produced transgenic mice that express a chimeric laminin composed of laminin α 5 domains VI through I fused to the human laminin α 1 globular (G) domain, designated Mr 51. Transgene-derived protein accumulated in many basement membranes, including the developing GBM. When bred onto the Lama 5 −/− background, Mr 51 supported GBM formation, preventing the breakdown that normally occurs in Lama 5 −/− glomeruli. In addition, podocytes exhibited their typical arrangement in a single cell layer epithelium adjacent to the GBM, but convolution of glomerular capillaries did not occur. Instead, capillaries were distended and exhibited a ballooned appearance, a phenotype similar to that observed in the total absence of mesangial cells. However, here the phenotype could be attributed to the lack of mesangial cell adhesion to the GBM, suggesting that the G domain of laminin α 5 is essential for this adhesion. Analysis of an additional chimeric transgene allowed us to narrow the region of the α 5 G domain essential for mesangial cell adhesion to α 5 LG 3 - 5. Finally, in vitro studies showed that integrin α 3 β 1 and the Lutheran glycoprotein mediate adhesion of mesangial cells to laminin α 5. Our results elucidate a mechanism whereby mesangial cells organize the glomerular capillaries by adhering to the G domain of laminin α 5 in the GBM...|$|R
40|$|Collagen IV {{is a major}} {{component}} of vertebrate basal laminae (BLs). Studies in humans have revealed a family of genes encoding alpha 1 - alpha 6 collagen IV chains and implicated alpha 3 -alpha 6 in disease processes (Goodpasture and Alport syndromes and diffuse leiomyomatosis). To extend studies of these components to an experimentally accessible animal, we cloned cDNAs encoding partial collagen alpha 3, alpha 4, and alpha 5 (IV) chains from the mouse. Ribonuclease protection assays showed that all three genes were expressed at highest levels in kidney and lung; alpha 5 (IV) was also expressed at high levels in heart. We then made antibodies specific for each collagen IV chain. Immunohistochemical studies of several tissues revealed many combinations of collagen IV chains; however, alpha 3 and alpha 4 (IV) were always coexpressed, and only appeared in BLs that were alpha 5 (IV) positive. The alpha 3 -alpha 5 (IV) chains were frequently but not exclusively associated with the S (beta 2) chain of laminin, as were the alpha 1, 2 (IV) collagen chains with laminin B 1 (beta 1). An analysis of developing rat kidney BLs showed that newly formed (S-shaped) nephrons harbored collagen alpha 1 and alpha 2 (IV) and laminin B 1; maturing (<b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage)</b> BLs contained collagen alpha 1 -alpha 5 (IV) and laminin B 1 and S-laminin; and mature glomerular BLs contained mainly collagen alpha 3 -alpha 5 (IV) and S-laminin. Thus, collagen alpha 1 and alpha 2 (IV) and laminin B 1 appear to be fetal components of the glomerular BL, and there is a developmental switch to collagen alpha 3 -alpha 5 (IV) and S-laminin expression...|$|R
40|$|The proliferative {{response}} of podocytes to injury determines the histological phenotype. Moreover, an {{apparent lack of}} podocyte proliferation may underlie the development of glomerulosclerosis. Podocyte proliferation is closely linked with its state of differentiation. However, the mechanisms regulating these processes are not fully elucidated. Because D-type cyclins {{have been shown to}} be important in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation, we examined their expression in podocytes in vitro and in vivo. The glomerular expression of cyclins D 1 and D 3 was examined in vitro in cultured immortalized podocytes by immunostaining and Western blot analysis, and in embryonic mice and rats, the passive Heymann nephritis model of experimental membranous nephropathy in rats, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -transgenic mice. Kidneys from cyclin D 1 knockout mice were also examined. Cyclin D 1 was abundant in cultured proliferating podocytes, but not in quiescent differentiated podocytes. In contrast, cyclin D 3 was abundant in differentiated, but not proliferating podocytes. Cyclin D 1 was expressed in embryonic mouse and rat glomeruli during the S- and comma-shaped stages, and was absent in podocytes at the <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> and in mature rodent glomeruli. Cyclin D 1 protein increased after injury in passive Heymann nephritis rats and in HIV-transgenic mice. Cyclin D 3 was constitutively and specifically expressed in podocytes in normal rodent glomeruli, and decreases during dedifferentiation and proliferation in HIV-transgenic mice. Kidneys from cyclin D 1 −/− mice were normal with the podocytes expressing specific differentiation markers. Cyclin D 1 is not necessary for the terminal differentiation of podocytes, and expression coincides with cell-cycle entry. In contrast, cyclin D 3 expression coincides with podocyte differentiation and quiescence...|$|R

Diagnosis was based on biomicrosopic and fluorescein angiographic findings and the group was determined according to the Gass and Blodi classification. Results: We analyzed eight patients in group 1 A (50 %), two in group 1 B (12. 5 %), and six in group 2 A (37. 5 %). Diverse treatment modalities, such as macular laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, intravitreal antiangiogenic agent, and steroid injection, were applied for macular edema in nine eyes; however, only two eyes showed visual improvement.

40|$|Molecular cloning, expression, and {{distribution}} of glomerular epithelial protein 1 in developing mouse kidney. BackgroundGlomerular epithelial protein 1 (GLEPP 1) is a receptor-like membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) with a large ectodomain consisting of multiple fibronectin type III repeats, a single transmembrane segment, and a single cytoplasmic phosphatase active site sequence. In adult human and rabbit kidneys, GLEPP 1 is found exclusively on apical membranes of podocytes and especially on surfaces of foot processes. Although neither ligand nor function for this protein is known, other RPTPs with similar topologies have been implicated in mediating adherence behavior of cells. MethodsTo evaluate potential roles of GLEPP 1 further, we cloned the full-length mouse GLEPP 1 cDNA and examined its expression patterns in developing kidney by Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence microscopy. ResultsNucleotide sequencing showed that mouse GLEPP 1 was approximately 80 % identical to rabbit and human GLEPP 1 and approximately 91 % identical at the amino acid level. The membrane-spanning and phosphatase domains of mouse GLEPP 1 shared> 99 % homology with PTPφ, a murine macrophage cytoplasmic phosphatase. Northern analysis identified a single GLEPP 1 transcript of approximately 5. 5 kb in fetal kidney that became approximately threefold more abundant in adults. In situ hybridization of newborn mouse kidney revealed GLEPP 1 mRNA in visceral epithelial cells (developing podocytes) of comma- and S-shaped nephric figures, and expression increased in capillary loop and maturing stage glomeruli. Beginning on embryonic day 14, GLEPP 1 protein was first observed on cuboidal podocytes of <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage</b> glomeruli, but nascent podocytes of earlier comma- and S-shaped nephric figures were negative. At later stages of glomerular maturation, where foot process elongation and interdigitation occurs, GLEPP 1 immunolabeling intensified on podocytes and then persisted at high levels in fully developed glomeruli. ConclusionOur {{findings are consistent with}} a role for GLEPP 1 in mediating and maintaining podocyte differentiation specifically...|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{stage of the}} mouse embryo at which capillaries first occurred and their localisation in the neuroepithelium were investigated on serial sections of 9 and 10 days old embryos embedded in paraffin and Epon. In addition, areas of the neuroepithelium in which capillaries had been observed at the light microscopical level were investigated by electron microscopy carried out on embryos fixed with glutaraldehyde supplemented with tannic acid. In 5 - 7 microns serial sections of paraffin-embedded embryos, capillaries were initially seen in the CNS anlage at Theiler's Stage 14 (1972). At this <b>stage,</b> <b>capillaries</b> also occurred in the prosencephalon, the rhombencephalon and in the developing spinal cord. In 1 micron serial sections of resin-embedded embryos, capillaries could be identified in the neuroepithelium one stage earlier, i. e. at Stage 13. These very early capillaries were seen in the dorsal part of the lateral wall of the prosencephalon which later forms the diencephalon. At the ultrastructural level, those areas of the neuroepithelium in which leptomeningeal capillaries first started to spread into the neuroepithelium were characterised by {{the disintegration of the}} basement membrane of the neuroepithelium and the appearance of tannic acid-positive extracellular structures between the neuroepithelium and the adjacent leptomeningeal capillaries...|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{sclerosis}} is {{a disease}} hallmarked by microangiopathy; the enlargement and leakage of skin <b>capillaries</b> in active <b>stages</b> develops into extensive avascular areas, clinically associated with severe tissue hypoxia {{and the formation of}} digital ulcers. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is upregulated in all stages of the disease, with little effect on efficient neovascularization. The oxygen-regulated alpha-subunit of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor- 1 (HIF- 1 alpha) represents a key mechanism involved in the transcriptional regulation of VEGF. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate expression of the oxygen-regulated alpha-subunit of HIF- 1 and VEGF in naive scleroderma patients. For this purpose, skin biopsies (dorsal hand surface) from scleroderma patients were analyzed and compared with control skin biopsies. Immunoreactivity for VEGF was enhanced in scleroderma patients, in contrast to restricted positive immunostaining in suprabasal keratinocytes observed in normal skin. In a similar fashion, all skin biopsies from scleroderma patients were strongly HIF- 1 alpha reactive, compared with rare immunoreactivity observed in normal skin. The pattern was similar in all stages of scleroderma. These observations for the first time directly connect constitutive hypoxia with VEGF upregulation in scleroderma patients. The sequence of events needs to be precisely mapped, and the pro- and antiangiogenic switches which may interfere with efficient tissue neovascularization identified, in order to provide meaningful therapeutic strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibilities}} of a column coupling two-dimensional capillary elec-trophoresis (2 D CE) combined with fiber-based {{diode array detection}} (DAD) for the direct, highly reliable and ultrasensitive quantitative de-termination of quinine in real multicomponent ionic matrices (human urine) are demonstrated in this work. The <b>capillary</b> isotachophoresis (CITP) <b>stage</b> provided an on-line sample pretreatment (elimination of interfering matrix constituents, preseparation and preconcentration of the analyte) before the capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) separ-ation. Due to the large volume (30 mL) sample injection and CITP sample preconcentration, a simple absorbance photometric detection was sufficient for obtaining very low concentration limits of detection (∼ 8. 6 ng/mL). The combination of the different separation mechan-isms (CITP and CZE) resulted in enhanced separation selectivity. This enabled us to obtain a pure analyte zone in the directly injected real samples suitable for qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The spec-tral DAD allowed (i) characterization of the purity (i. e., spectral homo-geneity) of the analyte zone; and (ii) preliminary indication of structurally related compounds (i. e., potential biodegradation products of quinine), via characteristic spectra recorded in intervals of 200 – 800 nm. The CITP–CZE–DAD method was characterized by favorable performance parameters that are suitable for its routine biomedical use. One of the primary benefits of the CITP–CZE–DAD method {{is the possibility of}} performing direct injections of real biological samples while avoiding external sample preparation procedures and, therefore, enhancing the reliability and applicability of analyses and the potential for method automatization and miniaturization...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{stimulation}} is {{a promising}} technology aimed {{to mobilize the}} entrapped non-wetting fluids in the subsurface. The applications include enhanced oil recovery or, alternatively, facilitation of movement of immiscible/partly-miscible gases far into porous media, for example, for CO 2 sequestration. This work is devoted to detailed quantitative studies of the two basic pore-scale mechanisms standing behind seismic stimulation: the mobilization of bubbles or drops entrapped in pore constrictions by capillary forces and the break-up of continuous long bubbles or drops. In typical oil-production operations, oil is produced by the natural reservoir-pressure drive during the primary stage and by artificial water flooding at the secondary <b>stage.</b> <b>Capillary</b> forces act to retain a substantial residual fraction of reservoir oil even after water flooding. The seismic stimulation is an unconventional technology that serves to overcome capillary barriers in individual pores and liberate the entrapped oil by adding an oscillatory inertial forcing to the external pressure gradient. According to our study, the effect of seismic stimulation on oil mobilization is highly dependent on the frequencies and amplitudes of the seismic waves. Generally, the lower the frequency and the larger the amplitude, more effective is the mobilization. To describe the mobilization process, we developed two theoretical hydrodynamics-based models and justified both using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Our theoretical models have a significant advantage over CFD in that they reduce the computational time significantly, while providing correct practical guidance regarding the required field parameters of vibroseismic stimulation, such as the amplitude and frequency of the seismic field. The models also provide important insights into the basic mechanisms governing the vibration-driven two-phase flow in constricted capillaries. In a waterflooded reservoir, oil can be recovered most efficiently by forming continuous streams from isolated droplets. The longer the continuous oil phase under a certain pressure gradient, the more easily it overcomes its capillary barrier. However, surface tension between water and oil causes the typically non-wetting oil, constituting the core phase in the channels, to break up at the pore constriction into isolated beads, which inhibits further motion. The break-up thus counteracts the mobilization. We developed a theoretical model that provides an exact quantitative description {{of the dynamics of}} the oil-snap-off process. It also formulates a purely geometric criterion that controls, based on pore geometry only, whether the oil core phase stays continuous or disintegrates into droplets. Both the theoretical model and the break-criterion have been validated against CFD simulations. The work completed elucidates the basic physical mechanisms behind the enhanced oil recovery by seismic waves and vibrations. This creates a theoretical foundation for the further development of corresponding field technologies...|$|R
40|$|The kidney is {{responsible}} for sieving the circulating blood to eliminate water-soluble waste products and potentially toxic substances from the body. The filtration step occurs in specialized filtration units called glomeruli. Some renal diseases are related to specific glomerular defects, but it is highly likely that the present knowledge gained from previous studies only represents {{a small proportion of}} genes and proteins that have important roles for normal kidney function. To identify other genes with roles for glomerular filtration function, our group developed GlomBase, which is a glomerular transcript database in which over 300 genes are highly glomerulus specific. Among those genes, several genes with highest glomerular expression were chosen for further analysis, but this thesis is mainly based on studies on three of them, dendrin, adenylate cyclase type I (Adcy 1), and Crumbs homolog 2 (Crb 2). Dendrin is a cytosolic protein previously identified only in the brain. However, we localized dendrin in the kidney specifically to the glomerular podocytes. Furthermore, we generated a polyclonal antibody against this novel glomerular protein. We detected that the earliest dendrin expression during glomerular maturation is at the <b>capillary</b> loop <b>stage,</b> and that it is located in the cytoplasmic face of the podocyte slit diaphragm. Unexpectedly, inactivation of the dendrin gene in mouse did not generate any obvious phenotype. Dendrin -/- mice were born at an expected Mendelian ratio and macroscopically all organs appeared normal. By the age of 1. 2 years, no signs of renal impairment have been observed in the dendrin-/- mice. Under kidney challenging conditions, dendrin -/- mice show no difference when compared with dendrin +/+ mice. Even though dendrin {{does not seem to be}} crucial for the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier, we do find two proteins that interact with dendrin, and their biological role in podocyte is still under investigation. These results are out scope of this thesis. Adcy 1 is one out of nine members of the adenylate cyclase protein family which catalyze the formation of the secondary messenger cAMP. cAMP is involved in a wide variety of cellular signaling processes, including regulation of actin cytoskeleton assembly through PKA. Adcy 1 has previously been thought to be expressed only by certain neuronal cells in the brain, but we localized Adcy 1 expression to the glomerular podocytes as well. During glomerulogenesis, the Adcy 1 expression was detected first at the stage when maturing podocytes develop foot processes. To study the role of Adcy 1 gene in the kidney in vivo, we analyzed the kidneys of Adcy 1 -/- mice (mice generatedby other investigators, that without severe phenotype except mild behavioral abnormalities). We found the glomerulogenesis to proceed normally in Adcy 1 -/- mice, and in mature mouse, no signs of renal impairment was detected. However, challenging of the kidney with albumin overload caused severe albuminuria in Adcy 1 -/- mice, whereas wild type mice showed only moderate albumin leakage to the urine. Thus, Adcy 1 may in fact be a susceptibility gene for proteinuria. Crb 2 is yet another novel podocyte specific protein we identified. Its Drosophila homologue Crumbs is an essential component for epithelial cells organizing apicalbasal polarity and adherent junctions. In the mouse, it is expressed only in brain, kidney and heart. In the kidney, it is specifically located in the glomerular podocyte slit diaphragm. Interestingly, inactivation of this gene led to arrest the embryonic development after E 7. 75 and embryonic lethality, which demonstrates the importance of this gene during early embryonic development. The Crb 2 -/- embryos show defects in neuroepithelium and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) at the primitive streak. The function of Crb 2 protein in the glomerulus will be explored later by my colleagues in studies of conditional knockout mice with podocyte specific inactivation of the Crb 2 gene. In summary, the discovery and characterization of novel glomerular genes and proteins presented in this thesis has increased our knowledge of glomerular biology as well as on the role of a glomeral gene in early embryogenesis...|$|R
