5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} {{a trial of}} a special category of bigadv work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive {{and have a great}} scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when <b>CPU</b> <b>core</b> minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the release}} of the first-generation product, some MacBook Air users have complained of CPU lockup caused by overheating. Apple {{released}} a software update in early March 2008 to fix the problem with mixed results: the deactivation of one <b>CPU</b> <b>core</b> was corrected; however, the runaway kernel problem remained for some users. The problem is aggravated by system-intensive tasks such as video playback or video chatting.|$|E
25|$|In theory, real-mode {{applications}} {{could be}} directly executed in 16-bit protected mode if certain rules (newly proposed {{with the introduction}} of the 80286) were followed; however, as many DOS programs did not conform to those rules, protected mode was not widely used until the appearance of its successor, the 32-bit Intel 80386, which was designed to go back and forth between modes easily and to provide an emulation of real mode within protected mode. When Intel designed the 286, it was not designed to be able to multitask real-mode applications; real mode was intended to be a simple way for a bootstrap loader to prepare the system and then switch to protected mode; essentially, in protected mode the 80286 was designed to be a new processor with many similarities to its predecessors, while real mode on the 80286 was offered for smaller-scale systems that could benefit from a more advanced version of the 80186 <b>CPU</b> <b>core,</b> with advantages such as higher clock rates, faster instruction execution (measured in clock cycles), and unmultiplexed buses, but not the 24-bit (16 MB) memory space.|$|E

50|$|Importantly, {{although}} the memory controller in Clarkdale processors is on-package, {{it is on}} a separate die from the <b>CPU</b> <b>cores,</b> and thus has increased latency compared to processor architectures which integrate it on-die with the main <b>CPU</b> <b>cores.</b>|$|R
50|$|OS Efficiency: It is inefficient when {{multiple}} <b>CPU</b> <b>cores</b> are run {{at different}} asynchronous frequencies because this {{could lead to}} possible scheduling issues. With vSMP, the active <b>CPU</b> <b>cores</b> will run at similar frequencies to optimize OS scheduling.|$|R
500|$|Physically, the Dreamcast {{measures}} [...] {{and weighs}} [...] [...] The Dreamcast's main CPU is a two-way 360MIPS superscalar Hitachi SH-4 32-bit RISC clocked at 200MHz with an 8 Kbyte instruction cache and 16 Kbyte data cache and a 128-bit graphics-oriented floating-point unit delivering 1.4GFLOPS. Its 100MHz NEC PowerVR2 rendering engine, {{integrated with the}} system's ASIC, is capable of drawing more than 3 million polygons per second and of deferred shading. Sega estimated that the Dreamcast was theoretically capable of rendering 7 million raw polygons per second, or 6 million with textures and lighting, but noted that [...] "game logic and physics reduce peak graphic performance." [...] Graphics hardware effects include trilinear filtering, gouraud shading, z-buffering, spatial anti-aliasing, per-pixel translucency sorting and bump mapping. The system can output approximately 16.77 million colors simultaneously and displays interlaced or progressive scan video at 640×480 video resolution. Its 67MHz Yamaha AICA sound processor, with a 32-bit ARM7 RISC <b>CPU</b> <b>core,</b> can generate 64 voices with PCM or ADPCM, providing ten times {{the performance of the}} Saturn's sound system. [...] The Dreamcast has 16 MB main RAM, along with an additional 8 MB of RAM for graphic textures and 2 MB of RAM for sound. [...] The system reads media using a 12x speed Yamaha GD-ROM Drive. In addition to Windows CE, the Dreamcast supports several Sega and middleware application programming interfaces. In most regions, the Dreamcast included a removable modem for online connectivity, which was modular for future upgrades. The original Japanese model and all PAL models had a transfer rate of 33.6kbit/s, while consoles sold in the US and in Japan after September 9, 1999 featured a 56 kbit/s dial-up modem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this article, we {{consider}} hybrid architectures that consist of standard <b>CPU</b> <b>cores</b> associated with acceler-ators (such as GPUs). These architectures are increasingly employed in large computing centers. We develop a strategy designed {{to deal with}} hybrid computing architectures from the computing performance and programmability points of view. We focus on hybrid computing clusters that consist of a potentially high number of standard <b>CPU</b> <b>cores</b> com-bined with some accelerators. Although such hardware is increasingly being used, because of related programming difficulties, {{only a small number}} of large applications use all the computing resources of such hybrid systems (i. e. both <b>CPU</b> <b>cores</b> and accelerators). To allow large applications to use both <b>CPU</b> <b>cores</b> and accelerators, we introduce SGPU 2, a runtime system that offers a programming model designed to express the fact that a computation can be performed on both <b>CPU</b> <b>cores</b> and accelerators. We first show how SGPU 2 manages the different computing resources of a hybrid architecture and how it can be used with a classical existing seismic wave propagation code; we then use this simulation code to benchmark SGPU 2.
