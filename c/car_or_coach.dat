25|$|Visiting {{the thermal}} {{features}} of Mount Binuluan, the visitor has {{to travel to}} Bontoc, the capital of Mountain Province, or to Tabuk, the capital of Kalinga province to Pasil or Tinglayan in Kalinga. From Manila one can travel to Tabuk, by <b>car</b> <b>or</b> <b>coach,</b> a journey of about 10 hours at night or longer by day. From Manila to Bontoc by bus or 4-wheel drive vehicle takes about 10 hours at night.|$|E
60|$|Money was abjured, as {{the root}} of all evil. The produce of the land was to supply most of their wants, or be {{exchanged}} for the few things they could not grow. This idea had its inconveniences; but self-denial was the fashion, and it was surprising how many things one can do without. When they desired to travel, they walked, if possible, begged the loan of a vehicle, or boldly entered <b>car</b> <b>or</b> <b>coach,</b> and, stating their principles to the officials, took the consequences. Usually their dress, their earnest frankness, and gentle resolution won them a passage; but now and then they met with hard usage, and had the satisfaction of suffering for their principles.|$|E

50|$|A twin unit or twinset {{is a set}} of two {{railroad}} <b>cars</b> <b>or</b> locomotives {{which are}} permanently coupled and treated as if they were a single unit. A twinset of <b>cars</b> <b>or</b> <b>coaches</b> can also be called a twin car.|$|R
50|$|The Michigan Star Clipper dinner train offered three-hour, five course premium dinner trains, two-hour, three-course dinner trains, Sunday {{family dinner}} trains, luncheon trains, and children's lunch & breakfast trains. For certain events, {{passengers}} {{even had the}} option to stay overnight onboard one of the Pullman (<b>car</b> <b>or</b> <b>coach)</b> sleeping compartment cars. The various forms of entertainment while on an excursion included a murder mystery theatre, holiday themed theatre shows (Christmas, Easter, and a New Year's Eve show), musical reviews featuring various live performers, fall color tours, and various other special event venues.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1951 summer {{timetable}} the DB {{introduced a}} new class of train: the Fernzug ("long-distance train"). These trains linked the economic centres of the German Federal Republic with one another. The trains were initially given the [...] "old" [...] code letter FD and, on 22 May 1955, F for Fernzug and operated until 1956 with 1st and 2nd class coaches; and thereafter exclusively with the (new) 1st class. The trains always included a dining <b>car</b> <b>or</b> <b>coach</b> with a buffet section that was managed by the DSG.|$|E
50|$|Although some cars {{exist for}} the railroad's own use - for track {{maintenance}} purposes, for example - most carry a revenue-earning load of passengers or freight, and may be classified accordingly as passenger <b>cars</b> <b>or</b> <b>coaches</b> {{on the one hand}} <b>or</b> freight <b>cars</b> (<b>or</b> wagons) on the other.|$|R
50|$|In {{passenger}} rail transport the term through <b>car</b> <b>or</b> through <b>coach</b> {{is used to}} denote a passenger car which is conveyed from one train to another, even within the same system.|$|R
5000|$|A {{vehicle for}} {{conveying}} persons especially in state, {{such as a}} triumphal <b>car</b> <b>or</b> a <b>coach</b> of state. This stately but manoeuvrable horse carriage was used for ceremonial occasions or for pleasure.|$|R
50|$|The dolmen is {{a popular}} tourist attraction, located close to the road between Ballyvaughan and Kilnaboy. A rope {{provides}} a barrier between tourists and the dolmen {{in order to preserve}} the ancient stone. It is requested that tourists do not go beyond this barrier or touch the dolmen. A large car park was opened in 2007 by the Clare County Council to deal with traffic problems caused by <b>cars</b> <b>or</b> <b>coaches</b> parked in the narrow road. A 2005 estimate put the number of annual visitors at 200,000.|$|R
2500|$|Society depends {{heavily on}} {{efficient}} roads. [...] In the [...] European Union (EU) 44% of all goods are moved by trucks over roads and 85% {{of all people}} are transported by <b>cars,</b> buses <b>or</b> <b>coaches</b> on roads. The term was also commonly {{used to refer to}} roadsteads, waterways that lent themselves to use by shipping.|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{however, the}} rail service {{was once again}} unable to compete {{effectively}} with modernising modes of alternative transport. The high frequency of air shuttle services between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur presented a much faster and more comfortable means of transport despite the high prices. From February 2008, partial deregulation of air travel between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur was introduced, and with full deregulation from December 2008 air fares are currently (April 2009) relatively low. However, the convenience of air travel should not be overestimated; typical time from Kuala Lumpur Sentral Station to City Centre of Singapore (via the low cost terminals at each airport) is around five hours. Moreover, {{the opening of the}} North-South Expressway in Malaysia from the late 1980s drastically cut travel time by private <b>car</b> <b>or</b> <b>coaches</b> to around five to five-and-a-half hours from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.|$|R
50|$|The Pierce-Arrow car brand, {{produced}} from 1901 to 1938, {{was known for}} {{having one of the}} first Town <b>Cars,</b> <b>or</b> open <b>coach</b> designs, beginning in 1905. Pierce-Arrow Town Cars were predominantly owned by the very wealthy, including the royal families of Japan, Persia, Saudi Arabia, Greece, and Belgium. Town Cars were produced in various models: Brougham Town Car, Metropolitan Town Car and the Limousine Landau Town Car.|$|R
5000|$|United States — Auto Train between Lorton, Virginia, and Sanford, Florida — up to 50 <b>cars.</b> 4 <b>or</b> 5 <b>coaches,</b> 1 lounge, 3 diners, 6 sleepers, one {{transition}} sleeper {{and up to}} 35 autoracks.|$|R
50|$|Most {{visitors}} {{drive through}} the Illuminations by <b>car,</b> <b>coach</b> <b>or</b> bus. There are also open top trams which run along the tramway as well as horse-drawn landau. At Bispham {{there is a special}} walkway for the tableaux which also includes mixed media in the various large tableaux displays. The Illuminations cost £1.9M each year to stage.|$|R
50|$|There {{are about}} 3-4 second class rakes (a set of coupled rail <b>cars,</b> {{normally}} <b>coaches</b> <b>or</b> wagons) plus one first class rake {{for the train}} between Hat Yai-Su-ngai Kolok. The Southern Special Express 37/38 {{has to be kept}} running as a means of reassuring residents that the central government will not abandon the local people of the three southern provinces despite the ongoing insurgencies there.|$|R

2500|$|Although traffic between Denmark and Sweden {{increased}} by 61 {{percent in the}} first year after the bridge opened, traffic levels were not as high as expected, perhaps due to high tolls. However, since 2005, traffic levels have increased rapidly. [...] This may be due to Danes buying homes in Sweden to take advantage of lower housing prices in Malmö and commuting to work in Denmark. In 2012, to cross by car cost DKK 310, SEK 375 or €43, with discounts of up to 75% available to regular users. In 2007, almost 25million people travelled over the Øresund Bridge: 15.2million by car and bus and 9.6million by train. By 2009, the figure had risen to 35.6million by <b>car,</b> <b>coach</b> <b>or</b> train.|$|R
5000|$|Like at Fairbank, the Cochise robbery {{took place}} in public as well, {{although}} it was nearly midnight {{and there was no}} gunfight. According to the Historical Atlas of the Outlaw West, by Richard M. Patterson: [...] "Most Western train robberies occurred on a lonely stretch of track, usually far enough outside the nearest town to give the robbers plenty of time to raid the express <b>car</b> <b>or</b> the passenger <b>coaches</b> and disappear over the nearest ridge." [...] Alvord and Stiles must have thought it was easier to rob a train in town than {{in the middle of nowhere}} so they came up with a plan to hold up a Wells Fargo express car as it was stopped in front of the train station in Fairbank. The express car, Alvord hoped, would be carrying the United States Army's payroll for the soldiers stationed at Fort Huachuca. Also, the crowd of people that was sure to be gathered at the station would provide the bandits with human shields.|$|R
25|$|As Shatabdi Express are day-trains {{and return}} to the station of origin the same day, coaches (called AC Chair <b>Car</b> <b>or</b> CC) on the train have only seats and not berths. All the Shatabdi Express trains have, however, one <b>or</b> two <b>coaches</b> of first class airconditioned seating. These coaches have wider leg room and offer better food {{compared}} to the normal Air conditioned seating (CC).|$|R

25|$|The current California Zephyr uses Superliner equipment. A typical train {{consists}} of two P42 locomotives, a baggage car, a transition sleeper, two sleeping cars, a dining car, a sightseer lounge <b>car,</b> and two <b>or</b> three <b>coaches.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the NBA, no {{ejection}} of {{a player}} <b>or</b> <b>coach</b> can result from a delay of game violation. FIBA and U.S. NCAA, however, will disqualify a player <b>or</b> <b>coach</b> for two technical fouls.|$|R
50|$|Car {{ownership}} is relatively high, as only 19 households in 2011 did not own 1 <b>or</b> more <b>car</b> <b>or</b> van, {{and there are}} 585 <b>cars</b> <b>or</b> vans in the area.|$|R
50|$|Safety can be {{improved}} in various simple {{ways to reduce the}} chance of an accident occurring. Avoiding rushing or standing in unsafe places on the bus <b>or</b> <b>coach</b> and following the rules on the bus <b>or</b> <b>coach</b> itself will greatly increase the safety of a person travelling by bus <b>or</b> <b>coach.</b> Various safety features can also be implemented into buses and coaches to improve safety including safety bars for people to hold onto.|$|R

50|$|As such, car shuttle train {{services}} {{are to be}} contrasted with Auto Train or Motorail services. Unlike a car shuttle train, an Auto Train or Motorail train is a passenger train on which, except in France, passengers can take their <b>car</b> <b>or</b> automobile along with them. On Auto Trains or Motorail trains, passengers are carried in normal passenger <b>cars</b> <b>or</b> in sleeping <b>cars</b> on longer journeys, while the <b>cars</b> <b>or</b> automobiles are loaded separately into autoracks, <b>car</b> carriers, <b>or</b> flatcars that normally form {{part of the same}} train.|$|R
