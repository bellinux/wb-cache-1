[...] In 2006, in a radio interview, Romm stated, [...] "Global warming is going to transform this country and our transportation and the way we live our lives. [...] If we don't act pretty soon, in an intelligent fashion, then change will be forced upon us by the radically changed climate... global warming is the issue of the century".
