You asked for it." [...] Petrie, talking about the potential use of flashbacks in the season, said that sometimes it is best to [...] "peel back the layer of the onion through flashback, or two people in a room talking <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the power in the world.

500|$|Frankie {{begins to}} hear their tiny voices calling to her and, though World tries to {{distract}} her from it, she finally discovers her friends. World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever. She calms him down enough to befriend and unshrink the gang, but Mr. Herriman bursts in, having gotten into the toy box and somehow past the gang's obstacles, and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World. World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void. World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera-like creature to attack them all (made of the remaining refuse of his world). The gang manages to escape the toy box. Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box. Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box, due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence. World gets happy already and shouts that he's free and everyone is really confused, Frankie's answer is: [...] "Well, {{think of it this}} way: Imagine if you were able to have anything you wanted, except one thing, but that one thing is what you wanted more than anything else. For him, that thing is a friend. That's all he wanted; that's {{what he was trying to}} protect. So I brought him here. Here he <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the friends in the world! I mean come on, isn't friendship what Foster's is all about?" [...] Instantaneously Bloo shouts, [...] " [...] No, it's all about me!" [...] promptly Herriman slaps him with a glove, to the delight of everyone else.|$|E

2500|$|The {{correlation}} matrix of n random variables X1, ..., X'n is the n×n matrix whose i,j entry is corr(X'i,X'j).

2500|$|As with a flight, it is {{possible}} on a broad canal {{for more than one}} boat to be in a staircase at the same time, but managing this without waste of water requires expertise. On English canals, a staircase of more than two chambers is usually staffed: the lockkeepers at Bingley (looking after both the [...] "5-rise" [...] and the [...] "3-rise") ensure that there are no untoward events and that boats are moved through as speedily and efficiently as possible. Such expertise permits miracles of boat balletics: boats travelling in opposite directions can pass each other halfway up the staircase by moving sideways around each other; or at peak times, one <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the chambers full simultaneously with boats travelling in the same direction.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{in a dispute}} between {{supporters}} of the adequacy of natural selection and those who held for inheritance of acquired characteristics, {{one of the arguments}} made repeatedly by Herbert Spencer, and followed by others, depended on what Spencer referred to as co-adaptation of co-operative parts, as in: [...] "We come now to Professor Weismann's endeavour to disprove my second thesis — {{that it is impossible to}} explain by natural selection alone the co-adaptation of co-operative parts. It is thirty years since this was set forth in [...] "The Principles of Biology." [...] In §166, I instanced the enormous horns of the extinct Irish elk, and contended that in this and in kindred cases, where for the efficient use of some one enlarged part many other parts have to be simultaneously enlarged, it is out of the question to suppose that they <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> spontaneously varied in the required proportions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout shooting, Arri Alexa {{cameras were}} used; an Alexa M {{was used for}} {{handheld}} sequences, and an Alexa XT {{was attached to the}} Steadicam. Neither used matteboxes, however. Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff explained this decision: [...] "We didn't want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline. This way we could get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actor's face." [...] Lubezki who did all the handheld camerawork had chosen the Alexa M because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors, sometimes filming two inches away from Keaton's face. The camera also allowed recording for such a long period necessary for the long takes of the movie that Lubezki {{went so far as to}} say the movie would have been impossible to do years before. The cameras were lensed with Leica Summilux-C or Zeiss Master Primes. Lubezki stated that these gave clean images, saying [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that". In terms of sizes, they initially trialled a 21mm, but this did not give Iñárritu the [...] "intimacy" [...] he wanted. The crew instead went to an 18mm Leica, which was used for the majority of the film. Only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm, but this was rare.|$|E
