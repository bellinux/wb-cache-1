40|$|Within {{this thesis}} three hepatocyte-like cell systems HepaRGTM, Upcyte® and HepG 2 were {{examined}} in respect to their CYP 450 gene expression. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze whether three of the most important CYP enzymes (CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 B 6 and CYP 3 A 4) are inducible through prototypical inducers. The potential of these cells as an alternative model for induction studies in addition to the human primary hepatocytes was investigated. <b>CYP</b> <b>induction</b> studies are part of the research and approval process of new drugs. Primary human hepatocytes show high inter-individual differences between donors and their scarce availability increase the demand for alternative cell models. CYP expression was determined using real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In the hepatoma-derived cell line HepaRGTM all CYP genes analyzed showed induction levels comparable to the primary human hepatocytes. In transduced hepatocytes (Upcyte®) only CYP 1 A 2 were significantly induced. The hepatoma-derived cell line HepG 2 only showed low, negligible CYP 2 B 6 inductions. As a result, only in HepaRGTM-cells all investigated CYP 450 enzymes could be induced and therefore the necessary nuclear receptors are expressed in these cells. Therefore HepaRGTM-cells seem to be a promising alternative cell model for <b>CYP</b> <b>induction</b> studies...|$|E

Hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) levels, cytochrome P 450 (<b>CYP</b> 1 A) <b>induction,</b> ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity plus gonad histology were analysed. Males and females were sexually immature and showed no significant evidence of degenerative pathologies.

Hepatocytes were isolated after a modified method of Bakala et al. (2003) and cultivated on collagen I coated plates. Three different media were compared for {{their influence on}} morphology, viability and CYP activity of the hepatocytes. CYP activity was evaluated with the fluorescent substrate 7 -benzyloxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin. Induction experiments were carried out with rifampicin, dexamethasone or phenobarbital. Concentration-response curves for induction with rifampicin were created. Williams' medium E showed the best results on morphology and viability of the hepatocytes and was therefore used for the following induction experiments. Cells cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium were not inducible. Incubation with rifampicin increased the CYP activity in two different hepatocyte preparations in a dose dependent manner (EC 50 = 1. 20 μM and 6. 06 μM; Emax= 4. 1 - and 3. 4 -fold induction). No increase in CYP activity was detected after incubation with dexamethasone or phenobarbital.

Alterations in levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp; MDR 1; ABCB 1) as well as CYPs cause drug interactions in the small intestine. We examined the effects of the duration of DPH administration on expression of CYPs and P-gp in the liver and small intestine of rats. Rats were treated with DPH (100 [*]mg/kg, peroral (p. o.) twice a day (b. d.)) for 2, 4, 8, and 16 [*]d. mRNA levels of CYPs and P-gp were examined using the total RNA extracted from the liver and duodenum 2 [*]h and 24 [*]h after the final administration of DPH.

A relatively long duration of DPH administration (8 [*]d and 16 [*]d) resulted in abolition of the induction of hepatic CYP but increased CYP 3 A activities were maintained.

We show here that exposure of TRP to window sunlight (aTRP) greatly increased the potency, efficacy, {{and duration of}} <b>CYP</b> 1 A <b>induction</b> by TRP in primary chick embryo hepatocytes and in vivo. Aqueous TRP exposed to sunlight for 7 days exhibited a 100 -fold or greater increase in potency over TRP in medium. The induction response was sustained for at least 48 h and was comparable in efficacy to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin. In hepatocytes, increases in mRNAs for CYP 1 A 4 and CYP 1 A 5, chick orthologs of mammalian CYP 1 A 1 and 1 A 2, preceded increases in CYP 1 A proteins and enzyme activities, 7 -ethoxyresorufin deethylase (EROD) for CYP 1 A 4 and arachidonic acid epoxygenation for CYP 1 A 5, consistent with a transcriptional mechanism. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) dependence was evidenced by aTRP induction of EROD in wild-type Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 cells but not in AhR-defective (c 35) mutants. Preparations of aTRP were stable for many months at 4 °C and were relatively resistant to metabolism by hepatocytes or liver microsomes. Fractionation of aTRP by HPLC analysis coupled with EROD assays showed that aTRP contained multiple photoproducts and CYP 1 A inducing components, which varied in sensitivity to metabolism by hepatocytes. The previously identified TRP photoproduct, 6 -formylindolo[3, 2 -b]carbazole (FICZ), was one component, but FICZ was not required for <b>CYP</b> 1 A <b>induction</b> by the aTRP mixture. These findings identify the indoor environment, and window sunlight in particular, as {{a new source of}} CYP 1 A inducers. Further, the evidence that biologically active metabolites of an endogenous substrate, arachidonic acid, are formed by aTRP-induced CYP 1 A provides a pathway by which TRP photoproducts, like toxic xenobiotics, could have significant physiologic effects...|$|R

Concentration-dependent <b>CYP</b> 3 A <b>induction</b> of rifampicin was reproducible with the EC 50 values of 0. 36 0. 28 M from four batches of human hepatocytes using the 96 -well plate with TL Matrigel. The rank order of induction potency for nine inducers or noninducers at a concentration of 10 M were well comparable among the multiple donors, by expressing the results as percentage of change compared with the positive control, 10 M rifampicin. Cotreatment of avasimibe or efavirenz with 10 M rifampicin was found to reduce CYP 3 A activities induced by rifam-picin at a lower rate than treatment with rifampicin alone, whereas treatment with phenobarbital and carbamazepine had no effect. From a comparison of induced CYP 3 A activities and gene expres-sion levels, there were compounds that would cause <b>induction</b> of <b>CYP</b> 3 A 4 mRNA but not activity, presumably due to their inhibitory effect on CYP 3 A activity.

To find out whether this property is keratinocyte specific, we investigated this characteristic in two other cell types, namely intestinal CaCo- 2 cells and the macrophage-like differentiated THP- 1 cells. THP- 1 macrophages and preconfluent CaCo- 2 cells contain the vitamin D receptor (VDR), possess 25 -hydroxylase (CYP 2 R 1 and CYP 27 A 1) and 1 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP 27 B 1) activity, and survive the low UVB doses essential for vitamin D 3 photoproduction. Upon irradiation, 24 -hydroxylase (CYP 24) mRNA is induced in both cell types pretreated with the sterol Delta 7 -reductase inhibitor BM 15766 whereby the 7 -dehydrocholesterol (7 -DHC) content was increased.

Redox-reactive hydrocarbons in diesel engine emissions can inhibit the activity of the enzyme that synthesises NO, which may lead to a lowering of the NO level and reduced vasodilatory capacity [26]. CYP 450 -catalysed epoxidation of fatty acid has a role to play in the endothelial-derived hyperpolarisation factor (EDHF) [27], which is relevant to vasodilatation.

Therefore, we incubated SCHH and HepaRG cells with plasma concentrations of various pregnancy-related hormones (PRHs) —individually or in combination—observed during T 1, T 2, or T 3 in pregnant women. Then, CYP 3 A activity was measured by 19 -OH-midazolam formation. In all three trimesters, only cortisol (C) consistently and significantly induced CYP 3 A activity, while other individual hormones (progesterone, estradiol, or growth hor-mones) failed to induce CYP 3 A activity.

The objective {{of this study is to}} measure the CYP 3 A 4 mRNA expression in HepG 2 cell culture induced by primaquine and ritonavir co-treatment. Methods: For the initial study HepG 2 cells were treated with 30, 40, 50 uM of primaquine; 2, 10, 20 uM ritonavir; DMSO ≤ 0. 1 % for negative control; or 20 uM rifampicin for positive control. While for the co-treatment study the cells were treated with 40 uM primaquine+ 10 uM ritonavir; DMSO ≤ 0. 1 %; or 20 uM rifampicin for 72 hours. The cells were harvested using trypsin–EDTA and total RNA was extracted using the Tripure isolation reagent. After determining the quantity of RNA spectrophotometrically, CYP 3 A 4 mRNA expression was quantified using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The expression of CYP 3 A 4 mRNA was up-regulated (1. 22 fold over control) in HepG 2 cells co-treated with primaquine and ritonavir. These data suggest that the induction effect of ritonavir was more dominant than the inhibitory effect of primaquine.

TCPOBOP, administered for 14 days at 0. 393 ± 96. 2 ppm in the diet, causedconcentration-dependentinductionofhepaticCYP subfam-ily 2 B (CYP 2 B) protein and of benzyloxyresoru ® n O-dealkylation. The ED 50 values for CYP 2 B induction, calculated {{on the basis of}} immunoreactiveCYP 2 B proteinand benzyloxyresoru ® nO-dealky-lation, were 1. 2 ppm and 2. 2 ppm dietary TCPOBOP, respectively. The maximal catalytic activities observed were 74 ± 95 -fold higher thancontrolvalues. These induction levelswere 2. 3 ± 2. 6 -foldgreater than those resulting from exposure of the mice to 500 ppm diet-ary phenobarbital (a prototypic CYP 2 B inducer). The EC 50 val-ues of TCPOBOP for hepatic CYP 2 B induction were < 0. 3 mol/l (serum) and < 3. 3 mol/kg (liver). Increases in immunoreactive CYP subfamily 1 A and subfamily 3 A proteins were also de-tected, although the maximal induction levels for these subfami-lies were relatively low (< threefold, compared to control val-ues). These results indicate that TCPOBOP is an effective CYP 2 B inducer in the mouse when administered at dietar...|$|E
40|$|Xenobiotic induced liver {{injury is}} a leading cause for drug {{withdrawal}} and toxicogenomics may help to identify molecular causes. Here we report studies with cultures of human hepatocytes to detect early responses of liver toxicity upon treatment with the hepatotoxin Aroclor 1254. We studied transcript abundance of 302 genes with biological functions in detoxification, cell proliferation, tumor development, stress response, signal transduction, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. More than 40 genes were regulated by at least twofold change, the majority coding for xenobiotic defense. In the case of <b>CYP</b> monooxygenases <b>induction</b> of coded protein was confirmed by Western immunoblotting whereas catalytic activities were determined by assaying for testosterone hydroxylase activity. There was good agreement between gene and protein expression and enzyme activity of CYP monooxygenases. In conclusion, xenobiotic induced hepatotoxicity may arise via several mechanisms and gene expression profiling helps to pinpoint location and pathways perturbed by drugs and chemicals...|$|R
40|$|A lipid-based physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) {{model has}} been {{developed}} for a mixture of six polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in rats. The {{aim of this study}} was to apply population Bayesian analysis to a lipid PBTK model, while incorporating an internal exposure-response model linking enzyme induction and metabolic rate. Lipid-based physiologically based toxicokinetic models are a subset of PBTK models that can simulate concentrations of highly lipophilic compounds in tissue lipids, without the need for partition coefficients. A hierarchical treatment of population metabolic parameters and a <b>CYP</b> 450 <b>induction</b> model were incorporated into the lipid-based PBTK framework, and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo was applied to in vivo data. A mass balance of CYP 1 A and CYP 2 B in the liver was necessary to model PCB metabolism at high doses. The linked PBTK/induction model remained on a lipid basis and was capable of modeling PCB concentrations in multiple tissues for all dose levels and dose profiles...|$|R
30|$|In vitro {{studies of}} THC and CBD on <b>CYP</b> 450 <b>induction</b> and {{inhibition}} indicate that both inhibit CYP 1 A 1, 1 A 2 and 1 B 1 enzymes (Yamaori et al. 2010). CBD {{also has an}} inhibitory effect on CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 19. However, this effect only occurred at high concentrations (IC 50 = 6 - 9 μM) of CBD (GW unpublished data), and in normal dosing, peak plasma concentrations of CBD are approximately 5 ng/mL or less, 400 -fold lower than the levels at which CYP inhibition may be anticipated. As such, {{it is unlikely that}} THC/CBD spray would cause a relevant inhibition of CYP 450 s. However, to investigate the potential interactions of THC and CBD with drugs which also interact with the CYP 450 s CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 19, various known inducers/inhibitors of these isoenzymes were employed and the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of their co-administration with THC/CBD spray evaluated.|$|R
40|$|Induction of drug {{metabolizing}} enzymes, {{such as the}} cytochromes P 450 (CYP) {{is known}} to cause drug-drug interactions due to increased elimination of co-administered drugs. This increased elimination may lead to significant reduction or complete loss of efficacy of the co-administered drug. Due to the significance of such drug interactions, many pharmaceutical companies employ screening and characterization models which predict CYP enzyme induction to avoid or attenuate the potential for drug interactions with new drug candidates. The most common mechanism of <b>CYP</b> <b>induction</b> is transcriptional gene activation. Activation is mediated by nuclear receptors, such as AhR, CAR, and PXR that function as transcription factors. Early high throughput screening models utilize these nuclear hormone receptors in ligand binding or cell-based transactivation/reporter assays. In addition, immortalized hepatocyte cell lines {{can be used to}} assess enzyme induction of specific drug metabolizing enzymes. Cultured primary human hepatocytes, the best established in vitro model for predicting enzyme induction and most accepted by regulatory agencies, is the predominant assay used to evaluate induction {{of a wide variety of}} drug metabolizing enzymes. These in vitro models are able to appropriately predict enzyme induction in patients when compared to clinical drug-drug interactions. Finally, transgenic animal models and the cynomolgus monkey have also been shown to recapitulate human enzyme induction and may be appropriate in vivo animal models for predicting human drug interactions...|$|E
30|$|The role {{of protein}} kinase-based {{signaling}} pathways in controlling phenobarbital-mediated induction of CYP 450 s had been proposed, even before CAR {{was recognized as}} the fundamental target of phenobarbital. Early studies showed that both activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by elevated intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the inhibition of protein phosphatases PP 1 and PP 2 A by okadaic acid (OA) resulted in complete repression of phenobarbital-inducible CYP gene transactivation in primary rat hepatocytes (Sidhu and Omiecinski, 1995, 1997). Although the transcription factor(s) that drive the phenobarbital induction event was/were yet to be determined, these results indicated that both PKA and protein phosphatase pathways exert marked roles in modulating the signaling of phenobarbital-mediated <b>CYP</b> <b>induction.</b> After establishing CAR as the critical DNA-binding protein required for phenobarbital response, Negishi and colleagues demonstrated that OA pretreatment was sufficient to inhibit phenobarbital-mediated nuclear translocation of CAR and induction of Cyp 2 b 10 in primary mouse hepatocytes, suggesting that CAR nuclear accumulation is most likely regulated by a dephosphorylation-sensitive signaling cascade (Kawamoto et al., 1999). Further studies from the same research group revealed that CAR exists as a complex with Hsp 90 in the cytoplasm of non-induced mouse liver hepatocytes. More importantly, phenobarbital treatment recruited PP 2 A to the protein complex, {{which led to the}} dephosphorylation of CAR (Yoshinari et al., 2003).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{prototype}} dioxin congener 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) {{is known}} to exert anti-estrogenic effects via activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) by interfering with the regulation of oestrogen homeostasis and the estrogen receptor α (ERα) signalling pathway. The AhR/ER cross-talk is considered to {{play a crucial role}} in TCDD- and E 2 -dependent mechanisms of carcinogenesis, though the concerted mechanism of action in the liver is not yet elucidated. The present study investigated TCDD's impact on the transcriptional cross-talk between AhR and ERα and its modulation by 17 β-estradiol (E 2) in the human hepatoma cell line HepG 2, which is AhR-responsive but ERα-negative. Transient transfection assays with co-transfection of hERα and supplementation of receptor antagonists showed anti-estrogenic action of TCDD via down-regulation of E 2 -induced ERα signaling. In contrast, enhancement of AhR signaling dependent on ERα was observed providing evidence for increased cytochrome P 450 (<b>CYP)</b> <b>induction</b> to promote E 2 metabolism. However, relative mRNA levels of major E 2 -metabolizing CYP 1 A 1 and 1 B 1 and the main E 2 -detoxifying catechol-O-methyltransferase were not affected by the co-treatments. This study provides new evidence of a TCDD-activated AhR-mediated molecular AhR/ERα cross-talk mechanism at transcriptional level via indirect inhibition of ERα and enhanced transcriptional activity of AhR in HepG 2 cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The strenuous {{procurement}} of cultured human hepatocytes {{and their}} short lives have constrained the cell culture model of cytochrome P 450 (<b>CYP</b> 450) <b>induction,</b> xenobiotic biotransformation, and hepatotoxicity. The development of continuous non-tumorous cell line steadily containing hepatocyte phenotypes would substitute the primary hepatocytes for these studies. Results The hepatocyte-like cells {{have been developed}} from hTERT plus Bmi- 1 -immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells to substitute the primary hepatocytes. The hepatocyte-like cells had polygonal morphology and steadily produced albumin, glycogen, urea and UGT 1 A 1 beyond 6 months while maintaining proliferative capacity. Although these hepatocyte-like cells had low basal expression of CYP 450 isotypes, their expressions could be extensively up regulated to 80 folds upon the exposure to enzyme inducers. Their inducibility outperformed the classical HepG 2 cells. Conclusion The hepatocyte-like cells contained the markers of hepatocytes including CYP 450 isotypes. The high inducibility of CYP 450 transcripts {{could serve as a}} sensitive model for profiling xenobiotic-induced expression of CYP 450. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} biological–chemical {{approach is}} necessary to evaluate correctly the environmental status of bodies of water, {{as suggested by the}} EU Water Framework Directive. The shore crab Carcinus aestuarii, sampled in the Lagoon of Venice (NE Italy), was used as a biomonitor species, and the chemical concentrations of 42 organic pollutants (HCHs, PAHs, PCBs, DDTs, PBDEs), biological responses related to neurotoxicity (AChE inhibition), detoxification mechanisms (<b>CYP</b> 450 <b>induction)</b> and endocrine alterations (vitellogenin-like protein induction) were measured at the same time. The responsiveness of biomarkers as predictors (or descriptors) of chemical contamination was evaluated by multivariate regression analysis, revealing good predictor potential for the selected biomarkers. Biomonitoring in the Lagoon of Venice revealed a predominance of DDT and PCB compounds, especially near industrial sites or large cities. Endocrine alterations, not always correlated with the presence of measured compounds, were also detected in many areas, suggesting exposure to compounds able to interfere with the crab endocrine system...|$|R
40|$|Flounder (Platichthys flesus) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) {{were exposed}} to three {{different}} levels of pollution involving contaminants from harbour dredged spoil in a large-scale mesocosm study lasting 30 months. Exposure of fish to PCBs and PAHs was estimated from liver concentrations of CB- 153 and biliary levels of 1 -OH pyrens in flounder. Both marker compounds were significantly elevated in fish from the polluted mesocosms {{in comparison to the}} reference mesocosm. Of the three parameters used to characterise CYPIA induction in flounder, only CYPIA-mRNA in female fish was significantly induced by pollution. However, significant induction of EROD activity and immunochemically measured CYPlA protein content was observed in plaice. To investigate in more detail the apparent lack of <b>CYP</b> 1 A <b>induction,</b> a parallel experiment was run in which flounder were injected with a single i. p. injection of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and sacrificed after 48 hours. Since this approach did result in significant induction of all the parameters used to characterise <b>CYP</b> 1 A <b>induction</b> (EROD, CYPIA, CYPIA mRNA), it appears that external factors may have prevented induction in the mesocosm experiments. Down-regulating effects of the possible presence of a compound with oestrogenic activity, or altered membrane-CYPIA or membrane-receptor interaction, could have contributed to this apparent lack of response, despite the intrinsic ability of flounder to increase CYPIA levels after exposure to a model inducer (BaP) ...|$|R
