25|$|Settlers {{on their}} way {{overland}} to Oregon and California became targets of Indian threats. Robert L. Munkres read 66 diaries of parties traveling the Oregon Trail between 1834 and 1860 to estimate the actual dangers they faced from Indian attacks in Nebraska and Wyoming. The vast majority of diarists reported no armed attacks at all. However many did report harassment by Indians who begged or demanded tolls, and stole horses and cattle. Madsen reports that the Shoshoni and Bannock tribes north and west of Utah were more aggressive toward wagon trains. The federal government attempted to reduce tensions and create new tribal boundaries in the Great Plains with two new treaties in the early 1850, The Treaty of Fort Laramie established tribal zones for the Sioux, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Crows, and others, and allowed for the building of roads and posts across the tribal lands. A second treaty secured safe passage along the Santa Fe Trail for wagon trains. In return, the tribes would receive, for ten years, annual <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> caused by migrants. The Kansas and Nebraska territories also became contentious areas {{as the federal government}} sought those lands for the future transcontinental railroad. In the Far West settlers began to occupy land in Oregon and California before the federal government secured title from the native tribes, causing considerable friction. In Utah, the Mormons also moved in before federal ownership was obtained.|$|E

2500|$|Another area of tort that {{developed}} in India which {{differs from the}} UK is the availability of constitutional torts. Creating constitutional torts is a public law remedy for violations of rights, generally by agents of the state, and is implicitly premised on the strict liability principle. The tort was further entrenched when the court allowed compensation to be awarded as [...] "a remedy available in public law; based on strict liability for the contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply, {{even though it may}} be available as a defence in private law in an action based on tort". This approach is vastly different from the approach taken in UK as <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> is not an available public law remedy.|$|E
2500|$|Both sides {{employed}} {{a variety of}} experts to represent their interests,including scientists and private or public enterprises. The United States used the U.S. State Department along with scientists from the Department of Agriculture to conduct investigations {{about the effects of}} the smelter's output on agriculture in the region. The Canadian side turned to Canada’s National Research Council (NRC) and was granted access to the Salt Lake Research Station to conduct research for the smelter's defence. These experts would remain active actors throughout the dispute. The decision laid down by the IJC awarded the farmers $350,000 in 1931 for the damages incurred by the Trail Smelter; this was much less than the farmers had sought. Additionally, {{this was the first time}} the IJC ruled on a trans-boundary air pollution case. [...] The U.S. State Department flatly rejected the decision and submitted for arbitration. This resulted in diplomatic maneuvering which led to an Arbitral Tribunal; it was the Tribunal’s decision that produced the most significant results in the dispute. As part of the agreements leading up to the Arbitral Tribunal, the United States agreed to accept the initial compensation awarded by the IJC from Canada as <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> done by the smelter prior to 1932.|$|E

40|$|<b>Compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> to health: a {{comparison}} of Czech and German legislation This diploma Thesis deals with the theme of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> to health in Czech and German legislation, {{which was one of}} the inspirations during the creation of the Czech Civil Code. The aim of this study is to explore the issue of civil <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> to health (and in the case of death) with an emphasis on medical-legal relations arising from the provision of health care, in both these legal systems. This study is divided into three parts. In the first is examined the legislation of Czech Republic, in the second the German one. The third section briefly summarizes the differences and the congruent aspects of both legislations, supplemented by suggestions for possible changes and improvements of the Czech law de lege ferenda. The area of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> to health is strictly bond with the civil liability, therefore the study deals with this issue as well. Within the Czech law, both of these areas have undergone a fundamental change with the entry into force of the new Civil Code on January 1, 2014. By the civil liability the unified conception of tort was left and now contractual and tort liability is distinguished, also the whole conception of civil liability tends to active and not penalty [...] ...|$|R

The Bloc demanded $5 billion for the province, including <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> from the January 1998 North American ice storm and $175 million towards a new hockey arena to bring back the Quebec Nordiques, which the Conservatives dismissed outright. [...] In the resultant 2011 federal election, the Bloc suffered a massive 43-seat loss—including many seats they'd held since their 1993 breakthrough—cutting them down to a rump of four seats. Much of that support bled to the NDP who ascended from fourth place to second place to become the Official Opposition, largely by winning 58 seats in Quebec which included a sweep of the Bloc's heartlands in Quebec City and eastern Montreal. The NDP, which entered the election with only one seat in the province - Tom Mulcair - had surged in the last weeks of the campaign {{at the expense of the}} Bloc due to NDP leader Jack Layton's charismatic personality and leftist nationalism policies, while Bloc [...] "over the years defend Quebec's interests, but the sovereigntist agenda is no longer very relevant". Duceppe lost his own seat to NDP challenger Hélène Laverdière by 5,400votes. Accepting responsibility for the Bloc's crushing defeat, Duceppe announced his pending resignation as Bloc leader soon after the result was beyond doubt. He remained defiant, however, vowing not to rest [...] "until Quebec becomes a country".|$|E

40|$|Roman jurists {{stated that}} the {{reparation}} or <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> tortious <b>damage</b> had already been envisaged by the Twelve Tables. In the classical age, the judge envisaged actiones utiles and actiones in factum as reparation <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> inflicted upon property either by failure to act or indirectly. In the Justinian Code the actio legis Aquiliae was considered the general reparation or <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> any <b>damage</b> caused by negligent behaviours. In fact, the requirements <b>for</b> reparation and <b>compensation</b> have been considered and defined by courts {{as early as the}} lex Aquilia. Thanks to the Roman jurists, the actio legis Aquiliae has become a general form of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> any <b>damage,</b> based on the criterion of negligence viewed as the lack of due diligence. This structure was transposed in the fundamental text related to <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> in the Canon law, namely the Si culpa tua. Canon 128 of the code in force has reintroduced in the Canon law a provision which lays down the general obligation of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage.</b> In particular, the Sacred Roman Rota case law pointed {{to the fact that the}} damage affecting individuals’ interests had to be unfair, linked to the damaging behaviour by means of an efficient chain of causation and be caused by legal negligence. In its turn, the Canon law had its own impact, thus contributing to the evolution of the provisions on reparation and compensation laid down by the jus commune developed by the jusnaturalistic legal theory. In more recent legal literature, the Canon law reveals more clearly the trends which affect the interpretation and practical implementation of the Justinian legal sources, in line with the general guidelines and mindset of the time. With a view to fully understanding the fundamental aspects of the provisions regarding reparation and <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage,</b> in my thesis I have examined the origins of this institution which I found at first in the Roman law and subsequently in the Roman canon law, without losing sight of its concurrent development in the civil law systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{right to}} <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> due to breach of {{contract}} exists in both situations of non-fulfilment of sales contracts, or in situations of lateness, and in situations of improper con- tract fulfilment.

This is also according to general rules on lateness, i. e. the general rules on non-fulfilment, Namely, when the debtor fails to fulfil an obligation or is overdue in its fulfilment, the creditor has the right to request <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> the <b>damage</b> incurred as a consequence thereof (Article 251 (2) LO). <b>For</b> <b>damages</b> due to lateness in fulfilling the contract and a debtor that the creditor has provided with an adequate additional time for fulfilment (Article 251 (3) LO).
