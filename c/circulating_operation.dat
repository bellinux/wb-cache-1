40|$|The {{cycloconverter}} as {{a direct}} frequency converter without a d. c. link is well known as a power amplifier in low speed a. c. drives. If continuous <b>circulating</b> current <b>operation</b> can be maintained, reversible energy flow and regenerative braking can be achieved in an induction motor drive without {{a change in the}} gate pulse sequence. Continuous <b>circulating</b> current <b>operation</b> also reduces the output harmonic content of the cycloconverter and increases the speed range of the drive. This dissertation describes the use of an induction motor stator as an inter-group reactor maintaining continuous circulating current in the cycloconverter. The same stator winding sets up the conventional rotating air gap-flux and the reactor machine has standard torque-speed characteristics. In the multi-machine drive designed and constructed in this work, one machine requires a special stator winding. Conventional squirrel-cage machines can then be added for tandem speed control and the utilisation of copper improved. Closed-loop speed control and air gap flux control are incorporated on the reactor machine. The standard induction motors added in addition to the reactor machine are shown to be essentially operating under open-loop conditions but a "hard supply" is maintained by closed-loop control...|$|R

40|$|The ongoing {{growth of}} world {{population}} and industrialization is increasing the primary energy demand, {{and also the}} need for transport fuels. The increasing {{carbon dioxide and other}} emissions are fostering the political atmosphere to demand for a more sustainable development with more efficient usage of raw materials and resources. In order to improve some key processes in refineries, such as Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (FCC), a better understanding of high-flux flow hydrodynamics is necessary. FCC units are producing a large proportion of gasoline world-wide, and some other valuable products such as light olefins and light cycle oil. Nearly all FCC units in production utilize a riser reactor, where the solids (catalyst) circulation rate could range from 400  kg/m 2 s to 1, 200  kg/m 2 s, and the superficial gas velocity from 6  m/s to 28  m/s. Therefore, it is surprising that nearly all studies of CFB pilot hydrodynamics have been carried out at low solids fluxes of less than 200  kg/m 2 s, whereas only a few limited but helpful studies are discussing higher solids fluxes of over 500  kg/m 2 s (Zhu and Bi, 1995). Such studies are regarded very useful for industrial processes and unit design, development and optimization. In comparison to those studies carried out in the dense suspension upflow (DSU) regime (Grace et al., 1999), this Thesis will discuss high-flux operations where the axial solids holdup profile is not flat and the cross-sectional solids concentration is clearly less than 10 %-vol in the upper portion of the riser. Consequently, the operation has similarities to both DSU and fast fluidization (FF) flow regimes. Since the cross-sectional solids concentration is also low (< 10 %-vol) in the upper portion of industrial FCC risers, another aim is to provide a detailed image of the radial solids concentration profiles and their development toward the top of a high-flux riser. Since there is confusion of how and why DSU flow regime would occupy a riser, some fundamental reasons are discussed in detail. It is shown that to realize a high-density <b>circulating</b> fluidized-bed <b>operation</b> (HFCFB), a high-flux <b>circulating</b> fluidized-bed (HFCFB) <b>operation</b> is essential but not sufficient. For having some experience enclosed from a low-flux riser, paper I is discussing the low-flux riser hydrodynamics concerning especially the flow structure near to the column wall. Paper II and III present the solids concentration and particle velocity profiles and flow development in a long and high-flux riser. Paper IV goes on to define a novel concept of four longitudinal sections in a HFCFB riser (but not in a HFCFB riser). This concept may be a very useful fundamental aid for industrial modeling of HFCFB risers. Paper V presents some operating experience of a high-flux riser with a novel design in the solids feeding inlet. Paper VI is discussing the particle aggregation in a HFCFB riser. The collected data in papers II to VI are believed to be useful for several industrial applications since not much measured data existed under high-solids fluxes. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{silkworm}}, Bombyx mori, is {{a typical}} Lepidopteran insect. In the silkworm hemolymph, there are 5 types of circulating hemocytes that are classified as prohemocytes, granulocytes, plasmatocytes, spherulocytes and oenocytoids. All of them are involved in humoral and cellular immunity either directly or indirectly. Insect hematopoietic organs can produce hemocytes that are continuously released into the circulation. Recent studies indicate that in the hematopoietic organs of silkworm larvae, there are mainly prohemocytes and oenocytoids. Based on in vitro observations, silkworm prohemocytes can differentiate into plasmatocytes and granulocytes, and granulocytes can differentiate into spherulocytes. The silkworm also has a novel type of hematopoiesis. When its hematopoietic organs are extirpated through a surgical <b>operation,</b> <b>circulating</b> hemocytes can still remain {{at a high level}} through the wandering stage due to an increase in the level of cell division.

The analysis of contamination of the internal surfaces of cooling tubes and of the influence of pollution on the process of heat transfer in turbine condensers has been fulfilled. The existing method of cleaning of condenser tubes with the use of porous elastic balls of sponge rubber that is implemented on a number of large thermal power plants and state region power plants of the Republic of Belarus is examined. In the operation of the ball cleaning system a significant drawback has been revealed, viz. a low efficiency of this method due to the failure to comply with preparation the system of <b>circulating</b> water for <b>operation.</b> Also, a certain imperfection of ball cleaning system technology has been determined. One of the prerequisites for the effective functioning of the ball cleaning system is a certain degree of purity of the pipe system of the condenser, characterized by the coefficient of purity. To determine the effectiveness of ball cleaning system a series of experiments on the launching of porous rubber balls in the pipe system of the main and the embedded bunches of the T- 250 / 300 - 240 UTMZ turbine has been produced. Immediately before the experiments hydraulic cleaning of the tubes of the condenser by a high-pressure installation were carried out. During the experiments, records of the number of downloaded porous rubber balls, of the number of rubber balls captured in a loading chamber, and of the number of rubber balls that remained in a calibration device were kept. A large proportion of default of the balls caused by the presence of residues of the carbonate sediments, that obstruct the movement of porous rubber balls in the tubes of the condenser, was determined. The presence of carbonate deposits in the tubes of the condenser indicates a lack of effectiveness of antiscale treatment of circulating water and of hydraulic method of cleaning tubes of the condenser.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Complex three {{dimensional}} particle-fluid flow operations (for example {{pneumatic conveying}} systems, cyclonic separator unit <b>operations,</b> <b>circulating</b> fluidised beds and dense medium cyclones) are encountered in many industries including energy, mineral, metallurgical, petroleum, environmental, pharmaceutics and materials, and is core in process/chemical engineering. One approach to optimise these industrially important operations {{is to develop}} a fundamental understanding of the underlying physics and mechanics of each operation. With this knowledge, the application of each technology to particular circumstances can be optimised to maximise business profitability. In this treatise presented in this thesis, a fundamental model, i. e., combined discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (DEM-CFD or CFD-DEM) model, has been attempted in a numerical study of complex three dimensional particle-fluid flows. In the DEM-CFD model, the motion of particles is modelled as a discrete phase, described by Newton's laws of motion applied at an individual particle scale, and the flow of fluid (gas or liquid) is treated as a continuum phase, described by the local averaged Navier-Stokes equations applied at a computational cell scale, while allowing the mutual interaction (e. g., momentum, heat and mass transfer) between particle and fluid phases. This method is recognised as an effective approach of studying the fundamentals of particle-fluid flow by various investigators. It is now increasingly used worldwide, but so far, its application is limited to relatively simple flow systems, mainly because the code development for the solution of fluid phase can be very challenging and time-consuming when complicated dense particle-fluid flow systems are considered. In this approach developed in this thesis, taking advantage of the available CFD development, a DEM-CFD model has been developed and extended, {{and for the first time}} combined with the most popular commercial CFD software, i. e. Fluent, as the platform, achieved by incorporating explicit DEM code and a coupling scheme between DEM and CFD into Fluent through its User Defined Functions (UDFs). The applicability of the developments is demonstrated in the study of the particle-fluid flow in various complex 3 D systems including pneumatic conveying bends, cyclone separator, circulating fluidised bed (CFB), and dense medium cyclones (DMCs). By comparing the numerical findings with experimental measurements, it is shown that the numerical results qualitatively capture some of the flow features typical to those flow systems considered, such as: roping and particle segregation in the pneumatic conveying bends; strands flow and reduction of tangential velocity after loading solids in the gas cyclone separator; core-annulus flow structure and axial solid segregation in the CFB; and &# 147;surging&# 148;, performance deterioration with decrease of medium-to-coal ratio and particle size, and the extraordinary effect of coal type in the DMCs. Quantitative agreements between simulated results with those measured were also obtained in various aspects, such as the periodical fluctuation of pressure drop in the pneumatic conveying bend, the decrease of pressure drop with increase of solid loading rate in the gas cyclone separator, the separation error and density as a function of particle size in the DMC. The internal flow structures are analysed by use of particle velocity and concentration, fluid/slurry flow field (velocity, pressure and density), particle-fluid, particle-particle and particle-wall interaction forces, which leads to an improved understanding of the flow mechanisms of these systems. The obtained intensity of particle-particle and particle-wall interactions can be used to study the attrition of solids and the erosion (wear) of walls in those systems respectively...|$|R
40|$|Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is an {{electricity}} generation technology that concentrates solar irradiation through heliostats onto a small area, the receiver, where a {{heat transfer fluid}} is used as heat carrier towards the heat storage and power block. It has been under the spotlight for a decade {{as one of the}} most potential or promising renewable and sustainable energy technology. The use of gas/solid suspensions as heat transfer fluid in CSP has been advocated for the first time in the 1980 's and this novel application relies on its possible use throughout the full CSP plant, i. e. in heat capture, conveying, storage and heat reuse, where it offers major advantages in comparison with water/steam, thermal fluids or molten salt, the current heat transfer fluids. Since the powder suspension has a heat capacity similar to that of molten salts, without temperature limitation except for the maximum allowable wall temperature of the receiver tube, suspension temperatures of about 800 °C can be tolerated, with additional high efficiency thermodynamic systems being applicable. This work reviews the development of CSP and assesses both its energy efficiency and the impact of the direct normal solar irradiance on the power yield of a CSP plant. A literature review of fluidized bed systems and their use as heat transfer medium is also included. A novel bubbling fluidized bed concept, the upflow bubbling fluidized bed is selected for use in a solar power tower plant for its excellent heat transfer and potential in moderate to high receiver capacities. Circulating fluidized beds could be interesting for very large scale operations. The selection accounts for sizes, complexity and operating costs. Both upflow bubbling fluidized bed and circulating fluidized bed of fine particles feature excellent heat transfer. At the 1 MW solar furnace, PROMES CNRS France reported that a high heat transfer coefficient of 1100 W/m²K was achieved with an upflow bubbling fluidized bed receiver at superficial gas velocities below 0. 2 m/s and solids circulation flux of 10 to 45 kg/m²s. A moderate heat transfer coefficient of 60 to 300 W/m²K was obtained in the <b>circulating</b> fluidized bed <b>operation</b> mode in this PhD. The values of the obtained heat transfer coefficients are dealt with by both empirical and mechanistic modeling approach, with fair to very good agreements obtained. Furthermore, the mechanistic surface renewal model provides guidelines in terms of dimensional scaling up, which is also a major contribution of the PhD. The particle circulation loop throughout the CSP installation is also examined for the remaining sections of the power generation concept, i. e. in the hot and cold storage hoppers, in the boilers of the thermal block, or as direct heat supply to the hot-side heat exchanger of a Stirling engine. Whereas in heat capture, mostly upflow bubbling or circulating fluidized beds seem appropriate, both moving beds or downcomers, and bubbling fluidized beds are recommended in the heat storage and re-use, and experimentally quantified. The novel concepts of thermal energy storage, using latent heat in phase change materials, or storing thermo-chemical heat through using reversible chemical reactions has been investigated with extensive interest. The thermal energy from a solar collection field or from transforming excess renewable electricity from wind turbines into heat can be stored for short or even long terms in such systems. However the concept applied at high temperatures is still at its early stage. Experimental phase change materials research was conducted and results illustrate the effect of different parameters. Another approach to thermal energy storage is the use of reversible chemical reactions, and they can be regenerated through the exothermic reverse reaction process. Unlike sensible or latent heat storage, mostly limited in time due to heat losses, chemical energy storage enables to bridge long duration gaps between supply and demand, hence making it particularly suitable for a stable {{electricity generation}}. Thermodynamic calculations and thermogravimetric analysis were conducted on selected reaction pairs. Results are of fundamental nature only, and it is far too early to imagine a pilot or large-scale application of thermo-chemical storage in the CSP concept. Since phase transformation or chemical reactions are involved, the materials need to be properly contained. The containment is discussed with respect to the selection concerns and criteria. The containing material or geometry should satisfy the required need of being closed and able to withstand the high temperatures envisaged, to resist possible chemical attacks by the contained materials, and to resist the pressure build up during the phase transition or reactions, in which expansion often occurs or gases and vapours are released. The PhD research is concluded by scale-up data and provides a preliminary view into the prospects and the overall economy of the system. Market prospects for both novel concentrated solar power and thermal energy storage applications are expected to be excellent. Although the PhD research provided lab-scale based design methods and equations for the key unit operations of a novel solar power tower CSP concept, there is ample scope for future development of several topics, as finally recommended. status: publishe...|$|R
