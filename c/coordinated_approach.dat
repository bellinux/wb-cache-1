5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} <b>coordinated</b> <b>approach</b> to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E
25|$|As diversions for {{irrigation}} approached or exceeded {{the capacity of}} the Murray–Darling river system, and environmental problems became more serious, the need for a <b>coordinated</b> <b>approach</b> to management of the Basin as a whole became more evident. Following negotiations beginning in 1985 the Murray–Darling Basin Agreement was signed in 1987. In its initial form, it was as an amendment to the River Murray Waters Agreement. Five years later, in 1992, a totally new Murray–Darling Basin Agreement was signed, replacing the River Murray Waters Agreement. The Agreement was given full legal status by the Murray–Darling Basin Act 1993 which was passed by all the contracting governments. Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory later joined the agreement.|$|E

The novel also has a different opening scene to introduce Vejur and Kirk, concentrates in sections on Kirk's struggle with confidence in taking command of the Enterprise again and expands on Ilia and Decker's relationship. The Vejur spelling for the [...] "intruder's" [...] name was used exclusively in the novel Roddenberry authored, from its first appearance on page 179 of the first paperback edition of the novelization through to the account on the novel's page 241 of Kirk reading the undamaged [...] "V-G-E-R" [...] letters on the fictional [...] "Voyager 6" [...] space probe's nameplate. In addition to the novel, Star Trek printed media included a coloring book, ship blueprints, and a comic book adaptation published by Marvel Comics as Marvel Super Special #15 (Dec. 1979). Toys included action figures, ship models, and a variety of watches, phaser mockups and communicators. McDonald's sold specially designed Star Trek Happy Meals.

40|$|In the Skyrme model, the Lagrangian can be {{quantized}} {{in several}} ways using the collective <b>coordinate</b> <b>approach.</b> Not all of which produce quantum states that {{can be interpreted as}} physical particles. For example the SU(2) collective <b>coordinate</b> <b>approach</b> produces both integral and half-integral spin and isospin states. Only half of these are the physical baryons. Less well known {{is the fact that it}} is equally possible to quantize the system using the SO(3) collective coordinates. This produces only unphysical integral spin and isospin states. To fulfill the goal of being able to express a classical skyrmion as a coherent state of baryons directly in terms of the baryon states, surprisingly a combination of both collective <b>coordinate</b> <b>approaches</b> is required. To prepare for the subsequent application to skyrmion formation through disoriented chiral condensates in heavy ion collisions, the Skyrme model is rigorously quantized using the Dirac prescription for constrained systems. This is shown for both the SU(2) as well as the SO(3) collective <b>coordinate</b> <b>approach.</b> Comment: revtex 4, 16 pages, no figure...|$|R

However, British diplomats residing there have sought refuge in a fortified compound south-west {{of the city to}} avoid the repetitive rocket attacks by warring militias. Three days earlier, a convoy carrying British diplomats from Tripoli to Tunisia came under fire when their vehicles refused to stop at an unofficial checkpoint in the outskirts of the city. On 2 August, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office finally announced that it would temporarily close its embassy in the capital and evacuate its staff. Ambassador Michael Aron said that the embassy would continue to operate from Tunisia. The following day, the Royal Navy ship HMS Enterprise managed to evacuate more than a hundred foreign nationals from the country to Malta, most of whom were British, in an operation off the coast of Tripoli.
