5|$|Although Jevons {{originally}} {{focused on}} the issue of coal, the <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> since been extended to the use of any resource, including, for example, water usage and interpersonal contact. It is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics.|$|E
5|$|The project {{demonstrated}} {{the effectiveness of}} electronic systems in enforcing freight restrictions without delaying vehicles, while alleviating security fears such systems could be easily compromised. The <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> since been applied to many parts of Canada, including Highway407's electronic tolling system.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of planets}} {{has evolved over}} its history, from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the {{scientific}} age. The <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> expanded to include worlds {{not only in the}} Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{independent}} primitive <b>concepts</b> <b>has</b> been minimized {{in order that}} the language be easy to describe, to learn, and to implement. On the other hand, these <b>concepts</b> <b>have</b> been applied “orthogonally” {{in order to maximize}} the expressive power of the language while trying to avoid deleterious superfluities.|$|R
30|$|Several {{concepts}} {{of a system}} for generating electricity while vaporizing liquefied natural gas (LNG) have been developed by Griepentrog et al. [1, 2]. These <b>concepts</b> <b>have</b> some thermodynamic and economic advantages over systems proposed in the past. A detailed discussion of {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of these <b>concepts</b> <b>has</b> been given in [3].|$|R
5000|$|Three {{different}} <b>concepts</b> <b>have</b> {{been proposed}} over the years, as described below: ...|$|R
5|$|This puffball was {{originally}} described in 1790 by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard as Lycoperdon utriforme, and since then, has been variously {{placed in the}} genera Bovista, Lycoperdon, Calvatia, and Utraria. In 1989, German mycologist Hanns Kreisel described the genus Handkea to include species of Calvatia that had distinct microscopic features: Handkea species have a unique type of capillitium (coarse thick-walled hyphae in the gleba), with curvy slits {{instead of the usual}} pores. Although accepted by some authors, the genus <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been rejected by others.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{marketing}} for the match, a unique design <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been developed for each Champions League final since 1997, inspired by the cultural and historical heritage of the host city. The 2008 final's design was announced on 31 October 2007 in a ceremony at the Luzhniki Stadium, attended by the ambassador for the final, former Russian goalkeeper Rinat Dasayev. The design {{was based on a}} colour scheme of deep red and gold, inspired by the predominant colours of Red Square, the Kremlin and the gold domes of Moscow's cathedrals, and featured images of the Moscow skyline, as well as the UEFA Champions League logo and trophy rendered in a Russian artistic style, with text in a font similar to Cyrillic script.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{molecular}} genetics suggested {{the concept that}} one gene makes one protein. This concept (originally called the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis) emerged from an influential 1941 paper by George Beadle and Edward Tatum on experiments with mutants of the fungus Neurospora crassa. Norman Horowitz, an early colleague on the Neurospora research, reminisced in 2004 that “these experiments founded the science of what Beadle and Tatum called biochemical genetics. In actuality they {{proved to be the}} opening gun in what became {{molecular genetics}} and all the developments that have followed from that.” The one gene-one protein <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.|$|E
50|$|The {{historical}} {{origin of}} the concept of MODS is as follows. For many years, some patients were loosely classified as having sepsis or the sepsis syndrome. In more recent years, these <b>concepts</b> <b>have</b> been refined - so that there are specific definitions of sepsis - and two new <b>concepts</b> <b>have</b> been developed: the SIRS and MODS.|$|R
30|$|Some new <b>concepts</b> <b>have</b> been {{proposed}} in the framework that need further explanation.|$|R
50|$|Eliminated: Daisy and Nadine, as Blanc {{felt that}} their <b>concept</b> <b>had</b> been lost.|$|R
5|$|Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are {{commonly}} cited {{as an example}} of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). While the keystone species <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of habitats {{is a necessary}} step in the maintenance of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs, the animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may {{take the form of}} the setting up of national parks, forest reserves and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans with the objective of benefiting wildlife. The laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the {{protection of}} habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been incorporated into some Australian legislation.|$|E
25|$|Self-organization is {{realized}} in the physics of non-equilibrium processes, and in chemical reactions, where it {{is often described as}} self-assembly. The <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> proven useful in biology, from molecular to ecosystem level.|$|E

50|$|Some aerial cranes, mostly <b>concepts,</b> <b>have</b> {{also used}} lighter-than air aircraft, such as airships.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{variations}} on the <b>concept</b> <b>have</b> been proposed to apply to other fields.|$|R
25|$|A {{financial}} transaction tax is a levy {{placed on a}} specific type of monetary transaction for a particular purpose. The <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been most commonly associated with the financial sector; it is not usually considered to include consumption taxes paid by consumers.|$|E
25|$|A God-fearer or Godfearer was {{a member}} of a class of non-Jewish (gentile) sympathizers to Second Temple Judaism {{mentioned}} in the Christian New Testament and other contemporary sources such as synagogue inscriptions in diaspora Hellenistic Judaism. The <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> precedents in the proselytes of the Hebrew Bible.|$|E
25|$|The 1-26 design {{gained weight}} through the {{evolution}} of the models, as the gross weight increased from 575lbs to 700lbs. Performance testing showed that there is very little difference between the models and that the one-design <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been maintained throughout the aircraft's production life.|$|E
5000|$|FIqh (religious law) has {{developed}} several traditional <b>concepts</b> <b>having</b> {{to do with}} economics. These included: ...|$|R
50|$|Catholic {{attacks on}} this <b>concept</b> <b>have</b> {{been based on}} the {{argument}} that it is incoherent.|$|R

25|$|The {{zero-energy}} building <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been {{a progressive}} evolution from other low-energy building designs. Among these, the Canadian R-2000 and the German passive house standards have been internationally influential. Collaborative government demonstration projects, {{such as the}} superinsulated Saskatchewan House, and the International Energy Agency's Task 13, have also played their part.|$|E
25|$|The Land of Israel <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been {{evoked by}} {{the founders of}} the State of Israel. It often {{surfaces}} in political debates on the status of the West Bank, which is referred to in official Israeli discourse as Judea and Samaria, from the names of the two historical Jewish kingdoms.|$|E
25|$|Since then, human {{security}} has been receiving more {{attention from the}} key global development institutions, such as the World Bank. Tadjbakhsh, among others, traces the evolution of {{human security}} in international organizations, concluding that the <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been manipulated and transformed considerably since 1994 to fit organizational interests.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} exact {{sequence}} arises naturally in this setting, {{and it turns}} out that exact functors, i.e. the functors preserving exact sequences in various senses, are the relevant functors between Abelian categories. This exactness <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> been axiomatized in the theory of exact categories, forming a very special case of regular categories.|$|E
25|$|The {{fractional}} ownership <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> since {{been extended to}} smaller aircraft and now has become common for single-engine piston aircraft like the Cirrus SR22, which are beyond the financial means of many private pilots. The same concepts apply, except that the management company may not provide flight crews nor reposition the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Entomological warfare (EW) {{is a type}} of {{biological}} warfare that uses insects to attack the enemy. The <b>concept</b> <b>has</b> existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program.|$|E
5000|$|DCE {{represented}} {{a big step}} {{in the direction of}} standardisation of [...] architectures, which had previously been manufacturer-dependent. Like the OSI model, DCE has not seen much success in practical implementation; however, its underlying <b>concepts</b> <b>have</b> had more substantial influence over subsequent efforts.|$|R
