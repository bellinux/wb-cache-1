5|$|The first Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, {{designed}} by Elias David Häusser and {{completed in the}} 1740s, was <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most impressive Baroque buildings of its day. Although the palace itself was destroyed by fire in 1794, the extensive showgrounds and riding arena completed by Niels Eigtved have survived undamaged and can be visited today. Fredensborg Palace (1731), the royal residence {{on the shore of}} Sealand's Lake Esrum, with its exquisite Chancellery House, is the work of Johan Cornelius Krieger who was the court gardener at Rosenborg Castle. The park at Fredensborg is one of Denmark's largest and best preserved Baroque gardens.|$|E

Close XI, Ken Rutherford scored 317 runs off just 245 balls, including 228 runs in fours and sixes. In terms of balls faced, this is almost <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four fastest first-class triple-centuries ever recorded.|$|E

25|$|In 1741, Arne filed a {{complaint}} in Chancery pertaining to a breach of musical copyright and claimed {{that some of his}} theatrical songs had been printed and sold by Henry Roberts and John Johnson, the London booksellers and music distributors. The matter was settled out of court. Arne was <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the very first composers to have appealed to the law over copyright issues.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, the Committee for {{establishing}} electric tram service, headed by Luko Bunić – <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most deserving persons {{who contributed to}} the realisation of the project – was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato Šarić, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Gracić, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Katić and Antun Milić. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.|$|E
25|$|Tai Fu Tai Mansion (大夫第) in San Tin was {{probably}} built in 1865 in {{the reign of}} the Qing Dynasty. It is a richly embellished residence situated on a spacious ground, with a large open space in the front and a garden at the back. The whole compound is surrounded by a green-brick wall. It is a fine example of traditional Chinese dwellings of the scholar-gentry class and is <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most elegant buildings throughout the territory.|$|E

25|$|There were {{subsequently}} other conflicts and incidents {{that were a}} part of the overall conflict, but are not usually seen {{in the context of the}} New Zealand Wars. The invasion of Parihaka in 1881 was <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these. There was an incident in the 1890s that became known as the Dog Tax War. Another was the arrest of Rua Kenana in 1916. It is even possible that events at Bastion Point in the 1970s should be considered as part of the same scenario.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{allege that}} Muir {{purchased}} the land illegally. The {{reason for the}} allegation is that the Colonial Secretary's records have no record of the sale transaction; the record notes simply that the land grant passed from Lightfoot to Ryan. However, {{it is likely that}} Muir, who had studied law at Edinburgh University and had passed his bar examinations in 1787 at the age of 22, had arranged a private contract for the sale of the land. If so, this was almost <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first contracts for the sale of property in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Plank used radical {{combinations}} of echo, reverberation and other electronic, mixing, equalisation, editing and tape-based effects to create mixes {{in which every}} element might be given its own highly individual sound environment, and in which each of these elements might alter radically in sound several times {{over the course of}} a track. In this he was undoubtedly influenced by the work of Jamaican pioneers like Lee 'Scratch' Perry but he was <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first European producers to adopt key stylistic innovations sourced from these reggae and dub production techniques.|$|E

25|$|Not {{directly}} on the street but {{a short distance away}} on one of the side streets stands the Palazzo Belgioioso, one of the masterpieces of Milan's Neoclassical architecture. The building is <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the finest examples of the Neoclassical citizens' residences and was a haunt of Milan's intellectuals. It was designed in 1772 by Giuseppe Piermarini who in this instance abandoned the sober and austere style of early Neoclassicism, building an imposing and highly decorated mansion which dominates the street. Here too, the most lavishly decorated part of the facade is the slightly protruding central section with a series of four giant columns, an entablature and a tympanum enclosed by pilasters. The ground floor is finished in rusticated bugnato ashlar, the first floor, separated from the second with bas-reliefs of heraldic symbols, has windows crowned with garlands and decorative mouldings. Some of the rooms still have period decorations, the most famous of which are the gallery decorated with frescoes by Martin Knoller and stuccos by Giocondo Albertolli. Rinaldo's room, also decorated by Knoller, was inspired by Torquato Tasso's epic poem Jerusalem Delivered.|$|E
25|$|The {{new town}} {{was laid out}} {{along the line of}} a street, later to be called Briggate, which was wide enough to hold a market, with about thirty burgage plots on either side. The south end of the street had a river {{crossing}} but the earliest recorded bridge, from which its name is derived (bridge gate), is in 1384. The population was small in 1207 and remained scanty for a long time afterwards. At the time of the Poll Tax of 1379 it appears not to have exceeded three hundred persons at the very outside; it was <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the smallest towns in Yorkshire, such places as Snaith, Ripon, Tickhill, and Selby exceeding it in importance. Even in the thirteenth century, Leeds consisted of several distinct areas of habitation and activity. There was the old settlement around the parish church, the newly founded borough, the manor house and mill to the west and the town fields at Burmantofts (borough men's tofts). By establishing the borough the manorial revenues were increased and Leeds became more prosperous. Tax returns of 1334 and 1377 show that population of the whole parish before the Black Death was about 1,000 people of whom 350 to 400 lived in the central area including the borough. Leeds began to rank with the more prosperous towns to the east.|$|E

I couldn't grumble about that. We used to get on very well, and he would listen to the {{instructions}} I gave him. Then he became world famous!" [...] The respect was mutual: though Greaves described the Chelsea title-winning side as [...] "almost <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the least talented teams ever to win the title", he made an exception for McNichol, [...] "the ball player of the team". In all competitions, he made 202 appearances for Chelsea and scored 66 goals.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jakob Dorof of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "Hands All Over" [...] is [...] "the one real gamble"; {{despite the fact}} that it tries to hard to find a missing connection between the works of Prince, Queen and Nine Inch Nails, [...] "it's <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the more interesting things the band has ever recorded." [...] Similarly, McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that on songs like [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Stutter", the Maroon 5 shows a band [...] "who are really at their best when they play pop music like the sleazy rockers they clearly are." [...] Contactmusic's Banimaer stated that although the track is a little repetitive, it shows what kind of band Maroon 5 wants to be.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the church}} {{structure}} itself, {{it was noted}} in Architecture Worth Saving in Onondaga County (1964) that [...] "This is <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most architecturally distinguished churches in Onondaga County, and a particularly fine example of Greek Revival architecture [...] The interior was unfortunately 'improved' with new arrangement of pews, and organ, new windows, carpets and chandeliers in 1896 [...] In recent years the steeple was blown down, falling into the nave. Although rebuilt to approximately the original proportions, the transitional detail between the square belfry and the conical spire was unfortunately eliminated. Also regrettable [...] is the recent replacement of the original wood-paneled entrance doors [...] The future of our finest Greek Revival church is uncertain [...] Destruction would be a loss to the entire community." ...|$|E

500|$|Every so often, I’d get a {{call from}} the {{producer}} saying, it’s going out at this time.

It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen. I mean, a lot of shows are left on people’s desks and they hardly get seen, and Joking Apart was <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of The Brittas Empire, and you thought, [...] "Bloody Hell! Come on, surely….?" [...] To my mind, our show was a very superior product, and it upset me that other shows, which I, personally, felt were broader and less interesting, were getting precedence.|$|E
500|$|... "On the Mindless Menace of Violence" [...] {{has been}} greatly overshadowed by Kennedy's Indianapolis remarks and largely ignored by scholars, but the speech is still {{considered}} {{by some to be}} historically significant. [...] Journalist Jack Newfield said the speech was [...] "probably the best written text of the campaign, and perhaps of Kennedy's public career." [...] Another journalist, David Halberstam, considered it [...] "perhaps the best speech of the campaign, perhaps the best speech of his life." [...] Greenfield also later called the address [...] "the best written speech of the campaign." [...] Mankiewicz wrote that it was [...] "perhaps the best speech Robert Kennedy made during the campaign, and <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best of his career" [...] and [...] "the most eloquent and memorable of RFK's view of humanity and the threats to its flowering and [...] survival." [...] Following Kennedy's assassination in June 1968, Representative Charles Vanik of Ohio, in a speech before the House of Representatives, called the City Club address the late senator's [...] "most significant statement [...] on crime and violence". In Newfield's opinion the speech was a suitable epitaph for Kennedy himself.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Peter Hunter Blair summarises Wilfrid's life as follows: [...] "Wilfrid left {{a distinctive}} {{mark on the}} character of the English church in the seventh century. He was not a humble man, nor, so far as we can see, was he a man greatly interested in learning, and perhaps he would have been more at home {{as a member of the}} Gallo-Roman episcopate where the wealth which gave him enemies in England would have passed unnoticed and where his interference in matters of state would have been less likely to take him to prison." [...] R. W. Southern, another modern historian, says that Wilfrid was [...] "the greatest papal enthusiast of the century". James Campbell, a historian specialising in the Anglo-Saxon period, said of him [...] "He was <b>certainly</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the greatest ecclesiastics of his day. Ascetic, deemed a saint by some, the founder of several monasteries according to the rule of St Benedict, he established Christianity in Sussex and attempted to do so in Frisia. At the same time, his life and conduct were in some respects like those of a great Anglo-Saxon nobleman." ...|$|E
