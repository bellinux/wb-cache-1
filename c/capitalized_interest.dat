50|$|An ongoing {{question}} for the accounting of any company is whether certain expenses should be capitalized or expensed. Costs which are expensed in a particular month simply appear on the financial statement as a cost incurred that month. Costs that are capitalized, however, are amortized or depreciated over multiple years. Capitalized expenditures {{show up on the}} balance sheet. Most ordinary business expenses are clearly either expensable or capitalizable, but some expenses could be treated either way, according to the preference of the company. <b>Capitalized</b> <b>interest</b> if applicable is also spread out {{over the life of the}} asset.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} several years, MOHELA has become a debt {{servicer}} {{for the federal government}} for student loans from all over the nation. Over 500,000 public student loan accounts were transferred from the U.S. Department of Education and other servicers to MOHELA for handling. There have been many complaints from borrowers about loan handling during and after the switch to MOHELA. Many borrowers have complained of charges for late payments due to delayed processing of payments made to the Dept. of Ed. before the transfer, suspension of auto-payment programs, increased payment amounts, increased estimated repayment dates, changes to the borrower's selected repayment plan, unwanted forebearances and deferments, failure to process forms, and applied or <b>capitalized</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E

40|$|According to the General Framework for {{preparing}} and presenting {{the financial statements}} elaborated by IASB, the utility of information is provided by attributes (qualitative features), such as: intelligibility, relevance, credibility and comparability. For being credible, the financial information shall be erroneous, shall not be biased or deforming the patrimony, {{and one of the}} elements representing and defining the information credibility is the prudency. Thus, the prudential accounting treatments affect, on the one hand, the accounting information relevance and credibility, and on the other hand, equally, both the producers as well as the users of the financial information, due to the economic consequences which are generated. From this perspective and considering that the implied economic agents are not neutral in terms of their option concerning the neutral accounting practices, prudent or aggressive, we opined that it is useful to conduct a study aiming the relevance of the accounting information related to the deferred taxes generated by the <b>capitalized</b> <b>interests</b> in the amount of the fix assets, recognizing the value of these taxes having as result the compliance with the principle of prudency within the accountancy. In this context, compared to the dominant accounting systems, respectively the continental system and the Anglo- Saxon system, within which the accounting information is characterized as legal, respectively addressed to the external users, especially to the investors, the conducted study aimed the following directions: the main differences between the provisions of the national, European, Anglo-Saxon accounting regulations and those of the international referential related to the prudency; the occurrence and evolution of the deferred taxes generated by the <b>capitalized</b> <b>interests</b> in the amount of the fix assets; informational benefits of the accounting prudency concerning the reflection of the deferred taxes established by the <b>capitalized</b> <b>interests</b> in the amount of the fix asset, directions on whose structure we conceived the conducted study, such that the modeled reality to be correctly and reasonably represented for the users of the financial statements...|$|R

5000|$|Approximately USD $374.3 {{million was}} {{invested}} into the Wynn Palace Cotai project {{during the first}} quarter of 2015, making the accumulative investment equal to USD $2.2 billion. As of April 2015, the total projected budget including [...] "construction costs, <b>capitalized</b> <b>interest,</b> pre-opening expenses, land costs and financing fees" [...] was USD $4.1 billion. Wynn Macau, Ltd was seeking government approval for 500 gaming tables by the fall of 2015. In November 2015, around 130 non-resident construction workers for Wynn Palace staged a meeting outside the PRC Liaison Office, alleging unpaid and involuntary overtime. The Labour Affairs Bureau (DSAL) subsequently stated that it had been aware of the situation since October 2015, and had promised staff to examine the issue. Also in November 2015, general construction delays pushed the projected opening back three months, from March 25, 2016 to the original date of June 25, 2016. As a result, Leighton Holdings (then renamed CIMIC) lost access to a USD $38 million bonus. Wynn Resorts share values fell 6 percent after the announcement, before rising again shortly afterwards. Wynn Macau, Ltd stated in January 2016 that if substantial delays continued, CIMIC might be liable for a maximum of USD $200 million in damages. Following a further update, the current expected opening date is August 22, 2016.|$|E

40|$|Background. When governments issue bonds they deposit {{proceeds}} {{or other}} monies in various accounts, which may include a construction fund, debt service fund, <b>capitalized</b> <b>interest</b> fund, debt service reserve, or an escrow fund in a refunding. Monies allocated to these funds are invested until needed. The investment strategy for each fund will depend, in part, on {{federal or state}} statutes and regulations governing the types of instruments permitted to be used, the yield permitted for the fund, requirements from rating agencies and/or credit enhancement providers, and the anticipated drawdown of bond proceeds. Additionally, each of these funds will have different investment objectives, so there are many factors to be considered by the government when selecting an investment instrument. Furthermore, governments need to be mindful that cash flow analyses are critical components {{of the process and}} can mitigate the possibility of negative arbitrage that may occur. This could affect the entire structure and sizing of the debt financing. Recommendation. The Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) recommends that state and local governments develop an understanding of the risks inherent in investing bond proceeds and incorporate steps in their investment strategy for each fund to minimize these risks. Three types of risk are: (1) credit risk (safety), the risk of investing in instruments that may default; (2) market risk (liquidity), the risk of selling an investment prior to maturity or at less than book value; and (3) opportunity risk (yield/return), the risk of investing long term an...|$|E
