25|$|The WC {{was popular}} in the Great Depression for its good value, {{affordable}} price, and frugal design elements. Two factors that lowered its cost of manufacture, and thus its sales price, were that it was made partially from off-the-shelf components, and that its steel <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> frame eliminated the need for large, heavy castings for the transmission and rear end (as were often used in tractors of the era). Its power was ample for the time and class, allowing it to pull a two-bottom plow.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>iron</b> systems {{typically}} form {{within a}} depression on the Cenozoic ‘Hamersley Surface’, and form several pods downstream on the palaeodrainage. The channels show typical fluvial sedimentary morphology, with channel scours truncating or incising the <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> deposits, and rare examples of graded bedding, and so on. Individual ore deposits are subsets {{of a larger}} sub-economic mineralized system, which varies laterally and along the palaeodrainage. The deposits form lensoidal accumulations with interbeds of clays, gravels and siliceous detrital materials.|$|E
50|$|The key {{economic}} criteria for <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> deposits are, firstly tonnage and location relative to infrastructure {{similar to other}} bulk commodities. Thereafter, {{the nature of the}} cement is important, particularly in the cases of carbonate cements containing magnesite, as magnesium is a problem. Rare <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> deposits are rendered uneconomic because of a silica cement proving too durable for easy mining and crushing. The water content of <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> deposits (quoted as Loss on Ignition) is from 7% to 12%, which is the highest of all iron ore types, generally due to the presence of goethite-limonite. Phosphorus, aluminium and sulfur levels are another concern, typically being above normal levels in-situ although if the phosphorus and aluminium are hosted in a weak cement, they can often be washed out during beneficiation. Most channel irons are upgraded via washing of the pisolite gravels to remove the cements and matrix.|$|E

5000|$|Popov {{nearly doubled}} the {{thickness}} of the armour on Vitse-admiral Popov compared to that on Novgorod. The design was complicated by the inability of the Izhorskiye Zavody ironworks to roll armour plates more than 9 in thick, so Popov decided to build a [...] "sandwich" [...] of armour. The outer belt armour was separated by 9 inches of teak reinforced by interlocking <b>channel</b> <b>irons</b> from the inner armour layer, which was itself backed by another 9 inches of teak and <b>channel</b> <b>irons.</b> The upper strake of the outer armour was also 9 inches thick and the lower was 7 in thick. The inner armour was also 7 inches thick, which gave a total thickness of 16 in at the waterline and 14 in below it. The armour of the ship's barbette was identical to that of the upper strake of the belt armour. The rounded deck was protected by a total of 2.75 in of armour, made up of three layers of plates ranging in thickness from 0.75 to 1 in.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>iron</b> {{deposits}} are {{an important}} source of iron ore, with the deposits at Yandi and Robe River accounting for approximately 47% of iron ore mined from the Hamerley Iron province. Although <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> deposits are typically low-grade at 53% to 57% Fe in-situ, they are composed of goethite-limonite which are hydrated iron oxide species. Ore typically contains around 8% to 12% water, and <5% SiO2, and <3% Al2O3. The hydrous iron oxides can be calcined, and the CID ore on a volatile-free basis is around 63% Fe or more.|$|E

40|$|Ferritin is a multimeric {{nanocage}} {{protein that}} directs the reversible biomineralization of iron. At the catalytic ferroxidase site two iron(II) ions react with dioxygen to form diferric species. In order {{to study the}} pathway of iron(III) from the ferroxidase site to the central cavity a new NMR strategy was developed to manage the investigation of a system composed of 24 monomers of 20  kDa each. The strategy is based on 13 C- 13 C solution NOESY experiments combined with solid-state proton-driven 13 C- 13 C spin diffusion and 3 D coherence transfer experiments. In this way, 75 % of amino acids were recognized and 35 % sequence-specific assigned. Paramagnetic broadening, induced by iron(III) species in solution 13 C- 13 C NOESY spectra, localized the iron within each subunit and traced the progression to the central cavity. Eight iron ions fill the 20 -Å-long <b>iron</b> <b>channel</b> from the ferrous/dioxygen oxidoreductase site to the exit into the cavity, inside the four-helix bundle of each subunit, contrasting with short paths in models. Magnetic susceptibility data support the formation of ferric multimers in the <b>iron</b> <b>channels.</b> Multiple <b>iron</b> <b>channel</b> exits are near enough to facilitate high concentration of iron that can mineralize in the ferritin cavity, illustrating advantages of the multisubunit cage structure...|$|R

5000|$|On the Tay Bridge the {{diagonal}} bracing was {{by means of}} flat bars running from one lug at the column section top (an {{integral part of the}} column casting) to two sling plates bolted to {{the diagonal}}ly opposite lug. Bar and sling plates all had a matching longitudinal slot in them; the tie bar was placed between the sling plates with all three slots aligned and overlapping and a gib driven through all three slots and secured. Two cotters (metal wedges) were then positioned to fill the rest of the slot overlap, and driven in hard to put the tie under tension. Horizontal bracing was provided by (wrought iron) <b>channel</b> <b>iron.</b> The various bolt heads were too close to each other, and to the column for easy tightening up with spanners; this coupled with lack of precision in the preparation of the <b>channel</b> <b>iron</b> braces led to various on site fitting expedients (one of them described by a witness to the enquiry as [...] "about as slovenly a piece of work as ever I saw in my life").) ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>iron</b> {{deposits}} {{are formed}} by accumulation of massive deposits {{of what is}} generally referred to as “pisolite iron gravels”, which are ooids and pisoids of goethite. CIDs were initially considered to be analogous to accumulations of pisolite gravels within palaeochannels via sedimentary means. Modern evidence points to an in-situ formation of the classic pisoilitic textures. Goethite ooids and pisoids show evidence of being formed by concretion of layers of goethite (cortex) around a core fragment (nucleus) which is typically ferruginised wood fragments, but may be quartz grains, hematite grains or other detrital material. It is considered that the mechanism for enrichment and formation of the goethite cortex is related to near-surface alteration of an existing highly ferruginous material by groundwater action. Ferruginised wood is ubiquitous and {{a major component of}} CIDs, existing as porous, friable limonite. Fossilised wood fragments are present but are usually extremely rare and of very small size (<50 mm). The goethite pisolites are cemented via a variety of agents, usually a mixture of goethite, clays, carbonate minerals (magnesite, calcite and sometimes siderite), and occasionally silica. This process may form an in-situ concretion of pisolites which may be very resistant to erosion - some mesas in the Pilbara, and Yilgarn are in fact old cemented ferruginous pisolite river gravels.|$|E
