5000|$|To {{make all}} that work correctly, the system allows {{automatic}} increases and decreases in transmitter power (for the individual {{cell phone and}} for the tower repeater, too) so that only the minimum transmit power is used to complete and hold the <b>call</b> <b>active,</b> [...] "on," [...] and allows the users to hear and be heard continuously during the conversation. The goal is to hold the <b>call</b> <b>active</b> but use {{the least amount of}} transmitting power, mainly to conserve batteries and be efficient. The tower system will sense when a cell phone is not coming in clearly and will order the cell phone to boost transmit power. The user has no control over this boosting; it may occur for a split second or for the whole conversation. If the user is in a remote location, the power boost may be continuous. In addition to carrying voice or data, the cell phone also transmits data about itself automatically, and that is boosted or not as the system detects need.|$|E

This paper addresses the lacuna in the business rights literature by 'bringing outcomes back in'.

Previous research has solved this problem by using the K-tuples approach in a time complexity of O(Kn 3). In this paper, efficient algorithms based on dynamic programming are derived to improve the time complexity for the overlapping case. The algorithms find the first, second and third maximum convex sum, {{and up to the}} Kth maximum convex sum in the time complexity of O(n 3 +Kn 2) applying a new method which we <b>call</b> <b>Active</b> Trace Overlapping-Shape (ATOS). In addition, efficient techniques have been developed for designing and implementing the derived algorithms. Moreover, experiments performed to compare the running time for the two methods.

In traditional approaches, high level knowledge {{is used in the}} post-processing to combine the outputs of the object detectors to achieve better classification performance. In contrast, the proposed approach employs high level knowledge actively by implementing an interaction between a reasoning module and a sensory module (Figure 1). Following this paradigm, we implemented an active scene recognizer and evaluated it with a dataset of 20 scenes and 100 + objects. We also extended it to the analysis of dynamic scenes for activity recognition with attributes. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the active paradigm in introducing attention and additional constraints into the sensing process...|$|E

40|$|In {{our work}} {{we focus on}} Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems in {{e-commerce}} distribution centers. These systems were designed to increase pick rates by employing mobile robots bringing movable storage units (so-called pods) to pick and replenishment stations as needed, {{and back to the}} storage area afterwards. One advantage of this approach is that repositioning of inventory can be done continuously, even during pick and replenishment operations. This is primarily accomplished by bringing a pod to a storage location different than the one it was fetched from, a process we call passive pod repositioning. Additionally, this can be done by explicitly bringing a pod from one storage location to another, a process we <b>call</b> <b>active</b> pod repositioning. In this work we introduce first mechanisms for the latter technique and conduct a simulation-based experiment to give first insights of their effect...|$|E
40|$|Phase {{transitions}} {{of active}} rotator systems with short-range coupling are discussed. The constituents {{of the system}} which we <b>call</b> <b>active</b> rotators are represented by a phase model of a limit-cycle oscillator or an excitable element, i. e., dt/J/dt = w-bsint/J, (Iw/bl<l). The rotators are subject to noises, and fer-romagnetic type coupling is assumed between them. The effect of infinitesimal noises on a perfectly. ordered motion is examined for various spatial dimensions by using a linear approximation. As a result, a macroscopic in-phase oscillation throughout the system turned out impossible for 1 and 2 dimensions, but possible for 3 dimensions. An interesting feature expected for a two-dimensional system {{is that there is}} a finite parameter region where characteristic length scale is absent. In order to see the latter feature in more detail, we performed a Langevin simulation for a two-dimensional system, and confirmed the existence of a Kosterlitz-Thouless type parameter region...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a new class}} of thin, dexterous con-tinuum robots, which we <b>call</b> <b>active</b> cannulas due to their potential medical applications. An active cannula is composed of telescop-ing, concentric, precurved superelastic tubes that can be axially translated and rotated at the base relative to one another. Active cannulas derive bending not from tendon wires or other exter-nal mechanisms but from elastic tube interaction in the backbone itself, permitting high dexterity and small size, and dexterity im-proves with miniaturization. They are designed to traverse narrow and winding environments without relying on “guiding ” environ-mental reaction forces. These features seem ideal for a variety of applications where a very thin robot with tentacle-like dexterity is needed. In this paper, we apply beam mechanics to obtain a kine-matic model of active cannula shape and describe design tools that result from the modeling process. After deriving general equations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{propose a}} new finite {{population}} model for cellular mobile systems with traveling users. In this model, mobile users arrive {{according to a}} Poisson process from outside the system, independently travel in the system, and leave the system in due time. A mobile user is either in <b>call</b> (<b>active)</b> or out of call (inactive). We find that if two minor modifications are made to the model, the joint distribution {{of the number of}} calls in progress in each cell has the product form. Making the two modifications is referred to as product-form approximation in this paper. Under the product-form approximation, the probability that channels are fully occupied in a cell is given by the Erlangloss formula. We evaluate the accuracy of the product-form approximation through several simulation experiments, and find that the Erlang-loss formula remains applicable to the performance evaluation and channel provisioning of cellular mobile systems...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a new approach}} to managing large image databases which we <b>call</b> <b>active</b> browsing. Active browsing integrates relevance feedback into the browsing environment, so that users can modify the database's organization to suit the desired task. Our method is based on a similarity pyramid data structure which hierarchically organizes the database {{so that it can be}} e#ciently browsed. At coarse levels, the similarity pyramid allows users to view the database as large clusters of similar images. Alternatively, users can "zoom into" finer levels to view individual images. We discuss relevance feedback for the browsing process, and argue that it is fundamentally di#erent from relevance feedback for more traditional search-by-query tasks. We propose two fundamental operations for active browsing: pruning and reorganization. Both of these operation depend on a user defined relevance set which represents the image or set of images desired by the user. We present statistical m [...] ...|$|E
