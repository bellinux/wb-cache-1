5|$|The <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency,</b> the Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires and the peninsulars {{opposed the}} new situation. The Royal Audiencia {{secretly}} swore {{allegiance to the}} <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency</b> a month later and sent communiqués to the other cities of the Viceroyalty, to request them to deny recognition to the new government. To {{put an end to}} these activities, the Junta assembled Cisneros and {{all the members of the}} Royal Audiencia on the pretext that their lives were in danger, and sent them into exile aboard the British ship Dart. Captain Mark Brigut Larrea was instructed to avoid American ports and deliver all of them directly to the Canary Islands. The Junta then appointed a new Audiencia composed entirely of criollos loyal to the revolution.|$|E
5|$|After Longchamp's exile Coutances {{was named}} {{head of a}} <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>regency,</b> which is {{sometimes}} equated to the post of Chief Justiciar, although he never referred to himself as such nor is he titled that in any official document. Most modern historians, however, name him as justiciar. He held that power until about 25 December 1193, when Hubert Walter was appointed Justiciar.|$|E
5|$|Every {{city in the}} {{territory}} of modern Argentina other than Córdoba endorsed the Primera Junta. The cities of the Upper Peru, however, did not take a position, owing to the recent outcomes of the Chuquisaca and La Paz Revolutions. Asunción del Paraguay rejected the Junta and swore loyalty to the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency.</b> The Banda Oriental, under Francisco Javier de Elío, remained a royalist stronghold.|$|E

He also held the titles of comte de Mussidan, baron de Castelnau, Caumont, Tunneins, Samazin, Feuillet, Taillebourg, Boësse, Cugnac, Roquepine, Maduran and la Boulaye. He was a colonel of a regiment of his name, as well as a councillor to the <b>councils</b> <b>of</b> <b>regency</b> and finance.|$|R

The regency {{came to an}} end when Major General Muhammad Naguib took power and {{declared}} Egypt a republic, ending the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty.|$|R
5|$|Montevideo, {{which had}} a {{historical}} rivalry with Buenos Aires, opposed the Primera Junta and the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency</b> declared it the new capital of the Viceroyalty, along with Francisco Javier de Elío as the new Viceroy. The city was well defended, so it could easily resist an invasion. Peripheral cities in the Banda Oriental acted contrary to Montevideo's will and supported the Buenos Aires Junta. José Gervasio Artigas led them, and kept Montevideo under siege. The final defeat of the Montevidean royalists {{was carried out by}} Carlos María de Alvear and William Brown.|$|E
5|$|The mutiny of Aranjuez in 1808 led King CharlesIV of Spain to abdicate {{in favor}} of his son, FerdinandVII. CharlesIV {{requested}} that Napoleon restore him to the throne; instead, Napoleon crowned his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as the new Spanish King. These events are known as the Abdications of Bayonne. Joseph's coronation was met with severe resistance in Spain, which started the Peninsular War, and the Supreme Central Junta took power {{in the name of}} the absent king. This also led to Spain switching allegiances from France to Britain. France eventually invaded Sevilla, and a <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency</b> based in Cadiz replaced the disbanded Supreme Central Junta.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution was {{a direct}} {{reaction}} to Spain's Peninsular War. In 1808, King FerdinandVII of Spain abdicated in favor of Napoleon, who granted the throne to his brother, Joseph Bonaparte. A Supreme Central Junta led resistance to Joseph's government and the French occupation of Spain, but eventually suffered a series of reversals {{that resulted in the}} Spanish loss of the northern half of the country. On February1, 1810, French troops took Seville and gained control of most of Andalusia. The Supreme Junta retreated to Cadiz and dissolved itself, and the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency</b> of Spain and the Indies replaced it. News of these events arrived in Buenos Aires on May18, brought by British ships.|$|E
50|$|De Durisdeer was {{an active}} player in the {{national}} governmental scene, attending the parliaments of 1464, 1467, 1468, 1469 and 1471. After the death of James II in 1460, he was appointed {{as one of the}} seven people on the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Regency.</b> He also played a role as an ambassador, visiting England in 1463 to negotiate the Treaty of York and travelling to Denmark in 1468 to arrange a marriage between the young King James III and Margaret of Denmark.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Limoges, France, to a family of magistrates. His father, Henri d'Aguesseau, a {{hereditary}} councillor of the parlement of Metz, {{was a man of}} singular ability and breadth of view who, after holding successively the posts of intendant of Limousin, Guyenne and Languedoc, was in 1685 called to Paris as councillor of state, appointed director-general of commerce and manufactures in 1695, president <b>of</b> the <b>council</b> <b>of</b> commerce in 1700 and a member <b>of</b> the <b>council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>regency</b> for finance. By him he was early initiated into affairs and brought up in religious principles deeply tinged with Jansenism.|$|R
60|$|As soon as Law {{was fairly}} {{out of the}} way, the Duke of Orleans summoned a <b>council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>regency,</b> and {{informed}} {{them that they were}} assembled to deliberate {{on the state of the}} finances, and the affairs of the India Company. Accordingly La Houssaye, comptroller-general, rendered a perfectly clear statement, by which it appeared that there were bank bills in circulation to the amount of two milliards, seven hundred millions of livres, without any evidence that this enormous sum had been emitted in virtue of any ordinance from the general assembly of the India Company, which alone had the right to authorize such emissions.|$|R
5|$|Viceroy Cisneros {{tried to}} {{maintain}} the political status quo, but a group of criollo lawyers and military officials organized an open cabildo (a special meeting of notables of the city) on May22 to decide {{the future of the}} Viceroyalty. Delegates denied recognition to the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency</b> in Spain and established a junta to govern in place of Cisneros, since the government that had appointed him Viceroy no longer existed. To maintain a sense of continuity, Cisneros was initially appointed president of the Junta. However, this caused much popular unrest, so he resigned under pressure on May25. The newly formed government, the Primera Junta, included only representatives from Buenos Aires and invited other cities of the Viceroyalty to send delegates to join them. This resulted in the outbreak of war between the regions that accepted the outcome of the events at Buenos Aires and those that did not.|$|E
5|$|Upon Henry's death, he was {{succeeded by}} his son Edward VI. Since Edward was then only nine years old, he could not rule directly. Instead, Henry's will {{designated}} 16 executors to serve on a <b>council</b> <b>of</b> <b>regency</b> until Edward {{reached the age of}} 18. The executors chose Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, Jane Seymour's elder brother, to be Lord Protector of the Realm. If Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs. If Mary's issue failed, the crown was to go to Elizabeth, Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn, and her heirs. Finally, if Elizabeth's line became extinct, the crown was to be inherited by the descendants of Henry VIII's deceased younger sister, Mary, the Greys. The descendants of Henry's sister Margaret– the Stuarts, rulers of Scotland– were thereby excluded from the succession. This final provision failed when James VI of Scotland became King of England in 1603.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{lasted from}} morning to midnight, {{including}} {{the reading of}} the proclamation, the debate and the vote. There was no secret ballot; votes were heard one at a time and recorded in the minutes. The main themes of the debate were the legitimacy of the government and the authority of the Viceroy. The principle of retroversion of the sovereignty to the people stated that, {{in the absence of the}} legitimate monarch, power returned to the people; they were entitled to form a new government. This principle was commonplace in Spanish scholasticism and rationalist philosophy, but had never been applied in case law. Its validity divided the assembly into two main groups: one group rejected it and argued that the situation should remain unchanged; this group supported Cisneros as Viceroy. The other group supported change, and considered that they should establish a junta, like the ones established in Spain to replace the Viceroy. There was also a third position, taking the middle ground. The promoters of change did not recognize the authority of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency,</b> and argued that the colonies in America were not consulted in its formation. The debate tangentially discussed the rivalry between criollos and peninsulars; the Viceroy supporters felt that the will of peninsulars should prevail over that of criollos.|$|E
50|$|At {{the death}} of Louis XIV, the regent Philippe d'Orléans, in search of {{political}} support, satisfied the aristocracy by replacing the ministers and secretaries of state with eight <b>councils</b> (declarations <b>of</b> September 15 and December 14, 1715) which were dominated by the inbred ancient aristocracy (descending from medieval knights, {{as opposed to the}} newer aristocracy of recently ennobled lawyers and civil servants). The <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Regency,</b> chaired by the regent, had no real power. The other councils shared government power. They were the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Matters within the Kingdom (Conseil des affaires du dedans du royaume), the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Conscience (Conseil de conscience) for religious matters, the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> War (Conseil de guerre), the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> the Navy (Conseil de marine), the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Finance (Conseil de finance), the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Foreign Affairs (Conseil des affaires étrangères), and the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Commerce (Conseil de commerce) for internal and foreign trade as well as for royal factories (manufactures). Each council had ten members and elected one president.|$|R
50|$|Anne {{was named}} regent upon her husband's death {{in spite of}} her late husband's wishes. With the aid of Pierre Séguier, she had the Parlement de Paris revoke the will of the late king, which would have limited her powers. Their four-year-old son was crowned King Louis XIV of France. Anne assumed the regency but to general {{surprise}} entrusted the government to the chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin, who was a protégé of Cardinal Richelieu and figured among the <b>council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>regency.</b> Mazarin left the Hôtel Tubeuf to take up residence at the Palais Royal near Queen Anne. Before long he was believed to be her lover, and, it was hinted, even her husband.|$|R
60|$|To engulf {{all classes}} in this ruinous vortex, Law now split {{the shares of}} fifty {{millions}} of stock each into one hundred shares; thus, as in the splitting of lottery tickets, accommodating the venture to the humblest purse. Society was thus stirred up to its very dregs, and adventurers of the lowest order hurried to the stock market. All honest, industrious pursuits, and modest gains, were now despised. Wealth was to be obtained instantly, without labor and without stint. The upper classes were as base in their venality as the lower. The highest and most powerful nobles, abandoning all generous pursuits and lofty aims, engaged in the vile scuffle for gam. They were even baser than the lower classes; for some of them, who were members <b>of</b> the <b>council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>regency,</b> abused their station and their influence, and promoted measures by which shares rose while in their hands, and they made immense profits.|$|R
5|$|On May14, 1810, the British war {{schooner}} HMS Mistletoe {{arrived at}} Buenos Aires with European newspapers that reported {{the dissolution of}} the Supreme Central Junta the previous January. The city of Seville had been invaded by French armies, which were already dominating most of the Iberian Peninsula. The newspapers reported that some of the former members of the Junta had taken refuge on the Isla de León in Cadiz. This was confirmed in Buenos Aires on May17, when the British frigate HMS John Paris arrived in Montevideo; the most recent newspapers reported that members of the Supreme Central Junta had been dismissed. The <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency</b> of Cadiz was not seen as a successor of the Spanish resistance but as an attempt to restore absolutism in Spain. The Supreme Central Junta was seen as sympathetic to the new ideas. South American patriots feared both a complete French victory in the peninsula and an absolutist restoration. Cisneros monitored the British warships and seized their newspapers, to conceal the news, but a newspaper came into the hands of Belgrano and Castelli. They spread the news among other patriots and challenged the legitimacy of the Viceroy, who had been appointed by the fallen junta. When Cornelio Saavedra, head of the regiment of Patricians, was informed of this news, he decided that it was finally the ideal time to take action against Cisneros. Martín Rodríguez proposed to overthrow the Viceroy by force, but Castelli and Saavedra rejected this idea and proposed the convening of an open cabildo.|$|E

50|$|Piłsudski {{became a}} popular hero when Berlin jailed him for insubordination. The Allies broke the {{resistance}} of the Central Powers by autumn 1918, as the Habsburg monarchy disintegrated and the German imperial government collapsed. The Greater Poland Uprising, one of the few Polish uprisings to actually succeed, that begun around that time, marks - with its success - the end of the Polish resistance to the partitioners. In October 1918, Polish authorities took over Galicia and Cieszyn Silesia. In November 1918, Piłsudski was released from internment in Germany by the revolutionaries and returned to Warsaw. Upon his arrival, on November 11, 1918 the <b>Regency</b> <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Regency</b> Kingdom <b>of</b> Poland (intended to be a German puppet state) ceded all responsibilities to him and Piłsudski took control over the newly created state as its provisional Chief of State. Soon all the local governments that had been created in the last months of the war pledged allegiance to the central government in Warsaw. Independent Poland, which had been absent from the map of Europe for 123 years, was reborn.|$|R
5000|$|Trouble {{was also}} brewing in the Hazara province. During {{the first months}} of Currie's Residency Captain James Abbot had warned Currie that discontent was rife in the Sikh brigade {{stationed}} there and in August he reported that its Governor, Sardar Chattar Singh Attariwalla was planning an uprising against the British. Abbott raised a Muslim force and marched on the capital to expel Chatar Singh. Currie ordered an investigation by Captain John Nicholson, whose report excused the defensive measures the Governor had taken to protect the capital, but drew attention to Chatar Singh's numerous previous actions, which had given rise to and justified Abbott's assessment. Accordingly, Currie issued orders that substantially reduced Chatar Singh's authority and income. This angered his son, Raja Sher Singh Atarivala, who was fighting on the British side with Edwardes against Diwan Mul Raj. Sher Singh was a prominent member <b>of</b> the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Regency</b> and was until then well disposed to British interests. [...] His sister was betrothed to Maharaja Duleep Singh and in November 1847 he had been honoured by the Lahore Durbar with the title Raja.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of the King and the {{economic}} independence of Brazil, Portugal entered a severe crisis that obliged João VI and the royal family to return to Portugal in 1821: a Liberal Revolution had broken out in Portugal in 1820, and the royal governors who ruled Portugal in the King's name had been replaced by a revolutionary <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency</b> formed to govern the European portion of the kingdom until the King's return. Indeed, the King's immediate return to Lisbon {{was one of the main}} demands of the Revolution. Under the revolutionary <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Regency,</b> a constituent assembly, known as the Portuguese Constitutional Courts (Cortes Constitucionais Portuguesas), was elected to abolish the absolute monarchy and replace it with a constitutional one. King João VI, then, yielding to pressure, returned to Europe. Brazilian representatives were elected to join the deliberations of the Constitutional Cortes of the kingdom.|$|E

He was wounded during the siege but managed to recover sufficiently to be present at the successful storming of Multan in January 1849 and at the surrender of the fortress of Chiniot shortly thereafter. He took part in the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 and accompanied Sir Walter Gilbert as he pursued the Sikhs and was at the surrender of the Sikh army.

During his minority he was extensively tutored in administrative skills by Raja Sir T.
