40|$|In lurcher {{mutually}} implies {{wild type}} mouse <b>chimeras</b> (lurcher <b>chimeras),</b> mutant Purkinje cells are transiently present and probably provide target support for afferent granule cells during the sensitive period of target- dependent cell death. Previous studies demonstrate that wild type Purkinje {{cells in the}} cerebella of mature lurcher <b>chimeras</b> often have atrophic dendritic morphologies, leading to the hypothesis that developmental deafferentation of wild type Purkinje cells occurs uniquely in lurcher <b>chimeras</b> following the period of mutant Purkinje cell loss. Other studies document the survival of a disproportionately large number of granule cells in these animals. Based on cell birthdate analyses, the hypothesis further proposes that deafferentation induces an up-regulation of trophic activity among the Purkinje cell population and the consequent rescue of late generated granule cells {{that might otherwise be}} lost to target related cell death. In the present study, we take advantage of phenotypic differences between the staggerer and lurcher mutations to test this hypothesis. While staggerer mutually implies wild type <b>chimeras</b> (staggerer <b>chimeras)</b> resemble lurcher <b>chimeras</b> in several respects, including extensive cell loss, they differ in that staggerer Purkinje cells never provide target support for granule cells. Hence the hypothesis predicts that Purkinje cells in these animals should not exhibit the atrophic morphologies found in lurcher <b>chimeras.</b> We have developed a new semiquantitative method for scoring dendritic morphology in a large number of Golgi-impregnated cells. We have used this method to characterize the distribution of wild type Purkinje cell morphologies in staggerer <b>chimeras,</b> and to compare these with the corresponding distributions of morphologies in lurcher <b>chimeras</b> and wild type mutually implies wild type <b>chimeras.</b> We find that morphologies in staggerer <b>chimeras</b> closely resemble those in control <b>chimeras.</b> Furthermore, Purkinje cells in both staggerer and wild type <b>chimeras</b> differ significantly from those in lurcher <b>chimeras.</b> These results confirm a direct prediction of the hypothesis...|$|R
