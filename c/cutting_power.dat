5|$|The {{depression}} produced waves up to 3ft (0.9m) around Anna Maria Island, {{where two}} people died of fatigue-related heart attacks after {{being caught in}} a rip current. Heavy rainfall in the New Orleans, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama areas—aided by instability from {{the remnants of the}} depression—flooded streets, inundating an apartment complex in the former city and <b>cutting</b> <b>power</b> to 1,921 customers in the latter city. Forty homes and businesses were flooded in Avoyelles Parish. Rainfall accumulations peaked south of Natchez, Mississippi, where 13.9in (353mm) was documented.|$|E
5|$|Springfield is in {{the midst}} of a massive heat wave. Every {{building}} in the town has installed a large air conditioning device. However, this draws a lot of power from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (<b>cutting</b> <b>power</b> to the orphanage), the plant is at full power. At home, without an air conditioning device, the Simpsons have to follow an old-fashioned fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by plugging in his dancing Santa Claus. This overloads the plant and causes a town-wide blackout. Eventually, widespread rioting and looting occur. The police try to intervene, but are powerless to stop the massive crime wave.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, the {{northern}} and southern Gyeongsang provinces were the most heavily impacted. At least 6,000ha (15,000ac) of paddy fields were flooded. Heavy rains caused the Nakdong River to breach a section of embankment, prompting the evacuation of 100families. Flood warnings were issued by the KMA on sections of the river {{for the first time in}} 2000. In South Gyeongsang, an electricity pylon collapsed, <b>cutting</b> <b>power</b> supply to about 700houses. Strong winds uprooted trees and destroyed homes and fishing boats in Pusan. Countrywide, losses were initially estimated at KR₩20billion (US$18million), though these figures later rose to US$71million. As a result of Saomai, eight people were killed, and 411others were displaced. More than 600buildings were either inundated or destroyed entirely. At the height of the storm, roughly 422,000households were without power, primarily in northern and southern Gyeongsang provinces.|$|E

5|$|Although Igor steered well {{clear of}} the Caribbean, large swells of 15–20ft (4.6–6.1m) {{propagated}} from the storm, drowning one person in St. Croix and another in Puerto Rico. Large waves affected the East Coast of the United States, and one person drowned in Surf City, North Carolina. In Bermuda, sustained winds of 91mph (146km/h) and gusts up to 117mph (188km/h) downed trees and power lines, <b>cutting</b> <b>power</b> to approximately 28,000 residents. Rainfall was largely insignificant, peaking at 3.19in (81mm). Impacts near the storm's landfall in Newfoundland were more severe. Rainfall amounts of more than 2in (50mm) were widespread, with a peak of 9.37in (238mm) in St Lawrence; as such, Igor ranks as the third wettest tropical cyclone to impact Atlantic Canada. Run-off from the torrential rainfall damaged or destroyed structures, killed a man when his driveway was washed out and he was swept away, and isolated approximately 150 communities. Sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) with gusts to 107mph (172km/h) in Cape Pine downed trees and power lines while damaging or destroying many homes. Approximately 50,000 households lost power during {{the peak of the}} storm. The overall damage total reached $200 million across Newfoundland, making Igor the costliest hurricane on record there. It was regarded as the worst storm of tropical origin to hit Newfoundland since 1935.|$|E
5|$|In Grenada, Earl {{produced}} {{heavy rains}} and strong winds that caused moderate damage. On the main island, roofs were blown off twelve homes while three others were partially damaged; twelve trees and six power poles were also knocked {{down by the}} winds. The heavy rain associated with the tropical storm triggered nine mudslides and three rockslides on the island. Nearby, six homes had their roofs completely blown off while thirteen others were damaged. Flooding was also reported on both islands; however, no known damage resulted from them. During the storm, a nursing home had to be evacuated due to significant damage to the structure. On St Vincent and the Grenadines, at least two homes had their roofs blown off and banana crops sustained moderate damage. In Tobago, numerous trees and power lines were downed throughout the island, <b>cutting</b> <b>power</b> to 90% of the island. The highest surface sustained winds in relation to Earl occurred {{on the morning of}} August 15 in Barbados and St. Lucia; winds were reported at 35mph (55km/h). One person was killed by the storm and nineteen others were listed as missing.|$|E
5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily <b>cutting</b> <b>power</b> to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was a different matter. Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became much more exuberant than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E

25|$|After {{several months}} of ongoing campaigning against the planned abolitions, on January 1 tram drivers and {{conductors}} took control of their trams and began to operate them for free as a “work-in” in protest against the State Government’s plans. The State Government responded by <b>cutting</b> <b>power</b> to Melbourne’s tram grid, leaving hundreds of trams grounded in the city’s CBD between Elizabeth and Bourke Street. At the same time tramways workers occupied and took control of tram depots at Essendon, Brunswick and South Melbourne {{as part of their}} effort to demand that Premier John Cain and Transport Minister Jim Kennan to reverse their plans to abolish conductors. The dispute ultimately turned into a month-long lockout – although Melbourne’s tramways were left paralysed {{for the duration of the}} dispute, the abolition of conductors ultimately went ahead. Despite this the ATMOEA did win some concessions as a result of the dispute, with tram conductors being phased out gradually over an 8-year period and many being retrained as ticket inspectors.|$|E
25|$|The plant {{comprises}} six separate {{boiling water}} reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and {{maintained by the}} Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At {{the time of the}} quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, <b>cutting</b> <b>power</b> to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting).|$|E
