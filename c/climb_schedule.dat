50|$|When the {{climbing}} groups started upward at 3 a.m., {{they found that}} the HAPs and Sherpas had started planting lines right above Camp IV, where they were not needed, up into the Bottleneck, and then had run out of rope for the traverse just above the Bottleneck. This forced the climbers to take rope from the lower portion of the route and use it to prepare the lines above the Bottleneck, causing a dangerous unplanned delay in the <b>climb</b> <b>schedule.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{competitive}} market will keep asking airlines for better services and lower prices, imposing pressure on costs. Therefore, {{it is important}} for an airline to establish operational standards that will allow an aircraft to be operated more efficiently. The implementation of the Economic Speeds defined by the Cost Index can represent significant operating cost reductions when compared to simply flying Fixed Speeds. Different aircraft models today are equipped with Flight Management Computers (FMC) that are capable of automatically calculating the Economic Speeds based on the Airline Cost Index. In the other hand, several aircraft types manufactured by world leading companies and flown by many airlines around the globe are equipped with FMCs that do not have this capability. Accordingly, this work focuses on the Economic Speeds defined by the Cost Index. More specifically, the Cost Index Methodology is discussed and its fundamentals are applied to the climb phase of the flight. Finally, a methodology for the generation of a practical guidance that allows the determination of the Economic <b>Climb</b> Speed <b>Schedule</b> during the daily operation is presented, allowing an airline with a fleet equipped with FMCs not capable of automatically calculating the Economic <b>Climb</b> Speed <b>Schedule</b> {{to take advantage of the}} potential operating cost reduction. The proposed methodology can be applied on the development of a calculation software to be installed on an Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) or to be used for generating data to be sent directly to the flight crew in the cockpit through a Datalink System. In case an EFB or a Datalink System are not an alternative, the proposed methodology leads to the Economic <b>Climb</b> Speed <b>Schedule</b> Table, a practical guidance that allows the flight crew to determine the Economic <b>Climb</b> Speed <b>Schedule</b> for an Airline Cost Index and different conditions of aircraft weight, cruise altitude and speed, with corrections for temperature and wind variations. Since corrections for temperature and wind variations can be understood as a simplification that permits the Economic <b>Climb</b> Speed <b>Schedules</b> to be presented through a table, it is necessary to investigate the impact of this simplification on the optimization. Therefore, the operating costs for an aircraft flying the Economic <b>Climb</b> Speed <b>Schedule</b> calculated for each specific condition is compared with that same aircraft flying the speeds obtained from the suggested Table. Finally, a Study Case analyses the impact on the operating costs for an aircraft flying the speeds obtained from the Economic <b>Climb</b> Speed <b>Schedule</b> Table in comparison with flying a Fixed <b>Climb</b> Speed <b>Schedule...</b>|$|R

40|$|Longitudinal {{wind shear}} flight control laws are {{developed}} for the dynamics of a twin-jet transport aircraft using nonlinear dynamic inversion. Time-scale decomposition simplifies controller design by partitioning it into slow and fast time scales. The effects of time-varying winds are explicitly considered in the derivation of the controllers. Three inverting controllers are developed and evaluated: airspeed/climb rate, groundspeed/climb rate, and throttle/climb rate. The implementation of a <b>climb</b> rate <b>scheduling</b> strategy {{makes it possible for}} the resultant flight paths to mimic the essential features of optimal escape trajectories developed in an earlier study, where altitude is exchanged for airspeed as a function of microburst strength...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} cost-optimized flight procedures for a commuter jet, ERJ 145 LU. The aim was to provide the operator, Finnish Commuter Airlines Oy, for whom this investigation was done, with documentation to improve cost efficiency in their ERJ 145 LU flight operations. Knowledge of company cost structure and cost drivers is of significant value in determining the airline strategy in cost optimization. For this purpose, this thesis reviews operating costs, cost drivers and cost reduction potential. In the performance calculations, Embraer performance programs were used. Validation of the programs was done as comparison between program performance data and actual aircraft performance. Actual aircraft performance data was obtained through performance monitoring on flights. The cost optimization of flight procedures was divided into vertical and lateral flight path optimization. First, the vertical flight path was studied by dividing the flight profile into climb, cruise and descent segments. <b>Climb</b> and descent <b>schedules</b> were evaluated for the most cost-efficient procedure in different conditions.

40|$|AbstractFor the {{development}} of agent based traffic simulation model, population synthesis {{is critical to the}} accuracy of simulation outcomes. This paper attempts to develop the synthetic population generation based on the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm for the activity-based travel demand model. This algorithm leads to estimate the activity schedules according to the multi-dimensional characteristics of the synthetic populations. However, appropriate rules have not been established for the estimation of parameters in simulated annealing, and it requires a significant amount of time to find optimal solution. In order to apply SA into the synthetic population, hill <b>climbing</b> and cooling <b>schedule</b> should be considered. In this study, total absolute error was calculated to prevent hill climbing and used Metropolis- Hasting algorithm to determine whether to select or dismiss follow-up distribution. In addition, stability of the algorithm was determined through scenario analysis of the optimal combination of iteration and temperature “T” on the cooling schedule. Based on this result, the current condition of household travel diary survey and census data were used to compare the IPF(Iterative Proportional Fitting) of a previous methodology with the result of establishing suggested algorithm, performing procedures of creating synthetic population, and suggesting the validity of algorithm created with the synthetic population based on SA through statistical verification...|$|R
