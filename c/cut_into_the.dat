5|$|Originally, {{the base}} of the tower was solid stone without any rooms; the top of the {{lighthouse}} was reached using external wooden stairs, which were later replaced with iron ones. During reconstruction in the 1800s, a stairway was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tower and has remained in use since.|$|E
5|$|Property {{changes since}} the {{original}} construction include the front terrace, entranceway and landscaping. The former front lawn and flower beds were paved over, {{and a new}} driveway was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stone wall north of the original large stone arch over the first driveway.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Bronze Age necropolis, {{located near}} the {{northern}} edge of the upper city and heavily damaged by the royal palace constructed above it. The necropolis contained three types of burials: simple graves bordered by bricks, cooking vessels, or shafts <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rocks. The most notable shafts are tombs I, II, III and V.|$|E

5|$|The faster-moving streams took {{advantage}} of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.|$|E
5|$|The game, {{like many}} {{previous}} meetings {{between the two}} teams, was dominated by defense. The Pacers {{got off to a}} quick start, opening up a 20-point lead with seven minutes to go before halftime. The Pistons managed to <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lead, trailing by 16 points by halftime. The Pistons opened the third quarter with a 9–2 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a layup from Jamaal Tinsley heading into the fourth quarter. Richard Hamilton and Lindsey Hunter started the last quarter with consecutive three-point field goals, as the Pistons <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lead again. But Stephen Jackson's back-to-back field goals pushed the lead back to 93–79 with 3:52 remaining, essentially putting the Pistons away. Despite the lopsided score {{near the end of the}} game, most key players on both teams remained in the game.|$|E
5|$|The left {{mandible}} is used {{briefly to}} <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> food plant; saliva is injected and the maxillary stylets, which form a tube, are then inserted and the semi-digested food pumped from ruptured cells. This process leaves cells destroyed or collapsed, and a distinctive silvery or bronze scarring on {{the surfaces of}} the stems or leaves where the thrips have fed.|$|E

5|$|Western Region based {{examples}} had hand/foot holds <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> smoke deflectors {{replacing the}} original handrails after a major derailment, to improve forward visibility. Some of these deflectors subsequently migrated to {{other members of}} the class.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> backdrop {{and covered with}} a transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} bus garage by the Chana School District. A large garage door was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> building and the floor completely removed. The smaller, 1893 room became a storage area. In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room and used the building as an overflow classroom. By the mid-1960s, the Chana District folded and was absorbed by the Oregon School District. Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down.|$|E

5|$|In 1739, the War of Jenkins' Ear {{broke out}} between Britain and Spain, and the {{decision}} was taken to improve the defences at Cromwell Castle. Abraham Tovey, the Master Gunner at the nearby fortification known as the Garrison, constructed a large gun-platform for a battery of six guns on the south-west side of the tower, possibly on top of any pre-existing 16th-century platform. A parapet protected the guns, a new entrance was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> main tower and other adjustments made.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, NASA {{contracted}} Emerson {{to build}} a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station. Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement. The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline {{with the addition of}} a guthook <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tantō point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages. The knife is not available for purchase outside of NASA.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 {{is another}} pyramid-temple {{base on the}} west side of Plaza C. It has a low {{platform}} at its southeastern corner, where 48 severed heads were excavated immediately to the west. Schele and Mathews have speculated that these may be the heads of the K'iche' kings Tepupul and Itzayul together with other members of the K'iche' court who were captured by the Kaqchikels and decapitated. Most of the skulls were found with associated obsidian blades. Most of the skulls had been individually buried in pits <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> floor of the plaza, although a few were grouped into small lots.|$|E

5|$|Temple 32 (Structure 5D-32) stands {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Temple 33. It was partially investigated in the mid-1960s and dates to {{the first half of the}} 7th century AD. The temple shrine contained three large chambers, which were looted soon after the abandonment of the city in the 10th century. Archaeologists discovered a tomb <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bedrock under the pyramid, which contained a royal burial (Burial 195). The pyramid was built over the tomb soon after the king's burial and consisted of a single construction phase.|$|E
5|$|The chapel walls {{have three}} {{horizontal}} tiers with six {{windows in the}} upper tier down each side. There were also two windows at each end, but these have been closed up above the altar when Michelangelo's Last Judgement was painted, obliterating two lunettes. Between the windows are large pendentives which support the vault. Between the pendentives are triangularly shaped arches or spandrels <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vault above each window. Above {{the height of the}} pendentives, the ceiling slopes gently without much deviation from the horizontal. This is the real architecture. Michelangelo has elaborated it with illusionary or fictive architecture.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{has also}} inspired {{various forms of}} artwork. The most notable form of art unique to the pipeline are pipeline maps—portions of scrap pipe <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shape of Alaska {{with a piece of}} metal delineating the path of the pipeline through the map. Pipeline maps were frequently created by welders working on the pipeline, and the maps were frequently sold to tourists or given away as gifts. Other pipeline-inspired pieces of art include objects containing crude oil that has been transported through the pipeline.|$|E

60|$|Not nature the instrument, not the keen sword that <b>cuts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{bleeding}} tissues, but {{the hand}} that wields it--the unseen unknown something, or person, that manifests itself in the horrible workings of nature.|$|R
50|$|The term {{itself may}} refer {{alternatively}} to <b>the</b> actual <b>cuts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bank of a bluff, {{or to the}} general feature of a drying or dried meander. Both uses, however, describe features of the same process.|$|R
5|$|To {{reduce the}} optical effects workload, Ferren {{rejected}} bluescreen compositing, opting instead for rear projection. This cheaper process, he reasoned, would save time, {{and would make}} sense for elements such as the Enterprises bridge viewer, where compositing would lack the softness of a real transmitted image. Designer Lynda Weinman used a Mac II to create the animatics <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> film during production, which were eventually replaced by the film's finished effects.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the ruins}} of Castell y Bere still stand on a rocky outcrop, with {{protective}} ditches <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stone on {{the south and east}} sides. The entrance to the castle lies on the west side, where the barbican, probably built by Edward I, contains two gatetowers, overlooking the stone steps approaching the inner gate. Through the barbican is the castle courtyard, containing a large well and the remains of several internal buildings of uncertain date.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak ordered another seven Turboliner trainsets, {{which were}} {{delivered}} between 1976 and 1977. These were manufactured by Rohr Industries, and {{were known as}} RTL Turboliners. They {{were based on the}} earlier RTG series, but had American-style Janney couplers throughout and a different design of power car cab. The standard configuration of each set was five cars: power cars at either end, a food service car, and two coaches. In that configuration, each trainset could carry 264 passengers. At times, Amtrak operated Turboliners with an additional coach <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> consist. These were the final gas turbine trainsets purchased by Amtrak; conventional diesel locomotive-hauled trains proved cheaper to operate.|$|E
