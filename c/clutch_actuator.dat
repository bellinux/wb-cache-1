5000|$|The new {{transmission}} {{is the first}} of its type from the brand, and has been developed in-house by Kia’s research and development teams at its Namyang, Korea R&D centre. More fuel efficient than Kia’s existing six-speed automatic transmission, the new DCT has been engineered with low fuel consumption and a sporty driving feel when in manual mode, and with comfort and smoothness when left in automatic mode. [...] Innovative hollow double-gear input shaft allows quick shifts. The DCT is made up of two dry clutches, each fitted with electric motor-driven <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> to improve responsiveness, and an innovative hollow double-gear input shaft. The hollow shaft itself allows the system to quickly engage even gears, while a solid shaft that runs through the middle operates odd gears. This crossed gear shifting enables continuous power delivery and more efficient packaging, two development cornerstones for the engineering teams behind the project. The hollow shaft mechanism lets the DCT operate sequentially, the car anticipating the next gear that the driver is likely to need next under acceleration or braking, or jump immediately to any of its seven forward gears (and reverse). This is particularly useful under kickdown or heavy braking, allowing the driver to remain in control of the vehicle at all times. The continuous power delivery of the DCT minimises the loss of torque and forward motion by the powertrain during gear shifts, resulting in more decisive acceleration and a smoother drive. This contributes towards the transmission’s boost to performance in all road conditions in its first application in the Cee’d GT line. Combined with an increase in power from 128 to 133 ps, the DCT’s seven gears allow the GT Line’s diesel engine to operate at its most efficient speeds at all times. With the engine’s torque increased from 265 to 285 Nm, the new DCT is engineered to effectively manage outputs up to 300 Nm, achieving a better balance between the engine’s improved, more effortless performance and potential for greater fuel economy. Reduction of noise, vibration and harshness has also been a focus for the team behind the DCT’s development, with an external damper ensuring a higher level of refinement for the new transmission.After the Cee’d GT line, which will go on sale across Europe in Q4 2015, the new seven-speed DCT will be made available on a range of other Kia models.|$|E

The fast dynamics of the <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> {{and the presence of}} both state and input constraints makes it appropriate to design an explicit Model Predictive Controller (MPC), where the only computation performed on-line would be a piecewise linear function evaluation. A multi-parametric Nonlinear Programming approach is applied to design the explicit MPC.

40|$|This thesis treats {{position}} control of an electropneumatic <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> operated by simple on/off solenoid valves. This <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> {{is intended for}} automatic manual transmission systems or clutch-by-wire systems in heavy duty trucks. Pressurized air is already present {{as a part of}} the brake system in such vehicles, and pneumatics is therefore the natural choice for actuating the manual transmission in these <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> systems. Production cost is a crucial factor in all parts of the automobile industry. For the <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> system this influence the choice of number of sensors present in the production system, limiting it to only a position sensor. It also lead to that a set of on/off solenoid valve is chosen for actuation over more commonly used proportional valves, even though it complicates the control task. Production quality sensors are considered in this thesis, and these are sensors which are more influenced by noise than sensors found in test rigs made for research and development. Motor vibration and possible other mechanical influence also have to be taken into consideration when testing in a full-scale truck as done in this thesis. Motivated by the choice of on/off solenoid valves as the control valves in the <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> system, switched control design is considered. Switched controllers exploit the on/off solenoid valves discrete behavior, switching the valves between fully open and fully closed in a manner such that desired supply or exhaust of air from the actuator chamber is obtained, ensuring the demanded piston position. Based on this line of action, two switched controllers are developed along with a dual-mode switched controller utilizing the best features of the individual controllers. Stability analysis based on standard Lyapunov theory are provided, and the performance of the controllers are tested in a full-scale test truck at Kongsberg Automotive ASA. Both theoretical and practical performance analyses confirm that switch controllers are well suited for actuator piston {{position control}} of the <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> system. Full-state feedback availability is assumed in the design of the switched controllers. Adaptive nonlinear observers are derived to provide estimates of unmeasured states and parameters for the <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> system. These adaptive observers are deterministic with linear output-injection, and have adaptation laws for estimation of clutch load characteristics and friction. A full-order adaptive observer, including filtering of position for suppression of noise, shows best performance. The adaptation of unknown parameters accounts for wear of the clutch and variations in temperature, ensuring a robust design of the <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> model and improving state estimates. Theoretical analyses of convergence are derived under persistence of excitation condition, and performance of the adaptive observers are validated by experimental data. The switched controller and the adaptive nonlinear are combined into an observerbased switched controller. Simulation of this is provided, comparing the results with actual truck measurements. These analysis indicate that the pressure sensor can be exchanged with an adaptive nonlinear observer without significant loss of performance for nonlinear state feedback based control designs for the system.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{the class of}} <b>actuators</b> called <b>clutched</b> elastic <b>actuators</b> (CEAs). CEAs use clutches to control the energy flow into springs. CEAs in exoskeletons, prostheses, legged robots, and robotic arms have shown the ability to reduce the energy consumption and motor requirements, such as peak torque and peak power. Because of those abilities, they are increasingly used in robotics. In this paper, we categorize existing CEA designs, identify trends in those designs, and provide a method to analyze their functionality. Based on a literature survey, current CEA designs are placed in nine categories, depending on their morphology. The main trend is that CEA designs are becoming more complex, meaning {{that the number of}} clutches and springs increases. We show with the introduced mathematical analysis that the functionality can be analyzed with a constraint matrix, a stiffness matrix, and multiplication of a clutch-dependent diagonal matrix with an oriented incidence matrix. This method eases the analysis of the functionality of CEAs. Furthermore, it can lead to new CEA designs in which the number of resulting stiffnesses grows exponentially with the number of springs and clutches.

40|$|Abstract—The cyclic {{and often}} linear torque-angle {{relationship}} of locomotion presents {{the opportunity to}} innovate {{on the design of}} traditional series-elastic actuators (SEAs). In this paper, a novel modification to the SEA architecture was proposed by adding a clutch in parallel with the motor within the SEA—denoted as a CSEA. This addition permits bimodal dynamics where the system is characterized by an SEA when the clutch is disengaged and a passive spring when the clutch is engaged. The purpose of the parallel clutch was to provide the ability to store energy in a tuned series spring, while requiring only reactionary torque from the clutch. Thus, when the clutch is engaged, a tuned elastic relationship can be achieved with minimal electrical energy consumption. The state-based model of the CSEA is introduced and the implementation of the CSEA mechanism in a powered knee prosthesis is detailed. The series elasticity was optimized to fit the spring-like torque-angle relationship of early stance phase knee flexion and extension during level ground walking. In simulation, the CSEA knee required 70 % less electrical energy than a traditional SEA. Future work will focus on the mechanical implementation of the CSEA knee and an empirical demonstration of reduced electrical energy consumption during walking.

40|$|Parallel elastic {{actuators}} (PEAs) {{have shown}} the ability to reduce the energy consumption of robots. However, regular PEAs do {{not allow us to}} freely choose at which instant or configuration to store or release energy. This paper introduces the concept and design of the bidirectional <b>clutched</b> parallel elastic <b>actuator</b> (BIC-PEA), which reduces the energy consumption of robots by loading and unloading a parallel spring with controlled timing and direction. The concept of the BIC-PEA consists of a spring that is mounted between the two outgoing axes of a differential mechanism. Those axes can also be locked to the ground by two locking mechanisms. At any position, the BIC-PEA can store the kinetic energy of a joint in the spring such that the joint is decelerated to zero velocity. The spring energy can then be released, accelerating the joint in any desired direction. Such functionality is suitable for robots that perform rest-to-rest motions, such as pick-and-place robots or intermittently moving belts. The main body of our prototype weighs 202 g and fits in a cylinder with a length of 51 mm and a diameter of 45 mm. This excludes the size and weight of the nonoptimized clutches, which would approximately triple the total volume and weight. In the results, we also omit the energy consumption of the clutches. The BIC-PEA can store 0. 77 J and has a peak torque of 1. 5 N. m. Simulations show that the energy consumption of our one-degree-of-freedom setup can be reduced by 73 %. In hardware experiments, we reached peak reductions of 65 % and a reduction of 53 % in a realistic task, which is larger than all other concepts with the same functionality. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{engineering}} technology of automotive system is currently edging toward improving fuel economy.

The dual clutch transmission (DCT) is the most efficient transmission that a 15 % higher fuel efficiency is available to be compared with planetary automatic transmission and any others.

To much higher efficiency of the system, energy consumption of <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> should be minimized as much as possible. Therefore, alternative design for <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> is suggested to improve overall efficiency of the clutch system in this paper. The <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> suggested using self-energizing effect is introduced to amplify the normal force applied on the surface between friction disks for the engagement of the clutch.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{different}} methods of backstepping controller design for an electro-pneumatic <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> used in heavy duty trucks. The {{first part of}} the thesis is a literature study, where the subject is control of nonlinear-sampled data systems in general. Sampled-data systems contain a continuous-time plant and a digitally implemented controller, which in general make them harder to analyze and control than systems that operate purely in the continuous-time or discrete-time domain. The available theory of nonlinear sampled-data control systems is scarce, but three {{different methods}} are described in this thesis; emulation design, direct discrete-time design, and sampled-data design. The electro-pneumatic <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> is controlled using a continuous-time backstepping controller implemented digitally. This is essentially the procedure of emulation design and is the common, if not only, method used in practical engineering tasks so far. However, redesign of the continuous-time controller using the direct discrete-time method shows great potential of improving performance and robustness of sampled-data systems. Direct discrete-time design is based on an approximate discrete-time model of the plant, giving the controller a structure that accounts for the sampling of the hybrid system. Potentially, one can utilize slower sampling in the system by implementing a discrete-time controller into the digial computer instead of a continuous-time one. Examples and case studies that prove the improvement one can achieve by chosing the direct discrete-time design is included in the {{first part of the}} thesis. Both a third- and fifth-order model of the electro-pneumatic <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> are presented, and used as a basis for continuous- and discrete-time state-feedback backstepping controllers. These controllers are simulated with different sampling intervals to show their performance under different circumstances. The continuous-time controllers prove good reference trajectory tracking of the pure continuous-time system, while the performance of the sampled-data systems descends as higher sampling intervals are used. And, as opposed to the mentioned examples and case studies, the controller designed when taking the sampling into account shows no sign to outperform the controller that was designed without considering the sampling, at least not for the relative fast sampling the <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> operates with. </p...|$|E

40|$|A <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> {{is used in}} {{a vehicle}} to {{transmit}} movement and force from the clutch pedal to the release bearing of the clutch. A pneumatic <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> consists of an anodised aluminium cylinder, inside of which a piston, with a rubber lip seal and a PTFE guiding ring, slides. The system is lubricated with silicone grease before assembly. A commercial <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> of this type, has a service life of 3 million actuations and must function in a wide temperature range, from - 40 ºC to 140 ºC. In this thesis, the complex tribological system of pneumatic clutch actuators has been studied. Field worn actuators have been disassembled and investigated. A laboratory test method has been developed to understand the tribomechanisms present in pneumatic clutch actuators. The test method's capability of simulating the real contact has been verified, by the comparison with studied actuators from the field. The influence of contact parameters: temperature, load, lubrication and particle contamination, has been investigated. In addition, different anodised aluminium surfaces have been studied. The manufacturing method of the aluminium cylinder influences surface topography {{and structure of the}} oxide, resulting in different mechanical and frictional properties. The wear during tests with only silicone grease is reminiscent, but on a lower scale, to the wear during tests with a mixture of silicone grease and standard dust. The initially applied amount of silicone grease is not important, the friction seems to depend on the amount of silicone grease that is dragged into or pushed out from the contact area during testing. Silicone grease lubrication reduces wear of the lip seal. However, during some tests, an adhesive layer, composed of  grease residuals and some PTFE, was formed on the lip. A triple PTFE transfer, from guiding ring to aluminium surface, to lip seal, to aluminium surface, occurred. Such transfer of material from the PTFE guiding ring was detected from the unlubricated tests, and also from the silicone grease lubricated tests, i. e. silicone grease lubrication does not prevent PTFE material transfer...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) is {{designed}} for an electro-pneumatic <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> controlled by two on/off valves with PWM. The areas of application of the <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> is in Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) and Clutch-by-wire (CBW) systems in heavy-duty trucks. As with most automated systems in the automation industry safety is the main priority, and in a cybernetic point of view this means that robustness of the control systems is very important. Sliding Mode Controllers {{are known for their}} excellent robustness properties and the focus of this thesis is to validate these properties for this particular application. The robustness properties of the SMC also indicates that a simple design model is adequate and since the existing mathematical models for this system are quite complex some simplifications are introduced. The controller design is performed in two phases. First an ideal SMC is designed, but since this introduces discontinuities in the control law any practical implementation would give heavy chattering at the output from the controller. Therefore a continuous linear approximation to the discontinuity is introduced. This controller is known as a boundary layer controller and it will reduce the control chattering to an acceptable level. The ideal controller is proven to be asymptotically stable, while for the boundary layer controller ultimate boundedness is achieved and a linearisation is performed for the case of a constant reference and this analysis shows that the origin of the linearised system is a stable focus. This indicates that the boundary layer controller might also be asymptotically stable. Since only a positionmeasurement is available to the control system the rest of the system states must be estimated. Velocity and acceleration are simply estimated as the first and second order filtered derivatives of the position measurement. The pressure is estimated based on the equation of motion for the <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator.</b> Through computer simulations and experimental testing the SMC has shown satisfying tracking performance and very good robustness with respect to parameter variations. Comparisons with a PD and a Backstepping controller shows that the performance of the SMC is superior to the PD controller and absolutely comparable to the Backstepping controller, though they have different strengths and weaknesses and therefore yield rather different results. </p...|$|E

The working principle and dynamic characteristics of the AMT system are first explored. The driveline, the engine control, and the dry clutch are modelled and analysed. In particular, a dynamic model for the hydraulic <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> that is currently used in the actual transmissions is developed. To evaluate the performance and operation characteristics of the AMT system, the control methodology to ensure desirable performance is studied.

40|$|Functional Magnetic Resonance Imagery (fMRI) is an imaging {{technique}} allowing {{the observation of}} brain activity. Haptic interfaces {{can be used in}} conjunction with fMRI to stimulate the subject while measuring brain activity. Using robotic stimulation over conventional methods offers repeatability, flexibility and the possibility of logging of different experiment variables. Such system becomes a powerful tool for neuroscience study, diagnostic and rehabilitation. The MR scanner with its high magnetic fields and radio frequency pulses is a harsh environment for a robotic system. Robots that can operate safely and do not induce disturbances in the imaging of the scanner are qualified as MR-compatible. The actuation of these robots is an important issue. Electrical power brought to the actuator represents an important source of interferences with the scanner. Since electrical motors cannot be introduced in the MR room, haptic interfaces are conventionally remotely actuated over a long transmission with the actuators placed outside of the MR room. In particular cases, such as the study of finger motion, small haptic interfaces with limited force ranges are required. Remote actuation methods impose transmission lengths and means that cannot be reduced nor scaled down thus imposing a trade-off between performances and size reduction in these applications. This work investigates an alternative actuator that can achieve high-quality force-interactions with the fingers. The Ultrasonic Motor (USM) is MR-compatible and offers good performances. But it is not well suited for force-feedback and may be hazardous for the users. To address these issues, mechanical solutions are investigated by using an electrical analogy applied to mechanical systems. A novel actuation system using the USM as a power source and a clutch to control the output torque is proposed: the Hybrid USM <b>Clutch</b> <b>Actuator</b> (HUCA). The first prototype validates the different mechanical concepts developed in this work. The second, MR-compatible, integrates a clutch based on electrorheological fluids (ER). MR-compatibility has been validated and performances evaluated. Since the HUCA has the unique property of behaving both like a force source and a velocity source, dedicated control schemes have been developed to implement impedance and admittance force control. These enable the display of stiff walls and the rendering {{of a wide range of}} impedances thanks to the overlap of their range of displayable impedances.

To {{be able to control}} and fully utilize an AMT it is of great importance to have knowledge about how torque is transmitted in the clutch. The transmitted torque in a slipping dry clutch is therefore studied in experiments with a heavy duty truck (HDT). It is shown that material expansion with temperature can explain torque variations up to 700 Nm for the same <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> position. A dynamic clutch temperature model that can describe the torque variations is developed. The dynamic model is validated in experiments, and shown to reduce the error in transmitted torque from 7 % to 3 % of the maximum engine torque compared to a static model. The clutch model is extended with lock-up/break-a-part dynamics and an extra state describing wear. The former is done using a state machine and the latter using a slow random walk for a parameter corresponding to the clutch disc thickness. An observability analysis shows that the augmented model is fully or partially observable depending on the mode of operation. In particular, by measuring the actuator position the temperature states are observable, both during slipping of the clutch and when it is fully closed. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was developed and evaluated on measurement data. The estimated states converged from poor initial values, enabling prediction of the translation of the torque transmissibility curve. The computational complexity of the EKF is low and it is thus suitable for real-time applications. The clutch model is also integrated into a driveline model capable of capturing vehicle shuffle (longitudinal speed oscillations). Parameters are estimated to fit an HDT and the complete model shows good agreement with data. It is used to show that the effect of thermal expansion, even for moderate temperatures, is significant in launch control applications. An alternative use of the driveline model is also investigated here. It is found that the amplitude discretization in production road-slope sensors can excite vehicle shuffle dynamics in the model, which is not present in the real vehicle. To overcome this problem road-slope information is analyzed and it is shown that a third-order butterworth low-pass filter can attenuate the vehicle shuffle, while the shape of the road profile is maintained.   All experiments in the thesis are performed using production HDTs only, i. e. production sensors only. Since all modeling, parameter estimation, observer design and validation are performed with production sensors it is straight forward to implement the results in a production HDT following the presented methodology.

It works just like an ordinary manual transmission but the clutch and the gear selection are computer controlled. In this way high efficiency can be accomplished with increased comfort and performance. To {{be able to control}} and fully utilize an AMT, it is of great importance to have knowledge about how torque is transmitted in the clutch. The transmitted torque in a slipping dry clutch is therefore studied in a series of experiments with Heavy Duty Trucks (HDT). It is shown that material expansion with temperature can explain torque variations up to 900 Nm for the same <b>clutch</b> <b>actuator</b> position. A dynamic clutch temperature model that can describe the torque variations is developed. The dynamic model is validated in experiments, and shown to reduce the error in transmitted torque from 7 % to 3 % of the maximum engine torque compared to a static model. Since all modeling, parameter estimation, and validation are performed with production HDTs, i. e. production sensors only, it is straightforward to implement the model in a production HDT following the presented methodology. The clutch model is extended with lock-up/break-a-part dynamics and an extra state describing wear. The former is done using a state machine and the latter uses a slow random walk for a parameter corresponding to the thickness of the clutch disc. Two observability analyses are made: one with production sensors, and one with a torque sensor in addition to the production sensors. The analyses show that, in both cases, the temperature states and the wear state are observable both during slipping of the clutch and when it is fully closed. The latter is possible since a sensor measures the actuator position. The unknown offset in the torque sensor is possible to observe (at all times) if the model is further augmented with engine inertia dynamics. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is developed and evaluated on measurement data for both cases. The estimated states converge from poor initial values, enabling prediction of the translation of the torque transmissibility curve and sensor offset. The computational complexity of the EKF is low and it is thus suitable for real-time applications. The clutch model is also integrated into a driveline model capable of capturing vehicle shuffle (longitudinal speed oscillations) and engine torque fluctuations. Parameters are estimated to fit an HDT and the complete model shows good agreement with data. It is used to show that the effect of thermal expansion, even for moderate temperatures, is significant in clutch control applications. One such application is micro-slip control. A control structure has been made and the basic components are a reference-slip calculator, an LQ controller and an EKF that can compensate for the thermal dynamics of the clutch. The controller isolates the driveline from the engine oscillations without dissipating more heat than the clutch can handle. An analysis shows a noticeable fuel consumption increase. Nonetheless, the real benefits of micro-slip control will only be evident when combined with other cost-reducing changes in the powertrain. The feasibility of a micro-slip control system for a dry clutch HDT has been proven. LINK-SI...|$|E
