50|$|Incorporated {{cities and}} towns in California are either <b>charter</b> or general-law <b>{{municipalities}}.</b> General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it; <b>charter</b> <b>municipalities</b> are governed by their own city or town <b>charters.</b> <b>Municipalities</b> incorporated in the 19th century tend to be <b>charter</b> <b>municipalities.</b> All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities. Most small cities have a council-manager form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise {{the operations of the}} city. Some larger cities have a directly-elected mayor who oversees the city government. In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membership—but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial.|$|R
