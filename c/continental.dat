5|$|After the World Cup, {{the most}} {{important}} international football competitions are the <b>continental</b> championships, which are organised by each <b>continental</b> confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC). The FIFA Confederations Cup is contested by the winners of all six <b>continental</b> championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective <b>continental</b> championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each <b>continental</b> competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup.|$|E

5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the <b>continental</b> crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west.

5|$|Because most of {{the newly}} formed {{regiment}} surrendered to British and German forces at the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776, the service history of the unit's surviving element is complex. Although modern and contemporaneous accounts of the battle convey the impression that it {{marked the end of}} the regiment as a combat entity, {{a significant portion of the}} unit continued to serve actively in the <b>Continental</b> Army throughout {{most of the}} remainder of the war. Elements of the regiment served with George Washington's Main Army and participated in the army's major engagements of late 1776 through 1778. Select members of the regiment were also attached to Col. Daniel Morgan's elite Provisional Rifle Corps at its inception in mid-1777. The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was reorganized in January 1779 and was stationed at Fort Pitt, headquarters of the <b>Continental</b> Army's Western Department, in present-day western Pennsylvania primarily to help in the defense of frontier settlements from raids by British-allied Indian tribes. The unit was disbanded with all other Additional and Extra <b>Continental</b> regiments during the reorganization of the <b>Continental</b> Army in January 1781. It was the longest serving <b>Continental</b> Army rifle unit of the war.|$|E

5|$|Clouzot was {{an early}} fan of the cinema and, {{desiring}} {{a career as a}} writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from German studios due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in Nazi occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company <b>Continental</b> Films. At <b>Continental,</b> Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular in France. His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from <b>Continental</b> before its release. As a result of his association with <b>Continental,</b> Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolutionary War, the <b>Continental</b> Congress {{directed}} {{the organization of}} the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment in resolves dated June 17 and 27, 1776. The unit comprised three of the four independent <b>Continental</b> rifle companies that had formed in Maryland and Virginia by decree of Congress in mid-1775, and six new companies—two from Maryland and four from Virginia. The three 1775 companies, among the first of the colonial units to join the newly constituted <b>Continental</b> Army, were raised and initially commanded by Capts. Michael Cresap, Thomas Price, and Hugh Stephenson. The nine-company force became a regiment on the same tables of organization as the 1st <b>Continental</b> Regiment, which was originally the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment. Unlike this Pennsylvania unit, however, the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was an Extra <b>Continental</b> regiment because of its two-state composition. It was not part of a state line organization but was instead directly accountable to national authority (Congress and the <b>Continental</b> Army). The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment's field officers were drawn from the original three 1775 companies based on their seniority. Hugh Stephenson from Virginia became the colonel, and Marylanders Moses Rawlings of Cresap's company and Otho Holland Williams of Price's company were designated the lieutenant colonel and major, respectively. All company officers were appointed in the summer of 1776, and subsequent recruiting for the unit in the two states extended {{to the end of the}} year. Recruiting occurred in Frederick and Harford Counties, Maryland, and Berkeley, Frederick, Loudoun, Fauquier, Prince William, and Culpeper Counties, Virginia. The enlisted men of the regiment served for three years or the duration of the war.|$|E

Rather than selecting two teams that faced each other in the final game of the regular season, <b>Continental</b> Bowl officials chose another team.

5|$|In {{addition}} to volunteers, Jefferson also {{arranged for a}} regiment of 200 regular <b>Continental</b> soldiers under Colonel John Gibson to accompany Clark. Longstanding tensions between <b>Continental</b> Army officers and the militia made such cooperation problematic, however. Colonel Daniel Brodhead, the <b>Continental</b> Army commander at Fort Pitt, refused to detach men for Clark's campaign because he was staging his own expedition against the Delaware Indians, who had recently entered {{the war against the}} Americans. Brodhead marched into the Ohio Country and destroyed the Delaware Indian capital of Coshocton in April 1781. This resulted in the Delaware becoming more determined enemies, and deprived Clark of badly needed men and supplies for the Detroit campaign.|$|E
