5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} {{decrease}} the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot (thrombus). Warfarin treatment <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> formation of future blood clots and help {{reduce the risk of}} embolism (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E

50|$|As {{with any}} body part, {{maintaining}} strength and {{flexibility of the}} muscles <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to <b>prevent</b> injuries. Specifically in the knee, the quadriceps and hamstring muscles help to stabilize the knee, and maintaining their strength and flexibility will <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> minor stresses from developing into major injuries. Proper footwear <b>can</b> also <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> injuries. Wearing shoes that are appropriate for the activity help decrease the risk of slipping or twisting forces acting on the knee. In some circumstances, prophylactic bracing or taping may {{reduce the risk of}} injury as well.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the rapid}} {{development}} of monitoring and detecting technology of {{indoor air quality}} have been observed. We have seen the two major streams of detection technology introduced so far: Acoustic wave sensor and Infrared gas sensor. The use of a gas monitoring system {{in the case of}} that dangerous levels of gases are detected, <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to <b>prevent</b> an explosion or <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to <b>prevent</b> worker injury or exposure to toxic gases...|$|R
25|$|It is {{advised to}} {{maintain}} a degree of muscle tension in this asana. Moderate tension in the thighs and hips can help develop positive habits and can increase the musculature in those areas which <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> injury. Additionally maintaining a degree of tension requires awareness, which <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> injury itself. Though in this asana {{it is unlikely to}} injure one's self, this habit can be beneficial throughout yoga practice.|$|E
25|$|In general, no good {{evidence}} supports the commonly held belief that vitamin D supplements <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> osteoporosis. Its general use for prevention {{of this disease}} in those without vitamin D deficiency is thus likely not needed.|$|E
25|$|Long descents: {{alternating}} {{the front}} and back brake <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> hand fatigue and overheating of the wheel rims which can cause a disastrous tyre blow-out, or boiling of the hydraulic fluid in case of hydraulic disc brakes.|$|E
50|$|Socks {{should be}} well fitting. This <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to <b>prevent</b> rubbing and any {{blisters}} that {{may arise from}} poor fitting socks.|$|R

25|$|Forgiveness in {{marriage}} {{is an important}} aspect in a marriage. When two individuals are able to forgive each other it results to a long happy marriage. Forgiveness <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> problems from accruing in the married couple's future.|$|E
25|$|Common ways {{of getting}} concussions are any head to head hits or any hits that involve a hard blow to the skull. Every year nearly 135,000 {{children}} ranging from age 5 to 18 are treated for concussions and other head injures from sports or other recreational activities. Many concussions come from sports such as wrestling, football, boxing and any other sport that risks getting hit in the head. Wearing head gear <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> concussions. Also wearing a frontal paid that protects the forehead and {{top of the head}} is very effective in protecting the head from a hit that may cause a concussion. Wearing a mouth piece <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> concussions as well.|$|E
25|$|Weight-bearing {{endurance}} exercise and/or {{exercises to}} strengthen muscles improve bone strength {{in those with}} osteoporosis. Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women. Fall prevention <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> osteoporosis complications. There is some evidence for hip protectors specifically {{among those who are}} in care homes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The physiopathological {{decline in}} {{appetite}} and food intake known as “anorexia of aging” {{can lead to}} involuntary weight loss and protein-energy malnutrition, with devastating consequences in older men and women. Food intake can be influenced by numerous endogenous and exogenous factors, both physiological and pathological: mechanisms underlying age-related anorexia are multifactorial, and not completely understood. Early recognition of anorexia, nutritional and pharmacological interventions <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>preventing</b> the development of malnutrition and poor clinical outcome in the elderly...|$|R

The period and orientation of the moiré patterns were also measured as functions of the angle. Simultaneous branches are observed and analyzed. The theoretical interpretation is also given. The results <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>preventing</b> or minimizing the moiré effect in displays. Comment: 13 pages, 14 figures, 12 equation...|$|R
25|$|There is no cure. Maintaining {{a healthy}} {{lifestyle}} by exercising and avoiding smoking <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> fractures. Treatment may include care of broken bones, pain medication, physical therapy, braces or wheelchairs, and surgery. A type of surgery that puts metal rods through long bones may be done to strengthen them.|$|E
25|$|Probiotics {{reduce the}} {{duration}} of symptoms by one day and reduced the chances of symptoms lasting longer than four days by 60%. The probiotic lactobacillus <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults but possibly not children. For those with lactose intolerance, taking digestive enzymes containing lactase when consuming dairy products often improves symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The TAAs <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> the {{bacteria}} from being {{destroyed by the}} host's immune system. In particular {{in the case of}} certain Yersinia spp., the TAA YadA has a role in autoagglutination, serum resistance, complement inactivation, and phagocytosis resistance. All of these methods prevent {{the bacteria}} from being eliminated by the host and ensure its survival.|$|E
50|$|Hydroxyurea is a {{medication}} that <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to <b>prevent</b> chest syndrome. It may cause a low {{white blood cell}} count, which can predispose the patient to some types of infection.|$|R
30|$|Subsidence {{rate has}} been {{increasing}} {{in the area and}} catastrophic events including damages to linear structures, elimination of groundwater storage and flooding will happen if appropriate measures are not taken. Tehran has a significant change in slope from north to south (from 1800 to 950  m) and subsidence in southern sections will increase this slope. Restricting groundwater extraction, changing water consumption pattern, improving agriculture methods and artificial recharge are some of the necessary actions that <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>preventing</b> the future problems.|$|R

25|$|Proper {{conditioning}} <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> ER, as {{it promotes}} {{the growth of}} capillaries in muscles {{and the number of}} enzymes used for energy production in muscle cells. However, improvement in these areas can take several weeks. Thus, ER is more common in horses that are only worked sporadically or lightly, and in horses just beginning an exercise regimen.|$|E
25|$|Some {{measures}} <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> headaches in children. Drinking {{plenty of}} water throughout the day, avoiding caffeine, getting enough and regular sleep, eating balanced meals at the proper times, and reducing stress and excess of activities may prevent headaches. Treatments for children {{are similar to those}} for adults, however certain medications such as narcotics should not be given to children.|$|E
25|$|Germs, bacteria, {{and mold}} can grow very quickly on wet bathing suits. Medical {{professionals}} warn that wearing damp swimwear {{for long periods}} of time can cause a number of infections and rashes in children and adults, and warn against sharing bathing suits with others. They suggest that changing out of a wet bathing suit right away <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> vaginal infections and itching in females and Tinea Cruris ("Jock Itch") in males.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, a {{large-scale}} study of fisheries that used ITQs compared to ones that didn't provided {{strong evidence that}} ITQs <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to <b>prevent</b> collapses and restore fisheries {{that appear to be}} in decline.|$|R

25|$|In agriculture, {{the insect}} {{can be managed}} with cultural, biological, and {{chemical}} control methods. Keeping orchard trees clipped {{so that they do}} not touch each other may help slow the spread. Cleaning farm equipment and other objects used in the field <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> its transport. Few insecticides are known to be very effective on mealybugs, because they can hide and avoid spraying, their wax layers resist some chemicals, and their overlapping generations prevent complete control.|$|E
25|$|Schools play a {{large role}} in {{preventing}} childhood obesity by providing a safe and supporting environment with policies and practices that support healthy behaviors. At home, parents <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> their children from becoming overweight by changing the way the family eats and exercises together. The best way children learn is by example, so parents should lead by example by living a healthy lifestyle. Screening for obesity is recommended in those over the age of six.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that mice exposed to {{environmental}} enrichment are less affected by the consequences of cocaine exposure in comparison with those in standard environments. Although the levels of dopamine in the brains of both sets of mice were relatively similar, when both subjects {{were exposed to the}} cocaine injection, mice in enriched environment were significantly less responsive than those in standard environments. It was thus concluded that both the activating and rewarding effects are suppressed by environmental enrichment and early exposure to environmental enrichment <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> drug addiction.|$|E
