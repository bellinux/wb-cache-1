5000|$|MIL-DTL-83538, (formerly MIL-C-83538) {{describes}} connectors and accessories, electrical, circular, umbilical. The {{connector assembly}} provides the necessary connections {{required to meet}} a MIL-STD-1760, Class I electrical interface between stores and their associated launchers using a [...] "blind mating" [...] mechanism. The connector assembly consists of a receptacle installed on the launcher, a receptacle installed on the store, and a buffer plug installed between the two receptacles. This specification also includes the required mounting adapters and nut, accessory adapter, <b>cable</b> <b>bushing,</b> and protective covers. This connector assembly provides the transfer of MIL-STD-1760 interface class I electrical signals and power between an aircraft (or ground vehicle) mounted launcher and an associated store. This connector is military unique because {{it is intended to}} be used on rail and eject launchers where engagement/disengagement of the launcher receptacle (with attached buffer plug) to the store receptacle will be via a blindmate mechanical mechanism; whereas no known commercially equivalent substitute is available. The insert arrangement is 25-20 of MIL-STD-1560.|$|E
40|$|Confluence of {{the rivers}} Berounka and Sázava and {{outflows}} from the Vltava dam cascade caused the {{flow in the}} lower part of the river Vltava in Prague. The Vltava culminated in Prague on 14 August with a flow of 5160 m 3. s- 1; this corresponds to a period of recurrence of 500 years. The extension of floods in the Vltava valley in Prague caused penetration of water into underground spaces of the Metro and water flooded 19 of 53 underground stations. Looseness of cable bushings through pressure interfaces and non-closure of some pressure interfaces were the most important cause of spreading of water in underground spaces. After the floods of August 2002 the accredited laboratory CTU in Prague, Klokner Institute designed a methodology of experiments and testing system and performed tests on reliability of cable bushings and on material properties of the U 5000. Results of experiments lead to the recommendation to replace all the existing <b>cable</b> <b>bushing</b> in Prague Metr...|$|E

5000|$|The {{extremely}} popular motif of the [...] "belling stag" [...] typically decorated {{the walls of}} petty bourgeois German living rooms and beer taverns in the 19th and 20th centuries. Wandrey took this sickly-sweet icon and propelled it into a new provocative existence as Oh, My Deer (1986). In this way he added continuity to this classic mass product of the kitsch industry and carried it into the digital age. The large-sized relief depicts the nationally venerated cultural icon as a [...] "cyber stag" [...] created from specially manufactured printed circuits boards with a blinking light emitting diode for its eye and surrounded by <b>cable</b> <b>bushes</b> on a copper background. The stag appears again in My Deer (1986), a sculpture made from printed circuit boards and stainless steel. For several years the artist collected more than 200 advertising icons from leaflets and newspapers focusing exclusively on animal motifs. He then worked them into a substantial picture series, the Propagandimals series (2007), translating them into digitalistic language forms. The oil painting Warning Decadence (1990) is one of Wandrey’s political and socio-critical works. It features a black cat with eyes depicted as atomic radiation warning signs. The cat is standing on a gradually melting bar of gold and possesses an aggressive, gleaming aura. Wandrey creates the Artist's multiple hybrid flowers between 1994 and 2000: Hybrid-Rose (1994), Hybrid-Lily (1995), Hybrid-Tulip (1996), Hybrid-Sunflower (1998) and Hybrid-Lotus (2000).|$|R
50|$|Gold Star Families for Peace, {{of which}} Sheehan is a {{founding}} member, released a TV commercial featuring Sheehan, broadcast on Crawford and Waco <b>cable</b> channels near <b>Bush's</b> ranch. The group conducted {{a walk to}} a police station just outside Bush's ranch and delivered a bundle of oversized letters written by them to First Lady Laura Bush, appealing {{to her as a}} mother to support their movement.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the possibility of using}} superconducting cables in power transmission lines, a problem to be solved is that of the diagnostics to be performed to assure the safe operation of the whole system. Partial discharge diagnostics is a valuable tool in order to assess the reliability of HV apparatus. In this work AC partial discharge characterization has been carried out on an experimental set-up for testing an HV superconducting model <b>cable,</b> including HV <b>bushing</b> and the impregnated paper insulation system. Special care has been dedicated to the characterization of the discharges and to the organization of experimental data in order to assess the validity of fingerprints as a diagnostic tool for the recognition and location of defects and study their role on the breakdown and aging of the device...|$|R
