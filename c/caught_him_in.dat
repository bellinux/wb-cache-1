5|$|Between Tests, Bradman rested himself {{during the}} match against Northamptonshire, which started {{the day after}} the Test, as Hassett led Australia to victory by an innings. He {{returned}} for the match against Yorkshire. Bradman came in at 1/0 when Barnes fell for a duck and top-scored with 54 as Australia made 249. Bradman pulled many short balls and reached 50 in 76 minutes. After the hosts replied with 209, Bradman came in at 1/17 and put on 154 for the second wicket with Brown, ending with 86 as the match petered into a draw. His innings ended when Hutton <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the leg trap. Not wanting to tire his bowlers before the Second Test that started the day after next, Bradman showed little intent to win the match. The batsmen batted unhurriedly and set Yorkshire 329 for victory with only 70 minutes of play remaining and the hosts ended at 4/85. Yardley expressed his displeasure by allowing his part-timers to bowl and then promoting tail-enders to the upper half of the batting order in the second innings. The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators.|$|E
25|$|During {{his final}} years, Diamandy became an {{advocate}} of democratic socialism, founding the Iași-based Labor Party and seeking the friendship of Russian Esers. The October Revolution <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Russia, but he escaped by way of Arkhangelsk, and died at sea while attempting to reach France.|$|E
25|$|But {{disaster}} struck when {{a servant}} found condoms among Empson's possessions and {{claimed to have}} <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> flagrante delicto with a woman. As a result, {{not only did he}} have his scholarship revoked, but his name was struck from the college records, he lost his prospects of a fellowship and he was banished from the city.|$|E

25|$|On January 11, 2005, Featherstone won {{a battle}} royal. That same night, he lost to Shorty Smalls in a {{submission}} match when Smalls <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a sleeper hold. A month later, he and Deuce Donnatelli fought {{to a time}} limit draw in Hagerstown on February 1. On March 19, he and Scott Vaughn lost the HoPWF Tag Team Championship to The Super Destroyers (A.J.

25|$|Eugen Relgis {{was still}} active on the {{literary}} scene {{during the first}} two years of World War II, before Romania formalized its military alliance with the Axis Powers. The Phoney War <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> France, but he returned to Romania shortly after, exposing himself to persecution by the growing Romanian fascist movements. In February 1940, he gave a retrospective lecture, republished by the newspaper L'Indépendence Roumaine, on the work of Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Another book of his political prose, Spiritul activ ("The Active Spirit"), saw print the same year.|$|E
25|$|Mike Denness won the toss and put Australia in to bat with {{immediate}} {{results as}} Wally Edwards and Ian Redpath were {{sent back to}} the pavilion with the score on 11/2. Ian Chappell hit 42 off 49 balls before Peter Lever <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the outfield off Chris Old (4/57) with the score on 65/3. Greg Chappell made 44 off 50 balls until Old bowled him, Ross Edwards and Doug Walters to leave Australia 139/6. Wickets now fell regularly as the lower order tried to add a few runs, but they were bowled out for 190 after 34.5 overs, leaving England to make 191 off their full 40 overs.|$|E

25|$|After {{defeating}} Anthony Macias, Sakuraba was matched against Royler Gracie, who {{had previously}} conquered Sakuraba's stablemate Yuhi Sano. It marked the largest weight advantage Sakuraba has enjoyed in his career to date (being around 30 pounds heavier than Royler). Royler, unable to score a takedown or strike effectively from a standing position, remained {{on the ground in}} an effort to bait Sakuraba into a grappling-oriented contest, while Sakuraba, standing, landed punishing kicks to Royler's legs, thighs and head. Eventually, with less than two minutes remaining, Sakuraba finally engaged Royler on the ground and instantly <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a Kimura lock. As Sakuraba wrenched on the submission, the referee intervened with 1 minute and 44 seconds remaining on the clock, ending the contest and awarding Sakuraba the win by TKO.|$|E

500|$|At around 3:20 p.m. on June 23, 1989, Sherron King {{returned}} {{from work to}} her apartment in Washington Terrace, Utah to find the body of her daughter Charla in the bedroom with a nightgown wrapped around her head and panties stuffed in her mouth. After calling the police, she was instructed to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation and discovered that Charla had been strangled {{to death with a}} telephone cord. Charla's foster grandmother Bertha Poster stated that she had dropped Charla off at the apartment at about 1:30 p.m. after visiting the mall. Charla had been planning to celebrate her 12th birthday at an amusement park on the next day. Prosecutors believe that John entered the house with intent on sexually molesting the girl. When she <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the house, Prosecutors believe, he chased her into the bedroom, and placed her underwear in her mouth. He raped her, placed a nightgown over her head, and strangled her to death.|$|E

500|$|On 20 May, a {{half dozen}} {{officers}} and around forty civilians, {{most or all of}} whom were Catholic, were arrested on charges of attempting to assassinate Quát and kidnap Thi and Kỳ. Several of the arrested were known supporters of Thảo and believed to be abetting him in evading the authorities. Despite this, Thảo himself managed to escape, even as a US$30,000 bounty was put on him by the junta. On 16 July 1965, he was reported dead in unclear circumstances; an official report claimed that he died of injuries while on a helicopter en route to Saigon, after being captured north of the city. However, it is generally assumed that he was murdered or tortured to death on the orders of some military officials. One report holds that a Catholic priest betrayed Thảo, while another claims General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu <b>caught</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> his memoirs, Kỳ claimed Thảo had been captured by police in Saigon and [...] "died in jail a few weeks later, probably from a beating". After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, a conspiracy theory emerged, maintaining that Thảo went underground and worked in counterintelligence for the communist Central Office of South Vietnam, helping to hunt down Vietcong cadres who had defected to Saigon.|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie drew {{criticism}} {{during the}} tour for his alleged pro-fascist views. In a 1974 interview he had declared, [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of}} the first rock stars... quite as good as Jagger... He staged a country", but managed to avoid condemnation. On the Station to Station tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of Nazi memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in Stockholm as saying that [...] "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader". Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of the Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment. The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called 'Victoria Station incident' in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top Mercedes convertible and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in NME. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> mid-wave, a contention backed by a young Gary Numan who was among the crowd that day: [...] "Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, you will get a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an issue out it..." [...] The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines [...] "To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading" [...] from Scary Monsters opening track [...] "It's No Game", four years later, were interpreted as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all.|$|E
6000|$|He went out, too. M. Binet {{stood in}} thought a moment, then {{followed}} him, his little eyes very cunning. He <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> up <b>in</b> the doorway. [...] "Let us {{take a walk}} together, M. Parvissimus," [...] said he, very affably.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{idea of an}} apology," [...] I answered, [...] "appears to me ridiculous. My own {{poor little}} {{possessions}} were wholly at his disposal. I <b>caught</b> <b>him,</b> however, <b>in</b> the act of meddling with papers which are mine only on trust." ...|$|R

2500|$|While lauding the {{technical}} prowess of his engineers who had developed color TV, David Sarnoff, {{in marked contrast}} to William Paley of CBS, did not disguise his dislike for popular TV programs.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the memory}} of Joselito {{led him to a}} liaison with the girlfriend of the dead matador, Encarnación López (La Argentinita). She was an intelligent, {{attractive}} woman, an exceptional performer and great dancer, as was her sister Pilar. Although Sánchez had had many tempestuous affairs, like the time in Mexico when a husband <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> bed with his wife and he had to make a hasty getaway, it was for La Argentinita only that he would leave his wife Lola [...] from the sister to the girlfriend.|$|E
60|$|Then {{two little}} weasels--a boy weasel {{and a girl}} weasel--came into the bower and threw their school-books at the {{squirrel}} so cleverly that one hit the King upon the nose and smashed his cigar and the other <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> fairly <b>in</b> the pit of his stomach.|$|R

2500|$|The {{intermediate}} sprint in Cortina d'Ampezzo {{resulted in}} Rasmussen coming {{out the back}} of the leading group. Savoldelli and Mazzoleni <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the road, and the Dutchman stayed with them to form a three-man chase group. Rain began to fall on the ascent of the Passo Tre Croci, the day's third climb, making the goings even more difficult. The leading group of four had 1'24" [...] on the Mazzoleni group at the top of Passo Tre Croci and a further three minutes on the pink jersey group, meaning Mazzoleni was very nearly the virtual race leader on the road. Mazzoleni dropped Savoldelli and Rasmussen as the stage went on, and finished five minutes before them.|$|E
2500|$|Returning {{to combat}} in mid-November, Captain Waskow {{and his men}} fought their way north past Naples, {{relieving}} the 3rd Infantry Division near Mignano and then marched on, largely on mountain trails to Monte Sambucaro (Hill 1205), near San Pietro Infine. The battle for San Pietro {{was one of the}} worst of the Italian Campaign. After a week, Waskow's company had been reduced to the size of a platoon, but participated in the assaults. On the evening of December 12, on his way up from the treeline to launch an attack on a ridge known as Hill 730 (...) , his unit was attacked, and a shell hit near him and his men. Fragmentation <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the chest and killed him almost immediately.|$|E
2500|$|His {{season was}} {{abruptly}} interrupted, however, when Hirsh {{went on the}} disabled list again after his right fibula was broken in a game August 7. [...] Not realizing his leg had been broken on a line drive comebacker hit by the second batter of the game, J. J. Hardy, that <b>caught</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the shin in the first inning, Hirsh went on to throw out Hardy and pitch six innings that day, earning a key win for the club. [...] Asked what he would do the next time he faced Hardy, Hirsh joked: [...] "I might put a catcher's shin guard on, just for him." [...] The injury ended his season. [...] "I was crushed," [...] Hirsh said. [...] "Obviously, nobody wants to have someone tell them that their season's cut short." ...|$|E
