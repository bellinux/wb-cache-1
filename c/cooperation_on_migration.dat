40|$|This article {{analyses}} the Bali Process in {{the context}} of Australia’s securitised approach to migrant smuggling, and the consequences this has for both the Australia–Indonesia diplomatic relationship and the Bali Process overall. The Bali Process is the premier regional forum for combating migrant smuggling and is well placed to discuss and develop regional <b>cooperation</b> policies <b>on</b> irregular <b>migration</b> within the region. In particular, the Bali Process remains a key domain where Australia and Indonesia can contest and amend the norms and practices around the human rights of refugees and asylum-seekers. This article traces and analyses the emergence of Australia’s bilateral agreements for offshore processing and resettlement between 2011 and 2014, which Australian political elites aligned rhetorically to the Bali Process, but which the authors argue remain in tension with stated Bali Process objectives in terms of rights and protections for asylum-seekers and refugees. This article identifies that Australia’s security-driven policies and regional disagreements over humanitarian responsibility remain an ongoing tension within Bali Process states, and provides commentary on the implications of this for future Australian policy relating to regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>on</b> irregular <b>migration...</b>|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{recent efforts}} at {{international}} cooperation to limit illegal migration, particularly {{through the use}} of legal migration avenues like guest worker (GW) schemes. We show that while GW schemes may be desirable in themselves as an avenue of international migration, they are an inefficient instrument to induce <b>cooperation</b> <b>on</b> illegal <b>migration.</b> <b>On</b> the one hand, GW schemes suffer from a negative selection problem relative to illegal migration, which tends to erode their attractiveness to source countries. On the other hand, GW schemes increase total (legal and illegal) migration which make them a costly compensating device for the host country. Moreover, GW schemes create additional pressure on host countries to implement tough laws against illegal immigration even when the host finds such laws per se undesirable. Thus, less favorable treatment of illegal immigrants, as in California Proposition 187, may be an inevitable rather than incidental outcome of reliance on guest worker schemes. In contrast, countries that are willing to use transfers and other forms of economic assistance to induce source countries to cooperate can afford relatively liberal treatment of illegal immigrants...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} on unregulated population movements suggests that illegal migration and undocumented migration for labor and other purposes {{is on the}} rise in Northeast Asia, and is demanding the attention of regional policy-makers. The last decade has also witnessed an increase in the criminalization of migration in the lucrative form of human trafficking, often related women and girls for prostitution. This paper reviews the scholarly debate on the linkages between security and migration, including how illegal migration has been incorporated into the discussion on traditional and non-traditional security, and human security. The emergence of illegal migration as a security issue in the European Union is discussed before a consideration of whether, and how, illegal migration has been defined as a "security" issue among politicians and policy-makers in Northeast Asia. The so-called Copenhagen School’s framework of "securitization" is discussed in relation to how securitization could be applied to specific cases of illegal migration and unregulated population flows within and from Northeast Asia.

40|$|In June 2012 the European Commission {{received}} {{the backing of}} the member states to launch a visa liberalisation process with Turkey in exchange for a readmission agreement that obliges Ankara to take back illegal immigrants who passed through Turkey as a transit country.

My process tracing analysis suggests that the key to explaining this development is the argumentative strength of the European Commission, stemming from the necessity of <b>cooperation</b> with Turkey <b>on</b> <b>migration</b> and the norms of procedures set in previous readmission negotiations, as well as the coalition between the Commission and the Danish Council Presidency.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{analyze the}} effect of the endogenous choice of sanctioning institutions <b>on</b> <b>cooperation</b> and <b>migration</b> patterns across societies. In our experiment, subjects are allocated to one of two groups, are endowed with group-specific preferences,and play a public goods game for 30 periods. Each period, subjects can move between groups and, at fixed intervals, can vote on whether to implement formal (centralized) sanctioning institutions in their group. We compare this environment to one in which only one group is exogenously endowed with sanctioning institutions. We find that subjects' ability to vote on institutions leads to (i) a more efficient partition of subjects between groups, (ii) a lower migration rate, (iii) an increase in overall payoffs, and (iv) a decrease in both inter- and intra-groups (payoff) inequality. Over time, subjects tend to vote for sanctioning institutions and contribute to the public good...|$|R

The impacts of global migratory movements {{depend on their}} political management: circumstances conducive to development require close and dependable cooperation between the countries involved. But international <b>cooperation</b> <b>on</b> refugee and <b>migration</b> policy - global migration governance - has to date been weak. Important institutional and policy changes are currently under way, with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 including at least some universally binding targets and indicators for migration. And in September 2016 the international community decided to prepare two global compacts - one for migration, one for refugees - within the space of two years. Both will have repercussions for the international institutional setup and the division of responsibilities between UN agencies, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

Immigration is an inherently multidimensional issue and differs from trade {{and other aspects}} of the bilateral relationship because of Mexico's unique ability to influence policy outcomes.

This review took place within the context of substantial uncertainties arising from the economic, jobs, and fiscal crises and, in the case of Europe, from political upheaval in the Arab world. It must also be seen in the context of ongoing institutional, economic, and demographic changes, as well as governments’ growing recognition that deeper cooperation with both sending and receiving countries are crucial to the effective management of migration.

30|$|The pace of {{migration}} to the EU {{is likely to increase}} given growing cooperation between both countries and the EU. Both Moldova and Georgia are members of the Eastern Partnership and have signed action plans with the EU in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which have included the development of mobility partnerships and visa facilitation agreements (Cantarji and Mincu, 2013; Labadze and Tukhashvili, 2013). In April 2014, visa requirements for Moldovans who hold biometric passports and wish to travel within the Schengen area were abolished, and both Moldova and Georgia signed association agreements with the EU in June 2014. Such frameworks for bilateral relations could potentially prepare both countries for future EU candidacy (Rieker, 2014). The impacts of these agreements on migration flows to the EU are unclear, but as <b>cooperation</b> <b>on</b> <b>migration</b> management deepens with the EU while simultaneously worsening with partners such as the Russian Federation, increased mobility to the EU would be a likely result.|$|E

30|$|The {{development}} of <b>cooperation</b> <b>on</b> asylum and <b>migration</b> {{matters in the}} European Union (EU) has often been explained {{as the result of}} ‘venue-shopping’, that is, the move by national policy-makers to a new EU policy venue in order to circumvent domestic obstacles. However, focusing on the case of asylum, recent literature has argued that, contrary to expectations, the move to the EU policy venue has actually resulted in a rise in asylum standards overall. This can be explained by a series of treaty changes that have resulted in the increasing ‘communautarisation’ and ‘judicialisation’ of the EU asylum policy venue. This article seeks to further contribute to these debates by examining the hitherto neglected role of refugee-assisting non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in this process. It argues that, contrary to the expectation that venue-shopping to the EU level would enable policy-makers to free themselves from NGO monitoring, NGOs have actually increasingly organised their advocacy work at the EU level in recent years. The treaty changes to the EU asylum policy venue have also increased advocacy opportunities for NGOs, which have enabled them to exercise a significant level of influence over the EU asylum policy-making process, especially at the policy drafting stage. It can be concluded that the current configuration of the EU asylum policy venue offers more opportunities for NGOs to exercise their influence on the {{development of}} the EU asylum policy than ever before.|$|R

40|$|The EU-Moroccan Mobility Partnership {{has been}} {{understood}} as EU’s migration policy to keep off unwanted migrants {{from reaching the}} Schengen area. EU is noted to have induced its southern neighbors’ cooperation by offering positive (or negative) conditionality. However, this paper claims that such an understanding remains Eurocentric and limited.

Morocco implemented the partnership on border control to its advantage, politicizing the issue {{in accordance with the}} country’s geopolitical interests.

40|$|An often {{overlooked}} {{dimension of the}} EU's influence is the Europeanisation of Non-Member states. While Europeanisation {{in the case of}} member states and accession countries stems from the supranational influence of EU law and the increasing integration, EU influence in co-operation with third countries has been undertheorised. Drawing from insights of organisational sociology and neo-institutionalist theory, the analysis of the organisational field of the external dimension of EU migration policy reveals interorganisational dynamics that are likely to impact on the policy output in non-Member States and shape Europeanisation processes. Complex interdependence leads to mutual influence whereby actors on all sides can impact on policy outputs. EU-influence is therefore dependent on the compatibility of understandings of migration and approaches as well as administrative capacities in the coordinating and implementing bodies. Rather than being dominated by EU actors, actors in third countries and implementation partners such as international organisations can be considerably empowered by Europeanisation. The process is hence not unidirectional but has multiple feed-back loops with considerable repercussions for policy output and process. This will be exemplified by empirical results from EU <b>cooperation</b> <b>on</b> <b>migration</b> with Morocco and Ukraine...|$|E
