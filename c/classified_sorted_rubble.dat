A finite element computer model was used to simulate the ground-water flow field from three frames of reference: a local plan view of the mine site (local hydrology), a cross sectional view of flow through the reclaimed mine interior (interior flow), and a cross sectional view of a regional flow system (regional hydrology). The simulation model solved for the piezometric head distribution in each system. For each simulation the piezometric head contours were plotted, and in some cases, the increase in flux induced by the min...|$|R

Among all the problems related to this strategy, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) is very important and of special attention in modern technology. This paper addresses the particular type of VRP, called VRPCDTW, considering a time limitation for each customer/retailer. This problem is known as NP-hard problem. Two meta-heuristic algorithms based on the Tabu search (TS) algorithm and variable neighborhood search (VNS) are proposed for its solution. These algorithms are designed for real-world cases and can be generalized to the more complex models such as those which deliveries can be specified in a split form. The proposed TS algorithm also offers a candidate list strategy which has no limitation for the number of nodes and vehicles. A computational experiment is performed to verify our presented algorithms. Through computational experiments, it is indicated that the proposed TS algorithm performs better than VNS algorithm in both aspects of the total cost and computation time. doi: 10. 5829 /idosi. ije. 2014. 27. 07 a. 1...|$|R

40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of strip mining features, commonly found in the Northern Great Plains Coal Region, on ground water hydrology. The features examined are: reclaimed mine geometry, relative transmissivity between the reclaimed spoil and the surrounding unmined coal bed aquifer, anisotropy, the gravity <b>sorted</b> <b>rubble</b> layer, coal wedges left between trench cuts, and the position and size of an operational mine in the regional flow system. A finite element computer model was used to simulate the groundwater flow field from three frames of reference: a local plan view of the mine site (local hydrology), a cross sectional view of flow through the reclaimed mine interior (interior flow), and a cross sectional view of a regional flow system (regional hydrology). The simulation model solved for the piezometric head distribution in each system. For each simulation the piezometric head contours were plotted, and in some cases, the increase in flux induced by the mine properties, and the contact time of water passing through the reclaimed spoil were calculated. Although only {{the flow of water}} through the spoil was modeled, water quality effects were inferred through a set of indices dealing with the reclaimed mine size and amount of water passing through it. The effects of a reclaimed mine were studied in the local and interior flow simulations. The influence of an operational mine was examined in the regional simulation. In all cases, the long term impacts were simulated by solving for the steady state condition. Regional location is found {{to be the most important}} factor in {{the influence of}} an operational mine on groundwater resources. Relative transmissivity is the most important factor in determining the influence of a reclaimed mine. When present, the rubble layer dominates the flow pattern through the mine spoil. The coal wedges are apparently of little hydrologic consequence. Equidimensional mine shapes are preferred to elongated shapes because they induce the least amount of flow through the spoil per unit extracted coal.
