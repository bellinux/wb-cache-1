40|$|Objectives: Health-related {{quality of}} life after kidney {{transplant}} in adolescents is a major concern; nevertheless, there is a paucity of data on the variables that {{have an effect on}} it. This study evaluated the extent to which socioeconomic, <b>clinical,</b> and <b>psychological</b> characteristics explain the variance in the health-related {{quality of life}} of adolescent Iranian kidney transplant recipients.

Results: The relative predictive power of socioeconomic, <b>clinical,</b> and <b>psychological</b> variables with respect to health-related quality of life was 21. 8 % (P =. 088), 21. 2 % (P =. 014), and 27. 6 % (P =. 001). Conclusions: Psychological factors had a greater relative predictive power in postrenal transplant health-related quality of life of adolescents than did the socioeconomic and clinical characteristics. Further research should target to improve the health-related quality of life in adolescent kidney recipients by psychological intervention...|$|R
