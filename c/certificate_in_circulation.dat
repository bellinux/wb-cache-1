5000|$|The Coinage Act of 1873, {{enacted by}} the United States Congress in 1873, embraced the gold {{standard}} and de-monetized silver. Western mining interests and others who wanted silver <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> labeled this measure the [...] "Crime of '73". For about five years, gold was the only metallic standard in the United States until passage of the Bland-Allison Act on February 28, 1878, requiring the US Treasury to purchase domestic silver bullion to be minted into legal tender coins co-existent with gold coins. Silver Certificate Series 1878 was issued to join the gold <b>certificates</b> already <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b>|$|R
500|$|In {{keeping with}} the verbiage on large-size silver {{certificates}}, all the small-size Series 1928 certificates carried the obligation [...] "This certifies that there has (or have) been deposited in the Treasury of the United States of America X silver dollar(s) payable to the bearer on demand" [...] or [...] "X dollars in silver coin payable to the bearer on demand". This required that the Treasury maintain stocks of silver dollars to back and redeem the silver <b>certificates</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b> Beginning with the Series 1934 silver certificates the wording was changed to [...] "This certifies that there is on deposit in the Treasury of the United States of America X dollars in silver payable to the bearer on demand." [...] This freed the Treasury from storing bags of silver dollars in its vaults, and allowed it to redeem silver certificates with bullion or silver granules, rather than silver dollars. Years after the government stopped the redemption of silver certificates for silver, large quantities of silver dollars intended specifically to satisfy the earlier obligation for redemption in silver dollars were found in Treasury vaults.|$|R
