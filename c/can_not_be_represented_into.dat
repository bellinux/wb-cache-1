40|$|Abstract- The {{facility}} location selection, {{which is}} one of the important activities in strategic planning for a wide range of private and public companies, is a multi-criteria decision making problem including both quantitative and qualitative criteria.

To illustrate the application of the proposed method, a practical application is given.

The idea of the procedure is that evaluation of the lotteries takes two steps. First, a decision maker classifies a lottery as a "bad," "good" or "medium" one. Then comparing the lotteries the decision maker uses lexicographic ordering between the classes and expected utility value (with possibly different utility scales for different classes) {{within each of the}} three categories. The paper contains comparison of the suggested procedure with several other non-expected utility models. Many preference patterns that motivated the other models can be explained within the suggested procdedure. Key Words: threshold, expected utility, Allais paradox. ...|$|R
