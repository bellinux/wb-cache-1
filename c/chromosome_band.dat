40|$|Visual {{examination}} of <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> patterns {{is an important}} means of chromosome analysis. Cytogeneticists compare their patient's chromosome image against the prototype normal/abnormal human <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> patterns. Automated <b>chromosome</b> analysis instruments facilitate this by digitally enhancing the chromosome images. Currently available systems employing traditional highpass/bandpass filtering and/or histogram equalization are approximately equivalent to photomicroscopy {{in their ability to}} support the detection of band pattern alterations. Improvements in chromosome image display quality, particularly in the detail of the banding pattern, would significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of these systems. In this paper we present our work on the use of multiscale transform and derivative filtering for image enhancement of <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> patterns. A steerable pyramid representation [2, 31 of the chromosome image is generated by a multiscale transform. The derivative filters are designed to detect the <b>bands</b> of a <b>chromosome,</b> and the steerable pyramid transform is chosen based on its desirable properties of shift and rotation invariance. By processing the transform coefficients that correspond to the <b>bands</b> of the <b>chromosome</b> in the pyramid representation, contrast enhancement of the <b>chromosome</b> <b>bands</b> can be achieved with designed flexibility in scale, orientation and location. Compared with existing chromosome image enhancement techniques, this new approach offers the advantage of selective <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> pattern enhancement that allows designated detail analysis. Experimental results indicate improved enhancement capabilities and promise more effective visual aid to comparison of chromosomes to the prototypes and to each other. This will increase the ability of automated chromosome analysis instruments to assist the evaluation of chromosome abnormalities in clinical samples...|$|R
25|$|The {{conservation}} of large chromosomal segments makes comparison between species worthwhile. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> {{has been a}} reliable indicator of chromosome homology overall, i.e. that the chromosome identified {{on the basis of}} banding actually carries the same genes.

40|$|After 24 {{hours of}} {{treatment}} of human peripheral leucocyte cultures or Syrian hamster embryonic secondary cultures with some known chemical carcinogens at concentrations that produce transformation in vitro of hamster cells, the chromosomes of {{both types of}} cells exhibited typical G <b>banding.</b> <b>Chromosome</b> <b>bands</b> did not result with urethane, a compound which does not produce cytotoxicity or cause transformation by direct exposure of cells. Non-carcinogenic chemicals which do not inhibit cell multiplication also failed to produce bands. Cytogenetic analysis following removal of the carcinogens from the cultures indicated non-banded uniformly stained chromosomes. It is concluded that metaphases with <b>chromosome</b> <b>bands</b> {{are more likely to}} be the result of nonspecific toxicity rather than being related to the carcinogenic properties of the chemicals...|$|R

40|$|The {{karyotype}} of Candida albicans 1001, a pathogenic isolate, presents {{two additional}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>bands</b> {{when compared with}} C albicans 1006 strain.

A comparison of karyotypes of strains 1001, 1006 and WO- 1 has enabled us to conclude that chromosomes 2 and 7 are involved in such a reorganization giving rise to the new <b>chromosome</b> <b>bands</b> of strain 1001.

40|$|Establishing how {{mammalian}} {{chromosome replication}} is regulated and how groups of replication origins are organized into replication bands will significantly increase {{our understanding of}} chromosome organization. Replication time <b>bands</b> in mammalian <b>chromosomes</b> show overall congruency with structural R- and G-banding patterns as revealed by different <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> techniques. Thus, <b>chromosome</b> <b>bands</b> reflect variations in the longitudinal structure and function of the chromosome, but {{little is known about}} the structural basis of the metaphase <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> pattern. At the microscopic level, both structural R and G bands and replication bands occupy discrete domains along chromosomes, suggesting separation by distinct boundaries. The purpose of this study was to determine replication timing differences encompassing a boundary between differentially replicating chromosomal bands. Using competitive PCR on replicated DNA from flow-sorted cell cycle fractions, we have analyzed the replication timing of markers spanning roughly 5 Mb of human chromosome 13 q 14. 3 /q 21. 1. This is only the second report of high-resolution analysis of replication timing differences across an R/G-band boundary. In contrast to previous work, however, we find that band boundaries are defined by a gradient in replication timing rather than by a sharp boundary separating R and G bands into functionally distinct chromatin compartments. These findings indicate that topographical band boundaries are not defined by specific sequences or structures...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} the methods currently employed in cancer cytogenetics, spanning from <b>chromosome</b> <b>banding</b> to array- and sequencing-based techniques.
