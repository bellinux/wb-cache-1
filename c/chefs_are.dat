5|$|Every {{year since}} 2000 {{the town has}} held a food and wine festival during May. It {{includes}} an international food market with over 100 stalls selling food and drink, and a large marquee with a kitchen area erected in Saxon Square. Here cooking demonstrations are given, sometimes by a celebrity chef: past guests have included Gary Rhodes and Jean-Christophe Novelli. The week-long festival is a community event which aims to educate people in healthy eating {{as well as the}} availability of foods.

5|$|The series {{features}} two families, {{one in each}} {{half-hour of}} the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant {{version of the same}} meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to the chefs as well as how longer they think it will take to prepare it. The <b>chefs</b> <b>are</b> then given {{the same amount of time}} to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and the procedure is repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000; if the chefs win, the family receives $1,000 worth of kitchen supplies.|$|E

500|$|Lauer {{thought that}} the surge in {{interest}} in bacon products prior to the book's publication was [...] "media driven". She noted that a response to political correctness as related to cooking and food consumption may have driven interest in the product. Lauer said that bacon seems to be [...] "the one thing that people are unwilling to give up". In a post of her blog in March 2009, Lauer lamented those that were willing to posit {{an end to the}} trend of interest in bacon. She commented, [...] "Bacon is something that everybody is familiar with and most people grew up eating. It has a comfort aspect to it and a familiarity. It's also got an addictive aspect to it— that sweet and salty combination of flavors." [...] She asserted that interest in the product is as much due to the culture surrounding it as to bacon itself. [...] "Current food trends focus on eating real and eating local, and there's nothing more real than a delicious strip of bacon. In many U.S. cities, local producers and <b>chefs</b> <b>are</b> making a name for themselves because of bacon," [...] said Lauer. She stated that [...] "most chefs would admit that bacon has long been one of their secret weapons in the kitchen." [...] The book was marketed as the [...] "most comprehensive book about bacon to date". Lauer promoted her book in a September 2009 appearance as a co-host at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Tour in Pennsylvania, hosted by fellow bacon blogger Jason Mosley (Mr. Baconpants, at mrbaconpants.com).|$|E
2500|$|After the Elimination Challenge, {{the chefs}} {{report to the}} Judges' Table, where the judges will {{deliberate}} on their choices for {{the best and worst}} dishes. The judges may also consider guests' comments, if available. The top individuals or teams are called in, and may be asked questions about their dishes or preparation before they are notified of their placement. One or more <b>chefs</b> <b>are</b> named the winner of the challenge and may be awarded an additional prize by the guest judge. The same procedure is repeated with the poorest performing chefs or teams, after which similar discussion takes place. From this group, one or more <b>chefs</b> <b>are</b> chosen for elimination, with the host asking the chef(s) to leave by saying [...] "Please pack your knives and go." [...] This is usually followed by a knife packing sequence for the eliminated chef(s), with a voice-over of their final thoughts about their performance, {{at the close of the}} episode. According to the credits, some elimination decisions are made in consultation with the show's producers.|$|E

2500|$|In each episode, chefs {{have one}} hour {{to cook and}} improvise a multi-course meal around a theme {{ingredient}} that must be present in each dish. Before the actual taping, the <b>chefs</b> <b>are</b> given {{a short list of}} possible themes, allowing the producers of the show to get any ingredients that may be needed. [...] Judges' primary goal was said to be determining which chef was able to [...] "best express the unique qualities of the theme ingredient". In rare cases, the format changed—angler fish battles were typically 75 minutes in length, and noodle battles had the Iron Chef stop after 50 minutes of cooking, only to resume after the challenger's dishes were tasted so that the noodles could be served right after cooking.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of a {{deadlock}} (as was possible during the era of the four-judge panel), first place is awarded to the chef with the greater number of points. On the rare occasions that the scores were also tied, an immediate [...] "overtime battle" [...] was held to determine the winner. In overtime the <b>chefs</b> <b>are</b> given 30 minutes to prepare dishes with a different key ingredient, having to make do with what remains of their pantry or with items that were previously prepared for the main battle. The overtime battles are aired as a separate episode. On one occasion, the overtime battle itself resulted in a tie, prompting Chairman Kaga to declare both the Iron Chef and challenger winners.|$|E

[...] and summons the Iron Chefs to cook with a phrase [...] "Allez cuisine!" [...] ("Go cook!"). The show has two regular commentators, Kenji Fukui who narrates the action on the floor, and Dr. Yukio Hattori, a food scholar and founder of the Hattori Nutrition College. A floor reporter, Shinichiro Ohta, reports to Fukui on what the challengers and Iron <b>Chefs</b> <b>are</b> preparing, their strategy, and their comments, breaking Fukui's train of commentary with a polite [...] "Fukui-san?". One or two guest commentators (who also serve as judges) also make frequent appearances.

The four Iron <b>Chefs</b> <b>are</b> Tom Aikens, Martin Blunos, Sanjay Dwivedi and Judy Joo. Like the original Iron Chef, the competitions are held in Kitchen Stadium and presided over by The Chairman.

2500|$|Top Chef is {{a cooking}} show {{that uses a}} {{progressive}} elimination format. The beginning of each season starts with twelve to nineteen professional chefs selected through auditions. The <b>chefs</b> <b>are</b> brought to the season's host city or state, which typically inspires themes throughout the season. The chefs live in a provided apartment or house {{during the course of}} the season, and normally do not have access to outside communication. Each episode, the chefs participate in a Quickfire Challenge and an Elimination Challenge (described below). The winner of the Quickfire Challenge is typically granted immunity from elimination, a prize, or another benefit for the following Elimination Challenge. The loser of the Elimination Challenge, as the name suggests, is eliminated from the competition. This format continues until two or three chefs remain. Each finalist is challenged to create a full-course meal; the chef with the best meal as determined by the judges is declared the [...] "Top Chef" [...] of the season. Towards the end of the season, when only four or five chefs remain, the show moves to another location to finish out the competition.|$|E
2500|$|In the Quickfire Challenge, chefs must cook a {{dish that}} meets certain {{requirements}} (for example, using specific ingredients or inspiring a certain taste) or {{participate in a}} culinary-related challenge (for example, a mise en place relay race or a taste testing contest). They are usually given an hour or less to complete these tasks. The Quickfire challenge traditionally begins with the host saying [...] "Your time starts now" [...] and ending with the host saying [...] "Hands up, utensils down". A guest judge selects one or more chefs as {{the best in the}} challenge. Early in the season, the winning <b>chef(s)</b> <b>are</b> granted immunity from the episode's Elimination Challenge. As the number of contestants dwindle, immunity is withdrawn and instead the winner receives an advantage (such as being the team leader for a team challenge or getting first pick of ingredients) or a prize (such as chef's knives, wine, or cash.) To emphasize the culture and environment of the sixth season's Las Vegas setting, the show introduced [...] "High-stakes Quickfire Challenges", which features extravagant rewards, usually a large cash prize upwards of [...] High-stakes Quickfire Challenges continued onward in further seasons. The twelfth season of Top Chef introduced the [...] "Sudden Death Quickfire Challenge", where the chef with the poorest dish faces immediate elimination unless they win a cook-off against another competitor.|$|E
