40|$|Background: Different {{studies show}} {{evidence}} that several unicellular organisms display a cellular metabolic structure {{characterized by a}} set of enzymes which are always in an active state (metabolic core), {{while the rest of the}} molecular catalytic reactions exhibit on-off changing states. This self-organized enzymatic configuration seems to be an intrinsic characteristic of metabolism, common to all living cellular organisms. In a recent analysis performed with dissipative metabolic networks (DMNs) we have shown that this global functional structure emerges in metabolic networks with a relatively high number of <b>catalytic</b> <b>elements,</b> under particular conditions of enzymatic covalent regulatory activity. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, to investigate the mechanism behind the emergence of this supramolecular organization of enzymes, we have performed extensive DMNs simulations (around 15, 210, 000 networks) taking into account the proportion of the allosterically regulated enzymes and covalent enzymes present in the networks, the variation in the number of substrate fluxes and regulatory signals per catalytic element, as well as the random selection of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>elements</b> that receive substrate fluxes from the exterior. The numerical approximations obtained show that the percentages of DMNs with metabolic cores grow with the number of <b>catalytic</b> <b>elements,</b> converging to 100 % for all cases.

Despite their central roles, the mechanisms of GTP‐dependent conformational switching and GTP hydrolysis that govern the function of trGTPases remain poorly understood. Here, we provide biochemical and high‐resolution structural evidence that eIF 5 B and aEF 1 A/EF‐Tu bound to GTP or GTPγS coordinate a monovalent cation (M$^+$) in their active site. Our data reveal that M$^+$ ions form constitutive components of the catalytic machinery in trGTPases acting as structural cofactor to stabilize the GTP‐bound “on” state. Additionally, the M$^+$ ion provides a positive charge into the active site analogous to the arginine‐finger in the Ras‐RasGAP system indicating a similar role as <b>catalytic</b> <b>element</b> that stabilizes the transition state of the hydrolysis reaction. In sequence and structure, the coordination shell for the M$^+$ ion is, with exception of eIF 2 γ, highly conserved among trGTPases from bacteria to human.

The inorganic part of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>element</b> was an ordered mesoporous electrodeposit of SiO 2, which {{has been used as}} the template for the electrochemical insertion of the self-doping copolymer. The oxidation of ascorbate ions at a fixed potential on this composite was studied by means of the kinetic model proposed by Bartlett and Wallace (2001). It was observed that the effective kinetic constant KME increased significantly but, simultaneously, k′ME remained almost constant when the composite was employed as the electrocatalytic substrate. These results were interpreted in the light of two combinations of kinetic constants, which strongly suggested that the increase in KME should be ascribed to the improvement in electronic conductivity of the copolymer induced by the highly ordered silica template.

The data revealed a systematic shift in vertical {{patterns of the}} LAPase: BGase ratios along the east-west axis of the investigated area. The ratio increased by over 10 -fold with depth in the eastern region (1398 W 21598 W), while it varied little (, 3 -fold) in the central region (1698 W 21798 E, including the Bering Sea). It decreased with depth by about six-fold in the western region (1698 E 21618 E). The decrease of LAPase: BGase ratio with depth {{is consistent with a}} general pattern in the decom-position of sinking particles, i. e., protein is degraded faster than polysaccharides, but the increase of the ratio with depth suggests that export of proteinaceous materials to the mesopelagic zone is high.

Whole cells {{are the most}} versatile f́actoriesf́or natural or non-natural products, however, the conversion of e. g. hydrophobic substrates can quickly become cytotoxic. One host organism {{with the potential to}} handle such conditions is the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas putida, which distinguishes itself by solvent tolerance, metabolic flexibility, and genetic amenability. However, whole cell bioconversions are highly complex processes. A typical bottleneck compared to classical chemistry is lower yield and reproducibility owing to cell-to-cell variability. The intention of this work was therefore to characterize a model producer strain of P. putida KT 2440 on the single cell level to identify non-productive or impaired subpopulations. Flow cytometry was used in this work to discriminate subpopulations regarding DNA content or productivity, and further mass spectrometry or digital PCR was employed to reveal differences in protein composition or plasmid copy number. Remarkably, productivity of the population was generally bimodally distributed comprising low and highly producing cells. When these two subpopulations were analyzed by mass spectrometry, only few metabolic changes but fundamental differences in stress related proteins were found. As the source for heterogeneity remained elusive, it was hypothesized that cell cycle state may be related to production capacity of the cells. However, subpopulations of one, two, or higher fold DNA content were virtually identical providing no clear hints for regulatory differences. On the quest for heterogeneity the loss of genetic information came into focus. A new work flow using digital PCR was created to determine the absolute number of DNA copies per cell and, finally, lack of expression could be attributed to loss of plasmid in non-producing cells.
