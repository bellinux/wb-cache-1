5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating.

25|$|Space {{neuroscience}} is {{the scientific}} study of the central nervous system (CNS) functions during spaceflight. Living systems can integrate the inputs from the senses to navigate in their environment and to coordinate posture, locomotion, and eye movements. Gravity has a fundamental role in controlling these functions. In weightlessness during spaceflight, integrating the sensory inputs and coordinating motor responses is harder to do because gravity is no longer sensed during free-fall. For example, the otolith organs of the vestibular system no longer signal head tilt relative to gravity when standing. However, they can still sense head translation during body motion. Ambiguities and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> the gravitational input is processed can lead to potential errors in perception, which affects spatial orientation and mental representation. Dysfunctions of the vestibular system are common during and immediately after spaceflight, such as space motion sickness in orbit and balance disorders after return to Earth.|$|E

[...] Angelou's biographies, beginning with Caged Bird, consisted of [...] "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression". This sequence led Angelou, as the protagonist, from [...] "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest" [...] throughout all seven of her autobiographies. [...] Angelou changed her views in the course of her autobiographies about Black-white relationships and learned to accept different points of view. It was <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> she regarded race, and her views of white people, that provided Angelou with freedom.

Hunter-gatherer societies were all oral cultures and thus only existed in geographically-limited small groups and identified themselves symbiotically {{in terms of that}} group. Spiritually, these societies believed in local gods who were only known to others through oral tales. The development of writing, as well as hydraulics and irrigation, allowed agricultural societies to better organize themselves so that a larger geographic area and a larger population could be controlled. Hydraulic power was labour-intensive, requiring large populations of subservient people. With scripts, there was a shift from [...] a mythological consciousness to a theological consciousness; individuals thought of themselves less in terms of a small, local group and more with a monotheistic religion which included a personal relationship with a god.|$|E
