25|$|In 1833, {{shortly after}} his defeat in the {{previous}} year's presidential election, Clay worked with Calhoun to end the dispute. Though Clay desired a high tariff, he found Jackson's war-like rhetoric against South Carolina distressing, and sought to avoid a crisis that could end in civil war.

40|$|The Academization of Sport in Sweden – Governing issues Sport {{research}} {{within the}} social sciences, and sport science (sport studies) education at an academic level are relatively new phenomenon’s in Sweden. Research started <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1970 s and before the 2000 s {{there were only a}} few academic sport educations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. Today, research and education are both comprehensive and diversified. The questions are: -	How research and education have emerged, how they appear today, and how they relate to each other? -	What knowledge is produced within research and what knowledge is conveyed through education? -	Do they differ? And if so - in what way and why? The study deals with the Sport Academization process. The purpose is to attain a deeper understanding of sport science higher education and its relationship to sport research from a knowledge perspective. Four concepts are particularly central <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study: knowledge, power, discourse and institutions. The analysis is grounded in theories as: Berger and Luckmann’s sociology of knowledge, Foucault’s ideas about discourse, power and institutions, Bourdieu’s field analysis, and Baumans theories about social processes and discourses of different eras. The empirical material consists mainly of various documents. Examples of analyzed documents are: dissertations, journal articles, educational plans and curriculums. The documents have been handled both qualitatively and quantitatively. Discourse analysis has been the main method for the qualitative analysis. The study shows that there is a discrepancy between the produced and conveyed knowledge. The largest proportion of the research has been produced within the fields of pedagogy, psychology, and history. In addition - almost half of the educations were Sport Management programs. The main interpretation of the differences is that research and education is based on different contemporary logics (ideas and ideals). The difference between produced and conveyed knowledge highlights important political questions about how research and education should be governed. For example: -	What role should <b>the</b> government take <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strategic planning and government of sport research and higher sport education? -	To what extent, and under what forms, should research and education be self-governed? -	What implications do different <b>choices,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>matters</b> above, infer (amount to) ...|$|R
25|$|A recent law journal note {{summarized}} the justifications for regulating payday lending. The summary notes {{that while it}} is difficult to quantify the impact on specific consumers, there are external parties who are clearly affected by the decision of a borrower to get a payday loan. Most directly impacted are the holders of other low interest debt from the same borrower, which now is less likely to be paid off since the limited income is first used to pay the fee associated with the payday loan.

25|$|The CPC don't {{believe that}} they have {{abandoned}} Marxism. The party views the world as organized into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, on the basis of historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Marx wrote that capitalists, in their search for profit, would travel the world in a bid to establish new international markets – hence, it is generally assumed that Marx forecasted globalization. His writings on the subject is used to justify the CPC's market reforms, since nations, according to Marx, have little <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> of joining or not. Opting not to take part in capitalist globalization means losing out in the fields of economic development, technological development, foreign investment and world trade. This view is strengthened by the economic failures of the Soviet Union and of China under Mao.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the series}} was indeed {{proving to be a}} hit, its late time slot in the country's largest media market began to concern its distributor. Even though Letterman's show and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson were strong ratings winners and Jeopardy! was able to retain a good amount of the {{audience}} from its lead in shows, a late night time slot is not usually considered beneficial for a first run series. WNBC, however, was not left with much <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> At the time, the station cleared the NBC daytime lineup in its entirety and aired {{two and a half hours}} of news beginning at 5:00p.m. The only available slots the station had were the 9:00a.m. hour between the end of Today and the beginning of the daytime schedule, the 4:00p.m. hour between the end of the daytime schedule and Live at Five, and the 7:30p.m. slot between the end of NBC Nightly News and the beginning of primetime. Each one of those slots was spoken for, however. The popular Donahue was one of the station's biggest ratings draws in daytime and was not going anywhere (especially considering NBC's New York base was about to become its home), which precluded Jeopardy! from moving there. WNBC, as a network-owned station, had also picked up the syndicated edition of Family Feud when it premiered along with the rest of the stations NBC owned, which took away the 7:30 slot. King World looked for a way out of its unfavorable situation with WNBC, but there was not much to be done. The two other major network affiliates in New York, WABC and WCBS, both had the same issue as WNBC in that both stations cleared their network's schedule completely and had other programming filing the holes in their schedules.|$|E

However, port prioritization was an idea conceived mainly to benefit businesses in which employees all shared the same internet connection. Employees who used [...] "bandwidth hogging" [...] applications such as peer-to-peer (P2P) applications and network-intense online games often slowed down the network dramatically, preventing users who wished to browse web pages or check their mail {{to do so in}} a short space of time. Port prioritization solves this problem as it prioritizes certain ports for certain applications.

Collective action theory, as discussed by Ostrom, offers several possible solutions, such as privatization of territory or discussion amongst the populace. Unfortunately, such solutions are impractical for this particular problem. The government must step in and impose a recycling “Leviathan” by implementing mandatory recycling and forcing citizens to recycle or be left with their own refuse. Only by making recycling a self-interested priority for the populace will St John’s be able to improve its waste management practices...|$|R

An objective, {{on the best}} scientific evidence-based consumer information about subthreshold elevated blood glucose levels (impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance) and primary prevention of diabetes, is not available yet. Thus we developed a web-based EBPI and aim to evaluate its effects on informed decision making in people 50 years or older. Methods/Design We conduct a web-based randomised-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of information about elevated blood glucose levels and diabetes primary prevention on five specific outcomes: (i) knowledge of elevated blood glucose level-related issues (primary outcome); (ii) attitudes to a metabolic testing; (iii) intention to undergo a metabolic testing; (iv) decision conflict; (v) satisfaction with the information. The intervention group receives a specially developed EBPI about subthreshold elevated blood glucose levels and diabetes primary prevention, the control group information about this topic, available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> internet. The study population consists of people between 50 and 69 years of age without known diabetes. Participants will be recruited via the internet page of the cooperating health insurance company, Techniker Krankenkasse (TK), and the internet page of the German Diabetes Centre.

40|$|This {{submission}} {{represents a}} journey of learning about learning within accounting education, and, <b>in</b> particular, <b>the</b> role of learning technologies and students’ skills <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of learning. The work presented was published {{over the past decade}} and a half and addresses issues concerned with accounting education both past and present, and includes research on the author of the first printed text on double entry bookkeeping, Fra’ Luca Pacioli. The overriding research interest at the core of this submission and which has guided the various and varied phases and themes within in it is a concern to learn from how learning technologies are and have been {{an integral part of the}} educational environment, and to gain insight into how learning technologies might best be utilised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of accounting education. The work is presented in two themes with an additional two publications related to methodological approach. The first theme is related to students’ skills and technology and the second theme includes historical research into early accounting education. <b>The</b> published work <b>in</b> these themes is predominantly represented by research published in leading refereed journals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields of accounting education and accounting history. The additional two publications are included as they relate to and illustrate the methodological approaches that underlie the overall approach to the research that is presented and developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two themes: an approach that privileges, as far as practical, subjects’ contextual understandings of their worlds. Given the diversity of <b>the</b> work included <b>in</b> this submission there is no single research question and there are a diverse range of contributions. The work included contributes to our understanding of the introduction and utilisation of learning technologies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> teaching of accounting, both printed books <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 15 th century and Information Technology (IT) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 20 th/early 21 st centuries, and the skills required to facilitate learning within the discipline of accounting. The practical value and importance of the research is supported by, inter alia, reference to the author’s applied work (not part of the submission) that illustrates how the published work contributes to good practice in skills development and the introduction and integration of learning technologies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accounting curriculum. The papers on IT skills adds to our understanding of the IT skills that students bring with them to university, and raises awareness of the need to challenge the taken for granted assumptions about the abilities of new generations of students. The work on generic skills, whilst showing the importance of skills development also highlights <b>the</b> complexities <b>in</b> this area particularly in relation to issues concerned with confidence <b>in</b> making <b>choices,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subject <b>matter,</b> via modelling <b>choices,</b> and <b>in</b> time management: not knowing what to do, what to study. The paper on matrix accounting in a Russian university illustrates the potential of an approach to accounting education that is facilitated by the use of IT based learning. The work on Pacioli contributes significantly to our knowledge and understanding of Pacioli as a pioneer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of accounting education, and the role of his writing within Summa <b>in</b> <b>the</b> education, development and spread of double entry bookkeeping and accounting, in particular by relating the works to literature in fields such as renaissance art, educational systems and social development. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>the</b> sole authored work on Pacioli concentrates on an element of the minutiae of the bookkeeping process, the accounting for goods inventory, traces the longevity of this method of recording transactions, and shows how this had potential to provide important decision information to merchants, who were the prime market for Pacioli’s writing at the time. The two themes addressed in this submission include works that have individually made unique and significant contributions to the fields of accounting education and accounting history, and the two publications included to illustrate the methodological approach have made a contribution methodologically and to the finance literature. Taken together the works presented also provide a significant and original contribution to the knowledge and understanding of the role of learning technologies in accounting education and, by investigating new learning technologies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different periods of time, provide a platform for further research to help us to appreciate the importance of technologies in accounting, and in accounting education...|$|R

2500|$|The {{fourth group}} is the [...] "no children" [...] group.

While not their main {{emphasis}} on the subject, Protestant authors such as Samuel Owen and James B. Jordan support this as an acceptable option, but only when a higher ethical principle intervenes to make child bearing imprudent, such as health concerns or a calling to serve orphans or as missionaries in a dangerous location, etc. A small activist group, the Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree, argues their position, [...] "Jesus loved children but chose to never have any, {{so that he could}} devote his life to telling the Good News." [...] Jordan also maintains that modern birth control methods, as well as Natural Family Planning, are acceptable tools of prudent family planning.

2500|$|Later Act IV, Scene 1, Ariel says: [...] "when I {{presented}} Ceres / I {{thought to}} have told thee of it / but I feared lest I might anger thee." [...] Earlier in the same scene, Ceres, along with Iris and Juno, had appeared at Prospero's command in a Masque. Scholars have wondered whether Shakespeare originally intended the actor for Ariel to cover Ceres' role, and give it away in this line. The need for a dual role may {{have been caused by}} a shortage of boys capable of playing female parts (boys usually played all female roles in Shakespeare's day) as there are many female roles in The Tempest. This changing of parts requires a change in costume, which explains a lot of Ariel's delay in scene four in carrying out Prospero's orders. Time is allowed for the character to change from Ariel to Ceres and back. On the other side, Ceres may have been associated, by Shakespeare, to the Kairos figure, related to rhetorics, personating the opportune moment to present the convincing argument in a speech. Early critics were sceptical of the idea, saying that [...] "presented Ceres" [...] could merely mean that Ariel introduced Ceres to the gathering. More recent studies, however, have revealed that, given the small number of boys travelling with the King's Men and the large number of parts for them to fill, there would have been little <b>choice</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> The entire scene comes together in a way that leads scholars to believe that the Masque scene with the three goddesses was added as an afterthought to work around costuming and role-playing issues.|$|E
