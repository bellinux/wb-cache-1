The lower resistance of the short arc brings about the increase of the <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> which leads to the faster melting of the wire stick-out until again a stable working point is reached, point 3. This compensation process takes approximately between 100 and 200 ms. The arc sensor evaluates the remaining change in <b>current</b> <b>intensity</b> between point 1 and point 3 in order to achieve a distance-proportionate parameter. In principle, this evaluation concept is also applicable to pulsed arc welding.The concept which has been specified above is, in the case of most arc sensors, extended by the transversal scanning of the groove geometry. The deflection of the process to the fusion faces allows the comparative measurement of the torch distance. By calculating the difference of the distance values, the lateral positioning of the torch can be evaluated. The mean value of both distance values indicates the height of the torch above the groove. Different concepts are applied for the deflection (Figure 9).Mechanical oscillation is most widely spread and is frequently used, especially with robots. Basically, fast deflectory systems, e.g. with magnetic or rotatory deflection offer the improvement of the signal rate and the signal quality, a higher apparatus expenditure must, however, be calculated when these systems are used.

The aim of this study, on nine healthy subjects, was to compare the cortical network activation profile and pain ratings during NMES of the right forearm wrist extensor muscles at increasing <b>current</b> <b>intensities</b> up to and slightly over the individual maximal tolerated intensity (MTI), and with reference to voluntary (VOL) wrist extension movements. By exploiting the capability of the multi-channel time domain functional near-infrared spectroscopy technique to relate depth information to the photon time-of-flight, the cortical and superficial oxygenated (O 2 Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin concentrations were estimated. The O 2 Hb and HHb maps obtained using the General Linear Model (NIRS-SPM) analysis method, showed that the VOL and NMES-evoked movements significantly increased activation (i. e., increase in O 2 Hb and corresponding decrease in HHb) in the cortical layer of the contralateral sensorimotor network (SMC, PMC/SMA, and S 2). However, the level and area of contralateral sensorimotor network (including PFC) activation was significantly greater for NMES than VOL. Furthermore, there was greater bilateral sensorimotor network activation with the high NMES <b>current</b> <b>intensities</b> which corresponded with increased pain ratings. In conclusion, our findings suggest that greater bilateral sensorimotor network activation profile with high NMES <b>current</b> <b>intensities</b> could be in part attributable to increased attentional/pain processing and to increased bilateral sensorimotor integration in these cortical regions...|$|R

MethodsTwenty-five rats were submitted to stereotactic stimulation of the posterior striatum under general anesthesia, receiving consecutively four different <b>current</b> <b>intensities.</b> the motor responses observed in the different body parts were registered for later comparison. We considered as threshold the smallest of these <b>current</b> <b>intensities</b> able to evoke a motor response. ResultsThe observed motor responses were qualitatively different for each segment: forepaws: ipsilateral, adduction, and contralateral abduction; hindpaws: ipsilateral, flexion, and contralateral, extension/abduction; trunk, rotation/flexion; and tail, rotation/elevation. High-frequency, small-amplitude distal tremor occurred in the ipsilateral forepaw in 95 % of the animals. Progressively larger <b>current</b> <b>intensities</b> were necessary for the induction of motor response in the forepaws, hindpaws, and trunk/tail, in that order. ConclusionsThe results allowed us to infer the following posterior striatal somatotopic organization: forepaws, posterolaterally, being the contralateral medial to the ipsilateral; trunk/tail, anteromedially; and hindpaws, in an intermediate position, being the contralateral posterior to the ipsilateral. It is suggested that the tremor and the other observed motor responses derive from the excitation of striatal projection neurons and that the striatum may {{play an important role}} in the genesis of essential tremor.
