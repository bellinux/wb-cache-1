40|$|The {{suitability}} {{of the pattern}} manufactured with the development figure was considered by reviewing the development conditions that can be directly connected to the basic pattern {{in the human body}} surface development figure with the cast bandage method. The method to prepare the sleeve basic pattern was based on the <b>cylindrical</b> surface <b>development</b> method, and the sleeve basic pattern covering the 45 and 90 degrees momentum of the arm-movement was made by using the cast-type body surface development figure prepared with the horizontal line of the sleeve hem placed horizontally in the plan and by combining the cast-type body surface development figure in the standing position with the figure in the moving position. The test clothing was prepared with the sleeve pattern adding the bodice pattern in the standing position and the momentum and was worn on the FRP replica. The relationship theory of the body surface development figure with the pattern was derived by reviewing the suitability from the wearing state. The sleeve-cap height of the sleeve basic pattern resulted in about 80 % in the standing position when the needs for a physical activity ar...|$|R

The <b>development</b> of algorithms and programs for the determination of deep regimes is also {{the aim of the}} paper. As a result typical boundary-value {{problems for}} longitudinal non-one-dimensional cylindrical regions have been constructed and investigated.

40|$|As {{the demand}} for highly capable {{microsatellite}} missions continues to grow, so too does the need for small, low power satellite technologies. One area which {{needs to be addressed}} is advanced propulsion systems capable of performing on-orbit maneuvers, station keeping and deorbit impulses with minimal propellant. A relatively low power Cylindrical Hall Thruster (CHT) is being developed at the Space Flight Laboratory (SFL) specifically to meet the low power and size requirements of microsatellite missions. The development of SFLâ€™s sub 200 Watt, 26 mm ionization chamber diameter Hall Thruster will permit more capable microsatellite missions while minimizing the required propellant and thruster mass. The aim is to produce a CHT qualified to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by the end of 2015. The first development phase focused on a highly configurable prototype design which facilitated optimization of performance parameters such as thrust, specific impulse and power consumption. The second phase incorporated lessons learned from prototype testing into the development of a proto-flight model. Subsequent work will involve packaging and qualifying a standalone flight unit including all electrical interfaces and the propellant feed system. Evaluations of alternative propellants such as Krypton and Argon against the baseline Xenon propellant will also be performed. This paper presents the test results from the low power <b>Cylindrical</b> Hall Thruster <b>development</b> campaign and discusses the status of the program and future plans...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Reactor Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Nodal {{diffusion}} {{methods have}} been used extensively in nuclear reactor calculations specifically for their performance advantage, but also their superior accuracy. In this work a nodal diffusion method is developed for three-dimensional <b>cylindrical</b> geometry. Recent <b>developments</b> in the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) project have sparked renewed interest {{in the application of}} different modelling methods to its design, and naturally included in this effort is a nodal method for cylindrical geometry. More specifically, the Analytic Nodale Method (ANM) has been applied to numerous reactor problems with much success. The multi-group ANM is applied to Cartesian geometry in the Necsa developed OSCAR- 3 code system used for the calculation of MTR and PWR type nuclear reactors. However, in support of the PBMR project, a need has arisen to include the ANM in cylindrical geometry. The ANM is based on a transverse integration principle, resulting in a set, of one-dimensional equations containing inhomogeneous sources. The issue of applying this method to 3 D cylindrical geometry has never been satisfactorily addressed, due to difficulties in performing the transverse integration, and a proposed solution entails the use of conformal mapping in order to circumvent these difficulties. This approach should yield a set of 1 D equations with an extra, geometrically dependent., "ghost" source. This thesis describes the mathematical development of the conformal mapping approach, as well as the numerical analysis via a developed FORTRAN test code. The code is applied to a series of test problems, ranging from idealized constructions to realistic PBMR 400 MW designs. Results show that the method is viable and yields much improved accuracy and performance, similar to what may be expected from nodal methods. Master...|$|R
40|$|We {{know that}} {{the basis of a}} survey is always choice, {{selection}} and discretization of the elements. In the case of a geometric transformation, in order to produce a flat representation of the detected surface detected, this smust be approximated to a combination of developable geometric shapes. Having no specific references in the field of architectural survey we can intervene on the basis of similar experiments made by the mapping used to to develope solutions to similar problems. It Is therefore essential to analyze patterns of map projections {{in order to have a}} useful starting point to develop a new projection model to be proposed. We can then synthesize a first list of the various geometric problems and how they might be faced: - When a series of paintings is done on a flat surface, or comparable to it, the simple projection in accordance with the mere seconds the attitude average projection produces a correct image. - If we have a ruled surface this can be developed and then the two-dimensional representation can be obtained by graphical and numerical processing, separately from the three-dimensional model that show a not 'measurable' vision. This possibility is very important, for example, in cases of restoration but also simply for a more complete overview. This is a secure plug-in required different program in the graphics used for the architectural survey. Limited to <b>cylindrical</b> surfaces the <b>development</b> can be made with the software for stiching panoramas. In fact, you run to shoot pictures with the camera positioned with the front nodal point on the axis will and then you obtain geometric, landscape, or a cylindrical projection developed. - The third case is that of non-developable surfaces, such as spherical surfaces or other even more complex. Often we can seek help from stereographic projection used in cartography. All map projections are carried out mainly in two phases: the first project the ellipsoidal surface of the earth of a ruled surface and develop as a cylinder or cone, and the second provides for its development in the plan, other procedures limited project areas directly on a plane. The different analytical techniques-projective possible to respect some parameters useful to the end use of the card. So we have: equivalence, when the area ratio is maintained; Isogon, when retained in the corners, equidistance, when you keep the ratio of distances. Just the equivalence would seem the most appropriate feature to an application for heritage conservation...|$|R
