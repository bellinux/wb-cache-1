40|$|AbstractA three-step {{model for}} the performance-based {{numerical}} simulations of the fire response of steel–RC two-layered beam-like composite structures is presented and validated. The first step consists of {{the determination of the}} evolution of temperatures in the structure׳s surroundings. Moisture and the heat transfer through the RC layer and the conduction of heat over the steel layer are obtained in the second step. In concrete, the transfer of water vapour, dry air, and free water is discussed as well as the evaporation and liquefaction phenomena and the dehydration of concrete and its thermal and mechanical degradation. Within the framework of the third step, a geometrically and materially non-linear mechanical response of the structure is proposed accounting for interlayer slips and uplifts as well as for various material-related phenomena such as the material hardening/softening and creep. The governing equations are solved numerically. An efficient, novel strain-based finite element formulation is introduced for the mechanical analysis. Due to its generality and consideration of several different possible non-linear material, geometrical, and interlayer contact phenomena and their couplings the model can be of a use to a broader fire science community for exploring the impact of different physical parameters on the results of the addressed numerical simulations, thereby providing directions for further research. In the paper a case of such a study is also demonstrated exploring the contribution of the steel sheet and the flexibility of the interlayer connection of a standard trapezoidal steel–RC slab to its ultimate fire resistance. A reasonable contribution of the sheet is proved if the stiffness ratio between the integrated and the external tensile reinforcement of the RC plate is low provided that the <b>contact</b> <b>connection</b> is sufficiently stiff...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{consider}} the method of constructive parameters calculation of the elastic elements, which are used in electrical connectors of flexible printed cables. Electrical connectors characterized {{by the fact that}} the contact pair is needed to provide pressure. It is also important to know the optimum ratio between stability of the <b>contact</b> <b>connection</b> and the necessary value of the transition resistance. These ratios are studied sufficiently for discrete electrical connectors, however for connectors of flexible printed cables this theme is not explored enough. The purpose of this work is to develop methods that will allow to carry out calculations for elastic elements, which provide communication, and to determine the size of case elements for electrical connectors. We consider two types of connectors. First are removable electrical connections where it is necessary to find a compromise between the resistance value and the separating (engaging) force. Second are permanent connections, where counts only the value of the transition resistance. For the first type of connectors were considered a simple form of the liner, in the shape of a rubber block, as in this case, the pressure should be created only by the compression of the liner and fixing it. It is important to get accurate results of the pressure calculation for removable electrical connections, because in this case we consider especial shape of elastomeric liner, which allows to create the pressure not only by compression of the liner, but by deformation it as a spring. For this task, the engaging force was specified on the basis of already known facts. It was important to set the amount of deformation that defines the shape and size of the liner and the case. We solved the problem of transition from the units of measuring hardness, specified in the technical specifications of rubber, to the value of the Young's modulus used in the calculations of constructive parameters of connectors. We got an analytic dependence that can be used to find the Young's modulus for a known value of hardness on a scale Shore A. We gave examples of the amount of compression calculation in the elastomeric liner to provide a reliable contact for specified values of the transition resistance for the removable and permanent connectors based on flexible printed cable...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{education}} system on campus {{has been using}} as a legacy over decades to support educational learning. The major change over time has {{been made by the}} use of technology supporting students in the academic community. As the majority of students in higher education today belong to the digital-age-student generation, they frequently use online technology to interact with instructors, other learners, and to access online materials. In this study, the result is primarily presented from campus students’ perceptions, to gain a deeper understanding of how social media is being used to support educational and collaborative/cooperative learning. Although, almost all the respondents are frequent social media users, only a quarter of them use such media regularly for academic purposes. Through use of social media in academia, students have encountered with benefits─ as convenience, possibility of interaction anywhere/anytime, time-saving, low price and many others─ in addition to facing to limitations─ such as less effective or spontaneous <b>contact,</b> <b>connection</b> problems, lack of platform compatibility, less creative and innovative thinking, and other issues─ which have been discussed in this study. This thesis adopted a qualitative research and the characterization of knowledge that is used is exploratory research method with the use of interview as a tool for empirical data collection. Twenty interviews have been conducted with Uppsala University higher education students within random subject disciplines. Among many different social media, the most frequent ones used by majority of students are e-mail, a common asynchronous media to interact with instructors and other learners; and Instant Messaging (IM), a synchronous communication way to interact with co-workers, classmates, or group-mates. Furthermore, learners use social media to coordinate their collaborative/cooperative work, share documents and ask questions. Facebook, Wikipedia, YouTube and other popular social media are also sometimes used for educational purposes. The findings indicate that social media seems particularly beneficial for supporting educational learning; though there are some negative aspect and limitations. Learners look at using the technology and social media as a complement to support their studies and collaboration/cooperation. However, not many of them consider using such media as a substitute for face-to-face interactions and the traditional campus education. By drawing on this thesis and the previous studies, proposition on how use of social media supports educational learning in the future has been emerged...|$|E
