40|$|Theoretical and {{computational}} {{study for}} a polarization change of localized and finite amplitude Alfven waves propagating parallel to an {{applied magnetic field}} is presented using both reductive perturbation theory and numerical simulations. In the magnetohydrodynamic limit, where right-hand and left-hand <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> are degenerate, one of the transverse components of the <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> Alfven <b>wave</b> is stable as it propagates, but the other component is unstable to either self-focusing or diffraction effects. Consequently, the wave changes its polarization from circular to linear. In the high frequency regime, where two <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> (right-hand and left-hand <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves)</b> are not degenerate, two transverse components of the <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> Alfven <b>wave</b> are strongly coupled to each other, and {{there is almost no}} polarization change...|$|R

We theoretically study two possible implementations of such hybrid materials: (1) the case of metal-dielectric stacks; and (2) rectangular waveguide near its cut-off frequency.

40|$|Properties of <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> are {{studied in}} the pulsar {{magnetosphere}} plasma. It is shown that some observational characteristics of the circular polarization observed in the pulsar radio emission can be qualitatively explained {{in the framework of}} the model based on anomalous Doppler resonance. Performed analysis provides that if the difference between Lorentz factors of electrons and positrons is relatively high, one of the <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> becomes super-luminal and therefore can not be generated by cyclotron instability. We suggest that this case corresponds to the pulsars with the domination of one hand of circular polarization through the whole averaged pulse profile at all observed frequencies. For intermediate values of the difference between Lorentz factors both <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> are generated, but the waves of one handness are much more effectively generated for high frequencies, whereas generation of another handness dominates for low frequencies. This should correspond to the pulsars with strong frequency dependence of the degree of circular polarization. The case of relatively small difference between Lorentz factors corresponds to the pulsars with sign reversal of the circular polarization in the centre of averaged pulse profiles.

50|$|The {{study of}} planar chiral {{metamaterials}} {{has revealed that}} planar chirality is associated with an optical effect: the directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection and absorption) of circularly polarized waves. Planar chiral metamaterials, which are also anisotropic and lossy exhibit different total transmission (reflection and absorption) levels for the same <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> incident on their front and back.The asymmetric transmission phenomenon arises from different, e.g. left-to-right, circular polarization conversion efficiencies for opposite propagation directions of the incident wave and therefore the effect {{is referred to as}} circular conversion dichroism.Like the twist of a planar chiral pattern appears reversed for opposite directions of observation, planar chiral metamaterials have interchanged properties for left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves that are incident on their front and back. In particular left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves experience opposite directional transmission (reflection and absorption) asymmetries.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} an evolved antenna is an X-band antenna evolved for a 2006 NASA mission called Space Technology 5 (ST5). The mission {{consists}} of three satellites that will take measurements in Earth's magnetosphere. Each satellite has two communication antennas to talk to ground stations. The antenna has an unusual structure and was evolved to meet a challenging set of mission requirements, notably the combination of wide beamwidth for a <b>circularly</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> and wide impedance bandwidth to cover {{the up and down}} link frequencies at X-band. Each spacecraft had two antennas - an evolved unit and a more standard, quadrifilar helix antenna. Both antennas were fabricated by the Physical Science Laboratory at New Mexico State University. Their external appearance was essentially identical in that a foam radome covered the radiating elements. The ST5 mission successfully launched on March 22, 2006 and operated for the mission period before being decommissioned by NASA, and so this evolved antenna represents the world's first artificially-evolved object to fly in space. Other evolved antennas were subsequently used on the LADEE spacecraft.|$|E

The variation of the cutoff frequency [omega] 0 with the static electric field E 0, magnetostatic field B 0, the electron number density N and the electron gas temperature T is discussed.
