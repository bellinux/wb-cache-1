25|$|Addai, {{who became}} the first bishop of Edessa, was succeeded by Aggai, then by Palut, who was ordained about 200 by Serapion of Antioch. Thence <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in the 2nd century the famous Peshitta, or Syriac {{translation}} of the Old Testament; also Tatian's Diatessaron, which was compiled about 172 and in common use until St. Rabbula, Bishop of Edessa (412–435), forbade its use. This arrangement of the four Canonical gospels as a continuous narrative, whose original language may have been Syriac, Greek, or even Latin, circulated widely in Syriac-speaking Churches.|$|E
25|$|Some 200 {{yards in}} advance of our position, which we were holding at a terrible cost, was a fence built high and strong. The troops in advance had tried to scale the fence and reform under that hell of fire. They were {{actually}} torn in shreds and wedged into the fence. The cry <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> for volunteers to pull down the fence. Instantly there sprang from the long line, fast being shortened as the ranks closed up over the dead, seventy-six volunteers. We ran straight for the fence amid a hail of iron and lead, the dead falling all about us, but to reach the fence was our only thought. A part of the force reached it, and, as one would grasp a rail it would be sent flying {{out of his hands}} by rifle-shots. The fence leveled, we made the attempt to return, and it was as hot for us on the retreat, as it had been on the advance. Few escaped death or wounds. I had almost regained my regiment, when I was hit. The line then successfully pressed on, and the 'Sunken Road,' or ' Bloody Lane,' as it is now known, was within our lines.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews were {{critical}} of the film's resemblance to The Fly. British magazine Time Out later [...] pointed it out, as did TV Guide. Audiences also noted that it {{was similar to the}} 1959 science fiction film 4D Man. In a 2000 interview with Video Watchdog, Richard Gordon stated [...] "we weren't really influenced by The Fly" [...] and wrote in the 2006 book Interviews with B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers that [...] "Projected Man does have a very strong similarity to The Fly, but it <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as a finished screenplay and seemed to be a perfectly logical film to make." ...|$|E

They were excited about the offer, as it indicated {{their impact on the}} music industry. Some people perceived participating in Woodstock '99 was a sell-out for the group; however, Bruce and Utsler disagreed. As Bruce explains, [...] " [...] sold out the mainstream style for us!

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{incarnation of}} [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{developed during the}} recording sessions for Achtung Baby. While working in Hansa Ton Studios in Berlin, guitarist The Edge and lead singer Bono created the verse. The track was given the working title [...] "Sinatra" [...] {{in reference to the}} artist whose music inspired it. The group reworked it in preparation of Zooropa. The Edge noted [...] "it <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in installments". Bassist Adam Clayton said [...] "it was hard to figure out how we would do it. I mean, {{no one is going to}} mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what we ended up with and that really worked." [...] The Edge added [...] "I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to summon up the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition." [...] He worked out a chord progression based on old Tin Pan Alley songs.|$|E

500|$|The title {{ascribed}} to the hymn, [...] "1 Chronicles 17:16–17", refers to David's reaction to the prophet Nathan telling him that God intends to maintain his family line forever. Some Christians interpret this as a prediction that Jesus Christ, as a descendant of David, was promised by God as the salvation for all people. Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratefulness for God's guidance, that God {{is involved in the}} daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await. Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly, and was humbled by it. According to Newton, unconverted sinners were [...] "blinded by the god of this world" [...] until [...] "mercy <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> not only undeserved but undesired... our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace." ...|$|E
500|$|Dougan {{was signed}} by Aston Villa in July 1961 for a fee of £15,000. He {{was signed by}} manager Joe Mercer as a {{replacement}} for Gerry Hitchens, who had been sold on to Inter Milan earlier in the summer for £85,000. Teammate Peter McParland later commented that [...] "when Derek <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> at Aston Villa I think it was {{at a time when he}} was not taking the game particularly seriously". After returning from watching his [...] "Villans" [...] teammates win the 1961 League Cup Final at Villa Park on 5 September, Dougan was a passenger in a car accident which killed fellow passenger Malcolm Williams and left Dougan with a broken arm and head injuries; driver and teammate Bobby Thomson was charged but found 'Not Guilty' of careless driving. In November 2010 – three years after Dougan's death, Thomson claimed that Dougan had drunkenly pulled a deerstalker hat over his eyes, causing him to crash the car. Dougan recovered after three months on the sidelines and ended the 1961–62 season with 12 goals in 27 matches. He twisted his knee midway through the 1962–63 campaign after slipping in the street, and ended the season with 14 goals from 33 games.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{consider}} Streltsov {{to be one}} of {{the finest}} footballers ever from Russia or the Soviet Union: British journalist and author Jonathan Wilson describes him as [...] "the greatest outfield player Russia has ever produced... a tall, powerful forward, possessed of a fine first touch and extraordinary footballing intelligence", while Russian author Aleksandr Nilin writes that [...] "the boy <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> from the land of wonder". Streltsov's skilful, innovative style of play helped him to stand out in Soviet football, and his pioneering of the back-heeled pass resulted in it becoming known in Russia as [...] "Streltsov's pass". During his early career, this technical ability combined with considerable speed and physical presence to create a formidable all-round forward player. In his later years, with his physical attributes reduced, he emphasised his skill and on-field intelligence to become more of a playmaker, playing further back and setting up attacking moves for team-mates rather than leading them himself. Indeed, for his final two seasons, Streltsov played in an attacking midfield role rather than up front. Despite the eight-year gap between his two spells as a member of the Soviet national team, Streltsov, nicknamed [...] "The Russian Pelé", was the fourth highest international goalscorer in the country's history.|$|E

500|$|Walker {{also took}} an {{interest}} in demographics later in his career, particularly towards the issues of immigration and birth rates. He published The Growth of the United States in 1882 and Restriction on Immigration in 1896 arguing for increasing restrictions out of concern about the diminished industrial and intellectual capacity of the most recent wave of immigrants. Walker also argued that unrestricted immigration was the major reason behind nineteenth-century Native American fertility decline, but while the argument was politically popular and became widely accepted in mobilizing restrictions on immigration, it rested upon a surprisingly facile statistical analysis that was later refuted. Writing on immigrants from southern Italy, Hungary, Austria, and Russia in The Atlantic, Walker claimed, [...] "The entrance into our political, social, and industrial life of such vast masses of peasantry, degraded below our utmost conceptions, is a matter which no intelligent patriot can look upon without the gravest apprehension and alarm. These people have no history behind them which is of a nature to give encouragement. They have none of the inherited instincts and tendencies which made it comparatively easy to deal with the immigration of the olden time. They are beaten men from beaten races; representing the worst failures in the struggle for existence. Centuries are against them, as centuries were on the side of those who formerly <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> They have none of the ideas and aptitudes which fit men to take up readily and easily the problem of self-care and self-government, such as belong to those who are descended from the tribes that met under the oak-trees of old Germany to make laws and choose chieftains." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{help fund}} the future works, the church {{announced}} plans in January 2008 to sell [...] of undeveloped, wooded property it owns on Hampton Lane to Shelter Development Corp. {{for construction of}} a senior citizen housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County officials to allow sixteen residential units per acre (current zoning limits density to two residential units per acre) {{for a total of}} 80100beds. The Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighboring Hampton, Maryland residents, said they [...] "...oppose zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down". Then-pastor David Cooney told the Baltimore Sun, [...] "We entered into this with Shelter, believing this is a good use for the land [...] that this is a good company and a needed service". In the face of community objections, however, Shelter and the church subsequently announced on March 3, 2008, that the development plans had been dropped. A Shelter official said that his company and Towson United Methodist Church had jointly {{come to the conclusion that}} [...] "this is not something we are going to pursue". Pastor Cooney said, [...] "It had become clear that we weren't going to be able to reach a compromise and we certainly don't want to be at war with our neighbors". In the wake of the plan's shelving, the president of the Hampton Improvement Association told the Towson Times that his group wishes to work with Towson United Methodist Church to find an alternative use for the land besides commercial development, as they [...] "don't want to preclude the church from trying to get some money out of it." [...] In April 2008, Dr. Cooney said that the church [...] "did not set out to sell this land; the proposal <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and we have no other plans to sell or develop the land".|$|E
