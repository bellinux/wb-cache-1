40|$|Mechanistic {{studies of}} coal cornbustion have long {{highlighted}} {{the variety of}} reaction pathways along which gasification may take place. These involve chemisorption of reactants, formation of surface oxides, surface mobility of chemisorbed species, and product desorption. At the same time, exposure of the solid fuel to high temperatures is associated with solid-state thermally activated processes. Altogether, the course of gasification may be profoundly affected by the overlapping and interplay of heterogeneous oxidation with purely thermally activated solid-state reactions. In the present work the cornbustion of a South African bituminous coal is analyzed {{in the framework of}} a simplified reaction network that embodies heterogeneous oxidative and thermally activated processes (pyrolysis, thermal annealing, coal <b>combustion,</b> <b>char</b> cornbustion, oxygen chernisorption) active both on the raw coal and on its char. The kinetics of each process of the network is assessed by a combination of thermogravimetric and gas analysis on coal and char samples.

40|$|Oxyfuel {{combustion}} is {{a technical}} option to yield energy from carbon based fuels without releasing CO 2 into the atmosphere. The main feature of oxyfuel combustion is replacing air with an oxidizer that mainly consists of CO 2 and O 2. This leads to {{high concentrations of}} CO 2 in the gas phase, which influences heat release, temperature and chemical reactions. This thesis studies how high concentations of CO 2 influence <b>char</b> <b>combustion,</b> {{the second stage of}} combustion of solid fuels such as coal and biomass. The first part of the thesis describes experimental investigations. Experiments show that in oxyfuel conditions <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> is promoted, but only at high temperatures and low O 2 concentrations. Under these conditions, local lack of O 2 at the particle surface is partly compensated by the slower Boudouard reaction.

To account for the complex interaction of effects, {{the second part of the}} work uses numerical simulation with Computational Fluid Dynamics. Simulations include validation of sub-models, especially for pyrolysis, <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> and thermal radiation, and evaluation of a pilot-size oxyfuel coal flame.

The combustion tests showed that the foams met several regulatory requirements in terms of their fire performance, {{whether or not they were}} combustion-modified. Both foams passed the MV SS 302 and CAL 117 small-flame tests. The nonmodified foam failed the Crib 5 test, but this test had a much larger ignition source. The particular problem with the nonmodified foam was melt drip into the flame zone. This led to a steady maintenance of the fuel feed and a rapid escalation of the fire. In contrast, the combustion-modified foam showed little melt drip and self-extinguished. Thermal analysis data for the two foams showed that melamine acted in part as an endothermic heat sink. This alone did not account for the much reduced melt flow and drip of the combustion-modified foam, but the solid-state 1 H-NMR data clearly showed that the molecular mobility of the <b>combustion</b> <b>char</b> from combustion-modified foam was lower than the unmodified foam char, which indicated that the flame-retardant formulation in the combustion-modified foam acted by a condensed-phase mechanism...|$|E

Under such conditions, char oxidation is frequently predicted by power law models, which despite their simplicity, are widely used in the comprehensive CFD modeling of pulverized coal boilers. However, {{there is no consensus}} on the apparent reaction order given by such models. This study developed a systematic approach which gives consistent values over a range of conditions. Apparent reaction orders for 10 bituminous coal chars were investigated with three different oxygen concentrations, ranging from 4 to 12 vol. %, and a gas temperature of 1223 K for each char. Experimental burnout profiles of the chars were obtained by means of an Isothermal Plug Flow Reactor operating at industrially realistic heating rates (10 (4) K/s). For various reaction orders between 0. 05 and 2. 00, kinetic parameters were independently determined, following numerical procedures recently suggested in the literature. The resulting values were incorporated into an empirical power law model and compared to experimental data for the 10 chars, over a burnout range of 0 - 75 %. The best fit to the experiments occurs with apparent reaction orders of around one for all the chars. (C) 2011 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Two {{slightly}} different models for predicting combustion efficiency for burning coal chars in bubbling fluidized bed combustors are developed. The models proposed assume that char particles are consumed simultaneously by combustion reaction and attrition with {{the rates of}} both processes following the shrinking particle model. To solve the gas-solid reaction problem, an approach {{quite different from the}} traditional method has been attempted. Characteristic times are introduced based on mean residence time concepts to characterize the reaction and attrition kinetics and particle size of different groups of char particles (ie original, attriated, elutriated, and withdrawal particles). Based on fundamental material balances and the proposed reaction-attrition mechanism, the models link combustion efficiency to some measurable parameters, including a few of the introduced characteristic times. Experimental techniques employing two types of batch experiments to determine the model parameters were developed. The first type experiments involve burning char particles to completion, while the second type experiments involve freezing the char combustion reaction, separating attrited particles from the original mother chars, and subsequently burning off attrited fines. With experimental records of exit gas concentrations of carbon oxides vs time for first type experiments as input, the models can be used to evaluate the parameters which characterize the reaction of burning char particles. When similar records for second type experiments are used, other parameters characterizing the attrited and elutriated particles can be obtained. The method also allows carbon losses from both types of experiments to be estimated. The new developments give a way to estimate the attrition rate and the elutriation fraction of post-attrition <b>combustion</b> <b>char</b> fines in fluidized beds, problems not previously solved. Experiments were performed with a bench-scale fluidized bed combustor to demonstrate the model parameter measuring techniques and to test the model features. The results show that the measured parameters are within reasonable ranges and generally agree well with the model assumptions. On the other hand, probably due to secondary fragmentation effects and the difficulty of precise burnout time measurement, most results evaluated for the power of dependence of fractional conversion on time are lower than expected, and discrepancies exist between the results of carbon loss estimated from the two types of experiments. The influences of coal type and operating conditions on the model parameters are also investigated. The results shown generally agree with past experience and are interpreted with the proposed model of the reaction-attrition mechanism...|$|E

40|$|The {{fluidized-bed}} <b>combustion</b> of <b>char</b> from a {{biomass fuel}} (Robinia Pseudoacacia) {{has been studied}} {{with a focus on}} the fate of fixed carbon under the combined effects of coarse <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> and attrition, of attrited carbon fines postcombustion and elutriation. Extensive postcombustion under oxidizing conditions prevents the measurement of the rates of carbon fines generation by attrition from collection of elutriated carbon. A novel technique is hereby presented to overcome this problem: the rates of coarse char attrition are evaluated from the comparison of the apparent carbon conversion rate of the actual test fuel, with that of a reference fuel, selected among those which have a negligible propensity to attrition. Results from the application of the proposed technique indicate that extensive fines generation by attrition, followed by their almost complete postcombustion, occurs during fluidized-bed <b>combustion</b> of Robinia <b>char.</b> About half of the fixed carbon burns along this pathway, the remainder being directly burnt as coarse char carbon. The occurrence of extensive attrition-postcombustion leads to enhancement of the coarse char particles' apparent Sherwood numbers by a factor of about two. Analysis of the dependence of the ratio between the fines generation rate and the parallel coarse <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> rate on operating variables of the reactor is directed to shed light on the prevailing mechanism of carbon fines generation by attrition.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{need for}} {{reducing}} emissions {{on a large}} scale to mitigate climate change has {{led to the development of}} new carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies such as oxyfuel combustion. Oxyfuel combustion, as the name suggests, is a technology in which fuel is burnt in oxygen rather than air to reduce the nitrogen content of the flue gas and thereby producing a concentrated stream of carbon dioxide almost ready for sequestration. In oxyfuel combustion a part of the flue gas, concentrated in CO₂, is recirculated back into the furnace mainly to reduce the high furnace temperatures. Hence, the combustion atmosphere is mainly O₂/CO₂ under oxyfuel conditions whereas in conventional air combustion, the atmosphere is mainly O₂/N₂. This major difference in the combustion conditions (the high CO₂ concentrations) affects major processes such as fuel combustion, heat transfer, and emissions inside the furnace. Hence, further development of this technology greatly relies on understanding the combustion and other processes under O₂/CO₂ conditions, with high CO₂ levels, as most current data and models available from air combustion may not suit pulverised coal combustion under oxyfuel conditions. This study deals in studying the combustion of pulverised coal in both O₂/CO₂ and O₂/N₂conditions concurrently. Data from the current study will help understand pulverised coal combustion under oxyfuel conditions and also enable direct comparison with the results obtained under air conditions. Coals of different ranks obtained from various regions of the world were selected to widen the scope of the study. In total, eight coals were used for the experiments, out of which three of them were mainly studied. Coals ranged from lignite to semi-anthracite and were obtained from were obtained from Australia, South Africa, Poland, and Germany. The combustion rates and reactivities were measured using a Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) and a Thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). The coal samples were analysed using proximate, ultimate, and petrographic analyses. Particle size measurements and scanning electron microscope studies were carried out on coal and char samples. Internal surface area measurements were performed on char samples. Chars were formed in the DTF at 1400 °C in N₂ and CO₂ atmospheres for the isothermal TGA tests. Combustion measurements were mainly carried out in the DTF and TGA under various O₂ levels, ranging from 0 to 21 % v/v basis, in O₂/N₂ and O₂/CO₂ atmospheres to simulate air and oxyfuel conditions respectively. Furnace temperatures were also varied in the DTF and the TGA tests in the range of 1000 to 1400 °C and 800 to 1000 °C respectively. Coal burnouts were measured in the DTF tests and char combustion rates were estimated from the coal burnout data. The char mass loss rates were measured in the TGA tests for reactivity assessment. Results from the current studies show that the char-CO₂ gasification reaction plays an important role under O₂/CO₂ conditions. Higher or similar volatile yields and coal/char burnouts were measured under CO₂ and O₂/CO₂ atmospheres respectively, in DTF experiments, in comparison to N₂ and O₂/N 2 ₂conditions respectively. The results from the DTF experiments were supported by higher mass loss rates and endothermic reactions indicated in O₂/CO₂ atmospheres during TGA experiments. The effect of the char-CO₂ gasification reaction depended on the coal type, furnace (particle) temperatures, and O₂ levels in the gas. The lower rank lignite tested in the study exhibited significantly higher mass loss/burnout under O₂/CO₂ conditions when compared to the other higher rank coals used in the study. The increase in mass loss rates/burnouts due to the char-CO₂ gasification was enhanced by lower O₂vlevels and higher furnace temperatures. While the diffusion of O₂ in CO₂ is slower than that in N₂, similar burnouts and combustion rates were observed in O₂/N₂ and O₂/CO₂ conditions. Under diffusion limited conditions, at very high particle temperatures, the char combustion rates are slower under O₂/CO₂ conditions, however, the char-CO₂ gasification reaction may compensate for the slower diffusivity. However, this depends on the coal type/rank as well, as the char-O₂ oxidation is comparatively faster and under diffusion limited conditions, the char-CO₂ gasification may not have sufficient residence time to have a significant effect on the char combustion rate. This study has shown that the char-CO₂ gasification reaction may contribute to the overall char combustion rate under O₂/CO₂ conditions depending on the O₂ level, the particle temperature, and the coal type. Under practical combustion conditions, as simulated in the current study using the DTF experiments, there may not be major differences in the coal burnout in air and oxyfuel conditions due to the reasons mentioned above. Even though the coal burnouts may appear similar apparently, the mechanisms of coal combustion including the volatiles release and <b>combustion,</b> <b>char</b> formation, and char combustion, have to be modelled specifically for O₂/CO₂ conditions in order to understand and predict the coal burnout and emissions. The char-CO₂ gasification reaction should be included in the models. Experimental data from the current study may be used for future modelling studies under O₂/CO₂ conditions. ...|$|E

The model {{is carried out}} {{on the premise that}} the total combustion response can be decomposed into two distinct processes: volatile <b>combustion</b> and <b>char</b> <b>combustion.</b> For an impulse in the feed rate of coal, the transient response of volatile combustion is modeled as an exponential decay. In contrast with volatile combustion, the transient response of <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> cannot be approximated by an exponential decay. Instead, the transient response of <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> is based on a closed-form solution to a population balance equation. This solution is used in conjunction with primary fragmentation distributions to explain the wide differences observed between the transient responses of small and large coal particles. To verify this model, theoretical responses are compared with experimental data obtained from batch tests of coal with known initial particle distributions. Experimental results suggest that particle distributions [...] even narrow distributions [...] significantly affect the transient response of coal combustion in fluidized beds;Besides developing a nonlinear transient combustion model, system identification algorithms are used in this study to develop linear transfer functions that characterize coal combustion dynamics.

The {{bioenergy}} production {{industry can}} benefit from {{a greater understanding of}} potential differences among the various feedstock materials and production influences on thermochemical conversion processes such as combustion. The thermal degradation of biomass during combustion can quickly be assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to provide a thermal profile for global characterization of reaction kinetics and temperatures associated with both the devolatilization and <b>char</b> <b>combustion,</b> as well as total volatile matter lost. In this work, the TGA technique was applied to understand combustion of Coastal bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.)

These eight treatments consisted of commercial N fertilizer or advanced‐treated swine wastewater effluent, each irrigated at two (75 % and 100 % of estimated evapotranspiration) irrigation rates and two lateral SDI spacings (0. 6 and 1. 2 m). While thermogravimetric (weight loss) profiles of the treatments were almost identical and indicated three distinct combustion weight loss steps, some variations among the treatments were noted in the differential thermal analysis profiles.

In this initial application, the model is limited to isothermal combustion with no diffusional limitations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{combustion}} kinetics of Norway spruce woody treated via wet or dry torrefaction were studied and compared. Dry and wet torrefaction of woodwere performed in compatible {{conditions on the}} basis of a common massyield. The combustion experiments were studiedthermogravimetrically, followed by a kinetic evaluation assuming a four-pseudo-component model. The results show that dry-torrefied wood is less reactive in the devolatilization step but more reactive in the <b>char</b> <b>combustion,</b> compared to wet-torrefied one. Dry torrefaction removesmore hemicellulose from Norway spruce wood than wet torrefaction, in compatible conditions. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor of cellulose and lignin in the devolatilization step are increased by both torrefaction methods. However, in the <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> the activation energy and pre-exponential factor areincreased by dry torrefaction, but decreased after wet torrefaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{available}} data on intrinsic kinetic parameters of wood <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> {{is limited in}} the literature. The intrinsic reactivity of porous char particles reflects {{the variance in the}} pore structure resulted from various compositions of parent biomass or coal fuels. In this study detailed kinetic models for calculating the intrinsic reaction rate and the Arrhenius parameters in two combustion zones are developed for the <b>char</b> <b>combustion.</b> The influence of the parent fuel composition and the thermal treatment on the char oxidative reactivity observed on the char surface area and particle density are explored through a mathematical model of the char service area and density. A higher reactivity of the wood pellets than coal and enhanced reactivity with the increasing pyrolysis temperature were observed as well...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{distribution}} coefficient (Xc), {{the fraction of}} the total heat of reaction released at the <b>char</b> surface during <b>combustion</b> of <b>char</b> particles, was studied using the improved moving flame front (MFF) model. The {{energy distribution}} coefficient (Xc), considering homogeneous oxidation of CO in the boundary layer of the particle and reduction of CO 2 at the surface, was derived explicitly. Under conditions in practical pulverized coal flames, the energy distribution coefficient (Xc) and the effective energy distribution coefficient (Xe), based on the heat-release calculated using the traditional single film model with CO as the only reaction product (SF-CO), were calculated and compared with the value commonly used in the SF-CO model. The results obtained show that the smaller the particle diameter, the greater the energy distribution coefficient. For the same particle diameter, the higher the particle temperature, the lower the energy distribution coefficient. Under the conditions of the calculation, the average value of the energy distribution coefficient Xc is approximately 0. 7, and the average value of the effective SF-CO energy distribution coefficient is greater than 0. 5, significantly larger than the value of 0. 3 obtained by the traditional single film model.

40|$|A High Performance Power System (HIPPS) {{is being}} developed. This {{system is a}} coal-fired, {{combined}} cycle plant with indirect heating of gas turbine air. Foster Wheeler Development Corporation and a team consisting of Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation, AlliedSignal Aerospace Equipment Systems, Bechtel Corporation, University of Tennessee Space Institute and Westinghouse Electric Corporation are developing this system. In Phase I of the project, a conceptual design of a commercial plant was developed. Technical and economic analyses indicated that the plant would meet {{the goals of the}} project which include a 47 percent efficiency (HHV) and a 10 percent lower cost of electricity than an equivalent size PC plant. The concept uses a pyrolyzation process to convert coal into fuel gas and char. The char is fired in a High Temperature Advanced Furnace (HITAF). It is a pulverized fuel-fired boiler/airheater where steam and gas turbine air are indirectly heated. The fuel gas generated in the pyrolyzer is then used to heat the gas turbine air further before it enters the gas turbine. The project is currently in Phase 2 which includes engineering analysis, laboratory testing and pilot plant testing. Research and development is being done on the HIPPS systems that are not commercial or being developed on other projects. Pilot plant testing of the pyrolyzer subsystem and the <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> subsystem are being done separately, and then a pilot plant with integrated pyrolyzer and <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> systems will be tested. In this report, progress in the pyrolyzer pilot plant preparation is reported. The results of extensive laboratory and bench scale testing of representative char are also reported. Preliminary results of combustion modeling of the <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> system are included. There are also discussions of the auxiliary systems that are planned for the <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> system pilot plant and the status of the integrated system pilot plant...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} overfeed packed bed <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> {{experiments}} and modelling. Experimental results {{are used to}} verify the assumptions of an existing <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> simulation. The computer model uses finite volume discretization methods to predict temperature and concentration profiles for packed bed <b>char</b> <b>combustion.</b> Also, the behaviour of ash in a packed bed is explored and incorporated into the model by accounting for the effect of ash on such properties as bed void fraction and heat and mass transfer processes. The effects of air flow rate and bed depth on the burning rate, the bed temperature and gas concentrations are also examined. Experiments were performed in a reactor 23 cm in diameter and 20 cm high. Thermocouples measured bed temperatures and a water-cooled probe sampled bed gases. Gas samples were analysed for CO 2, CO and O 2 using a gas chromatograph. The fuel was foundry coke with a particle diameter in the 1 cm size range. Experiments were run for bed heights ranging from 5 to 15 cm and air flow rates of 191 to 520 kg/m 2 hr. Comparison of the experimental bed profiles and burning rates with model predictions shows good agreement, indicating that the model can reliably predict packed bed <b>char</b> <b>combustion.</b> Species concentrations are shown to be only dependent on bed depth; whereas the burning rate {{is a function of}} both the bed depth and air flow rate. The data also show that the ash properties are highly dependent on the operating conditions; since the model predictions are very sensitive to the ash properties, a relationship between ash properties and temperature needs to be developed and included in the model. More research is also needed on the CO 2 reduction reaction parameters and pore diffusion model and the oxidation kinetics in the ash layer...|$|R
30|$|<b>Char</b> <b>combustion</b> {{reaction}} {{region is}} thicker than drying and devolatilization reactions region. Therefore, <b>char</b> <b>combustion</b> reaction is implying a slow reaction. Some char is remaining {{at the bottom}} of the packed bed without combustion even at the end of the grate. This must be due to the cooling effect of high velocity air flow at the end of the grate. Simulation results illustrate that under the given inputs and boundary conditions of the particular packed bed combustor in the tea factory, insufficient or no air penetration to the freeboard region. This prevents volatile combustion in the freeboard region. The disadvantages are loss of energy and release of harmful gases due to incomplete combustion into the atmosphere such as carbon monoxide (see Figs. 12 and  14 g, b of “Appendix 2 ”).|$|R
40|$|This is {{the second}} report on a project whose aim is to explore in a {{fundamental}} manner {{the factors that influence}} the development of porosity in coal chars during the process of activation. It is known that choices of starting coal, activating agent and conditions can strongly influence the nature of an activated carbon produced from a coal. This work has again confirmed that there is a fundamental difference in char structure that is reflective of the source of the chars. What is new in the present results is a strong indication that this difference is seen, irrespective of the conditions of char preparation. Results were compared for utility <b>combustion</b> <b>chars,</b> all of which were prepared under the very high intense heating conditions of utility boilers, and the laboratory-prepared chars prepared at orders of magnitude lower heating rates. The chars were of very similar nature regardless of the heating conditions that led to their preparation (and despite major differences in level of burnoff). On the other hand, the results from the examination of the laboratory char results do again suggest that the activation conditions play some role in determining porosity, though their effect is decidedly less important than the role of the parent material. This is true despite an enormous range of reactivity exhibited by the activating agents...|$|R
