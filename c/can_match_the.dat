25|$|A {{fire alarm}} box is an outdoor device used for notifying a fire {{department}} of a fire. Early boxes used the telegraph system and were the main method of calling the fire department to a neighborhood {{in the days before}} people had telephones. When the box is triggered, a spring-loaded wheel spins and taps out a signal onto the fire alarm telegraph wire, indicating the box number. The receiver at a fire station then <b>can</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> number to the neighborhood. The municipal fire alarm system got its start in Massachusetts. It was invented by Moses G. Farmer, an engineer, and Dr. William Channing, a Harvard-educated Bostonian. Their revolutionary creation was installed in 1851 and consisted of 40 miles of wire and 45 boxes in Boston.|$|E
25|$|Turntables allow DJs to play vinyl records. By {{adjusting}} the playback {{speed of the}} turntable, either by {{adjusting the}} speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs <b>can</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> tempos of different records so their rhythms can be played together {{at the same time}} without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as beatmatching. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a slipmat that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. Direct-drive turntables are the type preferred by DJs, with the Technics SL-1200 being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play hip hop music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for scratching, beat juggling, and other turntablism techniques.|$|E

500|$|The inverted-F antenna is an {{evolution}} of the basic quarter-wave monopole antenna. [...] The wire F-type antenna was invented in the 1940s. [...] In this antenna the feed is connected to an intermediate point {{along the length of}} the antenna instead of to the base. [...] The base is connected to ground. [...] The advantage of doing this is that the input impedance of the antenna is dependent on the distance of the feed point from the grounded end.

He wrote, [...] "Carey has sold {{tens of millions of}} albums by being the girl next door with the startling vocal range... but for most of [...] "Butterfly" [...] Carey turned her voice into an airy whisper, as if she would rather charm listeners" [...] compared to over-powering them. Aside from commenting on its deviance from Carey's previous work, he noted songs in which Carey alludes to her failed marriage to Mottola, such as [...] "Butterfly" [...] and [...] "Close My Eyes" [...] which were both released on the album following the divorce with lyrics about letting love go and life struggles. Additionally he wrote, [...] "Since Carey writes her own lyrics, fans might expect a glimpse of marital discord or pride in her new-found autonomy." [...] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly gave Butterfly a B- in his review. Browne wrote: [...] "In Breakdown, [...] demonstrates she <b>can</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> staccato, lite-reggae phrasing of her guests, two members of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony." [...] He described an increased intimacy in the music but noted the arrangement made it difficult to hear the lyrics Carey was singing.

But it's also the last thing anyone would have expected from her: blandly self-effacing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Inimitability of the Quran (or [...] "I'jaz") is {{the belief}} that no human speech <b>can</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> Quran in its content and form. The Quran is {{considered}} an inimitable miracle by Muslims, effective until the Day of Resurrection—and, thereby, the central proof granted to Muhammad in authentication of his prophetic status. The concept of inimitability originates in the Quran where in five different verses opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: [...] "If men and sprites banded together to produce the like of this Quran they would never produce its like not though they backed one another." [...] So the suggestion is that if there are doubts concerning the divine authorship of the Quran, come forward and create something like it. From the ninth century, numerous works appeared which studied the Quran and examined its style and content. Medieval Muslim scholars including al-Jurjani (d. 1078) and al-Baqillani (d. 1013) have written treatises on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran. Others argue that the Quran contains noble ideas, has inner meanings, maintained its freshness through the ages and has caused great transformations at the individual level and in history. Some scholars state that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science. The doctrine of the miraculousness of the Quran is further emphasized by Muhammad's illiteracy since the unlettered prophet could not have been suspected of composing the Quran.|$|E
2500|$|Astronomy is very {{sensitive}} to light pollution. The night sky viewed from a city bears no resemblance to what {{can be seen from}} dark skies. Skyglow (the scattering of light in the atmosphere) reduces the contrast between stars and galaxies and the sky itself, making it much harder to see fainter objects. This is one factor that has caused newer telescopes to be built in increasingly remote areas. Some astronomers use narrow-band [...] "nebula filters" [...] which only allow specific wavelengths of light commonly seen in nebulae, or broad-band [...] "light pollution filters" [...] which are designed to reduce (but not eliminate) the effects of light pollution by filtering out spectral lines commonly emitted by sodium- and mercury-vapor lamps, thus enhancing contrast and improving the view of dim objects such as galaxies and nebulae. Unfortunately these light pollution reduction (LPR) filters are not a cure for light pollution. LPR filters reduce the brightness of the object under study and this limits the use of higher magnifications. LPR filters work by blocking light of certain wavelengths, which alters the color of the object, often creating a pronounced green cast. Furthermore, LPR filters only work on certain object types (mainly emission nebulae) and are of little use on galaxies and stars. No filter <b>can</b> <b>match</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness of a dark sky for visual or photographic purposes. Due to their low surface brightness, the visibility of diffuse sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies is affected by light pollution more than are stars. Most such objects are rendered invisible in heavily light polluted skies around major cities. A simple method for estimating the darkness of a location is to look for the Milky Way, which from truly dark skies appears bright enough to cast a shadow.|$|E
