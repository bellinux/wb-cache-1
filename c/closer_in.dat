Christie Achebe has described their marriage as one of trust and mutual understanding; some tension arose early in their union, due to conflicts about attention and communication. However, as their relationship matured, husband and wife made efforts to adapt to one another.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} Pachylemur is {{relatively}} broad, but the orbits (eye sockets) are smaller and oriented more {{towards the front}} than in the ruffed lemurs.

Yttrium is the first d-block element in the fifth period.|$|E

5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel <b>closer</b> <b>in</b> length to A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are <b>closer</b> <b>in</b> lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E
5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are <b>closer</b> <b>in</b> perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E

5|$|As objects {{increasingly}} <b>closer</b> <b>in</b> size to Pluto {{were discovered}} in the region, it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified {{as one of the}} Kuiper belt objects, just as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet. Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.|$|E
5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, The New Testament in the Original Greek (1881), and it was the basis for their text. All critical editions of the New Testament published after Westcott and Hort were <b>closer</b> <b>in</b> the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus was the basis for the translation.|$|E
5|$|Oases in {{the largely}} desert region lived {{in by the}} Qedarites - such as Dedan, Tayma, and Dumah - played an {{important}} role as sites of settlement, trade, and watering-places. Dumah, a remote desert city to the west, known later as Dumat Al-Jandal and today as al-Jawf, was the most important of these, sitting as it did between the empires of Babylonia and Assyria. Serving as the base for Qedarite religious ceremonies, Dumah's strategic position on the north-south trade route in the area meant that relations with its inhabitants were sought after by both empires, though Dumah and the Qedarites were <b>closer</b> <b>in</b> both geographical and political terms to Babylonia. Those coming from the south and wishing to access Mesopotamia were obliged to pass through Dumah, which also lay on an alternate route to the northwest, leading to the city of Damascus, and from there, on to Assyria and Anatolia.|$|E
