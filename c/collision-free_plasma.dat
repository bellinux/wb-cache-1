40|$|This paper {{presents}} theoretical {{methods to}} determine the gas dynamic and the electrostatic effects due to the interaction caused by a rapidly moving body in the ionosphere. The principles of the methods are derived from the kinetic theory of <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma.</b> It is shown that the collective behavior of the <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma</b> {{makes it possible to}} use the fluid approach to treat the problems of ionospheric aerodynamics. Various solutions to the system of fluid and field equations that have direct bearing on the ionospheric aerodynamics are presented and discussed. Physical significances of the mathematical results are stressed. Some outstanding unsolved problems in ionospheric aerodynamics are elaborated and discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three parts. In Part I, it is shown that looping trajectories cannot exist in finite amplitude stationary hydromagnetic waves propagating across a magnetic field in a quasi-neutral cold <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma.</b> In Part II, time-dependent solutions in series expansion are presented for the magnetic piston problem, which describes waves propagating into a quasi-neutral cold <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma,</b> ensuing from magnetic disturbances on the boundary of the plasma. The expansion is equivalent to Picard's successive approximations. It is then shown that orbit crossings of plasma particles occur on the boundary for strong disturbances and inside the plasma for weak disturbances. In Part III, the existence of periodic waves propagating at an arbitrary angle to the magnetic field in a plasma is demonstrated by Stokes expansions in amplitude. Then stability analysis is made for such periodic waves with respect to side-band frequency disturbances. It is shown that waves of slow mode are unstable whereas waves of fast mode are stable if the frequency is below the cutoff frequency. The cutoff frequency depends on the propagation angle. For longitudinal propagation the cutoff frequency is equal to one-fourth of the electron's gyrofrequency. For transverse propagation the cutoff frequency is so high that waves of all frequencies are stable. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the speed and}} structure of steady non-linear waves moving with uniform velocity in an oblique direction across a magnetic field in a <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma</b> with temperature. This is a self-consistent formulation in which the plasma motion is governed by the Vlasov equation for ions and electrons coupled to the Poisson-Maxwell equations. This difficult problem can be solved in the Iimiting case of small-amplitude non-linear waves {{if we assume that}} the same scaling laws hold for the warm plasma as those for a cold plasma. This work was done {{under the auspices of the}} U. S. Atomic Energy Commission...|$|E
40|$|Electrostatic {{waves in}} a <b>collision-free</b> unmagnetized <b>plasma</b> of {{electrons}} with fixed ions are investigated for electron equilibrium velocity distribution functions that deviate slightly from Maxwellian. Of interest are undamped waves {{that are the}} small amplitude limit of nonlinear excitations, such as electron acoustic waves (EAWs). A deviation consisting of a small plateau, a region with zero velocity derivative over a width {{that is a very}} small fraction of the electron thermal speed, is shown to give rise to new undamped modes, which here are named corner modes. The presence of the plateau turns off Landau damping and allows oscillations with phase speeds within the plateau. These undamped waves are obtained in a wide region of the (k,ω__R) plane (ω__R being the real part of the wave frequency and k the wavenumber), away from the well-known `thumb curve' for Langmuir waves and EAWs based on the Maxwellian. Results of nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson simulations that corroborate the existence of these modes are described. It is also shown that deviations caused by fattening the tail of the distribution shift roots off of the thumb curve toward lower k-values and chopping the tail shifts them toward higher k-values. In addition, a rule of thumb is obtained for assessing how the existence of a plateau shifts roots off of the thumb curve. Suggestions are made for interpreting experimental observations of electrostatic waves, such as recent ones in nonneutral plasmas. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} field disturbance {{created by the}} impingement of a supermagnetosonic <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma</b> upon a hollow, electrically nonconducting body (lunella) has been studied in the laboratory using a plasma accelerator. Diamagnetic currents on the boundary of the downstream cavity which is formed {{are the source of}} these disturbances which fringe out within the lunella and extend on into the upstream flow to a distance of about the geometric mean Larmor radius. Additional field perturbations and associated currents appear over the upstream hemisphere. The results are in qualitative accord with lunar magnetometer data and bear upon the interaction of the solar wind with small non-magnetic bodies...|$|E
40|$|The gas {{dynamics}} of interactions of a tenuous ionosphere with moving satellites and probes that have bearings on the diagnostics of the ionosphere are discussed. Emphasis {{is on the}} cases where the body is moving at mesothermal speeds, namely intermediate between the thermal speeds of ions and electrons of the ambient ionosphere. Methods of <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma</b> kinetics with self-consistent field are used. The development of the topics for discussion starts with stationary Langmuir probe which entails the basic mechanism of body-plasma interaction that becomes further intricated as the body moves at a higher and higher speed. Applications {{of the theory of}} plasma interaction to meteors which move in the ionosphere are also presented...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that, if a {{longitudinal}} wave is excited in a <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma</b> and Landau-damps away, {{and later a}} second wave is excited and also damps away, then a third wave will spontaneously appear in the plasma. This wave appears long after the first two waves have damped away at a time proportional to the interval between the first two waves, and is in that sense an echo. It is also shown that, if a wave is continuously excited {{at one point in}} a plasma and a second wave is continuously excited many Landau damping lengths from the first point, then a third wave will spontaneously appear many Landau damping lengths from the second point. Fundamentally, plasma wave echoes are possible because of the reversible nature of Landau damping. However, small-angle Coulomb collisions are very effective in destroying the echo...|$|E
40|$|It is {{possible}} to relate the dispersion formula for longitudinal oscillations in an infinite, uniform, <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma</b> with no magnetic field to the complex potential of a line charge distribution on the real axis of the phase velocity (u=ω/k) plane. If the initial velocity distribution integrated over directions orthogonal to the direction of propagation is f 0 (v) the plasma is stable {{if and only if}} U(u) =P∫-∞∞f 0 ′(v) dv/v-u is negative at the minima of f 0 (v) on the real axis, with unimportant exceptions. In particular it is shown that single-peaked distributions are stable, while those with very sharp (e. g., nondifferentiable) minima or with a zero of f 0 between two peaks are not. The charge analogy yields information on the wavelengths for which oscillations can grow and on rates of growth. Examples are given, including the case of two identical interpenetrating hot plasmas. A limited generalization to transverse oscillations is given...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{different}} proposed mechanisms for generating parallel electric fields, magnetic mirroring of charged particles {{seems to be}} the most plausible. In the present paper, it is suggested that magnetic mirroring is the basic cause of parallel electric fields in the magnetosphere and that the magnetic mirroring effect may be able to form the basis of an auroral theory that can remove a major portion of the ambiguity of observations. In the model proposed, the parallel electric field is due to a magnetic confinement of a negatively charged hot <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma.</b> A transfer of electron gyroenergy into wave energy tends to weaken this confinement; if this energy transfer becomes too strong, the parallel potential gradient will break down. Hence, from this model, in contrast to certain other models of parallel electric fields, {{only a small fraction of}} the total auroral particle energy may be expected to be transformed into electromagnetic wave energy during the acceleration process...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of contact discontinuities in a <b>collision-free</b> <b>plasma</b> is examined using {{a model of}} a plasma which consists of two oppositely directed cold ion beams and a background of cold massless electrons such that exact charge neutrality is maintained and that the electric field is zero. The basic equations describing self-consistent equilibria are obtained for the more general situation where a net flow across the layer takes place and where the magnetic field has two nonzero tangential components but where the electric field remains zero. These equations are then specialized to the case of no net plasma flow where one of the tangential components is zero, and four different classes of sheets are obtained, all having thickness the order of the ion inertial length. The first class is for layers separating two identical plasma and magnetic field regions, the second is for an infinite array of parallel layers producing an undulated magnetic field, the third is for layers containing trapped ions in closed orbits which separate two vacuum regions with uniform identical magnetic fields, and the fourth is for layers which reflect a single plasma beam, leaving a vacuum with a reversed and compressed tangential field on the other side...|$|E
