5|$|Although pure oxygen pre-breathing is an {{effective}} method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> expensive {{for the protection of}} civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. Therefore, it is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft, and may also be used for high-altitude parachute jumps.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{lesson from the}} Tunisia Campaign was that neuropsychiatric casualties had {{to be treated as}} soon as possible and not evacuated from the combat zone. This was not done {{in the early stages of}} the Sicilian Campaign, and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North Africa, with the result that treatment became <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> only 15 percent of them were returned to duty. As the campaign wore on, the system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty.|$|E

5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was particularly evident in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{idea for the}} short was a magician who incorporated a rabbit into his act who suffered from stage fright.

To design the theater featured in Presto, the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.|$|E

On the other hand, overall patterns of cusps and ridges are essentially similar among Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica, indicating that the three are closely related.|$|E
5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is <b>complicated,</b> <b>and</b> its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} {{work on the}} Spyro the Dragon series, Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank {{was based on an}} idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early idea was to have a three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the robots was both <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, Clank.|$|E
5|$|As State Secretary Reitz had a <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> hefty job. After the State President he was {{the most}} {{important}} member of the Executive Council (Uitvoerende Raad). As the most senior civil servant he was responsible for the oversight over the implementation of the laws and regulations, as well as for all the correspondence of the President, official government reports, etc. He was also an intermediary between the Executive Council and parliament, the First and Second Volksraad, and a key figure in the foreign affairs of the State. Experienced and well organised as he himself was Reitz managed to quickly modernise the structure of the state apparatus, by implementing regulations for the running of the government departments, appointing an archivist for his own, and by prescribing that all correspondence with the government should be in Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in Weimar, but the composition history is <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> {{not at all}} stages certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt suggest that the cantata began with the later movements 2–6 and 9, most of them on biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, {{the wife of a}} former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in Weimar on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, shows on the title page the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.|$|E

40|$|Tigecycline, a glycylcycline {{related to}} the {{tetracycline}} class of antibiotics, represents a new option {{for the treatment of}} <b>complicated</b> intra-abdominal <b>and</b> <b>complicated</b> skin <b>and</b> skin structure infections. It displays favorable activity in vitro against the most common causative Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens. In addition, tigecycline demonstrates activity against drug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and organisms (such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Tigecycline lacks activity in vitro against Pseudomonas and Proteus spp. In randomized clinical trials, tigecycline administered intravenously twice daily has demonstrated efficacy similar to comparators for a variety of <b>complicated</b> skin <b>and</b> skin structure <b>and</b> <b>complicated</b> intra-abdominal infections. The potential for significant drug interactions with tigecycline appears to be minimal. Dosing adjustment is needed for patients with severe hepatic impairment. The predominant side effect associated with its use to date has been gastrointestinal intolerance (nausea and vomiting) ...|$|R

5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a {{multi-media}} project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was too <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse.|$|E
5|$|Evans used a woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as to maximize profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process was <b>complicated</b> <b>and</b> required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed a meticulous eye for detail and used a hand-press {{and as many as}} a dozen colour blocks for a single image.
