50|$|The Stolen Chimney is a {{traditional}} rock climbing route located on the Ancient Arts tower one of the Fisher Towers. This {{is the most common}} route to ascend the <b>cork</b> <b>screw</b> summit of the tower. The <b>cork</b> <b>screw</b> summit is the western most summit of the Ancient Arts tower {{but it is not the}} tallest. The summit is noteworthy for its extremely unusually shape which makes climbing the technically different from most other climbs. The unusual shape also makes it visually striking.

40|$|Background: The {{need for}} {{operative}} fixation of pediatric femoral fractures is increasingly being {{recognised in the}} present decade. The conventional traction and casting method for management of pediatric femoral fractures is giving way for the operative stabilisation of the fracture. Methods : Thirty five pediatric patients in age group 6 - 14 years with diaphyseal femoral fractures were stabilised with two titanium nails. Patients were followed up clinically and radiologically for two years. The final results were evaluated using the criteria of Flynn et al. Technical problems and complications associated with the procedure were also analysed. Results : Overall results observed were excellent in 25, satisfactory in 8 and poor in 2 patients. Hospital time averaged 12. 30 days in the series. All the fractures healed with an average time to union of 9. 6 (6 - 14. 4) weeks. Return to school was early {{with an average of}} 7. 8 weeks. The soft tissue discomfort near the knee produced by the nails ends was the most common problem encountered. Shortening was observed in three cases and restriction of knee flexion in 5 patients. There was no delayed union, infection or refractures. Per operative technical problems included failure of closed reduction in 2 cases and <b>cork</b> <b>screwing</b> of nails in one case. Conclusion : We believe that with proper operative technique and aftercare TENs may prove to be an ideal implant for pediatric femoral fracture fixation. The most of the complication associated with the procedure are infact features of inexact technique and can be eliminated by strictly adhering to the basic principles and technical aspects...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Natural corks {{have long}} been used as wine closures. However, they are {{associated}} with causing multiple adverse effects to the wine they are attempting to preserve. Alternative closures such as synthetic <b>corks</b> and <b>screw</b> caps were developed {{in order to reduce}} and/or eliminate these problems. However, the major cause of concern regarding these closures is of consumers' acceptance. The effect of how three types of closures (Natural Cork, Synthetic <b>Cork</b> and <b>Screw</b> Cap) affected wine consumers' perceptions of the quality of wine was examined in this study. This project was divided into two experiments. The first experiment determined if frequent wine consumers could detect sensorial differences between the three closure types. The second experiment ascertained if and how regular wine consumers' perceptions were altered based on the type of closure with which the wine samples were bottled. It was determined that the wine consumers could not significantly detect a difference between any of the three closure type samples based only on sensory stimuli. The results from the second experiment found for the Chardonnay samples, the knowledge that the wine samples came from a natural cork or a synthetic cork did not significantly affect the liking, quality or purchase intent scores. However, when the panelists knew that the sample was bottled with a screw cap, they thought it was of lower quality, were less willing to buy a wine like the sample and they lowered the price they were willing to pay. For the Merlot samples, knowledge that the sample came from a natural cork caused the wine consumers to significantly increase both their opinions {{of the quality of the}} wine and the amount they were willing to pay for the wine.

5000|$|Screw caps or [...] "Stelvin caps" [...] are {{closures}} {{made only}} from aluminium material that threads onto the bottleneck. They are the predominant closure used by Austrian, Australian and New Zealand wineries.

These benefits aid in maintaining the wine's overall quality and aging potential. Michel Laroche of Domaine Laroche noted that this played a role in his decision to adopt screwcaps.

50|$|Compared to <b>cork,</b> <b>screw</b> caps {{reduce the}} wine faults of {{oxidation}} and of cork taint, {{although it is}} possible to find TCA contamination in a screw cap bottle. Screw caps are generally perceived as easier to open. Screw caps have a much lower failure rate than cork, and in theory will allow a wine to reach the customer in perfect condition, with a minimum of bottle variation. However, cork has a centuries-old tradition behind it, and there are also concerns about the impact of screw caps on the aging of those few wines that require decades to be at their best. Some argue that the slow ingress of oxygen plays a vital role in aging a wine, while others argue that this amount is almost zero in a sound cork and that any admitted oxygen is harmful.|$|E

40|$|Musculoskeletal tissues {{adapt to}} changes in {{repetitive}} loading and training. When the adaptive response fail to meet the increased demands imposed by a training or rehabilitative program, the exceeding loadings can damage the tissues, causing inflammation and repair. Aggressive rehabilitation programs early carried out after a tissue reconstruction put stress on the healing tissue. Repetitive exercise can increase the strength, size, matrix organization and possibly collagen content of tendons and ligament and their insertion into bone. The fine balance between reparative stimulus and damage requires {{the knowledge of the}} basis of healing process with biological properties of the tissues and biomechanical characteristics of the reconstructed structures. The effects of increased loading on different tissues during rehabilitation stages {{and the role of the}} primary fixation strength in surgical procedures were extensively studied (1 - 3). ACL Reconstruction Central-third bone-patellar tendon-bone and hamstring tendon autografts have been commonly used as substitutes for the ACL and they are fixed to the femur and the tibia using various kinds of fixation. Since 1990 postoperative rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction has been accelerated, so strength and stiffness of the femur-graft-tibia complex are required for such rehabilitation, especially during the immediate postoperative period. In 1995 Beynnon noted that the stress on the intact ACL range between 25 N and 500 N during squatting, leg extension and running; so 500 N is considered the strength that a device should ensure for the initial biomechanical fixation. Our efforts were pointed on evaluation, using cyclic loading with final pull-out tests, of different coupled fixation devices (femoral and tibial together) commonly used for ACL reconstruction using doubled semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (DGST). For this study 5 different fixation methods were selected. We tested the complex with a cyclic loading of 1000 cycles between 10 and 150 N. This study shows that are now available some different fixation devices for femoral and tibial fixation of DGST for ACL reconstruction, differing for material, kind of fixation, surgical technique. Some among these devices shows good biomechanical properties, so they should be safely used for ACL reconstruction with an adequate post-op rehabilitation, but the best combination should also be in example of 2 different devices produced by different industries. So the surgeon could choice the best combination for each patients and the best technique in his own hands. Shoulder Rotator Cuff tears are a common cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction. The successful surgical reattachment of torn tendons to the humerus is the aim of reparable tears treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated the anchor suture repair technique to be significantly stronger than the bone tunnels technique. The initial ultimate tensile strength of the anchors was widely tested but resistance to cyclic loading provides a better simulation of the in vivo condition of fatigue of the “anchor-suture-tendon” complex. Three different bone anchors were tested: two absorbable anchors of 5. 0 and 6. 5 mm respectively (Bio-corkscrew, Arthrex-Naples-Florida) and a metallic anchor of 5. 0 mm (<b>Cork</b> <b>screw,</b> Arthrex-Naples-Florida). Coupled with the anchors we tested two kind of suture: Ethibond (Ethicon Johnson&Johnson) and FiberWire (Arthrex-Naples-Florida). To simulate the postoperative conditions, a cyclic loading was performed, similar to previous studies. The tensile load was then increased until the failure of the anchor fixation system. The ultimate failure load, the stiffness and the site and the mode of failure were registered. Results of our study suggests: 1) The polyblend suture increases significantly the strength of fixation devices under cyclic load. 2) Bioabsorbable anchors coupled with FiberWire show ultimate failure load values similar to those of metallic anchor-FiberWire combination, with important differences in the failure mode, which seems suggest a safer use of absorbable devices in clinical applications, in order to avoid metallic anchor migration. 3) Future construction of stronger loop of absorbable anchors might increase the ultimate failure load of the Fiberwire-anchor complex. 4) There are not important differences in biomechanical evaluation between bioabsorbable anchors of the 2 different size tested in this study...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} is concerned primarily with air-water flow in a horizontal 0. 032 m ID tube, {{and the influence}} of a 90 ° horizontal bend on the flow characteristics. Visualisation studies using high speed still photography and cine film, and entrainment and drop size measurements were conducted before and after the bend. Entrained mass fluxes were determined from film flow measurements carried out using the film removal technique, while the drop size distributions were measured with a laser diffraction technique. During these measurements the pressure in the test section was held between 1. 0 - 1. 4 bar, and at ambient temperature. Prior to the horizontal flow study, drop size and film flow rates were measured for vertical air-water flow in a 0. 01026 m ID tube. This extended the work of Jepson (1992) who reported the effect of gas density and surface tension on film flow rate, drop size and deposition mass transfer coefficient. Modifications to the equipment described by Jepson (1992) allowed an extension of the measurements to higher flow conditions. The visualisation study was taken across flow conditions that include stratified, annular and pseudo-slug flow regimes. Still photographs show the presence of air bubbles entrained in the liquid film, and the creation of liquid drops at the crest of roll waves. Drops were seen to be entrained from the liquid film by both bag break-up and ligament break-up mechanisms. At the bend, the phenomenon of film inversion was seen to occur. Also, a secondary flow existing in the gas phase at the bend can be responsible for a swirl movement observed in the liquid film, in which at {{the upper part of the}} tube the liquid was pulled from the outer wall of the bend to the top of the tube in an anti-clockwise, <b>cork</b> <b>screwing</b> fashion. In the lower half, the liquid film was drawn from the outer wall towards the bottom of the tube in a clockwise motion. From the cine films, information on drop velocity was also extracted. This showed the axial drop velocity to be constant over the time frame of analysis. No significant correlation was found between the drop size and the axial drop velocity. The entrainment results in the horizontal tube showed that for stratified/annular conditions the entrained liquid mass flux increases with liquid flow rate (for a fixed gas flow rate), and in some instances plateau conditions were reached. However, for the pseudo-slug regime the level of entrainment falls considerably. For the whole range of flow conditions studied, the entrained liquid mass flux increases with superficial gas velocity, except for GL = 10 kg/m 2 s where the amount of entrainment is constant. The reduction in entrained liquid mass flux after the bend above certain flow conditions, is caused by drops depositing on the outside wall of the bend. For the flow conditions under study, the Sauter mean diameter varies between 60 - 110 um. Gas velocity has a strong influence on drop size, ie, the higher the gas velocity the smaller the drop size. The effect of liquid flow rate is somewhat more complex. At the lower liquid flow rates, drop size seems to be controlled by the entrainment mechanisms, while at the higher liquid flows drop coalescence has a dominant effect. The influence of the 90 ° bend on the drop size distribution was to increase the diameter of the drops. Both the entrained liquid mass flux and drop size were found to be lower for horizontal annular flow than in vertical flow, for the same flow conditions and tube diameter. The measurements carried out for air-water flow in the vertical 0. 01026 m ID tube, showed the entrained mass flux to increase with both gas and liquid flow rates. For the flow conditions analysed, the Sauter mean diameter varies between 26 - 45 um. Drop size was seen to be influenced by gas and liquid flow rates, following similar trends to those observed during the horizontal study. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to discuss the implications of product loss rates in terms of the environmental performance of bottled wine. Wine loss refers to loss occurring when the consumer does not consume the wine contained in the bottle and disposes of it because of taste alteration, which is caused by inadequate product protection rendering the wine unpalatable to a knowledgeable consumer. The decision of whether or not to drink the wine in such cases is guided by subjective consumer taste perception and wine quality expectation (drinking the bottle or disposing of the wine down the drain and replacing it with a new bottle). This study aims to illustrate the importance of accurately defining system boundaries related to wine packaging systems. Methods: The environmental impacts resulting from wine loss rates as related to two types of wine bottle closures—natural <b>cork</b> stoppers and <b>screw</b> caps—have been estimated based on literature review data and compared to the impact of the respective closure system. The system studied relates to the functional unit “a 750 mL bottle of drinkable wine” and includes bottled wine, bottle and closure production, wine production, wine loss and wine poured down the drain. Results: The range of wine alteration rates due to corked wine is estimated to be 2 – 5 % based on interviews with wine experts. Consumer behavior was assessed through a sensitivity study on replacement rates. When the increase in loss rate with the cork stopper is higher than 1. 2 % (corresponding to 3. 5 % corked wine multiplied by a consumer replacement rate of 35 %), the influence of losses on the impact results is higher than that of the closure material itself. The different closures and associated wine losses represent less than 5 % of the total life cycle impact of bottled wine...|$|R
40|$|Distribution can {{be defined}} as a way of goods from {{producer}} to consumer. In wine production industry there exist several distribution channels, through which wine is distributed to the final consumer. Aim {{of this paper is to}} identify and compare advantages and disadvantages of particular distribution channels for wine sales related to a small wine-producer. Distribution of wine to the final consumer is done through dealers represented by retail chains, specialized wine-shops, hotels, and restaurants. In a smaller scale it is done through internet sales, own outlets and wine auctions. According to the research of Focus agency, Marketing & Social Research, done in 2009, customers buy wine mostly in retail chains and decide on sort and quality of wine directly at the moment of purchase. Selection is based except wine quality also on the shape of the bottle, etiquette, and also cork (consumers explicitly prefer <b>cork,</b> and the <b>screw</b> top rather discourages). Certain part of customers – specifically those, who are more acquainted with wine – buy wine in special wine-shops. The research shows a decrease of direct wine-sales. When using services of independent trade organizations, producers have to control the intensity of commercial activities and knowledge of technical characteristics of products. Small wine producers, though, do not have to use this distribution channel, and can focus only on direct sales. For some small wine producers, specifically those operating in the areas with an extended possibility for wine-tourism, this channel can be more suitable and effective than using retail chains. This way of distribution does not require extensive start-up investments, it is directly dependent on producers own effort, and can be done as a supplementary activity to the main source of income. Regardless the particular choice of a distribution channel by a small wine producer it is necessary to be judged not only from the viewpoint of its advantages and disadvantages, but also by a detailed analy­sis of costs of sales...|$|R
