40|$|Background: Palliative {{care for}} nursing home {{residents}} with advanced dementia is often sub-optimal due to poor communication and limited care planning. In a cluster randomized controlled trial, registered nurses (RNs) from 10 nursing homes were trained and funded to work as Palliative Care Planning Coordinators (PCPCs) to organize family <b>case</b> <b>conferences</b> and mentor staff. This qualitative sub-study aimed to explore PCPC and health professional perceptions {{of the benefits of}} facilitated <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> and identify factors influencing implementation. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the RNs in the PCPC role, other members of nursing home staff, and physicians who participated in <b>case</b> <b>conferences.</b> Analysis was conducted by two researchers using a thematic framework approach. Results: Interviews were conducted with 11 PCPCs, 18 other nurses, eight allied health workers, and three physicians. Perceived benefits of facilitated <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> included better communication between staff and families, greater multi-disciplinary involvement in <b>case</b> <b>conferences</b> and care planning, and improved staff attitudes and capabilities for dementia palliative care. Key factors influencing implementation included: staffing levels and time; support from management, staff and physicians; and positive family feedback. Conclusion: The facilitated approach explored in this study addressed known barriers to <b>case</b> <b>conferencing.</b> However, current business models in the sector make it difficult for <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> to receive the required levels of nursing qualification, training, and time. A collaborative nursing home culture and ongoing relationships with health professionals are also prerequisites for success. Further studies should document resident and family perceptions to harness consumer advocacy...|$|R

Design An integrative review of English language citations from CINHAL, MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO and CareSearch using a palliative care filter was undertaken. Two reviewers screened 238 titles to find 77 relevant articles which were reviewed in detail to identify nine studies that addressed the specific review questions. The analysis process allowed study characteristics, process and outcome measures along with implementation barriers and facilitators to be identified and the results synthesised. Results The highest level of evidence (Level II) was generated by two randomised controlled <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> trials which demonstrated enhance medication management for people with dementia living in a nursing home. Several pre-post test studies suggest that <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> enhances palliative symptom management and care outcomes in nursing homes. Qualitative evidence suggests that <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> is feasible and worthwhile if the identified barriers are addressed and the facilitators optimised. Conclusions <b>Case</b> <b>conferencing</b> provides opportunities to improve care palliative care outcomes for older people with dementia by engaging family and all relevant internal and external health providers in prospective care planning.

5000|$|In 1973, Paul Meehl {{published}} Why I Do Not Attend Case Conferences. [...] He {{stated that}} his {{main reason for}} not attending case conferences in a psychological or psychiatric clinic is that he feels that they are intellectually unstimulating and boring, sometimes {{to the point of}} being offensive. Meehl directly identified problems and fallacies that he noticed in the psychology or psychiatry <b>case</b> <b>conference</b> setting. In contrast, he stated he found case conferences for internal medicine or neurology illuminating, in part because they often contain a pathologist's report containing the true disease and/or pathophysiology. In other words, the medical <b>case</b> <b>conference</b> often benefits from having a gold standard to which the clinical symptoms and signs could be compared and contrasted. Meehl argues that creating a psychiatric analogue to the pathologist's report is a promising area of research, and he proposes a format for case conferences that includes data provided for discussion, and a subset of data revealed at the end to show whether conference attendees' clinical inferences about the patient's diagnosis were in fact correct. Why I Do Not Attend Case Conferences also addresses the issue of clinical versus statistical judgment, and the fact that clinical decision making, in case conferences and other environments, is often not very accurate. More generally, Meehl's paper encourages clinicians to be humble when it comes to skills used in decision making, and pushes for a higher scientific standard for clinical case conferences.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{understanding}} about and perceptions of, multidisciplinary <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> in residential aged care {{from the perspective}} of residential facility staff, residents, carers and general practitioners. Methods: Focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted with nurses, residents, carers, allied health workers and general practitioners from two residential aged care facilities during February-March 2008. Conversations were analysed using thematic analysis techniques. Results: Thematic analyses highlighted four key themes. Most notably, respondents identified a degree of confusion regarding the purpose of <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> and its role in resident health care. The ad hoc development of the conferencing model led to unclear role descriptions for participants that contributed to role confusion and the lack of a collaborative culture. Underpinning much of the discussion was the need for a framework to support the organisation of the conference process. Conclusions: While the process of multidisciplinary <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> in residential aged care has significant potential to improve resident care and health outcomes, the development of an explicit framework is required to support the effective conduct of these meetings. Key stakeholders need to be engaged to develop a team approach to conducting <b>case</b> <b>conferences</b> that facilitates the active participation of providers, residents and their carers...|$|R

40|$|Background Care {{for people}} with {{advanced}} dementia requires a palliative approach targeted to the illness trajectory and tailored to individual needs. However, care in nursing homes is often compromised by poor communication and limited staff expertise. This paper reports the protocol for the IDEAL Project, which aims to: 1) compare the efficacy of a facilitated approach to family <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> with usual care; 2) provide insights into nursing home- and staff-related processes influencing the implementation and sustainability of <b>case</b> <b>conferencing,</b> and; 3) evaluate cost-effectiveness. Design/Method A pragmatic parallel cluster randomised controlled trial design will be used. Twenty Australian nursing homes will be randomised to receive either facilitated family <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> or usual care. In the intervention arm, we will train registered nurses at each nursing home to work as Palliative Care Planning Coordinators (PCPCs) 16 h per week over 18 months. The PCPCs’ role will be to: 1) use evidence-based ‘triggers’ to identify optimal time-points for case conferencing; 2) organise, facilitate and document <b>case</b> <b>conferences</b> with optimal involvement from family, multi-disciplinary nursing home staff and community health professionals; 3) develop and oversee implementation of palliative care plans, and; 4) train other staff in person-centred palliative care. The primary endpoint will be symptom management, comfort and satisfaction with care {{at the end of}} life as rated by bereaved family members on the End of Life in Dementia (EOLD) Scales. Secondary outcomes will include resident quality of life (Quality of Life in Late-stage Dementia [QUALID]), whether a palliative approach is taken (e. g. hospitalisations, non-palliative medical treatments), staff attitudes and knowledge (Palliative Care for Advanced Dementia [qPAD]), and cost effectiveness. Processes and factors influencing implementation, outcomes and sustainability will be explored statistically via analysis of intervention ‘dose’ and qualitatively via semi-structured interviews. The pragmatic design and complex nature of the intervention will limit blinding and internal validity but support external validity. Discussion The IDEAL Project will make an important contribution to the evidence base for dementia-specific <b>case</b> <b>conferencing</b> in nursing homes by considering processes and contextual factors as well as overall efficacy. Its strengths and weaknesses will both lie in its pragmatic design...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : On 1 November 2000, {{a series}} of new item numbers {{was added to the}} Medicare Benefits Schedule, which allowed for <b>case</b> <b>conferences</b> between {{physicians}} (including psychiatrists) and other multidisciplinary providers. On 1 November 2002, an additional set of numbers was added, designed especially for use by psychiatrists. This paper reports the findings of an evaluation of these item numbers. RESULTS : The uptake of the item numbers in the three years post their introduction was low to moderate at best. Eighty nine psychiatrists rendered 479 <b>case</b> <b>conferences</b> at a cost to the Health Insurance Commission of $ 70, 584. Psychiatrists who have used the item numbers are generally positive about them, as are consumers. Psychiatrists who have not used them have generally not done so {{because of a lack of}} knowledge, rather than direct opposition. The use of the item numbers is increasing over time, perhaps as psychiatrists become more aware of their existence and of their utility in maximising quality of care.
