5|$|From October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni {{organised}} {{a series}} of measures to demonstrate the Arabs' exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs. He ordered new construction next to and above the Western Wall. The British granted the Arabs permission to convert a building adjoining the Wall into a mosque and to add a minaret. A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall. The Jews protested and tensions increased.|$|E

Noer (Days for Amanda), which earned a Citra Award nomination at the 2010 Indonesian Film Festival. He made his feature film directorial debut that year with Jakarta Maghrib (Jakarta at Maghrib), which details several {{families in the}} minutes before Maghrib prayers and how the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> stops their daily activities. It premiered at the Jakarta International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} {{wells and}} washing facilities, {{which would have}} been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca.|$|E
5000|$|... “An {{interesting}} illustration” {{of some of}} {{the principles}} discussed above is provided by Garden Cities Inc Association v Northpine Islamic Society. The High Court granted an interdict enforcing a contractual undertaking not to use loud-speaking equipment <b>to</b> broadcast <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> from a suburban mosque. An undertaking not to use any amplification equipment had been given by the respondent in 1986, in the deed of the sale of the land on which the mosque was built. Despite the contract, the respondent started broadcasting amplified <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> through a loudspeaker, and the applicants applied for an interdict to stop it.|$|R
50|$|Secondly the OIR {{was opposed}} to the {{continuation}} of state policies that restricted the ability of Shiites to freely practice their religion. Such policies included bans on Ashura processions and of Shi'ite <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b>|$|R
50|$|A small, {{very old}} {{well on the}} south side, donates holy water. In the {{south-west}} {{you can find the}} semantron and the bell-tower of the monastery. By hitting the semantron with a hammer, the monks are <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b>|$|R
25|$|In January 2004, {{members of}} the Al-Islah Islamic Center {{requested}} permission to use loudspeakers {{for the purpose of}} broadcasting the Islamic <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b> This request set off a contentious debate in the city, about the noise that would be caused by the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> eventually garnering national attention. Ultimately, Hamtramck amended its noise ordinance in July 2004 regulating all religious sounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of over 40,000 is roughly 95% Uzbek, 3% Kazakh, and 1% Russian, {{with the remainder}} being Uzbek-speaking Azeris, Chechens, Tajiks, and Iranians. Sayram {{is a city of}} observant Muslims, and the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> can be heard from the city's mosques.|$|E
25|$|In Yunnan province, {{during the}} Qing Dynasty, tablets that wished the Emperor {{a long life}} were placed at mosque entrances. No minarets were {{available}} and no chanting accompanied the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b> The mosques were similar to Buddhist Temples, and incense was burned inside.|$|E
50|$|At 5 am. {{before the}} puja starts, large drums in the drum house (Nagarkhana) {{of the temple}} are played loudly. The drums is a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayers</b> (puja) for the devotees. The drums are played (Chaughada) three times during the day.|$|R
50|$|The Jamia Mosque and Islamic Society of Darlington {{is a local}} {{community}} mosque located in the North Lodge Terrace area {{of the town of}} Darlington in County Durham, England. The mosque offers worship facilities, as well as Islamic Education, and has its own telecommunications mast for <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b>|$|R
60|$|A change {{came over}} the dream. Still the same fair city, but other men--men with greed and evil on their faces--who hated the bonds of righteous doing, and set their hearts on sin. The evening came; the glorious Figure mounted the throne and <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> but none bowed {{themselves}} in adoration.|$|R
25|$|Córdoba {{directed}} the first battle in history won by gunpowder small arms (the Battle of Cerignola). At {{the end of}} the battle, he issued a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> (toque de oracion, adopted later for all Western armies); when Córdoba saw the fields full of French bodies, he ordered the playing of three long tones and prayers for the fallen.|$|E
25|$|Barechu, {{the formal}} public <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> {{introduces}} {{a series of}} expanded blessings embracing the recitation of the Shema. This {{is followed by the}} core of the prayer service, the Amidah or Shemoneh Esreh, a series of 19 blessings. The next part of the service, is Tachanun, supplications, which is omitted on days with a festive character (and by Reform services usually entirely).|$|E
25|$|The Angelus is {{a prayer}} commemorating the Incarnation. It {{originated}} with the 11th-century monastic custom of reciting three Hail Marys during the evening, or Compline bell. It was traditionally recited in Roman Catholic churches, convents, and monasteries three times daily: 6:00 am, noon, and 6:00 pm {{and is usually}} accompanied by the ringing of the Angelus bell, which is a <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{synopsis}} of scenes by the composer mentions a caravan arriving, beggars, a princess carried by servants, jugglers, snake-charmers, and a caliph. After the princess and the caliph have left, a muezzin <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> from a minaret. The caravan continues its journey, {{and the market}} becomes silent. The duration is around six minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{professional}} muezzin {{is chosen}} for his good character, voice {{and skills to}} serve at the mosque. However, the muezzin is not considered a cleric, but in a position comparable to a Christian verger. When <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> the muezzin faces the qiblah, {{the direction of the}} Ka'bah in Makkah, while reciting the adhan.|$|R

25|$|Muslims {{practice}} {{a series of}} life-cycle rituals that {{differ from those of}} Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. Several rituals mark the first days of life—including the whispering <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> first bath, and shaving of the head. Religious instruction begins early. Male circumcision usually takes place after birth; in some families, it may be delayed until after the onset of puberty.|$|E
25|$|In October 1928, the Grand Mufti {{organised}} {{new construction}} next to {{and above the}} Wall. Mules were driven through the praying area often dropping excrement, and waste water was thrown on Jews. A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> directly next to the Wall, creating noise exactly when the Jews were conducting their prayers. The Jews protested at these provocations and tensions increased.|$|E
25|$|Muslims offer five daily prayers at {{specific}} {{times of the}} day, indicated by adhan (<b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer)</b> from the local mosques. Before offering prayers, they must ritually clean themselves by performing wudu, which involves washing {{parts of the body}} that are generally exposed to dirt or dust. A recent study by the Sachar Committee found that 3–4% of Muslim children study in madrasas (Islamic schools).|$|E

40|$|The Qutb Minar, is {{the highest}} {{monument}} of India {{and one of the}} tallest stone masonry towers in the world. Inside, a helical staircase with 379 steps communicates to five balconies, where the Mu‘adhdhin (muezzin) <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer.</b> The minaret has also a symbolic function, being a sign to glorify the victory of Islam against idolatry. The construction began during the reign of Qutb...|$|R
25|$|Certain sunnah prayers have {{prescribed}} waqts {{associated with}} them. Those ordained for before {{each of the}} fard prayers must be performed between the first <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> (adhan) and the second call (iqama), which signifies {{the start of the}} fard prayer. Those sunnah ordained for after the fard prayers can be performed any time between the end of the fard prayers {{and the end of the}} current prayer's waqt. Any amount of extra rakats may be offered, but most madha'ib prescribe a certain number of rakats for each sunnah salah.|$|E
25|$|On March 18, 2005, Amina Wadud gave {{a sermon}} and led Friday prayers for a Muslim {{congregation}} consisting of {{men as well}} as women, with no curtain dividing the men and women. Another woman, Suheyla El-Attar, sounded the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> while not wearing a headscarf at that same event. This {{was done in the}} Synod House of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York after mosques refused to host the event. This was the first known time that a woman had led a mixed-gender Muslim congregation in prayer in American history.|$|E
25|$|The Sunni Islam of the Shafi'i {{school of}} thought is the official, legal form in Malaysia, {{although}} syncretist Islam with elements of Shamanism is still common in rural areas. Mosques are an ordinary scene {{throughout the country and}} adhan (<b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer)</b> from minarets are heard five times a day. Government bodies and banking institutions are closed for two hours every Friday so Muslim workers can conduct Friday prayer in mosques. However, in certain states such as Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah and Johor, the weekends fall on Friday and Saturday instead of Saturday and Sunday. It has been introduced to several states, notably Kelantan and Terengganu, all businesses closes for 2 hours on every Friday for prayers. Failure to comply would result in fines.|$|E
50|$|The {{influence}} of Islamic, Persian and Arabian culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine, and lifestyle are very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> from the minarets of mosques, which are {{scattered around the}} country. The weekend begins on Friday due to Friday being the holiest day for Muslims. Most Muslim countries have a Friday-Saturday or Thursday-Friday weekend.|$|R
50|$|Daily life is {{dominated}} by Islamic observance. Five times each day, Muslims are <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> from the minarets of mosques scattered throughout the country. Because Friday is the holiest day for Muslims, the weekend is Friday-Saturday. In accordance with Salafi doctrine, only two religious holidays, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, were publicly recognized, until 2006 when a non-religious holiday, the 23 September national holiday (which commemorates the unification of the kingdom) was reintroduced.|$|R
50|$|The UAE culture mainly {{revolves}} around the religion of Islam and traditional Arab culture. The influence of Islamic and Arab culture on its architecture, music, attire, cuisine and lifestyle are very prominent as well. Five times every day, Muslims are <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> from the minarets of mosques which are scattered around the country. Since 2006, the weekend has been Friday-Saturday, as a compromise between Friday's holiness to Muslims and the Western weekend of Saturday-Sunday.|$|R
25|$|This service {{begins with}} the Barechu, the formal public <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> and Shema Yisrael embraced by two benedictions before and two after. Ashkenazim outside of Israel (except Chabad-Lubavitch and {{followers}} of the Vilna Gaon) then add another blessing (Baruch Adonai le-Olam), which is made from a tapestry of biblical verses. (This prayer is also said by Baladi Temanim {{in and out of}} Israel.) This is followed by the Half-Kaddish, and the Shemoneh Esreh (Amidah), bracketed with the full Kaddish. Sephardim then say Psalm 121, say the Mourner's Kaddish, and repeat Barechu before concluding with the Aleinu. Ashkenazim, in the diaspora, do neither say Psalm 121 nor repeat Barechu, but conclude with Aleinu followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (in Israel, Ashkenazim do repeat Barcheu after mourner's Kaddish).|$|E
25|$|Before {{the five}} {{required}} daily prayers, a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims {{are not the}} majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer</b> (adhan), although {{it is supposed to}} be said loudly to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the adhan as it is a recommended practice or sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The iqama, which is similar to the adhan and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.|$|E
25|$|In 1058, Baghdad was {{captured}} by the Fatimids under the Turkish general Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri, an adherent of the Ismailis along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh. Not long {{before the arrival of}} the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph al-Mustansir to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid da'i, al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi, had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking Mawṣil, Wāsit and Kufa. Soon after, by December 1058, a Shi'i adhān (<b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer)</b> was implemented in Baghdad and a khutbah (sermon) was delivered {{in the name of the}} Fatimid Imam-Caliph. Despite his Shi'i inclinations, Al-Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi'is alike, for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a common factor.|$|E
60|$|Here {{a certain}} number were always on duty, and men living there practiced the stern {{severity}} of conventual discipline. Thrice during the day, and once at night, they were <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayers.</b> They mortified the flesh by fasting and cruel penance, drawing blood from their bodies by flagellation or by piercing themselves with the thorns of the aloe. When their turn of duty was over, they resided with their wives and families outside the temples.|$|R
60|$|The horses had {{now been}} killed for food. The sufferings of the besieged {{inhabitants}} became greater daily, and numbers died from sheer starvation. The little inhabitants of John Whitefoot's castle were mere skeletons. Most {{of their parents}} were dead, and a mournful silence pervaded the town, save when the bells of the chapels <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>prayer,</b> or the yells of the mob announced that the lower orders were breaking into houses in search of food.|$|R
