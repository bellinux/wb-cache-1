40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAV) are evolving as {{an alternative}} tool to acquire land tenure data. UAVs can capture geospatial data at high quality and resolution in a cost-effective, transparent and flexible manner, from which visible land parcel <b>boundaries,</b> i. e., <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> are delineable. This delineation is to no extent automated, even though physical objects automatically retrievable through image analysis methods mark {{a large portion of}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries.</b> This study proposes (i) a workflow that automatically extracts candidate <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> from UAV orthoimages and (ii) a tool for their semi-automatic processing to delineate final <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The workflow consists of two state-of-the-art computer vision methods, namely gPb contour detection and SLIC superpixels that are transferred to remote sensing in this study. The tool combines the two methods, allows a semi-automatic final delineation and is implemented as a publicly available QGIS plugin. The approach does not yet aim to provide a comparable alternative to manual cadastral mapping procedures. However, the methodological development of the tool towards this goal is developed in this paper. A study with 13 volunteers investigates the design and implementation of the approach and gathers initial qualitative as well as quantitate results.

40|$|In 1995, {{the concept}} of a dynamic cadastre, based on a dynamic {{geodetic}} datum, was proposed for New Zealand to recognize that all <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> in New Zealand are in some form of motion - relative to each other and relative to the geodetic datum which is also in motion. Subsequently New Zealand implemented a semi-dynamic geodetic datum which is accompanied by a deformation model. Later, a survey conversion project resulted in the boundaries of 70 % of the land parcels in New Zealand being coordinated to survey accuracy in terms of the semi-dynamic datum. These boundaries continue to be adjusted by least squares as new cadastral survey observations and geodetic control stations are integrated into the network. However the deformation model has not, in practice, been routinely applied to <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries.</b> In 2010 and 2011, the Canterbury region in the South Island of New Zealand was subjected to a sequence of earthquakes that caused widespread damage and resulted in some boundaries being ruptured by up to 4 metres.

40|$|A {{multi-purpose}} cadastre is {{the goal}} of most countries today. Cadastral information is also a key layer in most multi-purpose geographic information systems (GIS), and these systems, in turn, are included within the broader Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). The utility of spatial data is greatly improved if it is accurate and consistent between layers, especially given the advent of inexpensive GPS devices. This paper introduces an approach to improve and maintain spatial accuracy of <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundary</b> geometry, and concurrently improve geometry of other layers constructed with reference to the cadastral boundaries. This approach has been used in Australia for several years, while the full integration with a commercial GIS is currently under development. In the described system, cadastral geometry provides a network of boundaries defined by their dimensions and connectivity, thus making use of pre-existing survey information. Least squares analysis is applied to the network using survey accuracy as a means to weight the network elements. As many cadastres have used a digitizing process to create their digital maps, the system is designed to begin with such data and incrementally improve accuracy as more survey information is added. Adjustments to the cadastral geometry create a field o...|$|E
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries {{have witnessed the}} urgent need of accelerating cadastral surveying processes. Previous studies found that large portions of <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> coincide with visible physical objects, namely roads, fences, and building walls. This research explores the application of airborne laser scanning (ALS) techniques on cadastral surveys. A semi-automated workflow is developed to extract <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> from an ALS point clouds. Firstly, a two-phased workflow was developed that focused on extracting digital representations of physical objects. In the automated extraction phase, after classifying points into semantic components, the outline of planar objects such as building roofs and road surfaces were generated by an α-shape algorithm, whilst the centerlines delineatiation approach was fitted into the lineate object—a fence. Afterwards, the extracted vector lines were edited and refined during the post-refinement phase. Secondly, we quantitatively evaluated the workflow performance by comparing results against an exiting cadastral map as reference. It {{was found that the}} workflow achieved promising results: around 80 % completeness and 60 % correctness on average, although the spatial accuracy is still modest.

40|$|Countries in EU {{have been}} using Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) in order to {{administer}} agricultural subsidies since 1992. In time, IACS experienced some major changes indicating the usage of concrete spatial reference systems. In this context, Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPISs) emerged in order mainly to spatially represent the activities of farmers on their lands. LPIS requires the usage of orthophotos or orthoimagery as a basic guidance and sometimes uses cadastre coverage as an ancillary data source in demarcating agricultural parcels {{in conjunction with the}} declarations by farmers. These systems cover only agricultural areas. They mainly records agricultural land use information declared by farmers rather than land tenure information. The main reason for using such a system rather than using land records under land administration authorities is that land records were not readily available for the majority of countries. Another reason for that is the so-called complexity of both these land records and related administrations. The LPISs of this kind are regarded as easy to build, update and manage, and also low cost systems. In this study, the application of building standalone LPISs has been analyzed considering both the current situation and the future prospects. In this context, pros and cons of LPISs were revealed in view of land tenure and land administration. TS 1 G – <b>Cadastral</b> <b>Boundary</b> Issue...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a model that}} determines {{the position of the}} high water mark (HWM) based on the spatial continuity of inundation probability due to swash for a range of HWM indicators. These indicators include mean high water (MHW), high water line (HWL), and a number of shoreline features, such as the vegetation line. HWM identifies the landward extent of the ocean and is required for <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundary</b> definition, land-use and infrastructure development along the foreshore,and for planning associated with climate change adaptation. In this paper, shoreline indicators are extracted using an object-oriented image analysis (OOIA) approach. Ten-year hourly swash heights (shoreline excursion length) are fitted into a cumulative distribution function. The probability that swash will reach the various HWM indicators over a 10 y period is then estimated. The spatial continuity distances of the swash probability of HWM indicators are calculated using semivariogram models that measure similarity of swash probability. The spatial continuity distance is defined as the distance between the lower bound of sampling position (the most seaward HWM indicator) and the position where autocorrelation, or the similarity of swash probability of the various HWM indictors, approaches zero. The latter is considered as the HWM position in this study. This HWM determination method is evaluated at two study sites at different latitudes and with distinct coastal features...|$|E

Such an analysis can be realized without any additional measurements being taken, but only by using a high quality transformation model. The country-wide triangle-based transformation, Version 3. 0, was used as a reference model. The reasons for the inconsistency between D 48 /GK and D 96 /TM coordinates of CB points according to the reference transformation model are low accuracy or gross errors in D 96 /TM coordinates (GNSS measurements) and D 48 /GK coordinates (classical measurements). Rather than in direct measurement, D 48 /GK coordinates are obtained indirectly by using transformation. In that case, the inconsistency is caused by poor quality transformation parameters. In addition to possible low quality tie points, there may be an insufficient number of tie points used, or their inadequate spacing. The inconsistency between the coordinates of CB points could also be caused by some problems in the control network and low accuracy of the reference transformation model. The aims of the consistency analysis are quality control of surveys of CB points and quality control of the triangle-based transformation model. To achieve these aims, independent surveys were carried out at the selected locations within the testing area...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to propose a new {{redefinition}} of cadastral boundaries using GNSS equipment and cadastral maps. These maps are the ‘original' maps of the Italian Land Cadastre, the first cartographic support built directly from measures carried out by technicians during implantation of the Italian land cadastre. They are called ‘originali di impianto' - ‘originals of implantation' or ‘implant maps'. As such, these maps are valuable and are kept with great care. Recently, the Italian cadastre has carried out an accurate digitisation of these maps in a raster format at a high resolution. In this work, the authors propose {{the use of these}} digital maps for the recovery of <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundary.</b> The original cadastral map, one of the primary sources relied upon in defining legal boundaries, generally uses the Bessel ellipsoid localised in Genova and the Cassini-Soldner projection; the GNSS equipment, on the other hand, uses the geocentric ellipsoid with global or continental realisations. After an RTK positioning, the receivers usually provide the cartographic coordinates in a Gauss projection. However, our study deals with the problem of using different projections and reference systems within the limits of a map. In this context, the transition between systems and projections can be made through a conformal transformation with deformations slighter than graphical errors in the map. The difficulty of finding identifiable points in both reference systems is partially solved through a new way of carrying out the redefinition of boundaries by exploiting geometric informatio...|$|E
40|$|The High Water Mark (HWM) is an {{important}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundary</b> that separates land and water. It is also used as a baseline to facilitate coastal hazard management from which land and infrastructure development is offset to ensure the protection of property from storm surge and sea level rise. The determination of the HWM has a long history. Its definition, the mean and even the corresponding determination methods have changed through time. In addition, {{the location of the}} HWM is difficult to define accurately due to the ambulatory nature of water and coastal morphology variations. To better understand the HWM determination, this paper reviews the development of the definition of HWM, including ordinary high water mark (OHWM), mean high water mark (MHWM), mean high water spring (MHWS) and mean higher high water (MHHW), and the existing HWM indicators, such as vegetation line and beach morphological features. Two common methods of HWM determination, field survey and remote sensing, are discussed in this paper. This is followed by the investigation of the possible factors that influence the variation of the HWM position. Furthermore, an overview of the ambulatory nature of both water and coastal morphology, which contributes to the difficulties in HWM determination, is provided. Finally, the limitations of previous determination methods and future direction in HWM determination studies are also discussed.

By including station velocity models along with periodic readjustments, the spatial accuracy of the datum could be maintained in the face of wide spread earth deformation; improvements in survey technology; and changing demands of geodetic density and accuracy.

It is also used as a baseline to facilitate coastal hazard management, from which land and infrastructure development is offset to ensure the protection of property from storm surge and sea level rise. However, {{the location of the}} HWM is difficult to define accurately due to the ambulatory nature of water and coastal morphology variations. Contemporary research has failed to develop an accurate method for HWM determination because continual changes in tidal levels, together with unimpeded wave runup and the erosion and accretion of shorelines, make it difficult to determine a unique position of the HWM. While traditional surveying techniques are accurate, they selectively record data at a given point in time, and surveying is expensive, not readily repeatable and may not take into account all relevant variables such as erosion and accretion. In this research, a consistent and robust methodology is developed for the determination of the HWM over space and time. The methodology includes two main parts: determination of the HWM by integrating both water and land information, and assessment of HWM indicators in one evaluation system. It takes into account dynamic coastal processes, and the effect of swash or tide probability on the HWM. The methodology is validated using two coastal case study sites in Western Australia. These sites were selected to test the robustness of the methodology in two distinctly different coastal environments...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand, lying {{across the}} Pacific/Australian plate boundary, {{is subject to}} ground {{movements}} within the country of approximately 5 cm/yr. The existing geodetic control network and datum, New Zealand Geodetic Datum (NZGD) 1949, has been distorted by {{the effect of this}} ground movement. Because of these distortions, <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundary</b> coordinates, if held fixed in a coordinate cadastre, would eventually conflict with the position of slowly moving ground marks. However, the use of new technology such as GPS is ideally suited {{to the development of a}} coordinate cadastre. A dynamic coordinate cadastre is a possible outcome of recently started projects. A programme is underway to develop a modern control network and new datum (referred to as NZGD 2000) to replace the existing network. This could include up to 30 GPS permanent tracking stations which would monitor the integrity of the new datum and determine rates of ground deformation. A four dimensional (dynamic) datum with coordinates assigned velocities and changing to reflect ground movements is an option. As a separate project, the Department is considering the automation of the survey and land title systems. The automation of the survey system would see the digital capture of land parcel dimensions. Through connection to the geodetic network, geodetic coordinates would be assigned to parcel boundary points resulting in a coordinate cadastre. As the geodetic network moves to reflect ground movements, adjustment for this could be applied to boundary points forming a dynamic coordinate cadastre. In this manner, coordinates of boundary points would encapsulate available evidence of their true ground positions. This would not be a legal coordinate cadastre, but in the absence of other evidence the coordinate could be accepted as evidence to define parcels. To take the model further, it is conceivable that the cadastral surveyor in performing surveys would contribute to the geodetic network and dynamic datum. This possible model is debated...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{models of}} urban environments have great appeal and offer {{promises}} of interesting applications. While initially {{it was of}} interest to just have such 3 D data, it increasingly becomes evident that one really {{would like to have}} interpreted urban objects. To be able to interpret buildings we have to split a visible whole building block into its different single buildings. Usually this is done using cadastral information to divide the single land parcels. The problem in this case is that sometimes the building boundaries derived from the cadastre are insufficiently accurate due to several reasons like old databases with lower accuracies or inaccuracies due to transformation between two coordinate systems. For this reason it can happen that a <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundary</b> coming from an old map is displaced by up to several meters and therefore divides two buildings incorrectly. To overcome such problems we incorporate the information from vertical aerial images. We introduce a façade separation method that is able to find individual building façades using multi view stereo. The purpose is to identify the individual façades and separate them from one another before on proceeds with the analysis of a façade’s details. The source was a set of overlapping, thus “redundant ” vertical aerial images taken by an UltraCam digital aerial camera. Therefore in a first step we determine the building block outlines using the building classification and use the height values from the Digital Surface Model (DSM) to determine approximate “façade quadrilaterals”. We also incorporate height discontinuities using the height profiles along the building outlines to enhance our façade separation. In a next step we detect repeated pattern in these “façade images ” and use them to separate the façades respectively building blocks from one another...|$|E

40|$|Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{have emerged}} as a rapid, {{low-cost}} and flexible acquisition system that appears feasible for application in cadastral mapping: high-resolution imagery, acquired using UAVs, enables a new approach for defining property boundaries.

A workflow that automatically extracts boundary features from UAV data could increase the pace of current mapping procedures. This review introduces a workflow considered applicable for automated boundary delineation from UAV data. This is done by reviewing approaches for feature extraction from various application fields and synthesizing these into a hypothetical generalized cadastral workflow. The workflow consists of preprocessing, image segmentation, line extraction, contour generation and postprocessing.
