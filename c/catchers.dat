5|$|Hartnett hit 24 {{home runs}} in 1925, {{breaking}} the single-season home run record for <b>catchers</b> set by Jack Clements in 1893. He finished second overall in the National League behind the 39 home runs hit by Rogers Hornsby. Although he led National League <b>catchers</b> in errors, he also led in range factor and in putouts, while his strong throwing arm helped him lead the league in assists and caught stealing percentage. Leo Durocher, who played against Hartnett and was a National League manager during Johnny Bench's career, stated that the two <b>catchers</b> had similarly strong throwing arms. During the major league baseball winter meetings in December 1925, it was rumored that Hartnett might be traded to the New York Giants for catcher Frank Snyder and outfielder Irish Meusel; however, Cubs president Bill Veeck, Sr., squelched the rumors saying that Hartnett would not be traded for anybody.|$|E

5|$|Bresnahan {{was known}} for baiting umpires. He and McGraw were often ejected from games, suspended, and on a few {{occasions}} escorted from the field by police. A 1911 directive by NL president Thomas Lynch, compelling umpires to prevent <b>catchers</b> from antagonizing batters with verbal abuse, mentioned only Bresnahan by name.|$|E
5|$|Mancuso {{was known}} for his capable {{handling}} of pitching staffs and for his on-field leadership abilities. He was a member of five National League pennant-winning teams, and played as the catcher for five pitchers who were eventually inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Mancuso was {{regarded as one of the}} top defensive <b>catchers</b> of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Of the 48 {{players the}} Yankees have {{selected}} in the first round, 23 were pitchers. Of these, 18 were right-handed and 5 were left-handed.

50|$|A wild pitch usually {{passes the}} <b>catcher</b> behind home plate, often {{allowing}} runners on base an easy {{chance to advance}} while the <b>catcher</b> chases the ball down. Sometimes the <b>catcher</b> may block a pitch, and the ball may be nearby, but the <b>catcher</b> has trouble finding the ball, allowing runners to advance.|$|R

5|$|Prior to Johnny Bench, Hartnett was {{considered}} the greatest catcher {{in the history of}} the National League. A six-time All-Star, he appeared in four World Series during his playing career. At the time of his retirement, Hartnett held the career records for <b>catchers</b> in home runs, runs batted in, hits, doubles and in most games played as a catcher. Hartnett was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Catcher's</b> {{interference}} {{is called}} when the <b>catcher</b> physically hinders the batter's opportunity to legally swing at a pitched ball. This occurs most often when a <b>catcher</b> squats {{too close to}} home plate, so that the batter's bat touches the <b>catcher's</b> mitt as the batter swings. [...] This {{is most likely to}} happen on attempted steals where the <b>catcher</b> is anxious to catch the ball as soon as possible and may move his entire body or mitt forward a bit.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] "catcher's balk" [...] {{occurs when}} the <b>catcher</b> does not stay in the <b>catcher's</b> box until the pitcher {{delivers}} the ball. [...] The rule is rarely enforced, though. However, a <b>catcher's</b> balk is still charged to the pitcher. This is because the pitcher is deemed to have illegally delivered a pitch while the <b>catcher</b> was out of position.|$|R
25|$|Under {{high school}} (NFHS) rules only, <b>catcher's</b> {{interference}} is instead called <b>catcher's</b> obstruction.|$|R
5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg {{spent the first}} three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to <b>catchers</b> Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E
5|$|Despite the passed balls, Wilhelm won the American League ERA {{title with}} a 2.19 ERA. During the 1960 season, Orioles manager Paul Richards devised a larger mitt so his <b>catchers</b> {{could handle the}} knuckleball. Richards was well {{equipped}} with starting pitchers during that year. By {{the middle of the}} season, he said that eight of his pitchers could serve as starters. Wilhelm started 11 of the 41 games in which he appeared. He earned an 11–8 record, a 3.31 ERA and seven saves. He only started one game the following year, but he was an All-Star, registered 18 saves and had a 2.30 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Each year in {{late summer}} {{thousands}} of black swans and ducks descend on the area as the inland waterways they inhabit dry up. Waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants, oyster <b>catchers</b> and terns are common often year round. Egrets, ibis, herons and spoonbills feed on the seagrass and fairy wrens, chats, fantails and thornbills feed on insects and plants amongst the samphire. Each September stints and sandpipers arrive from the Northern Hemisphere in a spectacular display. With the abundance of birdlife the area attracts birds of prey with swamp harriers, collared sparrowhawks, black-shouldered kites, kestrels and little falcons are all seen in the skies over St Kilda.|$|E
5000|$|Hoiles {{returned}} to the major leagues in 1991 when the Orioles traded away <b>catcher</b> Mickey Tettleton and gave Hoiles {{an opportunity to be}} their starting <b>catcher.</b> He made only one error in 89 games played as a <b>catcher</b> and ended the year with a league-leading [...]998 fielding percentage, becoming the fifth rookie <b>catcher</b> in major league baseball history to win a fielding title.|$|R
5000|$|His 18-season playing {{career began}} in 1873 for the Washington Blue Legs of the National Association, {{and ended with}} the 1891 Washington Statesmen.

5|$|Ferrell {{was once}} again traded; this time he {{returned}} to the Senators in March1944. He earned {{a reputation as one of}} the best knuckleball <b>catchers</b> in baseball when he had the arduous task of catching for a Senators' starting pitching staff made up entirely of knuckleball pitchers. Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Roger Wolff, and Mickey Haefner all threw the notoriously difficult-to-catch knuckleball, making Ferrell the first catcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. Although Ferrell led the league in passed balls due to the unpredictability of the knuckleball, he was still named to his seventh All-Star Game. The Senators ended the season in last place while Ferrell's former team, the St. Louis Browns won the 1944American League pennant.|$|E
5|$|Ferrell was {{regarded}} as one of the best <b>catchers</b> in baseball during the 1930s and early 1940s. While playing for the Red Sox in 1933, he and his brother Wes were selected to play for the American League (AL) team in the inaugural 1933 Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July6, 1933. His 1,806games played as a catcher set an AL longevity record which stood for more than 40years. A seven-time All-Star, Ferrell was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984 by the Veterans Committee. After his playing career, he became a coach with the Senators, and later a scout and general manager with the Detroit Tigers. He died in July 1995.|$|E
5|$|Hartnett {{felt the}} strain of {{managing}} a team during the 1939 season as he faced player discontent over the pampering of Dizzy Dean while pitcher Larry French went over his head to complain to owner Philip Wrigley about his lack of pitching assignments. French felt he was being punished for requesting to have Gus Mancuso as his catcher. In addition, Hartnett was forced to catch more games {{due to the lack}} of hitting from the other Cubs <b>catchers.</b> On August 28, 1939, he broke Ray Schalk's Major League record of 1,727 career games as a catcher. His record for longevity was surpassed by Al López during the 1945 season.|$|E

50|$|After {{the ball}} makes {{contact with the}} wall and bounces off the ground at least once, any of the players, {{including}} the thrower, may then try to catch the ball. If <b>catcher</b> mishandles the ball and the ball touches the ground, the <b>catcher</b> must try to touch the wall before another player fields and throws the ball against the wall. If the ball touches the wall before the <b>catcher,</b> the <b>catcher</b> is out and must face various consequences. In some places, instead of hitting the wall you have to throw it at the <b>catcher.</b>|$|R
