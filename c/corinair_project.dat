40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that atmospheric emissions of various pollutants, from mobile and stationary sources, affect {{quality of life and}} public health. The impact of these emissions can be of a small (urban smog) or regional scale (acid deposition, troposheric ozone), {{as a result of the}} transportation of pollutants in the atmosphere. In terms of a local scale, road traffic is considered to be the most important pollutants source. In the present work, air pollutants emissions from road transport in Greece will be presented. The reference date for the calculations is the year 2000, but, additionally, a year-to-year variation (from 1992 to 2000) of the emissions will be examined in order to clarify the impact of the vehicle fleet and the engine technology changes. To calculate emissions, a methodology developed for the European Commission in the framework of the <b>CORINAIR</b> <b>project</b> has been applied. This methodology was further improved and adjusted to the greek fleet characteristics taking into account the vehicle age, the level of the vehicle maintenance etc. Calculations have shown that, despite during the last years the amount of the emitted pollutants per vehicle has significantly decreased, the total pollutants emitted have increased as a result of the increase the number of circulating vehicles. More specifically, in heavy duty vehicles and passenger cars have the most important role for emitting NOx, whilst motorcycles are the most important polluters for non-methene article organic compounds...|$|E
40|$|Urban and {{regional}} planning {{is regarded as}} a possible tool for a limited but precious resource use control, and as a means to assure a better environmental air quality. It now refers to new problems involved in the concept of sustainability. Actually, itâ€™s a common practice to found planning on a strong sense of responsibility towards the natural environment to avoid a further crisis of the settlement system. The research presented is founded on this premise. Its objective is to build a GIS platform based data processing framework in order to quantify emission and diffusion phenomena caused by public and private car traffic in Bologna Province. The starting point is the reconstruction of the entire mobility cycle from the quantification of generated or attracted trips by the census districts in which the provincial territory is divided. The system uses cascade models for traffic flows assignment, for the corresponding emissions estimate and for the evaluation of air pollutant transportation, diffusion and effects on air quality. On the basis of work and school trips dated to 1991 census and of data regarding road network structure and traffic load, the traffic flows was calculated. The model system created is useful both for diagnostic information and for the possibility to envisage- {{at least in terms of}} relative changes- the effects of measures and of particular weather conditions. In accordance with ACI (Italian Automobiles Club) traffic surveys and extrapolations, vehicles have been divided into classes in classes taking account of categories, running conditions and maintenance as stated by the <b>CORINAIR</b> methodology (a <b>project</b> to estimate air pollutant emissions promoted by UE XI DG) ...|$|R
