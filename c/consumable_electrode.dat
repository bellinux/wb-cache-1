5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and <b>consumable</b> <b>electrode</b> rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new welding methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was {{responsible}} for the release of stud welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged arc welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and gas metal arc welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal arc welding was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated <b>consumable</b> <b>electrode,</b> and it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma arc welding was invented. Electroslag welding was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961. In 1953, the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.|$|E

Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|R
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. <b>Consumable</b> <b>electrode</b> processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
500|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) – uses an {{automatically}} fed <b>consumable</b> <b>electrode</b> and {{a blanket of}} granular fusible flux. The molten weld and the arc zone are protected from atmospheric contamination by being [...] "submerged" [...] under the flux blanket.|$|E
500|$|To {{strike the}} {{electric}} arc, the electrode {{is brought into}} contact with the workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the <b>consumable</b> <b>electrode,</b> and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. [...] As the electrode melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder. This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces {{the amount of time that}} the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator's time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.|$|E

The analysis was confined only to the weld metal, and the base metal was not considered. Analysis methods included optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Energy dispersive x- ray analysis was performed in the transmission electron microscope to analyze the chemical composition of non-metallic inclusions. The microstructure was found to be primarily granular ferrite with some primary ferrite, bainite, and martensite. Very little acicular ferrite was found (< 18 %). Because of this, to get the best mechanical properties in the weld, the size and volume fraction of non-metallic inclusions needs to be minimized. This can be accomplished by minimizing the amount of oxygen while increasing the amount of titanium and aluminum in the weld metal. EDX analysis revealed that the non-metallic inclusions were multi-phase particles with two predominant phases: a TiO-MnO phase and a MnO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3, phase. Copper-sulfide caps were also found on the surface of some inclusions. This inclusion chemistry is typical of what is found in welding HSLA steel[URL] Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

Experimental results show {{a reduction in}} amount of large inclusions when the mold rotation rate is 6 r·min- 1, and the inclusions are uniformly distributed in the ESR ingot. As comparison with the electroslag ingots of conventional ESR (stationary mold), {{the portion of the}} Al 2 O 3 inclusions smaller than 1 μm in size increase from 38 % to 41. 4 %, whereas that of the SiO 2 inclusions increases from 48 % to 74 % in the ingots when mold rotation is applied. This phenomenon is caused by the decrease in metal droplet size, resulting in large contact area between the slag pool and metal droplets in ESR process with mold rotation. Moreover, the metal droplets have relatively long movement routes, leading to long metal contact time between the slag pool and metal droplets when a relative motion between the <b>consumable</b> <b>electrodes</b> and mold is present. However, when the mold rotation rate is increased to 45 r·min- 1, inclusion removing effect decreases.

The mechanical properties were determined by performing different tests, viz. Charpy V notch impact test, tensile test, hardness test, bend test. Surface morphology had been analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The results indicated that the shielding gas compositions have great influence on mechanical properties. Results revealed that increase in amount of CO 2 in shielding gas resulted in higher tensile strength and hardness values than the base metal. The study also indicated that shielding gas composition also have an influence on toughness values which further depends upon -ferrite content in the weld metal. This -ferrite content decreases with increase in CO 2 percentage of shielding gases. Decrease in -ferrite content has negative effects on toughness values of weldments. The gas metal arc welding is found to be suitable for welding of AISI 304 L {{austenitic stainless steels}} owing to their high welding speed and excellent mechanical properties...|$|R
