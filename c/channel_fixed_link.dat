40|$|AbstractInfrastructure {{projects}} with large increase in accessibility, often experience over- or underestimation in traffic volume prognosis. This {{has been the}} case in several <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> projects in Norway. <b>Fixed</b> <b>link</b> projects replaces ferry services with a bridge or a tunnel, resulting in large time savings across the fjord. This paper investigates four <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> projects in Norway. The <b>fixed</b> <b>links</b> connects islands to towns with a population of up to 50. 000. This study investigates how land use is affected by the opening of a <b>fixed</b> <b>link.</b> Commuting patterns, population, housing prices and number of companies are analysed with the difference in difference method. Results show a growth due to the <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> for two of the cases, while the other two experience small or no growth caused by the <b>fixed</b> <b>link.</b> The results indicate that land use changes might appear for islands, which get a <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> connection to non-urban areas...|$|R

5000|$|The Vigra <b>Fixed</b> <b>Link</b> (Vigrasambandet), {{also known}} as the Ålesund Tunnels (...) , is a <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> {{connecting}} the archipelago and municipality of Giske and the island of Ellingsøya to the mainland and the island city of Ålesund. It consists of the 3520 m long Ellingsøy Tunnel between Ålesund and Ellingsøya, the 4222 m long Valderøy Tunnel connecting the islands of Ellingsøya and Valderøya, the 3844 m long Godøy Tunnel between the islands of Valderøya and Godøy, and the Giske Bridge from Valderøya to Giske island. Valderøya was already connected by bridge to the island of Vigra, which meant that the <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> also connected the city of Ålesund to Ålesund Airport, Vigra. The <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> opened between 1987 and 1989, and was financed as a toll road. The link is part of Norwegian National Road 658 and Norwegian County Road 658.|$|R
5|$|Back in Kristiansund, Løvold {{started working}} {{with the idea of}} {{building}} a subsea road tunnel from Kristiansund to the mainland. He discussed the issue in Foreningen Kristiansunderen where it received support. Løvold was an important enthusiast for the <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> project, which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei <b>Fixed</b> <b>Link</b> in 1992. The local press dubbed him the <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> general. In 1955 he organized an inspection of Freifjorden; using echo sounding it was possible to survey the depth of the fjord. Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav Oksvik and the two started working towards implementing the plans.|$|R

A <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> across the Bohai Sea is required to join the first missing link from Dalian to Yantai. The construction of a tunnel was announced in February 2011. Second, to achieve a <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> from Mainland China to Hainan Island, a bridge is being constructed across the Qiongzhou Strait. Currently, the southern terminus is Xuwen County, in the city of Zhanjiang, Guangdong, because the <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> to Haikou, Hainan has not been built yet.|$|R
50|$|TEDCO and the City had {{earmarked}} {{the lands}} for waterfront revitalization upon {{the recommendations of}} the Crombie Commission on the Waterfront. Thus, while the TPA was seeking approval of the Island Airport <b>fixed</b> <b>link,</b> it potentially threatened the ability of the City to proceed on waterfront revitalization. City Council, leading up to the debate on the <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> plan, made the settlement of the lawsuit a condition of the approval of the <b>fixed</b> <b>link.</b> On November 28, 2002, Council in a day-long debate, made two votes to settle the issue. First, Council voted 32-9 to accept a settlement to end the TPA port-lands lawsuit in exchange for an immediate payment of $5.5 million and an annual subsidy of $5.5 million to the TPA until 2012. Council then voted 29-11 to approve the amendment of the tripartite agreement to permit a <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> and the construction of a lift bridge. In return, the TPA dropped its claim to the lands and the permanent subsidy in exchange for money and permission to build the <b>fixed</b> <b>link.</b> In its estimation, the TPA would thus be able to be self-sufficient and contribute to waterfront revitalization.|$|R

40|$|AbstractFixed links {{projects}} are bridges or tunnels that connect two areas separated by geographic barriers. <b>Fixed</b> <b>links</b> reduce dramatically the travel time and provide reliability and flexibility, as often they replace ferry services. This might impact on land use characteristics and travel behaviour. We aim to explain these impacts by making time series analyses of empirical data on two <b>fixed</b> <b>links</b> that connect islands {{to the mainland}} {{on the west coast}} of Norway. We find that changes in travel time and cost might generate an increase in the attractiveness of the municipalities connected by the <b>fixed</b> <b>links,</b> leading to an increase in population. The greater demand for housing triggers a growth in square metre price for dwellings and construction rates. There is also a higher annual traffic growth than the experienced before the <b>fixed</b> <b>link</b> was opened. Despite that, we do not find either an additional {{increase in the number of}} companies or changes on number of employees in the existing companies...|$|R
