40|$|The MACS-lift technique, in {{the simple}} or {{extended}} variation, delivers a reproducible and natural rejuvenation of the face and neck with minimal morbidity and a swift recovery. Retro-auricular extension of the surgery is avoided by pure vertical redraping of the facial skin. In patients with an exceptionally bad skin quality, any vertical pleats below the lobule that may appear can easily be corrected with a limited posterior <b>cervicoplasty...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveCarotid artery {{stenosis}} is a {{complication of}} neck irradiation. We describe {{the immediate and}} long-term results of surgical treatment. MethodsThis was a retrospective single centre study. From 1996 to 2009, 24 consecutive patients who {{had in the past}} received neck radiation therapy (mean 12 years, 1 – 41 years) underwent 27 primary carotid artery revascularisation procedures. Six patients (23 %) had previous radical neck dissection, three permanent tracheostomies and one <b>cervicoplasty</b> with pectoral muscle flap. Indications for surgery included symptomatic (five transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), four strokes; 34 %) and asymptomatic (18 patients, 66 %) stenosis. Four patients had occlusion of the contralateral carotid. General anaesthesia without shunting was used with measurement of stump pressure. Carotid interposition bypass grafting included 23 vein grafts and three Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts. ResultsNo perioperative deaths or central neurological events occurred. Three patients suffered transient cranial nerve injuries. Eleven patients died during follow-up, mean interval of 28 months (range 6 – 120 months), of causes unrelated to surgery. Five patients had recurrent bypass stenosis with one TIA and one stroke. All other surviving patients remained asymptomatic. ConclusionDespite no comparative study as evidence, we think that the perioperative risk of stroke is at least comparable with the risk encountered for angioplasty procedures...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundMajor {{problems}} with <b>cervicoplasty</b> by direct skin excision include the subjective nature of skin markings preoperatively and the confusing array of procedures offered. This technique incorporates curved incisions, {{resulting in a}} wave-like scar, {{which is why the}} procedure is called a "wave-plasty". MethodsThis prospective study includes 37 patients who underwent wave-plasty procedures from 2004 to 2015. Skin pinching technique was used to mark the anterior neck preoperatively in a reproducible fashion. Intra-operatively, redundant skin was excised, along with excess fat when necessary, and closed to form a wave-shaped scar. Patients were asked to follow up at 1 week, 6 weeks, and 6 months after surgery. ResultsThe mean operation time was 70. 8 minutes. The majority (81. 3 %) was satisfied with their progress. On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being the worst, and 10 being the best), the scars were objectively graded on average 5. 5 when viewed from the front and 7. 3 when seen from the side 6 months after surgery. Complications consisted of one partial wound dehiscence (2. 3 %), one incidence of hypertrophic scarring (2. 3 %), and two cases of under-resection requiring revision (5. 4 %). ConclusionsIn select patients, surgical rejuvenation of the neck may be obtained through wave-like incisions to remove redundant cervical skin when other options are not available. The technique is reproducible, easily teachable and carries low morbidity and high patient satisfaction in carefully chosen patients...|$|E
