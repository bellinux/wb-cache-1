Between 17:30 and 18:30UTC on September12, the hurricane's eye moved over Guadeloupe with a barometric pressure of , suggesting maximum sustained winds of 240km/h (140mph), or Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Continuing to the west-northwest, the hurricane passed about 10mi (16km) south of Saint Croix [...] before approaching Puerto Rico. On September13, the 15mi (25km) eye crossed Puerto Rico in eight hours from the southeast to the northwest, moving ashore near Guayama and exiting between Aguadilla and Isabela. A ship near the southern coast reported a pressure of , and the <b>cup</b> <b>anemometer</b> at San Juan reported sustained winds of 160mph (257km/h) before failing. As the wind station was 30miles (50km) north of the storm's center, winds near the landfall point were unofficially estimated as high as 200mph (320km/h). On this basis, the hurricane {{is believed to have}} made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, although there was uncertainty in the peak intensity, due to the large size and slow movement of the storm.|$|E

In this paper, we demonstrate a method for identifying faulty three <b>cup</b> <b>anemometers.</b> This method is applicable to cases where data is available from two or more anemometers at equal height and cases where data is available from anemometers at different heights.

In addition, various preprocessing techniques are discussed to improve performance of the algorithm. These include removing data that corresponds to poor wind directions for comparing the anemometers and removing data that corresponds to frozen anemometers. These methods are employed on the data from the PHM 2011 Data Competition with results presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cup</b> <b>anemometers</b> {{are used}} in the wind energy {{industry}} to characterize wind farm sites and to predict monthly and annual energy production. Their role is important since wind speed predictions depend on their correct operation. Unfortunately, northern climates greatly affect the performance of anemometers, because in-cloud icing generally occurs at higher altitudes (more than 600 m). Wind speed prediction error caused by rime ice accreted on the anemometer can be as large as 10 % to 30 % during the winter months. This generates big errors in wind predictions, resulting in an undervaluation of the wind potential of a site or causing overloads to the wind turbines which depend only on the parameters read by the anemometer. In order to partially remedy this difficulty, heated <b>cup</b> <b>anemometers</b> are used. The Anti-icing Materials International Laboratory (AMIL) at the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi (UQAC), in collaboration with the Wind Energy Group at the University of Quebec at Rimouski (UQAR) evaluated, in a refrigerated wind tunnel, under a very severe freezing fog, the behaviour of two <b>cup</b> <b>anemometers</b> in order to estimate and model the performance loss in adverse atmospheric conditions. The results obtained show that performance decreases for both unheated and heated <b>cup</b> <b>anemometers</b> with respect to exposure time and freezing fog severity, leading to complete stoppage of the unheated anemometer. Finally, a semi-empirical equation, taking into account air speed and temperature, liquid water content as well as water droplets median volumetric diameter is proposed in order to predict a <b>cup</b> <b>anemometer’s</b> performance loss due to exposure time to freezing fog exposure time...|$|R

The windy with enhanced turbulence data set showed significant differences between the buoy mounted laser wind sensor and the on-shore mast mounted <b>cup</b> <b>anemometers.</b> The sign of the average difference depended on the direction of the winds.

50|$|In the 1960s, {{wind chill}} {{began to be}} {{reported}} as a wind chill equivalent temperature (WCET), which is theoretically less useful. The author of this change is unknown, {{but it was not}} Siple or Passel as is generally believed. At first, it was defined as the temperature at which the windchill index would be the same in the complete absence of wind. This led to equivalent temperatures that exaggerated the severity of the weather. Charles Eagan realized that people are rarely still and that even when it was calm, there was some air movement. He redefined the absence of wind to be an air speed of 1.8 m/s, which was about as low a wind speed as a <b>cup</b> <b>anemometer</b> could measure.

50|$|The {{scale was}} made a {{standard}} for ship's log entries on Royal Navy vessels in the late 1830s and was adapted to non-naval use from the 1850s, with scale numbers corresponding to <b>cup</b> <b>anemometer</b> rotations. In 1916, to accommodate the growth of steam power, the descriptions were changed to how the sea, not the sails, behaved and extended to land observations. Rotations to scale numbers were standardized only in 1923. George Simpson, C.B.E.

The measure was slightly altered some decades later to improve its utility for meteorologists.

50|$|On September 6, ships {{reported}} a tropical depression developing {{just off the}} west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal. The next day, a ship reported winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), or tropical storm status; on this basis, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the system attained tropical storm status late on September 6. However, lack of observations for several days prevented the system from being classified in real time as it moved generally westward across the Atlantic Ocean. On September 10, the S.S. Commack first observed the storm about 900 miles (1450 km) to the east of Guadeloupe, which at the time was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship's radio. Later that day, two other ships confirmed the intensity of the storm, and the Hurricane Research Division estimated it strengthened into a hurricane at 18:00 UTC on September 10.As the storm neared the Lesser Antilles, it continued to intensify. Between 17:30 and 18:30 UTC on September 12, the hurricane's eye moved over Guadeloupe with a barometric pressure of , suggesting maximum sustained winds of 240 km/h (140 mph), or Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.
