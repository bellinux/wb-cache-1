In early faunal works many more taxa were named than were acknowledged 50 years later.

Despite its importance, there is little consistency in <b>the</b> statement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grouping</b> problem in literature. In addition, most grouping algorithms in vision are inspired on a specific technique, rather than being based on desired characteristics, making it cumbersome to compare <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> various methods. This paper discusses six precisely formulated considerations for <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> generic <b>grouping</b> algorithms in vision: proper definition, invariance, multiple interpretations, multiple solutions, simplicity and robustness. We observe none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing algorithms for grouping in vision meet all the considerations. We present a simple algorithm as an extension of a classical algorithm, where the extension is based on taking the considerations into account. The algorithm is applied to three examples: grouping point sets, grouping poly-lines, and <b>grouping</b> flow-field vectors. <b>The</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greedy algorithm is OðnOGÞ, where OG is <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grouping</b> measure.

40|$|Summary. We {{present a}} {{distributed}} mechanism for automatically allocating tasks to robots {{in a manner}} sensitive to each robot’s performance level without handcoding these levels in advance. This mechanism {{is an important part}} of improving multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) in systems where communication is restricted or where the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> dynamics makes it necessary to make allocation decisions locally. The general mechanism is demonstrated as an improvement on our previously published task allocation through vacancy chains (TAVC) algorithm for distributed MRTA. The TAVC algorithm uses individual reinforcement learning of task utilities and relies on the specializing abilities of the members of the group to produce dedicated optimal allocations. Through experiments with realistic simulator we evaluate the improved algorithm by comparing it to random allocation. We conclude that using softmax action selection functions on task utility values makes algorithms responsive to different performance levels in a group of heterogeneous robots. ...|$|E

Methods: A mixed methods research study focussing on ethnic options of young ‘mixed race ’ people (n= 326) recruited {{in colleges and}} universities investigated respondents ’ preferences with respect to concepts, terminology, and classifications. Results: The overwhelming generic term of choice was ‘mixed race’, widely interpreted by respondents to include mixed minority groups. Respondents were able to assign themselves in a valid way to a 12 -category extended 2001 England and Wales Census classification for ‘mixed’, which collapses into five main groupings and also maps back to the census categories. Amongst options tested for census purposes, multi-ticking performed poorly and is not recommended. Conclusions: A more finely granulated classification for ‘mixed ’ is feasible where needed but this requires more extensive testing before it can be judged preferable to a ‘tick one or more ’ option that has been shown to have poor reproducibility in validation surveys...|$|E

The difficulty of color isomorphism problems is known to be closely linked to the the composition factors of the permutation group involved. Previous works are primarily concerned with applying color isomorphism to bou nded degree graph isomorphism, and have therefore focused on the alternating composit ion factors, since those are the bottleneck in the case of graph isomorphism. We consider the color isomorphism problem with composition factors restricted to those other than the alternating group, show that group isomorphism reduces in n^(O(log log n)) time to this problem, and, conversely, that a special case of this color isomorphism problem reduces to a slight generalization of group isomorphism. We then sharpen our results by identifying the projective special linear group as the main obstacle to faster algorithms for group isomorphism and prove that the aforementioned reduc tion from group isomorphism to color isomorphism in fact produces only cyclic and projective special linear factors. Our results demonstrate that, just as the alternatin g group was a barrier to faster algorithms for graph isomorphism for three decades, the projective special linear group is an obstacle to faster algorithms for group isomorphism.

We give {{methods for}} {{bounding}} the higher-order filling functions of a Carnot group and {{apply them to}} a family of quadratically presented groups studied by Chen [8] and Warhurst [22]. These methods give sharp bounds on some higher-order filling invariants of these groups.

30|$|The {{next-generation}} High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard {{reduces the}} bit rate by 44 % on average {{compared to the}} previous-generation H. 264 standard, resulting in higher encoding complexity. To achieve normal video coding in power-constrained devices and minimize the rate distortion degradation, this paper proposes a hierarchical complexity control algorithm for HEVC {{on the basis of}} the coding unit depth decision. First, according to the target complexity and the constantly updated reference time, the coding <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> of pictures layer and the frame layer is allocated and controlled. Second, the maximal depth is adaptively assigned to the coding tree unit (CTU) {{on the basis of the}} correlation between the residual information and the optimal depth by establishing the complexity-depth model. Then, the coding unit smoothness decision and adaptive low bit threshold decision are proposed to constrain the unnecessary traversal process within the maximal depth assigned by the CTU. Finally, adaptive upper bit threshold decision is used to continue the necessary traversal process at a larger depth than the maximal depth of allocation to guarantee the quality of important coding units. Experimental results show that our algorithm can reduce the encoding time by up to 50 %, with notable control precision and limited performance degradation. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm can achieve higher control accuracy.|$|E

Our phylogenetic analysis of new mitochondrial DNA sequences of 58 species of Macrobrachium distributed mainly in America support the hypothesis of monophyly of this genus, if Cryphiops Dana, 1852 is accepted as a generic synonym. We concluded that the independent evolution of different types of life cycle (abbreviated larval development-ALD and extended larval development-ELD) must have occurred more than once in the history of the group. Similarly, we also concluded that the current type species of the genus, Macrobrachium americanum Bate, 1868, should not be considered valid, as previously proposed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} utilizes {{the social}} relief {{efforts of the}} Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Branch of the Black Panther Party {{as a framework for}} social transformation. By applying post-colonial theory, this study constructs a story on the lived resistances, socio-historical context, and discourse of former members of the Black Panther Party and local Philadelphia residents from 1968 - 1974. This study is imperative for four reasons. First, {{in order to get a}} complete picture of the Black Panther Party, one has to extend foci beyond the deeply studied Oakland, California Chapter (i. e., Panther Headquarters), and examine differences/similarities across the local Branches. Second, literature in the field of curriculum studies has only dealt with the Black Panther Party in passing. Thus, there is little attempt to detail this historical moment in the Black Power Movement, and apply it to Black liberation struggles in American education. Third, prior research on the Black Panthers has been overly romantic, Marxist, and reductionist, therefore offering a limited perspective on the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> their lived resistances, and how the Panthers modeled social transformation as a step-by-step process. Fourth, this study challenges many mis-representations and mis-interpretations of the Black Panther Party that have circulated in contemporary society as common truths. Resultantly, this dissertation provides insight from a multiplicity of sources to better capture the identity(-ies) of the organization. In sum, this dissertation will not only resolve a dearth in the literature that highlights the multiple facets of the Black Panther Party, but will serve as a template on effective strategies for social and educational transformation. ...|$|E
40|$|On {{one hand}} {{the content of}} this thesis falls {{within the scope of}} Group theory, {{and on the other hand}} in the field of Graph theory. The thesis deals with Cayley digraphs of {{different}} finite groups and with identifying properties of groups from their representation as Cayley (di) graphs. By the properties of groups we particularly refer to the properties such as the orders of elements, generators of group, the subgroups, the normal subgroups, the cosets, and so on. Cayley digraphs are very appropriate for such consideration as they directly or indirectly reveal various properties of the groups, and give a clear insight into the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> Cayley (di) graphs are named after Arthur Cayley, who first mentioned them in 1878. These graphs are naturally obtained from groups with their vertices being the elements of the group in question. Due to the symmetry these graphs exactly the same from each vertex. When investigating the properties of the groups we examine the structure of their Cayley (di) graphs and their characteristics. Groups are in fact abstract objects. Being able to investigate their properties via their Cayley (di) graphs is thus of great help since it enables us to visualise these abstract objects. At the beginning of the thesis we define the basic concepts of Group theory that are needed to understand the thesis. After that we explain the basic concepts of Graph theory and introduce a concept of the digraph. Afterwards we introduce the concept of Cayley (di) graphs, which play a central role in the thesis.

(2) Implementation {{of managerial}} supervision is carried out through three stages: the initial activity is to explain the intent and purpose of arrival at the school superintendent, explained the format of the principal performance assessment and performance assessment scenarios agreed school. On head supervisor assessing the performance of the core activities of the Principal. ie relating to aspects of the management and administration of the School with the steps that have been agreed at once record things that are less corresponding. On activities cover supervisor explained to the headmaster about the results of the assessment. supervisor explained the result by showing the performance of the principal aspects of strength and weakness. (3) Feedback supervision manajerial. to correct the findings discrepancies or problems found. Implementation of managerial supervision by supervisors in Dabin 7 UPTD District of Purwodadi there are 3 stages: planning, implementation and feedback in order to improve the quality and effectiveness of education.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> bottom-up {{recovery of}} structured 2 -D geometric primitives from real, complex images. A novel approach for perceptual grouping is presented, using asynchrony whose fundamental principle is to process some primitives before some others, because they carry more information. <b>The</b> main contribution <b>of</b> this work lies in <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grouping</b> process {{to a problem}} linear with respect to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> image contours. Another advantageous characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed method is that only two parameters need to be specified. <b>The</b> asynchronous perceptual <b>grouping</b> processes a data flow of ordered contour primitives, with a rank in the flow determined according to a measure of saliency. It sequentially attempts to group each contour primitive coming in the data flow with other neighboring ones having arrived earlier. Acceptance or rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current contour depends on <b>the</b> geometrical configuration <b>of</b> its neighborhood in the image; properties tested include proximity, colinearity, curvilinearity, and parallelism. The topology as well as <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant structures emerging throughout the whole image are captured in a rigid graph. Junction and surface characteristics are easily extractable, which can help to choose pertinent primitives for an indexing or a recognition system...|$|R
