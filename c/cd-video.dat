2500|$|The {{original}} 1989 Rykodisc edition, in an LP-size box {{designed by}} Roger Gorman and featuring photography by Greg Gorman, was either in LP, audiocassette or CD format, as six LPs, three cassettes or three CDs and one <b>CD-Video</b> (a Laserdisc type disc that was retired in 1991), {{with the latter}} containing audio tracks and the music video of [...] "Ashes To Ashes". There was also a numbered limited edition of 350 in a solid beach wood case with a certificate personally signed by Bowie. [...] Content from this release included material from Bowie's catalogue through 1980 (including several live performances from the 1970s). [...] A second Rykodisc version of this edition, released in 1995 on CD, replaced the <b>CD-Video</b> with a regular CD-ROM and was packaged in a smaller slipcase. The contents of this release are otherwise {{identical to the original}} release.|$|E

40|$|A {{compact disc}} (CD) player is an optical {{decoding}} device that reproduces high-quality audio from a digitally coded signal recorded as a spiral-shaped track on a reflective disc [2]. Apart from the audio application, other optical data systems (CD ROM, optical data drive) and combined audio/video applica tions (CD-interactive, <b>CD-video)</b> have emerged. An important research area for these applications {{is the possibility}} of increasing the rotational frequency of the disc to obtain faster data readout and shorter access time. For higher rotational speeds, however, a higher servo bandwidth is required that approaches the resonance frequencies of bending and torsional modes of the CD mechanism. Moreover, the system behavior varies from player to player because of manufacturing tolerances of CD players in mass production, which explains the need for robustness of the controller. Further, an increasing percentage of all CD-based applications is for portable use. Thus, additionally, power consumption and shock sensitivity play a decisive role in the performance assess ment of controller design for CD systems. In this chapter we concentrate on the possible improvements ofboth the track-following and focusing behavior of a CD player, using robust control design techniques...|$|E
