5|$|In July 1952, Kesselring was {{diagnosed}} with a <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth</b> in the throat. During World War I, he had frequently smoked up to twenty cigars per day but he quit smoking in 1925. Although the British were suspicious of the diagnosis, they were concerned that he might die in prison like Mälzer, which would be a public relations disaster. Kesselring was transferred to a hospital, under guard. In October 1952, Kesselring was released from his prison sentence on the grounds of ill-health.|$|E
5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth</b> (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.|$|E
25|$|Oncomirs are {{associated}} with carcinogenesis, malignant transformation, and metastasis. Some oncomir genes are oncogenes, in that overexpression of the gene leads to <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth.</b> Other oncomir genes are tumor suppressors in a normal cell, so that underexpression of the gene leads to <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|E

25|$|In normal circumstances, absent telomerase, if a cell divides recursively, at {{some point}} the progeny reach their Hayflick limit, which is {{believed}} to be between 50–70 cell divisions. At the limit the cells become senescent and cell division stops. Telomerase allows each offspring to replace the lost bit of DNA allowing the cell line to divide without ever reaching the limit. This same unbounded growth is a feature of <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|E

25|$|For many years, Higgins smoked. He had <b>cancerous</b> <b>growths</b> {{removed from}} his mouth in 1994 and 1996. In June 1998, he {{was found to have}} throat cancer; on 13 October of that year, he had major surgery.|$|R
50|$|Rudolf Breuss (1899 - 1990) was an Austrian who {{maintained}} that cancer lives on solid foods {{taken into the}} body, and that <b>cancerous</b> <b>growths</b> will die if a patient drinks only vegetable juices and tea for 42 days.|$|R
25|$|A {{very rare}} type of {{parasitic}} twinning {{is one where}} a single viable twin is endangered when the other zygote becomes cancerous, or molar. This means that the molar zygote's cellular division continues unchecked, resulting in a <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth</b> that overtakes the viable fetus. Typically, this results when one twin has either triploidy or complete paternal uniparental disomy, resulting in little or no fetus and a cancerous, overgrown placenta, resembling a bunch of grapes.|$|E
25|$|Gwynn {{had three}} {{procedures}} to remove noncancerous growths from his parotid gland since 1997. In 2010, {{he was diagnosed}} with cancer of a salivary gland and had lymph nodes and tumors from the gland removed. The operation left his face partially paralyzed on the right side, leaving him unable to smile. Later that year, he underwent eight weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. He was declared cancer free afterwards, and also regained his ability to smile. Additional surgery was performed in 2012 to remove more <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth</b> and address nerve damage. Gwynn attributed the cancer to the dipping tobacco habit that he had since playing rookie ball in Walla Walla in 1981. Doctors, however, stated that studies had not linked parotid cancer with use of chewing tobacco.|$|E

500|$|In May 2001, it was {{revealed}} that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth</b> from one of his lungs, and in July, it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland. While in Switzerland, Starr visited him but had to cut his stay short to travel to Boston, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery, prompting Harrison to quip: [...] "Do you want me to come with you?" [...] In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital, in New York City, for non-small cell lung cancer that had spread to his brain. When the news was publicised, Harrison bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{with his}} cancer in remission, Walt {{undergoes}} an operation {{to remove the}} remaining <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth.</b> Walt's anesthesia-induced references to a [...] "second cell phone" [...] – the one he uses to deal drugs – makes Skyler suspicious, leading her to uncover many of his lies and leave with their children. Just after her departure, two passenger planes collide directly above Walt's house; the accident was caused by Donald, who works as an air traffic controller and was so overcome with grief {{that he was not}} paying attention to his work. Walt watches the accident in horror, unaware that he is indirectly responsible for it.|$|E
2500|$|Other, {{more complex}} {{relationships}} {{have been observed}} {{as a consequence of}} mutated AR; some mutations associated with male phenotypes have been linked to male breast cancer, prostate cancer, {{or in the case of}} spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, disease of the central nervous system. [...] The form of breast cancer seen in some men with PAIS is caused by a mutation in the AR's DNA-binding domain. [...] This mutation is thought to cause a disturbance of the AR's target gene interaction that allows it to act at certain additional targets, possibly in conjunction with the estrogen receptor protein, to cause <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth.</b> The pathogenesis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) demonstrates that even the mutant AR protein itself can result in pathology. [...] The trinucleotide repeat expansion of the polyglutamine tract of the AR gene that is associated with SBMA results in the synthesis of a misfolded AR protein that the cell fails to proteolyze and disperse properly. [...] These misfolded AR proteins form aggregates in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. [...] Over the course of 30 to 50 years, these aggregates accumulate and have a cytotoxic effect, eventually resulting in the neurodegenerative symptoms associated with SBMA.|$|E

2500|$|... of splice isoforms of key {{proteins}} in important cancer pathways. It {{is not always}} clear whether such aberrant patterns of splicing contribute to the <b>cancerous</b> <b>growth,</b> or are merely consequence of cellular abnormalities associated with cancer. Interestingly, for certain types of cancer, like in colorectal and prostate, the number of splicing errors per cancer {{has been shown to}} vary greatly between individual cancers, a phenomenon referred to as transcriptome instability. Transcriptome instability has further been shown to correlate grealty with reduced expression level of splicing factor genes. In fact, there is actually a reduction of alternative splicing in cancerous cells compared to normal ones, and the types of splicing differ; for instance, cancerous cells show higher levels of intron retention than normal cells, but lower levels of exon skipping. Some of the differences in splicing in cancerous cells {{may be due to the}} high frequency of somatic mutations in splicing factor genes, and some may result from changes in phosphorylation of trans-acting splicing factors. Others may be produced by changes in the relative amounts of splicing factors produced; for instance, breast cancer cells have been shown to have increased levels of the splicing factor SF2/ASF. One study found that a relatively small percentage (383 out of over 26000) of alternative splicing variants were significantly higher in frequency in tumor cells than normal cells, suggesting that there is a limited set of genes which, when mis-spliced, contribute to tumor development. It is believed however that the deleterious effects of mis-spliced transcripts are usually safeguarded and eliminated by a cellular posttranscriptional quality control mechanism termed Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [...]|$|E
