40|$|Chemical {{modification}} with chitin- and chitosan-hexamethyl methylol melamine (HMMM) co-polymers {{was investigated}} {{for improving the}} stiffness of lignocellulosic materials. Chitin and chitosan were converted by chemical means to low molecular weight oligosaccharides with molecular weight profiles suitable for penetration of lignocellulosic cell walls. The oligomers were reacted under controlled conditions with hexamethyl methylol melamine (HMMM) to produce aqueous formulations of oligosaccharide bonded to HMMM, the “pre-polymers”. The chitosan oligomers reacted with HMMM to produce, on <b>condensation</b> <b>polymerisation,</b> a water-insoluble polymer in high yield (69 %), whereas the chitin oligomer HMMM condensation reaction gave poor co-polymer yields (28 – 34 %).

30|$|The degradable {{synthetic}} polymers, {{which have}} widely {{been used as}} scaffolding materials in bone tissue engineering, are polyesters. Polyesters are characterised by the ester functional groups along their backbones, which are formed via the <b>condensation</b> <b>polymerisation</b> between carboxylic acid group (–COOH) and a hydroxyl group (–OH) on the precursor monomers. Two widely used monomers are lactic acid and glycolic acid. These small precursor molecules are endogenous to the human metabolism. In principle, polyesters can degrade to natural metabolic products through hydrolysis. Saturated poly(α-hydroxy esters) such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), and their copolymers have been extensively investigated (Mano et al. 2004; Kohn 1996; Rezwan et al. 2006).|$|E

In the binder, up to 20 % of phenol are replaced by cardanol with various weight ratios of 100 / 0, 95 / 5, 90 / 10, 85 / 15, 80 / 20. Cardanol may react both through the phenolic group and the double bond of the side chain yielding addition, <b>condensation</b> and <b>polymerisation</b> reactions that allow the synthesis of tailor-made products and polymers of high value. In the present work, mechanical, thermal and wear characteristics of cardanol based phenolic resin with organic ingredients were manufactured and tested.

40|$|A {{crystalline}} ice matrix at subzero temperatures {{can maintain}} a liquid phase where organic solutes and salts concentrate to form eutectic solutions. This concentration effect converts the confined reactant solutions {{in the ice}} matrix, sometimes making <b>condensation</b> and <b>polymerisation</b> reactions occur more favourably. These reactions occur at significantly high rates from a prebiotic chemistry standpoint, and the labile products can be protected from degradation. The experimental study of the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles at the ice–water system showed the efficiency of this scenario and could explain the origin of nucleobases in the inner Solar System bodies, including meteorites and extra-terrestrial ices, and on the early Earth. The same conditions can also favour the condensation of monomers to form ribonucleic acid and peptides. Together with the synthesis of these monomers, the ice world (i. e., the chemical evolution in the range between the freezing point of water and the limit of stability of liquid brines, 273 to 210 K) is an under-explored experimental model in prebiotic chemistry.

Although they all have the same chemical composition, it is found that their chemical and optical properties vary. NMR studies show that the morphologies of the polymers are different, due to the differences in the cis?trans ratio of the vinylene bonds. It is found that the derivatives produced by Horner condensation contain a majority of trans bonds, and these derivatives show different spectral characteristics to the Wittig derivatives. The ability of the polymers to disperse carbon nanotubes is also studied. Here, not only is the synthetic route important, but the solvent used also plays a role.

40|$|Silica gel, a {{material}} that is produced from the <b>condensation</b> <b>polymerisation</b> of silicic acid, contains surface silanol groups formed during the condensation. The silanol groups on the surface are mostly of free and vicinal silanol groups. These silanol groups can be modified in several different ways. Thermal treatment and hydrothermal treatment {{can be carried out}} to alter the concentration proportions between free and hydrogen bonded silanol groups on the surface. They can also be chemically treated with suitable chlorosilanes to modify the silanol groups into polar or non polar materials {{that can be used in}} separation science. This article explores the chemical nature of silanol groups on the surfaces of different materials. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy was used as the instrumental technique in this study. The silanol groups classifications were made by analyzing the near infrared spectra obtained during the adsorption of water molecules. Absorption of the combination frequencies of water molecules in the region 5500 - 5000 cm - 1 were used in characterizing the silanol groups on the surfaces. Second derivative technique was employed in the resolution and detailed analysis of these absorptions. The study reveals that the materials contain free, vicinal and gem silanol groups. Silica gel contains free and vicinal silanol groups, thermally treated silica gel contains fewer vicinal silanol groups compared to the base silica gel, and hydrothermally treated silica gel contains higher concentrations of vicinal silanol groups compared to the base silica gel. Furthermore, the chemically modified silica gel contains vicinal or geminal silanol groups depending on the type of functionality introduced...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} {{of an ancient}} weathered glass is characterized by high porosity and {{a small amount of}} modifier ions, due to the leaching effect of water {{on the surface of the}} glass. This effect is connected to the formation of voids in the glass and to a general release of ions from the glass to the moisture. The {{structure of}} the weathered area is similar to the structure of a room temperature synthetic sol-gel silica, in which the porosity is achieved through the chemical mechanism of synthesis (<b>condensation</b> and <b>polymerisation</b> from the reagents) while the composition of the weathered glass can be tailored changing the receipt of the precursors. The work deals with the results of the application of this technique in the study of ancient glass. In particular, we found interesting similarities between the composition of an ancient glass coming from Iulia Felix (a Roman ship dated to II century A.

The sol–gel matrix was produced from an inorganic precursor, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), a hybrid precursor organically functionalized with CfC groups, 3 -metacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS), and an organic bi-functional monomer, ethyleneglycol-dimethacrylate (EGDMA) used to increase the cross-linking network. Silica nanoparticles, on the other side, increase the density and provide a major mechanical performance through the reinforcement of the coating.

40|$|Colloidal silica {{particles}} {{have found}} {{a wide variety of}} applications including uses in chemical analysis, catalyst, sensor and bio-medicinal fields. Current industrial production of silica, however,relies on high temperatures or harsh conditions. Bioinspired synthesis routes provide a way to circumvent these issues as well as possibly enhancing the control of particle formation beyond what is currently possible with commercial methods. Previous work has demonstrated monodisperse "PEIsilica" particles can be synthesized from non-toxic hydrolysed trimethoxymethylsilane (TMOMS) and the biomimetic catalyst polyethyleneimine (PEI) through a <b>polymerisation</b> <b>condensation</b> proceeding at room temperature. In this work the role of mixing (through magnetic stirring and sonication during the reaction period) on final particle size and morphology was investigated. No mixing reactions, mixing by sonication and mixing by magnetic stirring were chosen as the three preparation modes. The results of the no mixing reactions showed that the particle polydispersity as well as their average size was sensitive to the location of precursor injection. Mixing by sonication broadened the particle size distribution compared to no mixing reactions. Finally, in the magnetic stirring experiments, the rate of stirring could increase or decrease the final particle size, depending on the concentration of PEI. Overall, determining the relationship between the desired characteristics of the particles and the reaction mixing conditions is extremely beneficial for the optimisation of the particle synthesis process, especially when considering silica particle applications that require control of specific interactions, such as in mineral separation, catalysis and drug delivery...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current {{understanding}} of electrocoalescence of water droplets in oil, highlighting particularly the mechanisms proposed for droplet-droplet and droplet-interface coalescence {{under the influence}} of an applied electrostatic field, as well as various factors influencing the electrocoalescence phenomenon. Generally, the coalescence behaviour can be described in three stages: droplets approaching each other, the process of film thinning/drainage, and film rupture leading to droplet-droplet coalescence. Other possible mechanisms, such as droplet chain formation, dipole-dipole coalescence, electrophoresis, dielectrophoresis and random collisions, are also presented. Experimental work and mathematical modelling of the coalescence process are both reviewed, including various models, such as molecular dynamic simulation, random collision/coalescence modelling, and linear <b>condensation</b> <b>polymerisation</b> kinetics. The type of electric field, such as alternating, direct and pulsed direct current, plays a significant role, depending on the design and set-up of the system. The concept of an optimum frequency is also discussed here, relating to the electrode design and coating. Other factors, such as the average droplet size and the residence time of the liquid mixture exposed to the electric field, are highlighted relating to coalescence efficiency. The characteristics of the emulsion system itself determine the practicality of employing a high electric field to break the emulsion. Emulsions with high aqueous phase content tend to short-circuit the electrodes and collapse the electric field. Type and concentration of surface-active components have been shown to impart stability and rheological property changes to the interfacial film, thus making the coalescence mechanism more complicated. More investigations, both experimental and by computer simulation, should be carried out to study the electrocoalescence phenomenon and to contribute to the design and operation of new electrocoalescers...|$|E
40|$|A new {{route to}} the AB(_ 2) monomer {{dimethyl}} 5 -(2 -hydroxyethoxy) isophthalate and its subsequent polymerisation is reported. Hyperbranched polyesters were prepared by melt <b>condensation</b> <b>polymerisation</b> of the AB(_ 2) monomer and also by copolymerisation with suitable core molecules. Unusual molecular weight growth characteristics were demonstrated. The {{number average molecular weight}} (Mn) reached a plateau value after relatively short polymerisation time, whereas the weight average molecular weight (M(_n)) continued to increase. This limit to the attainable number average molecular weight is thought to be a consequence of intramolecular cyclisation reactions, evidence of which was provided by MALDI-TOF MS. The weight average molecular weight continues to increase after complete cyclisation and it is postulated that this is due to a redistribution of polymer chains by ester interchange reactions. The plausibility of the occurrence of ester exchange processes was demonstrated by the successful incorporation of a dimethyl isophthalate core molecule into a fully cyclised hyperbranched polyester. The amount of branching in the hyperbranched polyesters was in agreement with the theoretical value for a statistical distribution at high conversion, as determined by quantitative (^ 13) C NMR spectroscopy. The solution properties of the hyperbranched polyesters were studied and revealed these materials to be soluble in common organic solvents. Solutions of the hyperbranched polyesters had characteristically low intrinsic viscosities ([n]) and Mark-Houwink plots showed a linear relationship between log M(_w) and log[n]. The thermal properties of the hyperbranched polyesters were examined by differential scanning calorimetry, which showed the polymers to be amorphous materials exhibiting a glass transition temperature (T(_g)) but no melting point. The T(_g) varied with molecular weight, was proportional to 1 /M(_w) and reached a limiting value of 86 ºC at high conversion...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{freeze-thaw}} indicators {{have become}} attractive in the food, pharmaceutical and medical {{industries in the}} monitoring of the quality and safety of perishable products, during cold-chain storage and distribution. Freeze-thaw indicators are capable of providing a clearly visible change if the product has {{been exposed to the}} freezing temperatures. The irreversible change would indicate that the product had suffered a form of thermal abuse, making it unsafe for consumption use and requiring removal from the market. This project aimed to develop a freeze-thaw indicator using various technologies. Three possible options were evaluated for the preparation of freeze-thaw indicators. i) 	Hydrogels, such as starch-based hydrogels, sodium alginate-based compositions and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) -based compositions that were capable of providing syneresis upon freezing, could be used for the preparation of freeze-thaw indicators. The indicators gave a visible change through the staining of a paper caused by a water-soluble dye (Reactive Red 3) that was dissolved in the aqueous solution released from the hydrogels upon freezing; ii) 	Aqueous droplets entrapped in the polymeric films through solvent evaporation of water-in-polymer solutions [i. e. poly(vinyl acetate) and ethyl cellulose solutions or the UV radiation-induced polymerisation of water-in-acrylate-based monomer emulsions]. The aqueous droplets were designed to break the polymeric films to trigger a visible change upon freezing; iii) 	Microcapsules containing aqueous droplets were prepared by either the interfacial <b>condensation</b> <b>polymerisation</b> between 4, 4 ’–bis(chloromethyl) - 1, 1 ’-biphenyl and hexamethylenediamine or by UV radiation-induced polymerisation of acrylate-based monomer (OTA 480) in emulsion systems. The microcapsules and a piece of water-sensitive paper (coated with a hydrochromic dye, bromophenol blue) was sealed in a container for the freeze-thaw testing. The water-sensitive paper changed colour from yellow to blue in contact with the aqueous solution released from microcapsules upon freezing. In order to understand the feasibility of these options for the use in freeze-thaw indicators, freeze-thaw testing was carried out on the relevant hydrogels/compositions, polymeric films carrying aqueous droplets and microcapsules. The analysis showed that the polymer loading in the associated compositions and preparation conditions had an influence on the synersis of such compositions. The polymerisation process of films was monitored by FTIR and UV-Vis spectrophotometers. The formation of emulsions was studied using optical microscopy (ImageXpert evaluation). The morphology of the resulting polymeric films and microcapsules was characterised using scanning electron microscopy. ...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDmetal-containing complexes, that exhibit {{enhanced}} {{chemical and}} physical properties. This thesis describes {{the synthesis of}} new metal-containing linear polymers and dendritic molecules. Chapter 1 presents {{an overview of the}} field of metal-containing polymers, with particular attention to the synthesis of polymers via <b>condensation</b> <b>polymerisation.</b> This review includes the various types of metal-containing condensation polymers and the applications of these materials, where available. This discussion is followed by a brief summary of metal-containing dendrimers, which includes a concise description of their structure and applications in general. There are two routes to preparing metal-containing polymers. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of three bifunctional organometallic monomers, of the general type [M]-O-{ 2, 6 -(CH 2 OH) 2 - 4 -CH 3 -C 6 H 2 }, where [M] represents the various metal-containing moieties, (η 5 -C 5 H 5) (CO) 2 Fe(CH 2) 3 (25), (η 5 -C 5 H 4 -CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 -) Re(CO) 3 (26) and Fpdendr (27). These monomers were prepared using 2, 6 -bis(hydroxymethyl) -p-cresol as the key reagent. The monomers were used in classical polycondensation reactions with terephthaloyl chloride using ambient temperature solution techniques. This yielded new low molecular weight oligomeric polyesters, that were characterised using FTIR and 1 HNMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and sizeexclusion chromatography. In Chapter 3, an alternate route to metal-containing polymers is described. In this case, bifunctional organic monomers were polymerised to give preformed organic polymers. Two types of organic polymers were prepared, viz. polyesters (with pendant vinyl moieties) and polyimines (with α-diimine units along the polymer backbone). Functionalisation of these preformed organic polymers with various metal sources was attempted. Hydrozirconation reactions of the vinyl polyesters with Schwartz’s reagent, Cp 2 Zr(H) Cl, were attempted and were largely unsuccessful. Competing reactions with the ester functionality prevailed, preventing the desired reaction. Reaction of the polyimines with PdCl 2 (COD) yielded insoluble, intractable metal-containing oligomers. Partial characterisation of the complexes is described. The synthesis of new poly(propylene imine) iminopyridyl metallodendrimers is described in Chapter 4. Schiff-base condensation reaction of the commercially available DAB dendrimers with 2 -pyridinecarboxaldehyde, gave the dendrimers 51, 52, and 53, with four, eight and sixteen pyridylimine functionalities respectively on the periphery. Successful complexation reactions with PdCl 2 (COD), PtCl 2 (COD) and CuCl 2 produced the corresponding metal-containing dendrimers, with either PdCl 2 (54, 55, 56), PtCl 2 (57) or CuCl 2 (58) moieties bound on the periphery. The metallodendrimers were insoluble in the more common organic solvents, and were characterised by IR and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy and microanalysis where possible. Dendrimers with salicylaldiminato ligands on the periphery were prepared by reacting the DAB dendrimers with salicylaldehyde. These ligands were reacted with various metal acetates in an attempt to prepare new metalcontaining salicylaldimine dendrimers. This work yielded either paramagnetic metal complexes or insoluble, intractable compounds. Chapter 5 describes the applications of the catalyst precursors (54, 55, 56, 57, 58), discussed in Chapter 4, in the polymerisation of ethylene and the use of complexes 54 and 55 as Heck cross-coupling catalyst precursors. The complexes all showed catalytic activity toward ethylene polymerisation. A discussion of their activity, the polyethylene molecular weight and microstructure is presented in this chapter. The precursors 54 and 55 are also effective catalysts in the Heck reactions, coupling iodobenzene with methyl acrylate, styrene and 1 -octene in high conversions. South Afric...|$|E
40|$|Future energy supplies, as {{a result}} of {{governmental}} policy and environmental legislation, will increasingly be borne from renewable sources. Use of biomass to provide fuels and chemicals to replace those derived from coal and oil will be crucial in providing diverse, sustainable and secure supplies for years to come. Production of the full range of solid, liquid and gaseous fuels from biomass to replace those from non-renewable sources is achievable, but not in the quantities currently consumed at present, hence demand will increase with an ever-expanding world population, coupled with competing markets for food production. Biomass used as fuel has environmental benefits, with CO 2 emissions being reduced, however, because biomass energy density is much lower than coal or oil, more prone to microbial degradation and because many biomass sources have high water content, transportation is much more expensive, therefore energy densification techniques are required to overcome these hurdles. Various thermal technologies exist to upgrade biomass to fuels; these include gasification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal processing and torrefaction. Hydrothermal processing (HTP) is an environmentally benign method of energy densification and can be used to produce directly liquid and solid fuels and indirectly gaseous fuels. The reactions are carried out in hot, compressed water in temperatures of 160 – 400 °C for reaction times ranging from seconds to days. Benefits of HTP reactions include high energy density liquid and solid fuels, low gaseous emissions and high product yields are also claimed. For oil production, homogeneous alkali catalysts have been used with high returns with equally high temperatures. Biological components of energy crops biomass comprise largely of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, with differing ratios and types between plant species. Taking each individual lignocellulosic component and reacting in isolation presents expected data from each when reacting as a whole, allowing comparisons to be drawn with ‘raw’ biomass, Miscanthus and willow in this study. Oil formation under HTL conditions with alkali catalyst was deemed to be the best fuel product, but yields were lower than expected and the catalyst concentration was brought into question. Another surprising development was the formation of oil from lignin under these conditions, though the process of lignin removal may account for this phenomenon. LC-MS analysis of HTL derived aqueous phase lignin indicated the presence of high molecular weight polymers, heteroatomic and substituted polyaromatic compounds, with λmax outside the rage of 190 – 400 nm scanned and notable by their absence. Results from the factorial study in Chapter 5 showed that of all the reaction conditions tested (temperature, reaction time and catalyst) the greatest effect on all lignocellulosic compounds was temperature. Though it was expected that cellulose and xylan would behave in a similar manner due to the likeness of their polymeric composition, {{this was not the case}} for many responses compared. At the conditions in this study, lignin was found to be the least affected by any of the variables. Overall, the use of catalyst, though beneficial for increasing the calorific content and yield of cellulose oil, had a detrimental effect on the other components. KOH catalyst reduced aqueous phase acidity through formation of buffers, but post calculation, xylan was found to have produced more acidic species. Biomass energy crops Miscanthus and willow were reacted in Chapter 6. Evident from this data are similarities with individual biomass components found earlier. Hemicellulose content of Miscanthus was the reason for greater solubility, though with increasing reaction times, rate limiting <b>condensation</b> <b>polymerisation</b> reaction took place to increase char yields. The most energy efficient hydrothermal conversion method was HTC, with catalyst use only beneficial for oil production. Analysis of chars by AES indicated lower alkali metals concentrations than raw analysis (K, Na, Mg, Ca). Aqueous phases contained high concentrations of these leached metals. Implications are reduction of inorganic matter improves fuel quality and less likelihood of combustion boiler problems. The final part of the study was comparison of HTC and torrefaction. Information from literature sources and pilot plant produced torrefied materials were compared and contrasted. Drying biomass is the largest processing requirement for this process. Suitability of feedstock is largely dependent therefore on water content. Similarities are evident between products and energy yields, but torrefaction is much closer to commercial realisation due to technological advancements needed for large scale HTP systems...|$|E
