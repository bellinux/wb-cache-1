A modern RFID transponder system consists of several analog blocks, a digital section, and possibly sensors.

Ultraviolet or broadband Infrared absorption, and Photothermal Deflection prevent the speciesconversion, time delay, and adsorption problems associated with traditional sampling systems, but often use expensive, bulky or delicate radiation sources that are not suitable for commercialisation. In gas detection, <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is one of the constraints since the air consists of a variety of gases. A few techniques were introduced such as using gas separation techniques or ratio calculation to overcome the problem. For ammonia gas sensing, {{it has been reported that}} the <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with humidity is the main problem and this occurs in certain wavelength ranges. This is a strong indication that <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for ammonia emission monitoring must be modelled. Choosing suitable wavelength of ammonia with minimal <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> effect can reduce the effect of <b>cross</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at infrared region. In this numerical prediction analysis, the optical transmission of ammonia was obtained through a model developed using a commercial simulator SpectralCalc-GATS, OptiSystem and Matlab.

System functionality of the force sensor should comply with many reliability aspects peculiar to aerospace industry rather than just sensing the applied force.

Furthermore this work presents the practical circumstances faced during fabricating and testing.
