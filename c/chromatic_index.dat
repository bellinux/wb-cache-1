40|$|This diploma thesis {{discusses}} graph colouring games, as {{introduced by}} Bodlaender [3], {{in a more}} general setting. The main results are: The directed and undirected game <b>chromatic</b> <b>indices</b> {{of the class of}} forests of maximum degree D are D+ 1, for D= 3, D= 5, and D> 5. The directed game <b>chromatic</b> <b>indices</b> of the class of forests of maximum degree 2 are 2 or 3, depending on whether passing is allowed for Alice in the underlying game. The method of decomposition of independent subtrees is extended from edge colouring games to node colouring games and leads to new proofs resp. new results concerning the undirected resp. directed (new) game chromatic numbers of the class of forests. These numbers are 4 (3) resp. 3 (3). The results mentioned so far are also true for infinite instead of finite graphs. Some general properties of graph colouring games are examined.

40|$|Summary: The {{impact of}} cluster {{heterogeneity}} on mechanical properties, <b>chromatic</b> <b>indices</b> and chemical composition of Italia table grape berries sorted by flotation was evaluated in this study. The density sorting at commercial harvest permitted to get berries of different ripeness and relatively different quality attributes. Individually, some grape chromatic characteristics, physical characteristics (weight {{of the whole}} berry and berry skin), content and composition of reducing sugars, organic acids and phenolic compounds (flavanols of low molecular mass in berry skins) permitted to characterise and to differentiate berries belonging to different density classes. However, the tested mechanical properties were {{not related to the}} berry density. When the variables that significantly contributed to the berry differentiation were globally assessed, the chemical parameters related to sugars (142. 3 - 164. 4 g kg- 1), content of skin oligomeric flavanols [46. 3 - 137 mg (+) -catechin kg- 1], berry skin weight (379 - 607 mg), yellow/blue colour component (26. 31 - 29. 96) and chroma (26. 40 - 30. 06) were the more representative...|$|R

Wine colour depends on complex extraction and polymerization reactions'; therefore it could evolve over time. This study is based on few samples of Pinot Noir wines, that achieve both good quality levels and a strong market performance, Mavrud, an ancient variety from Thrace, and Rubin, a Syrah and Nebbiolo crossbreed. The selected wines differ for their anthocyanic profile and polyphenolic content. Furthermore, the quality of the selected national varieties is comparable to the most famous international ones. A comparison was made based on chemical and organoleptic characteristics as well as their performance on the market. The <b>chromatic</b> <b>indices,</b> intensity and hue, the anthocyanic profile and their evolution in time, were determined via the polymerization indices.

40|$|We {{consider}} constrained proper edge colorings of {{the following}} type: Given a positive integer j and a family F of connected graphs on 3 or more vertices, we require that the subgraph formed by the union of any j color classes has no copy of any member of F. This generalizes some well-known types of colorings such as acyclic edge colorings, distance- 2 edge colorings, low treewidth edge colorings, etc. For such a generalization of restricted colorings, we obtain an upper bound of O(dmax(θ, 1)) on the minimum number of colors sufficient for such a coloring. Here, d refers to the maximum degree of the graph and θ is a parameter defined by θ = θ(j,F) = maxH∈F (|V (H) |− 2) (|E(H) |−j). Our proof is based on probabilistic arguments. In particular, we obtain O(d) upper bounds for proper edge colorings with various interesting restrictions placed on the union of color classes. For example, we obtain O(d) upper bounds on edge colorings with restrictions such as (i) the union of any 3 color classes should be an outerplanar graph, (ii) the union of any 4 color classes should have treewidth at most 2, (iii) the union of any 5 color classes should be planar, (iv) the union of any 16 color classes should be 5 -degenerate, etc. We also consider generalizations where we require simultaneously for several pairs (ji,Fi) (i = 1, [...] ., s) that the union of any ji color classes has no copy of any member of Fi and obtain upper bounds on the corresponding <b>chromatic</b> <b>indices.</b> As a corollary, we obtain {{that each of the}} four restrictions above can be satisfied simultaneously using O(d) colors.

The aim {{of this paper was}} to study the influence of the chromatic adaptation {{in the context of the}} development of the color diversity index, a new index capable of predicting illuminant-induced variations in several types of images. The spectral reflectance obtained from hyperspectral images of natural, indoor and artistic paintings, and the spectral reflectance of 1264 Munsell surfaces were converted into the CIELAB color space for each of the 55 CIE illuminants and 5 light sources tested. The influence of the CAT 02 chromatic adaptation was estimated for each illuminant and for each scene. The CIELAB volume was estimated by the convex hull method and the number of discernible colors was estimated by segmenting the CIELAB color volume into unitary cubes and by counting the number of non-empty cubes. High correlation was found between the CIELAB volume occupied by the Munsell surfaces and the number of discernible colors and the CILEAB color volume of the colors in all images analyzed. The effects of the chromatic adaptation were marginal and did not change the overall result.

In this work we studied, computationally, the chromatic effects of a large set of illuminants with almost arbitrary spectral structure. The illuminants were metamers of a Planckian radiator with colour temperature of 6500 K and metamers of non-Planckian radiators with chromaticity coordinates uniformly distributed over the same isotemperature line. The metamers were generated by the Schmitt’s elements approach and were parameterized by the spectral distance to the equi-energy illuminant E. The colour rendering properties of each illuminant were quantified by the CIE colour rendering index (CRI), by a <b>chromatic</b> diversity <b>index</b> (CDI) and by the number of discernible colours estimated for a set of indoor scenes digitized by hyperspectral imaging. It was found that CRI decreases as the spectral structure of the illuminant increase and that larger values of CDI could only be obtained with illuminants with a small number of non-zero spectral bands, that is, with highly structured spectra. In conclusion, highly structured illuminants produce larger chromatic diversity than more uniform spectrum and may therefore be best for applications where maximization of chromatic diversity is important.
