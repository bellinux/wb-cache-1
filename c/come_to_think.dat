Despite Kassandra's warnings, the city experiences an earthquake sent by Poseidon, killing the three young sons of Helen and Paris. After Patroklus is killed by Hector, his closest friend Akhilles again joins the fight to get his revenge. Hector {{and his younger brother}} Troilus are killed, to the grief of everyone in Troy. Akhilles kills Penthesilea in battle, and soon after Kassandra fires a fatally poisoned arrow at his unprotected heel.|$|E

25|$|Today, the Ten Commandments {{are heard}} in the synagogue three times a year: as they come up during the {{readings}} of Exodus and Deuteronomy, and during the festival of Shavuot. The Exodus version is read in parashat Yitro around late January–February, and on the festival of Shavuot, and the Deuteronomy version in parashat Va'etchanan in August–September. In some traditions, worshipers rise for {{the reading of the}} Ten Commandments to highlight their special significance though many rabbis, including Maimonides, have opposed this custom since one may <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the Ten Commandments are more important {{than the rest of the}} Mitzvot.|$|E

500|$|Grant married Dyan Cannon on July 22, 1965, at friend Howard Hughes' Desert Inn in Las Vegas. Their daughter, Jennifer, {{was born}} on February 26, 1966. Jennifer is Grant's only child. He {{frequently}} called Jennifer his [...] "best production". He said of fatherhood: [...] "My life changed the day Jennifer was born. I've <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the reason we're put on this earth is to procreate. To leave something behind. Not films, because you know that I don't think my films will last very long once I'm gone. But another human being. That's what's important." [...] Grant and Cannon divorced in March 1968. On March 12 that month {{he was involved in}} a car accident on Long Island when a truck struck the side of his limousine. Grant was hospitalized for 17 days with three broken ribs and bruising.|$|E
500|$|The Parliamentary {{leader of}} the {{opposition}} Labour party, Harold Wilson, attacked the new Prime Minister as [...] "an elegant anachronism". He asserted that nobody from Douglas-Home's background knew of the problems of ordinary families. In particular, Wilson demanded to know how [...] "a scion of an effete establishment" [...] could lead the technological revolution that Wilson held to be necessary: [...] "This is the counter-revolution... After half a century of democratic advance, of social revolution, the whole process has ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl!" [...] Douglas-Home pooh-poohed this as inverted snobbery, and observed, [...] "I suppose Mr Wilson, when you <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, is the fourteenth Mr Wilson." [...] He called Wilson [...] "this slick salesman of synthetic science" [...] and the Labour party [...] "the only relic of class consciousness in the country". The opposition retreated, with a statement in the press that [...] "The Labour Party is not interested {{in the fact that the}} new Prime Minister inherited a fourteenth Earldom– he cannot help his antecedents any more than the rest of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Bo's {{first wife}} was Li Danyu, the {{daughter}} of former Beijing Party First Secretary Li Xuefeng. They wed in September 1976 and had a son, [...] "Brendan" [...] Li Wangzhi (李望知), the following year. Their son graduated from Columbia University in 2001. Li Danyu insisted that her son change his surname to Li following her divorce from Bo Xilai in 1984. Li Wangzhi was reportedly low-key and modest and was not commonly associated with his father during the latter's political heyday. Li Wangzhi obtained a master's degree in media studies and worked {{for a few years}} at Citibank, then worked for a law firm in Beijing; he eventually went into private equity. Li had remarked publicly that his father's arrest [...] "destroyed his life". In 2014, Li released a statement on his microblog feed revealing that his father was doing well in prison and that medical treatment is available to him should he need it. Li wrote, [...] "life is short... if the law allows, I would like to see him more. <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, the only times I've seen him [...] was at funerals, in the courtroom, or in prison." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that she resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or}} another by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E

Critics claimed that Samsung knocked out smaller businesses, limiting choices for South Korean consumers, and sometimes colluded with fellow giants to fix prices while bullying those who investigate. Lee Jung-hee, a South Korean presidential candidate, said in a debate, [...] "Samsung has the government in its hands. Samsung manages the legal world, the press, the academics and bureaucracy".|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, Maxime Rodinson, a {{distinguished}} Marxist scholar of Islam, responded to French avant-garde enthusiasm for Khomeini's revolution in a three part article in Le Monde, by arguing that, {{in response to}} successive assaults by Crusaders, Mongols, Turks and Western imperialism, [...] Islamic countries had come to feel embattled, and the impoverished masses had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of their elites, linked to foreigners, as devoid of traditional piety. Both nationalism and socialism imported from the West were recast in religious terms, {{in a process of}} political Islamicization which would be devoid of the progressive side of nationalism and revert to what he called [...] "a type of archaic fascism" [...] characterized by policing the state to enforce a totalitarian moral and social order.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1993, Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{linguistics}} {{professor and}} political commentator Noam Chomsky praised the film {{because of the}} way people were portrayed doing the real work of unions.

After the third take, Ozu {{approved}} it… The reason [...] circles around the room once is that she’s nostalgic for all the memories there and she also wants to make sure she’s left nothing behind. He didn’t show each of these things explicitly, but through my smoothly circling the room—through how I moved, through the pacing and the blocking—I think that’s {{what he was trying to}} express. At the time, I didn’t understand. I remember I did it rhythmically: I didn’t walk and I didn’t run; I just moved lightly and rhythmically. As I continued doing it, that’s what it turned into, and Ozu okayed it. <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, it was that way of walking rhythmically that I think was good.

2500|$|He got on with critics {{personally}} {{as long as}} they praised his work. The Sydney Morning Herald drama critic H. G. Kippax was {{an early}} champion, being one of the few critics who wrote favourably of The Ham Funeral. Of its 1961 Adelaide premiere, he wrote that the play brilliantly suggests {{a way out of the}} impasse in which the Australian drama finds itself. After the 1962 Sydney premiere, he wrote: I am not going to mince words or hedge against the future. I believe the professional performance of The Ham Funeral at the Palace... is an epoch-making event. However, he and White fell out over more negative critiques of some later White plays. David Marr writes that Kippax [...] "had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> all White's later plays were trash". For his part, White now regarded Kippax as a [...] "deadhead". They also had diametrically opposing views of the plays of Louis Nowra: what Kippax loved in Nowra, White was sure to hate and vice versa.|$|E
