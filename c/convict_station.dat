6000|$|Yet this ignoble {{war between}} barbarous tribes whom {{it has long}} been the fashion to pet, this poor scuffle between the breechloader and the Birmingham trade musket, may yet in one sense do good. It must perforce draw public {{attention}} to the West Coast of Africa, and raise the question, [...] "What shall we do with it?" [...] My humble opinion, expressed early in 1865 to the Right Honourable Mr. Adderley, has ever been this. If we are determined not to follow the example of the French, the Dutch, the Portuguese, and the Spaniards, and not to use the country as a <b>convict</b> <b>station,</b> resolving to consume, as it were, our crime at home, we should also resolve to retain only a few ports and forts, without territory, at points commanding commerce, after the fashion of the Lusitanians in the old heroic days. The export slave-trade is now dead and buried; the want of demand must prevent its revival; and free emigration has yet to be created. As Mr. Bright rightly teaches, strong places and garrisons are not necessary to foster trade and to promote the success of missions. The best proof on the West African Coast {{is to be found in}} the so-called Oil Rivers, where we have never held a mile of ground, and where our commerce prospers most. The great [...] "Tribune" [...] will forgive my agreeing in opinion with him when he finds that we differ upon one most important point. It is the merchant, not the garrison, that causes African wars. If the home authorities would avoid a campaign, let them commit their difficulty to a soldier, not to a civilian.|$|E
6000|$|Lopes de Lima (vol. iii. part ii.) gives São Paulo in 1846 a {{total of}} 5,065 whites, mulattoes, and blacks, {{distributed}} into 1,176 hearths; the census of 1850-51 raised the number to 12,000, including 7,000 negroes, of whom 5,000 were serviles; in 1863 the figure was understood to have diminished rather than to have increased. Old authors divided the population into five orders. The first was of ecclesiastics, the second contained those who were settled for command or trade, and the third were convicts, especially new Christians of Jewish blood, who were prevented from attending the sacred functions for a scandalous reason. Then ranked the Pomberos, or Pombeiros, mostly mulattoes, free men, and buyers of slaves; their morals {{seem to have been}} abominable. Last and least were the natives, that is, the [...] "chattels." [...] Amongst the latter the men changed wives for a time, [...] "alleging, in case of reproof, that they are not able to eat always of the same dish;" [...] and the women were rarely allowed by their mistresses to marry--with the usual results. The missionaries are very severe upon the higher ranks of colonists. Father Carli (A.D. 1666) found the whites the most deceitful and the wickedest of men,--an effect caused by the penal settlement. Father Merolla (A.D. 1682) declares that [...] "the women, being bred among blacks, suffer themselves to be much perverted--they scarcely retain anything white about them except their skins." [...] J. C. Fêo Cardoso (Memoir published in Paris in 1825) attributes the decadence of Angola and Benguela to three reasons; rare marriages amongst the higher orders; poverty amongst the lower; and the immorality and incontinence of both. Lopes de Lima (p. 149 loc. cit.) traces the decline and fall of Christianity in the eighteenth century to the want of priests, to the corruption of the regular clergy (Carmelites and Franciscans), for whom West Africa, like Syria and Palestine, was made a kind of <b>convict</b> <b>station,</b> and to the inhuman slave-export, as opposed to domestic slavery. All has now changed for the better; society in Angola is not a whit inferior to that of any English colony in West Africa, and, as a convict establishment, Loanda is a great success.|$|E

They slept on bare boards with a blanket apiece, 10 men to a box or cell. One of the two official floggers was later found murdered The stockade used to be accessible by a stile, but this has been taken down to discourage use of the once daunting intersection of the Highway with Towrang Road. There are the remains of the powder magazine next to the Wollondilly River, three graves on the north bank of Towrang Creek, and the remains of a weir on Towrang Creek built for the stockade. Aboriginal stone tools have also been found on the banks of Towrang Creek, indicating that this was a route well-travelled long before Hamilton Hume came this way in 1824.|$|R
50|$|Most convicts in Western Australia spent {{very little}} time in prison. Those who were {{stationed}} at Fremantle were housed in the Convict Establishment, the colony's convict prison, and misbehaviour was punished by stints there. The majority of <b>convicts,</b> however, were <b>stationed</b> {{in other parts of}} the colony. Although there was no convict assignment in Western Australia, there was a great demand for public infrastructure throughout the colony, so that many <b>convicts</b> were <b>stationed</b> in remote areas. Initially, most convicts were set to work creating infrastructure for the convict system, including the construction of the Convict Establishment itself. Later, they were set to work on other public works, especially roads. In Perth, for example, convicts built the Perth Gaol between 1854 and 1856, and some were then housed there to provide labour for capital works in the city and surrounds. The Perth Town Hall and Government House and the Canning River Convict Fence are several of the notable landmarks built by convicts.|$|R
