5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In <b>colubrids,</b> the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the rostral scale.|$|E
5|$|In certain regions, {{presence}} or absence of certain scales may be a quick way to distinguish non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the {{presence or}} absence of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless <b>Colubrids</b> and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Because the {{majority}} of <b>colubrid</b> species are considered harmless to human beings, <b>colubrid</b> snakebites are rarely reported. However, the venom of Rhabdophis, {{which is part of}} the Colubridae family, is procoagulant and leads to severe coagulopathy. Here, we present a case of disseminated intravascular coagulation with enhanced fibrinolysis following a Rhabdophis bite. Although coagulopathy can be treated effectively with the specific Rhabdophis antivenom, this antivenom is not widely available in Indonesia. We also found transient hypertension secondary to the <b>colubrid</b> venom, an unusual finding...|$|R

25|$|Opisthoglyphous <b>colubrids</b> have enlarged, grooved teeth {{situated}} at the posterior extremity of the maxilla, where a small posterior portion of the upper labial or salivary gland produces venom.|$|E
25|$|Most snakebites {{are caused}} by non-venomous snakes. Of the roughly 3,000 known species of snake found worldwide, only 15% are {{considered}} dangerous to humans. Snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica. The most diverse and widely distributed snake family, the <b>colubrids,</b> has approximately 700 venomous species, but only five genera—boomslangs, twig snakes, keelback snakes, green snakes, and slender snakes—have caused human fatalities.|$|E

25|$|In Northern Australia, {{sea snakes}} are common and {{occasionally}} inflict bites, although far less frequently than terrestrial snakes. Several venomous <b>colubrids</b> exist in Australia as well, {{such as the}} brown tree snake, although they have geographically limited distributions and only very rarely deliver a medically significant bite. In Tasmania and Kangaroo Island, which have a cooler, moister habitat than mainland Australia, the tiger snakes and copperhead snakes inflict the majority of bites. The brown snakes are not present on these islands.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} venomous <b>colubrids</b> in Africa, {{although}} of these only two arboreal genera, the boomslang and the twig snakes, {{are likely to}} inflict life-threatening bites. Of the Atractaspididae, Atractaspis is the species involved {{in the majority of}} bites. Since these snakes are nocturnal and fossorial, living in burrows underground, bites remain rare, peaking at 1 to 3% in certain areas of the Sudanian savanna. However, there is no antivenom or other effective therapy for Atractaspis envenomation, and the case fatality rate remains approximately 10%, with death typically occurring quickly.|$|E
25|$|The fangs, {{which are}} {{enlarged}} and hollow, {{are the first}} two teeth on each maxillary bone. Usually only one fang is in place on each side at any time. The maxilla is intermediate in both length and mobility between typical <b>colubrids</b> (long, less mobile) and viperids (very short, highly mobile). When the mouth is closed, the fangs fit into grooved slots in the buccal floor and usually below {{the front edge of}} the eye and are angled backwards; some elapids (Acanthophis, taipan, mamba, and king cobra) have long fangs on quite mobile maxillae and can make fast strikes.|$|E

25|$|The head of {{the queen}} snake is narrow and has nine large plate-like scales on the top, and the chin has several rows of thicker scales. This is a {{protective}} adaptation, for the snake's feeding habit of chasing its prey under rocks. The pupil of the eye is round, a feature shared with most other <b>colubrids.</b> There are 19 rows of keeled dorsal scales at midbody, and the anal plate is divided. The sexes are often difficult to distinguish based on external characteristics. Male queen snakes have relatively longer tails than females. Males have from 65 to 89 subcaudal scutes (average 76), with the tail from 23% to 34% of the snake's total length. Females have 54 to 87 subcaudals (average 69), with tails equal to 19% to 27% of total length.|$|E
2500|$|The two infraorders of Serpentes are: Alethinophidia and Scolecophidia. This {{separation}} {{is based on}} morphological characteristics and mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity. Alethinophidia is sometimes split into Henophidia and Caenophidia, with the latter consisting of [...] "colubroid" [...] snakes (<b>colubrids,</b> vipers, elapids, hydrophiids, and atractaspids) and acrochordids, while the other alethinophidian families comprise Henophidia. While not extant today, the Madtsoiidae, a family of giant, primitive, python-like snakes, was around until 50,000 years ago in Australia, represented by genera such as Wonambi.|$|E
2500|$|Most often {{employed}} by colubroid snakes (<b>colubrids,</b> elapids, and vipers) when the snake must move {{in an environment}} that lacks irregularities to push against (rendering lateral undulation impossible), such as a slick mud flat, or a sand dune, sidewinding is a modified form of lateral undulation in which all of the body segments oriented in one direction remain in contact with the ground, while the other segments are lifted up, resulting in a peculiar [...] "rolling" [...] motion. This mode of locomotion overcomes the slippery nature of sand or mud by pushing off with only static portions on the body, thereby minimizing slipping. The static nature of the contact points can be shown from the tracks of a sidewinding snake, which show each belly scale imprint, without any smearing. This mode of locomotion has very low caloric cost, less than ⅓ of the cost for a lizard to move the same distance. Contrary to popular belief, {{there is no evidence that}} sidewinding is associated with the sand being hot.|$|E
