After Vajpayee’s visit to China in 2003, both countries agreed to resume trade through Nathu La. The significance of this step lay in China’s implicit recognition of Sikkim’s merger with India- a fact that Beijing had consistently refused to accept earlier. On 23 June 2003, Vajpayee and Wen Jiabao signed the declaration of principles for relations and comprehensive cooperation between the China and India (Xinhua 2003) including the memorandum on expanding border trade that provided for the formal reopening of Nathu La as a border trade pass between Indian and China.

40|$|Empirical {{research}} suggests that the existence of territorial disputes makes armed conflict more likely to occur. Yet, there are many states that have engaged in militarized interstate disputes that not only maintain normalized bilateral relations, but cooperate with one another on an increasing number of bilateral issues. How can disputing states like Argentina and the UK so frequently cooperate with each other on bilateral issues when there remains a significant amount of tension regarding their territorial dispute over the Falklands/Malvinas Islands? Our theory suggests that challengers involved in territorial disputes are willing to engagein bilateral cooperation with their adversaries in order to influence upcoming territorial settlement attempts. Bilateral cooperation is purposively and strategically used by the challengers as a form of <b>confidence</b> <b>building</b> <b>measure</b> (CBM) with the goal of reducing the negative impact of the territorial dispute. Empirical analyses of monthly data (1978 â€” 2003) on Argentinaâ€”UK relations, as well as qualitative evidence from the case, support our theoretical expectations by showing that challengers deliberately link cooperation on bilateral issues to territorial dispute settlement attempts as a form of bargaining incentive to increase the likelihood of peaceful resolution.

50|$|As {{the first}} step for demarcating Indo-Nepal border, survey teams from both {{countries}} located and identified missing pillars along the border, and, an agreement was reached to construct new pillars in some places. According to the Nepalese government estimates, of the 8000 boundary pillars along the border, 1,240 pillars are missing, 2,500 require restoration, and, 400 more need to be constructed. The survey teams conducted survey of the border pillars based on the strip maps prepared by the Joint Technical Level Nepal-India Boundary Committee (JTLNIBC). The JTLNIBC {{was set up in}} 1981 to demarcate the India-Nepal border and after years of surveying, deliberations and extensions, the Committee had delineated 98 per cent of the India-Nepal boundary, excluding Kalapani and Susta, on 182 strip maps which was finally submitted in 2007 for ratification by both the countries. Unfortunately neither country ratified the maps. Nepal maintained that it cannot ratify the maps without the resolution of outstanding boundary disputes, i.e. Kalapani and Susta. India, on the other hand, awaited Nepal’s ratification {{while at the same time}} urging it to endorse the maps as a <b>confidence</b> <b>building</b> <b>measure</b> for solving the Kalapani and Susta disputes.

40|$|The Pret a Voter {{election}} scheme provides high {{assurance of}} accuracy and secrecy, {{due to the}} high degree of transparency and auditability. However, the assurance arguments are subtle and involve some understanding of the role of cryptography. As a result, establishing public understanding and trust in such systems remains a challenge. It is essential that a voting system be not only trust-worthy but also widely trusted. In response to this concern, we propose to add a mechanism to Pr^et �a Voter to generate a conventional (i. e. human readable) paper audit trail that can be invoked should the outcome of the cryptographic count be called into question. It is hoped that having such a familiar mechanism as a safety net will encourage public confidence. Care has to be taken to ensure that the mechanism does not undermine the carefully crafted integrity and privacy assurances of the original scheme. We show that, besides providing a <b>confidence</b> <b>building</b> <b>measure,</b> this mechanism brings with it a number of interesting technical features: it allows extra audits of mechanisms that capture and process the votes to be performed.

The participants to the Treaty are European countries, the United States, and Canada and would have to be extended to include other than the present signatories if it were to be used in a worldwide SNM verification Cutoff role. The major nuclear powers with the exception of China are signatories to the Treaty and the inclusion of other member states will only be considered once entry into force has started. The technology and data sharing provisions of the Treaty have defined the airborne sensor performance specifications. Therefore, the Treaty allowed sensor technology may not be adequate for the purposes of monitoring an SNM Cutoff regime. New sensors and sensor performance levels to adequately monitor an SNM Cutoff regime may be proposed only after entry into force of the Treaty on Open Skies. The utility of an aerial inspection component to the monitoring strategy for an SNM Cutoff regime would best be evaluated with field trials using realistic scenarios. This would allow the testing of synergism among other components of an overall monitoring strategy and would lend insight into the appropriate sensor technology to be recommended for future implementation...|$|R
