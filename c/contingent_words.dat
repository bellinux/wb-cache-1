40|$|During {{monitoring}} of the discourse, the detection of the relevance of incoming lexical information could be critical for its incorporation to update mental representations in memory. Because, in these situations, the relevance for lexical information is defined by abstract rules that are maintained in memory, results critical to understand how an abstract level of knowledge maintained in mind mediates the detection of the lower-level semantic information. In the present study, we propose that neuronal oscillations participate in the detection of relevant lexical information, based on ‘kept in mind’ rules deriving from more abstract semantic information. We tested our hypothesis using an experimental paradigm that restricted the detection of relevance to inferences based on explicit information, thus controlling for ambiguities derived from implicit aspects. We used a categorization task, in which the semantic relevance was previously defined based on the congruency between a kept in mind category (abstract knowledge), and the lexical-semantic information presented. Our results show that during the detection of the relevant lexical information, phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations selectively increases in delta and theta frequency bands during the interval of semantic analysis. These increments were independent of the semantic category maintained in memory, had a temporal profile specific for each subject, and were mainly induced, as they {{had no effect on}} the evoked mean global field power. Also, recruitment of an increased number of pairs of electrodes was a robust observation during the detection of semantic <b>contingent</b> <b>words.</b> These results are consistent with the notion that the detection of relevant lexical information based on a particular semantic rule, could be mediated by increasing the global phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations, which may contribute to the recruitment of an extended number of cortical regions...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, event-related brain {{potential}} (ERP) {{studies of}} language processing have presented words {{at a fixed}} rate using rapid serial visual presentation. Recent studies suggest, however, that the processes engaged during sentence comprehension are <b>contingent</b> on <b>word</b> presentation rate. These findings underscore the importance of allowing participants to read at a natural pace. The present study employed simultaneous self-paced reading and ERP methodologies to examine behavioral and neural responses while participants read sentences containing pragmatic or morphosyntactic violations or no violations. ERP and self-paced reading results replicated previous findings. This novel combination of behavioral and ERP methodologies combines the high temporal resolution and direct neural measures offered by ERPs with the more natural reading environment and information about processing load provided by self-paced reading...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{examined}} eye movement guidance in Chinese reading. We embedded either a 2 -character word or a 4 -character {{word in the}} same sentence frame, and observed the eye movements of Chinese readers when they read these sentences. We found that when all saccades into the target words were considered that readers eyes tended to land near the beginning of the word. However, we also found that Chinese readers’ eyes landed at the center of words when they made only a single fixation on a word, and that they landed {{at the beginning of a}} word when they made more than one fixation on a word. However, simulations that we carried out suggest that these findings cannot be taken to unambiguously argue for word-based saccade targeting in Chinese reading. We discuss alternative accounts of eye guidance in Chinese reading and suggest that eye movement target planning for Chinese readers might involve a combination of character-based and word-based targeting <b>contingent</b> on <b>word</b> segmentation processes...|$|R

40|$|International audience: Stimulus {{repetition}} {{can produce}} neural response attenuation in stimulus-category selective networks within the occipito-temporal lobe. It is hypothesized that this neural suppression reflects the functional sharpening of local neuronal assemblies which boosts information processing efficiency. This neural suppression phenomenon has been mainly reported during conditions of conscious stimulus perception. The question remains whether frequent stimuli processed {{in the absence}} of conscious perception also induce repetition suppression in those specialized networks. Using rare intracranial EEG recordings in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) of human epileptic patients we investigated neural repetition suppression in conditions of conscious and unconscious visual processing of words. To this end, we used an orthogonal design manipulating respectively stimulus repetition (frequent vs. unique stimuli) and conscious perception (masked vs. unmasked stimuli). By measuring the temporal dynamics of high-frequency broadband gamma activity in VOTC and testing for main and interaction effects, we report that early processing of words in word-form selective networks exhibits a temporal cascade of modulations by stimulus repetition and masking: neuronal attenuation initially is observed in response to repeated words (irrespective of consciousness), that is followed by a second modulation <b>contingent</b> upon <b>word</b> reportability (irrespective of stimulus repetition). Later on (> 300 ms post-stimulus), a significant effect of conscious perception on the extent of repetition suppression was observed. The temporal dynamics of consciousness, the recognition memory processes and their interaction revealed in this study advance our understanding of their contributions to the neural mechanisms of word processing in VOTC...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} problem of pricing and hedging {{contingent}} claims in the multi-period, discrete time, discrete state case using {{the concept of a}} sufficiently attractive expected gain opportunity to a claim’s writer and buyer. Pricing results somewhat different from, but reminiscent of, the arbitrage pricing theorems of mathematical finance are obtained. We show that our analysis pro-vides tighter price bounds on the contingent claim in an incomplete market, which may converge to a unique price for a specific value of a risk aversion parameter imposed by the market while the hedging policies may be different for different sides of the same trade. The results are obtained in the simpler framework of stochastic linear programming in a multi-period setting, and have the appealing feature of being very simple to derive and to articulate even for the non-specialist.

[...] This regiment had remained confined to its barracks {{during the initial}} stages of the mid-July disturbances. With Paris becoming the scene of a general riot, Charles Eugene, Prince of Lambesc (Marshal of the Camp, Proprietor of the Royal Allemand-Dragoons), not trusting the regiment to obey his order, posted sixty dragoons to station themselves before its dépôt in the Chaussée d'Antin. The officers of the French Guards made ineffectual attempts to rally their men. The rebellious citizenry had now acquired a trained military <b>contingent.</b> As <b>word</b> of this spread, the commanders of the royal forces encamped on the Champ de Mars became doubtful of the dependability of even the foreign regiments. The future [...] "Citizen King", Louis-Philippe, duc d'Orléans, witnessed these events as a young officer and was of the opinion that the soldiers would have obeyed orders if put to the test. He also commented in retrospect that the officers of the French Guards had neglected their responsibilities in the period before the uprising, leaving the regiment too much to the control of its non-commissioned officers. However, the uncertain leadership of Besenval led to a virtual abdication of royal authority in central Paris. On the morning of 13 July the electors of Paris met and agreed to the recruitment of a [...] "bourgeois militia" [...] of 48,000 menfrom the sixty voting districts of Paris, to restore order.|$|R
50|$|The story {{takes place}} {{over a period}} of 24 hours. The game begins with Kais' first mission, an attempt to rescue the Ethereal Ko'vash from Governor Severus. He infiltrates Severus' prison-fortress, and escapes with Ko'vash intact. As the Orca dropship begins docking with the Tau Emissary class cruiser, it is {{attacked}} by an Imperial Battleship, and boarding pods are launched. Kais then fights a desperate battle against a force of Storm Troopers as they try to disable the cruiser's engines, and assassinate the Captain.After Kais fails to rescue the Captain, he and several teams of Fire-Warriors are launched, by boarding pod at the Imperial ship. There, he disables the ship's guns and nearly captures the ship's commander, Admiral Constantine. Kais is clubbed on the head by Captain Ardias, however, and is captured.Ardias brokers a truce between the Imperium and the Tau, and it is revealed that Governor Severus has been seduced by the Powers of Chaos, teleporting a <b>contingent</b> of <b>Word</b> Bearers Chaos Marines onto the ship. They capture the ship's remaining guns, in an attempt to restart the Imperium-Tau war, but are stopped by Kais' destruction of the guns. Ardias then sets the ship to self-destruct, and Kais escapes via a Dreadnought drop-pod.Landing {{in the midst of a}} ruined Imperial city, Kais fights his way to fellow Tau Fire-Warriors, and learns from Ardias that Severus plans to use an Imperial Titan held in the City. Kais destroys the Titan, enters Severus' fortress, and kills Severus and his daemonic master. The game ends with Ardias ordering that the planet should be destroyed to prevent the taint of Chaos from spreading.Many adversaries from the Warhammer 40,000 universe are encountered by the protagonist Kais, such as Chaos Dreadnoughts, Chaos Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Daemon princes, Obliterators, and an Imperial Valkyrie.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Subjects with {{albinism}} usually {{suffer from}} nystagmus and reduced visual acuity, which may impair reading performance. The contribution of nystagmus to decreased reading ability is not known. Low vision and nystagmus {{may have an}} additive effect. We aimed {{to address this question}} by motion compensation of the nystagmus in affected subjects and by simulating nystagmus in healthy controls. METHODS: Reading speed and eye movements were assessed in 9 subjects with nystagmus associated with albinism and in 12 healthy controls. We compared the reading ability with steady word presentation and with words presented on a gaze <b>contingent</b> display where <b>words</b> move in parallel to the nystagmus and thus correct for the nystagmus. As the control, healthy subjects were asked to read words and texts in steady reading conditions as well as text passages that moved in a pattern similar to nystagmus. RESULTS: Correcting nystagmus with a gaze contingent display neither improved nor reduced the reading speed for single words. Subjects with nystagmus and healthy participants achieved comparable reading speed when reading steady texts. However, movement of text in healthy controls caused a significantly reduced reading speed and more regressive saccades. CONCLUSIONS: Our results argue against nystagmus as the rate limiting factor for reading speed when words were presented in high enough magnification and support the notion that other sensory visual impairments associated with albinism (for example reduced visual acuity) might be the primary causes for reading impairment...|$|R
40|$|The social {{movement}} of Solidarity {{emerged as a}} revolt against the communist regime, {{which was based on}} the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. Many authors claim that although Solidarity did finally bring on the downfall of communist rule in Poland, its ideology was as totalitarian as the communist one. The "Reflection Thesis" states that the ideas of Solidarity reflected, as if in a distorting mirror, many features of the very ideology against which the movement stood. This reflection concerned mostly not the content or values of communist ideology, but its form or way of thinking about the world. It is said that Solidarity, just like the Communist Party, was based on indisputable ideological assumptions, had a tendency to see politics in black and white terms, and was incapable of compromise. Therefore, contrary to the common view, the Solidarity movement was not at all democratic, liberal and pro-Western, but was of a rather totalitarian, non-liberal nature, and, in fact, comprised an expression of a deep Sovietization of Polish society. The Reflection Thesis was firstly formulated by Jadwiga Staniszkis in her famous book Poland’s Self-Limiting Revolution in 1984, and afterwards developed and argued in her subsequent volumes. Similar claims may be found in works by other sociologists, e. g. Sergiusz Kowalski and Bronisław Świderski, as well as various publicists. In this book I try to challenge the Reflection Thesis. I argue that neither the content, nor form of Solidarity’s ideas was a reproduction of communist ideology. However, to satisfactorily prove this claim, an appropriate theory of discourse must be found and applied to appropriately selected empirical data. Here I refer to the theory of sign systems, developed by Yuri Lotman and Boris Uspensky, the most important representatives of the so-called Moscow-Tartu Group. With the help of theoretical devices provided by the semiotics of culture, I examine the official documents of the Ninth Extraordinary Congress of the Polish United Workers’ Party (Warsaw, July 1981) and the First National Congress of Solidarność (Gdansk, September-October 1981). In the first chapter of this book I introduce some concepts of the semiotics of culture. Ideologies, discourses and forms of thinking may be considered as collections of text and hence belong to that field of the semiotics of culture which studies systems of texts. The Moscow-Tartu Group developed several useful theoretical concepts suitable for comparative studies of discourses and successfully applied them to the history of Russian culture. Some semiotic phenomena specific to Russian history have also occurred in contemporary Polish history. In a few books and papers, Lotman and Uspensky proposed a few, slightly different classifications of semiotic systems. These categories may be joined and generalized, leading to a distinction between "binary" and "ternary" systems. In the binary semiotic system, meaning is formed by way of an inner transformation; an internal perspective prevails and the relationship between the signifier and the signified is considered necessary. On the contrary, in the ternary semiotic system, meaning is formed in the process of external transformation; an external perspective dominates and the relation between the signifier and the signified is seen as <b>contingent.</b> In other <b>words,</b> binary systems are of an a priori nature, exclude different points of view, and formulate a dichotomist vision of the world while ternary systems are emipirical, rather a posteriori, accept different points of view, and admit neutral elements of the world. According to Lotman and Uspensky, the structure of Russian culture is deeply binary. Via the distinction between binary and ternary sign systems, it is easy to precisely formulate the Reflection Thesis and then analyze the discourses of Communist Party and Solidarity in order to confirm or reject the thesis. In the second chapter I argue that communist ideology, as well as a public discourse in communist countries, had a clearly binary structure. Communist ideology was based on a priori assumptions and allowed no alternatives. This has been noted by many authors who have described the Soviet system, including Alain Besançon, Father Józef Bocheński, and Edgar Morin. The third chapter contains an analysis of the social system of communist states. It is argued (see Besançon, Staniszkis, and Edward Wnuk-Lipiński) that attempts to realize the communist ideology resulted in contradictions in culture, politics and economics. An analysis of these paradoxes is necessary for the understanding of some special features of Solidarity movement. The following chapter presents the controversy over the nature of Solidarity. On the one hand, as was mentioned above, some authors have claimed that the ideas of Solidarity reflected communist ideology. On the other hand, many sociologists (including Ireneusz Krzemiński, Mirosława Marody, and Alain Touraine) have argued that Solidarity broke free of the fetters of that ideology. I examine the argumentation of both sides of that dispute and propose an exact formulation of their claims. The Reflection Thesis boils down to a claim that the discourse of Solidarity had binary structure; the opposite view might be interpreted as a claim that Solidarity’s discourse was ternary. The fifth and sixth chapters are devoted to analysis of the official documents of the Ninth Congress of the PUWP and the First Congress of Solidarity. Examined in turn are the self-image of both organizations, their way of understanding the social and economic crisis, their proposed solutions, and their view of each other. The analysis leads {{to the conclusion that the}} Communist Party’s discourse was definitely binary and that Solidarity’s was clearly ternary. This deep structural difference finally undermines the Staniszkis and Kowalski claim. In the conclusion, however, I put forward a hypothesis that Polish public discourse at the beginnings of the 90 s was of a binary structure. Some sociologists (including Zdzisław Krasnodębski, David Ost and Paweł Śpiewak) have pointed out that the prevailing liberal discourse was based on a priori assumptions concerning the path of modernization and excluded any alternative views. If this "Postcommunist Discourse Hypothesis" is correct, it is understandable why Solidarity’s ideas were so often conflated with communist ideology by commentators, and why they were rejected by politicians...|$|R
