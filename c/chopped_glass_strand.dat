Polyimide precursors, synthesized by the reaction of 3, 3 ', 4, 4 '-benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride {{with a mixture of}} two diamines, can be processed into foams by indirect or direct heating techniques. Flexible resilient foams and thermal acoustical foams produced by the microwave heating of polyimide precursors are shown to conform to requirements for aircraft seating foams and thermal and acoustical insulation materials, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to enable large part or high volume manufacturing processes to make consumer or industrial products from a cork reinforced polymer composite, similar to current applications of glass reinforced polyester. The low initial investment and high flexibility of the spray lay-up process make it an attractive candidate to study. A spray lay-up apparatus was successfully constructed and employed in manufacturing parts from a hybrid material composed of granulated cork, <b>chopped</b> <b>glass</b> <b>strand,</b> and a polyester matrix. The material was tested for tensile and flexural properties following relevant ASTM standards. The material was found to have a tensile strength of 4. 4 MPa and tensile modulus of 850 MPa. The flexural strength and modulus were 9 MPa and 830 MPa, respectively. Adding a fiberglass skin to the cork hybrid significantly improved its flexural strength. Additionally, a small turbine blade prototype was created as a proof of concept. It is recommended that further work focus on optimizing the hybrid material's properties, re-designing and optimizing the apparatus used for the spray-up process, and demonstrating material viability by manufacturing a cross section of a large turbine blade. by Benjamin J.

At the scale of the whole composite domain, the distribution of fibers and the resulting number of crack-bridging fibers is considered. All the above random effects contribute to the variability of the crack bridge performance and result in size-dependent behavior of a multiply cracked composite...|$|R

40|$|The current {{investigation}} presents an independent fibre-modelling approach {{for the analysis}} of the composite sandwich panels reinforced with shear keys methodology under static bending load. The sandwich panel under investigation is composed of glass fibre reinforced polymer skin with polyvinylchloride and polyurethane foam core, while the semi-circular shear keys inserts are made of <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>glass</b> fibre impregnated with epoxy resin. The constituent materials were investigated through a series of quasi-static tests, while the flexural response of the sandwich panel with and without shear keys has been evaluated under four-point bending test. The experimental stress–strain curves of all the constituent materials were considered in the analytical model, while the total deflection is assumed to comprise two main components, one due to flexure and the other due to shear deformation. An incremental approach is used, where the concepts of force equilibrium and strain compatibility are satisfied in every loading step. The numerical procedure was executed using MATLAB code programming with the predictions of the damage mode. A significant improvement in the flexural stiffness and strength of the panel incorporated with shear keys accompanied with a good correlation with the analytical results were observed...|$|R

Parametric finite element (FE) investigation using ABAQUS software has been performed to evaluate {{the effect of the}} shear key orientation (bi-axial model) on the shear response and the failure mode of the composite sandwich panel under in-plane shear load and comparing the results with the zero orientation shear key model (uni-axial). Polyvinylchloride (PVC) foam {{has been used as a}} core material which sandwiched between two thin strong face sheets of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) to build a high performance sandwich panel. <b>Chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>glass</b> fibre (CS) impregnated with epoxy resin was used as shear key material.

Different orientations of the shear keys, namely ± 15 °,± 30 °,± 45 °,± 60 ° and 90 / 0 °, have been investigated. The FE results showed an improvement in the initial stiffness and ultimate stress of the sandwich panel as a result of introducing the shear keys. The FE model precisely captured the failure mode and demonstrated that the model with ± 60 ° was the most sustainable model among the other bi-axial models. In comparison with the bi-axial model, uni-axial model offered a remarkable enhancement in the shear performance compared with the bi-axial model and accordingly selected for the future investigation...|$|R

The matrix material consists of epoxy resin LY 556 and room-temperature curing hardener HY 951 supplied by Crystal Chemicals, Delhi, India. The composites were fabricated by blending epoxy resin, glass fiber, and SiC filler in a certain weight percentage reinforcement. Five different compositions of composites were prepared by varying the SiC filler reinforcement with fixed weight percentage (wt.%) of <b>chopped</b> <b>glass</b> fiber reinforcement. SiC filler in five different weight percentages (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt.%) are added with fixed 20 wt.% of <b>chopped</b> <b>glass</b> fiber and remaining epoxy so as to notice the effect of SiC reinforcement on physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of <b>chopped</b> <b>glass</b> fiber-reinforced epoxy composites.

40|$|The {{requirement}} for lightweight structures with high stiffness {{has seen the}} use of composite sandwich panels in many engineering applications. In recent years, foam cores have increasingly been used in composite sandwich constructions due to their ease of manufacture and low cost. However, their performances are often limited by their vulnerability to skin-core debonding. The shear-key methodology proposed in this thesis is a simple and cost-effective way of improving the shear resistance of foam-core composite panels and reducing the probability of their failure at the skin-core interface. This research is aimed at investigating improvements {{that can be achieved}} using shear keys and the influence of geometric parameters on the shear resistance of foam-core sandwich panels. The panels employed have glass fibre-reinforced polymer skins and polyvinylchloride and polyurethane foam-core materials while the shear keys are made from <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> <b>glass</b> fibres impregnated with epoxy resin. The effect of a shear key’s diameter, pitch and orientation in a sandwich panel subjected to shear loading is first investigated numerically using finite element modelling. Then, the model with the most promising shear-key geometry is fabricated and tested experimentally under shear loading and shows good agreement with the numerical results. In general, the panels with shear keys show stronger and more stable responses than those without them. Improvements in the flexural responses of sandwich panels through the introduction of shear keys are investigated both numerically and experimentally. Also, a theoretical model for the analyses, which takes into account the appreciable shear deformation in the core, is developed and found to provide predictions in good agreement with the numerical and experimental results. These theoretical, numerical and experimental studies confirm that foam-core sandwich panels with shear keys exhibit better flexural performances than ordinary panels without shear keys. From this study, it is concluded that incorporating shear keys with appropriate geometry in foam-core sandwich panels provides significant improvements in both shear and flexural performances...|$|R
