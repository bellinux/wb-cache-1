There will be a set of 3–4 GPS satellites, one geo-synchronous satellite, GPS receivers at end of the runways, a ground station and a VHF data broadcast system. When the pilot project starts, Chennai airport {{will be the first}} airport in the country to have the facility.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{first step}} towards {{integrating}} the entire airspace in the country, the automation system at the ATC in Chennai Airport was commissioned on 1 October 2011. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has invested [...] 42 crore for the Chennai automation system, which runs on Auto Track 3+, a sophisticated air traffic <b>control</b> <b>automation</b> system supplied and installed by US-based Raytheon. A new route radar at Porur has also been installed and the 13-year-old terminal radar at the airport will be replaced. With the automation system in place, all information regarding tower control, approach control, area control and oceanic control would be exchanged electronically in Chennai. It would ensure reliability, thereby enhancing safety of aircraft and passengers.|$|E
