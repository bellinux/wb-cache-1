40|$|Abstract: Suspension and {{cable-stayed}} bridge cables are currently vulnerable to multiple scenarios that can jeopardize {{the integrity of}} the bridge. These can include accidental truck fires and more recently, terrorist attacks. The inherent nature of suspension and cable-stay bridges leaves little redundancy to their structural loads paths. For this reason they are more susceptible to terrorist attacks than possibly any other structure. This paper looks at a composite <b>cable</b> <b>shield</b> composed of various materials each tailored to protect against unique threats. Several test specimens were manufactured by Fyfe Co.

50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>shielding</b> may be {{required}} in order to improve a Cat 6 cable's performance in high electromagnetic interference (EMI) environments. This shielding reduces the corrupting effect of EMI on the <b>cable's</b> data. <b>Shielding</b> is typically maintained from one cable end to the other using a drain wire that runs through the cable alongside the twisted pairs. The shield's electrical connection to the chassis on each end is made through the jacks. The requirement for ground connections at both cable ends creates the possibility that a ground loop may result if one of the networked chassis is at different instantaneous electrical potential with respect to its mate. This undesirable situation may compel currents to flow between chassis through the network <b>cable</b> <b>shield,</b> and these currents may in turn induce detrimental noise in the signal being carried by the cable.|$|R

At the fundamental frequency of 53 1. 25 MHz, common-mode current and radiated emissions in-creased at a rate of approximately 9 dB/decade of skew. At skew values much lower than the rise time of the signal, common-mode current increased nearly linearly with skew.

40|$|Electrical {{power cables}} with Cross-Linked Polyethylene Insulation (XLPE-insulation) are {{currently}} utilized in projects of the electric-power supply systems of modern facilities. However, the higher costs, the incomplete design, {{installation and maintenance}} normativetechnical basis as well as certain constructional features of the XLPE-insulated cable lines hinder their large-scale implementation. The cables with XLPE insulation are mostly produced in a single-conductor core version being provided with a composite copper shield whose cross-section may vary while the electric conductor cross-section remains uniform. Earthing the <b>cable</b> <b>shields</b> on both sides causes the flow of electricity in them. The course of operational service of the XLPE-insulated cable lines revealed the following fact – the currents induced in the <b>cable</b> <b>shields</b> can run up to the levels commeasurable {{with those in the}} conductor-cores themselves. That, in its turn, leads to electrical safety-level reduction, cable lines failure, and economic losses. The currents induced in the shields may occur both in symmetric (normal and emergency) and asymmetric operating modes of the power grid with values of the induced currents reaching 80 % of the conducting core currents. Many factors affect the level of the current induced in the shield: the midpoint conductor modes, the values of the core longitudinal currents in the normal and emergency operating modes, failure mode, the cross-section area of the <b>shield,</b> the <b>cables</b> mutual disposition, and the distance between them. The paper claims experimental existence conformation of the cable-shield current induced by that in the conductor-core and demonstrates its measured value.
