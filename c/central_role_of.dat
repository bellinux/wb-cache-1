5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating the <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> ammonia, ammonia levels {{do not always}} correlate with {{the severity of the}} encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already been absorbed into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E

5|$|Casino Royale {{deals with}} the {{question}} of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the real-world <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the US in the defence of the West. The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6—Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean—to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but he did not focus on it too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship did not reflect the reality of the US-UK relationship.|$|E
5|$|With {{the piece}} {{set to open}} on 26 December, Gilbert first read the {{libretto}} to the cast on 14 December, but Toole, who was playing the <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> Thespis, did not return from {{a tour of the}} British provinces until 18 December. He then appeared in nine performances at the Gaiety in the six days immediately after his return, and other actors had similar commitments. In addition, Hollingshead had committed the company to perform a pantomime at The Crystal Palace on 21 December, which included many of the performers who would be in Thespis. Lastly, Thespis was to play as the afterpiece to an H. J. Byron comedy, Dearer than Life, which shared many of its actors, including Toole and Fred Sullivan, and had to be rehearsed at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Sexual pheromones {{are defined}} as odors and {{are one of the}} {{prevalent}} ways in which social male insects find females to mate with. They can be produced in either males or females.

In addition, females discriminate against mates by the judgment of their sex pheromones. Courtship pheromones are issued in many cases by males.

40|$|In atherosclerosis, the {{accumulation}} of apolipoprotein B-lipoproteins in the matrix beneath the endothelial cell layer of blood vessels leads to the recruitment of monocytes, {{the cells of the}} immune system that give rise to macrophages and dendritic cells. Macrophages derived from these recruited monocytes participate in a maladaptive, nonresolving inflammatory response that expands the subendothelial layer due to {{the accumulation}} of cells, lipid, and matrix. Some lesions subsequently form a necrotic core, triggering acute thrombotic vascular disease, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death.
