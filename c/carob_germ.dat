The effects of different types of egg ingredients (fresh, whites, dried) and <b>carob</b> <b>germ</b> flour (CGF) as well as par-baking technology on the quality of dough-based gluten-free sorghum dinner rolls were evaluated. Gluten-free rolls containing 30 % of fresh shell eggs or equivalent of egg products and 10 % of CGF on a flour basis were evaluated against a control (no egg, no CGF). The feasibility of partial baking of rolls was studied on control as well as fresh eggs and <b>carob</b> <b>germ</b> flour formulas during 5 baking times (0, 8, 10, 12 and 18 minutes). Breads were evaluated for crumb and crust color, specific volume, cell profile, Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) and consumer acceptability. Results showed that rolls containing egg ingredients had higher specific volumes than control (p< 0. 05) with an increase from 1. 45 cm[superscript] 3 /g to 1. 96 cm[superscript] 3 /g. <b>Carob</b> <b>germ</b> flour did not {{have a significant effect on}} specific volume. Eggs also improved cell elongation and produced significantly darker crust (p< 0. 05). CGF did not appear to have an effect on cell elongation but increased average cell number when combined with egg ingredients, and greatly impacted rolls texture. The combination of fresh eggs or egg whites with CGF reduced significantly (p< 0. 05) crumb hardness from 2, 074 to 1, 404 g and 1, 468 g of force respectively. Par-baked dinner rolls displayed similar color, volume, cell profile and texture trends to conventionally baked rolls. Sensory study revealed that acceptability, organoleptic characteristics and willingness to buy of par-baked dinner rolls could be similar to that of conventional wheat products. This research proved that the addition of eggs and CGF to a GF rolls formulation resulted in better overall quality of the product. Moreover, par-baking of the rolls showed great potential to provide safe, convenient and acceptable GF foods to celiac individuals...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science Institute - Animal Science & IndustryFadi M. Aramouni, Bean, Scott R. The biochemical, {{physical}} and baking properties of caroubin, the main protein in the carob bean, were characterized. The biochemical properties of caroubin {{were analyzed using}} reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALS) and micro-fluidics analysis. The {{physical and}} baking properties of caroubin were characterized via SE-HPLC, laser scanning confocal microscopy, farinograph mixing, and texture profile analyzer analysis. Using a modified Osborne fractionation method, <b>carob</b> <b>germ</b> flour proteins were found to contain ~ 32 % albumin and globulin and ~ 68 % glutelin with no prolamins detected. When divided into soluble and insoluble protein fractions under non reducing conditions {{it was found that}} caroubin contained (~ 95 %) soluble proteins and only (~ 5 %) insoluble proteins. As in wheat, SEC-MALS analysis showed that the insoluble proteins had a greater Mw than the soluble proteins and ranged up to 8 x 107 Da. These polymeric proteins appeared to {{play a critical role in}} protein network formation. Analysis of the physical properties of <b>carob</b> <b>germ</b> protein-maize starch dough showed that the dough’s functionality was dependent on disulfide bonded protein networks, similar to what is found in wheat gluten. When baked into a bread these proteins were shown to have a possible improving affect by decreasing staling in gluten-free breads. This was evident when compared to a gluten-free batter bread, and a wheat bread over a five day period...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the phytochemical content and to determine the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of methanol extracts of the carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua L.) germ flour. The extracts were rich in phenolic compounds, had considerable antioxidant activity, and reduced the viability of cervical (HeLa) cancer cells. The chemical content and the biological activities of the extracts were significantly affected by gender and cultivar. Female cultivar Galhosa had {{the highest levels of}} phenolic compounds, and the highest antioxidant activity. Extracts from the hermaphrodite trees and from the female cultivars Galhosa and Costela/Canela exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity. The most abundant compound was theophylline. The phenolic content was correlated to both antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. Our findings provide new knowledge about the health implications of consuming food supplemented with <b>carob</b> <b>germ</b> flour...|$|E
40|$|<b>Carob</b> pod, <b>germ,</b> {{and seed}} were {{analyzed}} for moisture, ash, protein, fat, carbohydrates and particularly for their tannins content. Recovery of tannins as affected by various solvent extraction systems was investigated. Carob pod meal contained {{high levels of}} carbohydrates, appreciable amounts of protein {{and low levels of}} fat. Germ and seed contained more fat and less carbohydrates. Seventy percent acetone was the most effective solvent for the exctration and recovery of tanniins...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of gastric evacuation rates (GERs) and digesta content, moisture and pH values along the gastrointestinal tract was performed between gilthead sea bream and European sea bass. In order to distinguish species-specific differences from diet-elicited effects, all parameters were determined under either a fishmeal diet or a <b>carob</b> seed <b>germ</b> meal diet that contained high levels of total and soluble non-starch polysaccharides. GERs were significantly different between species {{and they were not}} affected by diet. Similarly, species-specific patterns were revealed in the distribution of digesta and water content along the gastrointestinal tract. In sea bream, stomach digesta and water content decreased with time, whereas in sea bass stomach retained the highest digesta and water content throughout the sampling period. The anterior and distal intestine exhibited the lowest accommodating capacities of digesta and water in either species. Overall, sea bream performed stomach digestion at lower hydration levels and higher pH compared with sea bass. Diet affected stomach moisture in both species and pH of stomach digesta in sea bass and of all intestinal sections in sea bream. The results obtained indicated that water and inorganic ion exchanges through the gut may differentiate between the species and warrant further investigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of <b>carob</b> seed <b>germ</b> meal (CSGM) as a soybean meal (SBM) replacement {{in the diet}} of red tilapia hybrid was evaluated in an 8 -week feeding trial. Five isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets with increasing CSGM (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 %), {{at the expense of}} SBM, were fed to triplicated groups of tilapia fingerlings. Their growth, feeding efficiency, whole body proximate composition, selected plasma biochemical parameters, and liver and gut histopathology were assessed. The survival and growth of red tilapia were unaffected by the dietary CSGM inclusion up to 30 %. Growth and feeding efficiencies were significantly reduced at 40 % CSGM inclusion. Hematocrit and body crude lipid were significantly lower (p <  0. 05) in fish fed 30 – 40 % CSGM while plasma ALT and protein were significantly higher compared to the control (0 % CSGM). In addition, some instances of lipofuscin and cellular degradation were shown in liver while morphological changes were observed in fish fed 30 and 40 % CSGM. Some of these included a 60 % and 34 % reduction in goblet cell prevalence and villi length, respectively, as well as a thickening of the intestinal mucosal and submucosa layers of 51 and 27 %, respectively as dietary CSGM increased from 0 to 40 %, that was likely due to increased anti-nutritional factors. In conclusion, a dietary inclusion of only up to 20 % untreated CSGM was recommended for red hybrid tilapia...|$|R
