50|$|Since the {{erase head}} erases the old signal {{right before the}} video heads write onto the tape, there is no remnant of the old signal to cause visible {{distortion}} at and after the moment a cut is made, resulting in a <b>clean</b> <b>edit.</b> In addition, the ability of flying erase heads to erase old video off the tape right before recording new video on it allows the ability to perform insert editing, where new footage can be placed within an existing recording with clean cuts {{at the beginning and}} end of the edit.|$|E
5000|$|Released on {{the single}} were a [...] "clean edit" [...] and the [...] "radio edit." [...] Both edits cut from section 2:20 through 3:07 {{on the album}} version. The {{differences}} between the two edits is that the <b>clean</b> <b>edit</b> has the words [...] "crystal meth" [...] censored through backmasking. Radio stations that chose not to edit the drug reference played the radio edit. A third edit omits the entire second verse and second chorus, and is usually played on adult contemporary stations to avoid the drug and sexual references of the song.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS {{epidemics}} continue unchecked in African countries at {{all level}} of society bearing the heaviest {{burden of the}} scourge. Different researches have been done to see the progress of disease {{from time to time}} However, information that shows the trend of HIV among the healthy population {{over a period of time}} in Ethiopia is very limited. METHODS: A descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out to see the trend of HIV Sero-positivity and associated socio-demographic factors. The data was retrieved from records of people who donated blood during the period of January 2007 to December 2010, at Jimma University Specialized Hospital (JUSH). Data on socio–demographic variables and serologic status of the subjects were abstracted from their records using structured format. Then the data were <b>cleaned,</b> <b>edited</b> and entered into computer and analyzed by Microsoft Excel sheet. Then Chi-Square (X 2) Statistical test was used for testing associations and P value less or equal to five percent (P < 0. 05) was considered significant...|$|R

A <b>clean</b> radio <b>edit</b> was released for promotional purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the many}} uses of profanity in the song, {{different}} clean edits have been released. The official <b>clean</b> <b>edit</b> which is played on most radio stations replaces [...] "Crazy bitch" [...] with [...] "Crazy chick", removes [...] "Shit", and replaces [...] "You're fucking crazy" [...] with [...] "You like it crazy". Another edit is the same, but instead of removing [...] "You don't really give a shit", it is replaced with [...] "You don't really give it up." [...] Finally, the iTunes edit completely blanks out all profanity, as well as [...] "Blacked out". Some radio stations and music channels also remove [...] "What did you put in my drink?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In the video, Yung Joc plays four {{different}} roles; as himself, as {{a fat man}} {{who works at the}} shop, a dwarf who works at the shop, and as a bald old man who also works at the shop. Gorilla Zoe's verse in the video {{is not the same as}} his verse in the single, and the video ends after Joc says, [...] "Hey kids, please don't do drugs." [...] rather than continuing into [...] "Give them to me and I'll get rid of them at the Coffee Shop" [...] as it does in the single. The video uses the <b>Clean</b> <b>Edit</b> rather than the Album Version.|$|E
5000|$|The album's booklet {{is missing}} credits of [...] "As I Am" [...] and the songs from Octavarium as edited versions; those tracks are {{actually}} {{shorter than the}} ones from that album as secondary versions for [...] "As I Am" [...] (also a <b>clean</b> <b>edit),</b> [...] "The Root of All Evil" [...] and [...] "Sacrificed Sons" [...] with the first minute intro taken out, [...] "The Answer Lies Within" [...] has the first 15 seconds of bells ringing taken out, [...] "I Walk Beside You" [...] has the same length as its original album but with the clock ticking sound {{taken out of the}} first riff.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Surgical Site {{infections are}} {{the second most}} {{frequently}} reported infections of all nosocomial infections among hospital patients. Among surgical patients in obstetrics, Surgical Site Infections were the most common nosocomial infections and the rate is higher in sub-Saharan Africa. There {{has not been a}} study which documented the extent of the problem in the study area; hence the objective {{of this study was to}} determine the surgical site infection rate among women having surgery for delivery in obstetrics of Jimma University Specialized Hospital (JUSH) from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010. METHODS: A prospective descriptive study design was conducted with the aim of determining the surgical site infection rate on all 770 women who had surgery for delivery from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010 in obstetric ward of the Hospital. Data on history of the patient, patient specific demographic information on potential risk factors and the occurrence of Surgical Site infections in the first 30 days following surgery were collected using pretested data collection form. In addition, relevant data were also abstracted from the operation logbook of the cases. Then data were <b>cleaned,</b> <b>edited</b> and fed to computer and analyzed using SPSS for window version 16. 0. Finally Statistical test for significance was employed...|$|R
40|$|It {{important}} to properly collect, code, <b>clean</b> and <b>edit</b> the data before interpreting and displaying the research results. Computers {{play a major}} role in different phases of research starting from conceptual, design and planning, data collection, data analysis and research publication phases. The main objective of data display is to summarize the characteristics of a data and to make the data more comprehensible and meaningful. Usually data is presented depending upon the type of data in different tables and graphs. This will enable not only to understand the data behaviour, but also useful in choosing the different statistical tests to be applied...|$|R

50|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} the song exists {{that appears to be}} an earlier {{version of the}} song. Said version does not feature vocals from Nicki Minaj, which suggests that it was the original version of the song before Minaj has been arranged, and therefore has a different third verse; furthermore the ending is extended and features one more repetition of the last line. The song's length of 3 minutes and 47 seconds is about the same as the regular version (that includes the intro by Minaj from the third verse at the beginning). This alternate version is referred to as Letting Go (Dutty Love) (Promo Only <b>Clean</b> <b>Edit).</b> It is not known if the version was leaked or distributed for promotional use by the record label.|$|E

5000|$|Ghostwriters {{are widely}} used by celebrities and public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies or memoirs. The degree of {{involvement}} of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to substantial. Various sources explain {{the role of the}} ghostwriter and how competent writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to <b>clean</b> up, <b>edit,</b> and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a [...] "how-to" [...] book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, and an outline, interview sessions with the celebrity or public figure.

40|$|The gateway {{south of}} South Africa {{constitutes}} an integral inter-ocean {{link in the}} global thermohaline circulation (THC) since it allows the exchange of shallow- and deepwater masses between the Indian and the Atlantic. Thus understanding past variations of this current system is important for improving {{our knowledge of the}} global climate. The long-term changes in deepwater flow in the Atlantic-Indian gateway during the Cenozoic have been initially studied using reflection seismic profiles. But in many cases the seismic stratigraphy is poorly constrained and not further resolved within the time period from the late Miocene to present. In particular, there are limited Pliocene records {{that can be used to}} investigate the influence of climatic (e. g. Antartic ice volume) and tectonic (e. g. closure of the central American seaway) on the deep-water variability. Here we focus on the bottom water flow around the Agulhas Plateau, a location proximal to the entrance of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) to the Southern Ocean and South Indian Ocean. IODP Expedition 361 (SAFARI) Site U 1475 was drilled in 2669 m water depth into a sediment drift that is deposited on the southwestern flank of Agulhas Plateau and comprises a complete stratigraphic section of the last ∼ 7 Ma. We present <b>cleaned,</b> <b>edited,</b> and spliced high-resolution data sets of sediment physical properties measured at Site U 1475. Synthetic seismograms generated from the velocity and bulk density core scanning records allow a detailed correlation oft the drilling results with the Site survey seismic reflection profiles. Seismic reflectors at 3. 75 and 3. 87 s (two-way-traveltime) correspond to major increases in acoustic impedance at ∼ 110 and ∼ 216 meters below seafloor. Based on the preliminary shipboard biostratigraphic age model sediments at these depths have ages of ∼ 4. 0 and ∼ 5. 1 Ma, respectively. Furthermore spectral analyses of physical property records such as natural gamma radiation and colour reflectance reveal climate variability on orbital and suborbital timescales...|$|R

The article {{is part of a}} series of papers on the evaluation of the Project NetWork demonstration. In addition to 8, 248 Project NetWork participants randomly assigned to receive case management services and a control group, the simulation identified 138, 613 eligible nonparticipants in the demonstration areas. The output data files contain detailed monthly information on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Disability Insurance (DI) benefits, annual earnings, and a set of demographic and diagnostic variables. The data allow for the measurement of net outcomes and the analysis of factors affecting participation. The results suggest that it is feasible to simulate complex eligibility rules using administrative records, and create a <b>clean</b> and <b>edited</b> data file for a comprehensive and credible evaluation. The study shows that it is feasible to use administrative records data for selecting control or comparison groups in future demonstration evaluations...|$|R
