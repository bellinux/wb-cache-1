40|$|International audienceDealing with spatial {{knowledge}} {{requires the}} <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> spatial <b>information.</b> This <b>consistency</b> is usually enforced by constraint satisfaction techniques including constraint propagation through arc and path consistency. While theses techniques often assume that spatial information are static, {{this is in}} general {{not the case in}} the real world. Our goal is to propose an approach to maintain the <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> spatial knowledge in a dynamic environment. To our best knowledge no work in spatial reasoning has addressed this issue. In this paper we use a spatial ontology called SpaceOntology to describe both objects and spatial relations namely topological and distance relations between these objects. Based on a dynamic path consistency algorithm, our proposed method maintains the <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> spatial <b>information</b> after adding new instances of topological relations described by SpaceOntology of a given environment. In order to evaluate the performance of our dynamic path consistency method, we conducted several tests on instantiations of SpaceOntology in addition to randomly generated spatial constraint problems.

In our approach, the model checking tool SPIN is used.
