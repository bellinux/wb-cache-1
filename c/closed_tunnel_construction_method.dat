40|$|A tunnel is {{a passage}} way that carries people or {{vehicles}} {{to cross a}} destination that have obstruction or to shorten the travelling time. Tunnels in the olden days are used for mainly mining works. In the recent years as technology evolve with time, <b>tunnels</b> <b>construction</b> had become more commonly used transport routes in places that alternative solution such as roads or bridges impossible to be built or the costing is higher since there are obstruction to be accounted for in order to built the necessary routes. Tunnels are also used as rails links, vehicles and also as canals for water diversion. Most tunnels are built through a hill or mountain and underground below cities, roads, ocean or rivers. The <b>constructions</b> of <b>tunnels</b> are very complex because it involves precise and accurate planning. <b>Tunnel</b> <b>construction</b> depends mainly on geological study of the sub-surface before determining the type of <b>construction</b> <b>method</b> and costing involves. This is because the type of soil formation will determine the structural needs, types of machineries, suitability for that particular location to construct the tunnel and also the environmental impact on the society and the natural surrounding especially the sub-surface of the soils (e. g. underground streams and {{the stability of the}} soil).

Large-scale accidents and malicious threats, such as fires or explosions creating a blast loading, potentially carry very high economical and societal consequences. Compared to other statistically certain events, explosive-induced blasts in tunnels have an extremely low {{probability of occurrence}} {{but at the same}} time an enormous damage potential for structure, life, and environment. The paper presents a procedure for evaluation consequences of blast loading threat scenarios, focusing on the local and global structural integrity of <b>tunnel</b> <b>constructions.</b> <b>Methods</b> to capture the dynamic loading and the structural resistance, especially considering the dynamic soil response under large stresses and strains, are described. For that, a combined experimental and numerical approach is chosen, including characterization of the soil by dynamic triaxial experiments realizing stress levels of about 1 MPa, acting in 1 ms on the specimen. The analysis showed that the measured triaxial strength of the soil differed from the static by a factor of 2 for the friction angle. Furthermore, scaled experiments have been designed and conducted to demonstrate and investigate the behavior of a buried tunnel segment under blast loading. The results showed that realistic loading charges can cause massive cracking of the tunnel system and a soil sinking of up to 1 cm. Both experimental results obtained from the triaxial tests on the one hand and from the scaled tunnel experiments on the other hand have been validated using numerical models. The good agreement obtained is the essential input parameter for the evaluation of criticality in tunnels under blast loading scenarios...|$|R

Based on the ground conditions, geometry, and <b>tunnel</b> <b>construction</b> <b>method</b> simulated, a significant zone of influence can be identified one tunnel diameter ahead and one behind the tunnel excavation face. Within this zone of influence, the settlement of the pile {{is greater than the}} ground settlement due to the plastic yielding at the pile toe. A computed ground sur-face settlement profile simulated by a normal Gaussian distribution does not accurately reflect pile head settlement and a significant nonlinear distribution of subsurface settlement with depth is induced by tunnel excavation. Under plane strain conditions. other empirical and analytical methods predicted similar trends in the subsurface settlements, but gave larger magnitudes of subsurface settlements. The open face tunnel excavation induces complex distributions of relative subsurface settlements and both positive and negative side shear stresses along the pile. Within the zone of influence of the tunnel excavation, excess positive and negative pore-water pressures are generated at the pile head and pile toe, respectively. At the pile toe, the pore-water pressure was reduced to 40 % of its initial hydrostatic value. At 10 days after the tunnel face passed the pile, the excess pore-water pressures at the pile recovered to within 20 % of initial hydrostatic values. Due to the additional settlement of the pile that occurred during tunneling, the soil resistance factor of safety for the pile can be regarded as decreasing from 3. 0 to 1. 5, according to a displacement-based failure load criterion.

30|$|By {{means of}} 3 D FEM or FDM, the {{response}} of the operational subway tunnel to neighboring shield tunneling has been rigorously assessed both in normal and anomalous conditions, i.e. considering a set of potential scenarios at the design stage in almost all <b>close</b> <b>tunnel</b> crossing <b>construction</b> projects of mainland China (such as Yang et al. 2009). Main construction phases simulated step by step, key parameters to be observed and regulated such as the face support pressure and grouting volume, can be identified and selected with the numerical simulations. At the same time, the most critical aspects of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>close</b> crossing can be understood by simulating the possible crisis scenarios and defining a course of countermeasures for every predictable significant deviation of the observational findings from those predicted {{on the basis of the}} predefined working hypothesis. On account of the above characteristics of the numerical calculations, it was required that impacts of the shield tunneling on existing tunnels were simulated using the 3 D FEM or FDM. But it is necessary to point out that the computation quantitative results of the FEM/FDM weren’t taken as absolute values owing to calculations based on a variety of assumptions, simplifications of some construction details as well as inaccurate selection of parameters and constitutive equations of soils. A suggestion is to back-analyze the shield tunneling induced movements of the existing tunnels. Using the back-analysis method, reasonable parameters and models to describe the complex interaction between tunnel and ground may be gotten in each city. By combining the findings with the computation by the FEM/FDM for a new nearby shield <b>tunnel</b> <b>construction</b> in this city, the calculated results can be gotten with more reliability. The findings by the FEM or FDM do provide important references for making the execution plans. Measures and countermeasures can be taken against the worst scenarios in construction according to the findings. It is a necessary part of the framework. The findings by the calculations do provide crossing projects with the directional guidance in construction, and at least can be employed as a basis for qualitative judgment. It is encouraging that the simulation precision is increased solidly with the more <b>tunnel</b> <b>close</b> crossing projects completed and more numerical calculations performed in the largest cities of China.|$|R

Although {{the majority of}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>construction</b> projects have been completed safely, {{there have been several}} incidents that have resulted in delays, cost overruns, and sometimes more significant consequences such as injury and loss of life. To help eliminate these accidents, it is necessary to systematically assess and manage the risks associated with <b>tunnel</b> <b>construction.</b> In order to better understand the conditions under which accidents occur, a database of 204 <b>tunnel</b> <b>construction</b> accidents was assembled. This is the most comprehensive database known to date. The database was analyzed to better understand the causes of accidents. Influence diagrams were constructed containing the main factors, and the interactions between them. These served as the basis of the risk assessment methodology presented in this work. The risk assessment methodology consists of combining a geologic prediction model that allows one to predict geology ahead of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>construction,</b> with a decision support model that allows one to choose amongst different construction strategies the one that leads to minimum risk. The geologic prediction model is based on Bayesian networks because of their ability to combine domain knowledge with data, encode dependencies among variables, and their ability to learn causal relationships.
