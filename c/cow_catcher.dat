50|$|<b>Cow</b> <b>Catcher</b> - the {{children}} ride on their parents' {{back and try}} to round up some toy cows and place them in a corral.|$|E
50|$|The tender {{locomotives}} {{had their}} maker's standard 2-6-0 (1C) axle positions. Like the 7100 series, they bore a diamond-shaped chimney and <b>cow</b> <b>catcher</b> {{in the older}} American style, but had straight-top boilers instead of wagon-top ones, and a steam-dome in the second boiler compartment. The furnace was located between {{the second and third}} driving wheels, which were 1,372 mm apart; the first and second driving wheels were 2,296 mm apart. Of the tender's three axles, the second and third were bogies.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{outfitted with}} <b>cow</b> <b>catchers,</b> smokestacks, bell, oil lamp headlights, and a wooden cab, all typical of American locomotive design practice. The two purchased in 1880 used Westinghouse air brakes, which was quite new and advanced at the time; it allowed the brakes {{to be applied}} to all cars simultaneously.|$|R
25|$|Tram engines {{had their}} wheels and motion {{enclosed}} to avoid accidents in traffic. They also had <b>cow</b> <b>catchers</b> to avoid road debris causing a derailment. Some tram engines were {{fitted with a}} roof and enclosed sides, giving them an appearance more like a goods wagon than a locomotive. To save weight, this side cladding could be of either metal or wood. A well-known fictional {{example of such a}} wooden-bodied tram is Toby the Tram Engine.|$|R
25|$|The railway {{seems to}} have lacked stock-proof fencing in places, clearly {{indicated}} in a postcard of a scene near Chanter's Lane. Presumably the light railway order, low speeds and <b>cow</b> <b>catchers</b> on the locomotives made this unnecessary on {{some parts of the}} line. On the same postcard the railway is mistakenly called the 'Bideford, Chanter's Lane, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway'. Substantial wood fencing is present at other sites in surviving photographs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ship has}} been {{involved}} in two incidents. On 22 March 2008 the ships mooring ropes parted resulting is her drifting across the eastern entrance of Dover Harbour. The ship was assisted back to her berth by a Dover Harbour tug. [...] On 29 August 2008 the ship suffered a partial lost of electrical power which resulted in a collision with Linkspan 7 in Calais. European Endeavours <b>cow</b> <b>catcher,</b> a metal structure welded to the bow to support the bow ramp when deployed, was demolished and significant damage was caused to the linkspan.|$|E
5000|$|After her run on The Wild Wild West, the Inyo {{participated in}} the Golden Spike Centennial at Promontory, Utah, in 1969. The {{following}} year it appeared as {{a replica of the}} Central Pacific's [...] "Jupiter" [...] locomotive at the Golden Spike National Historical Site. The State of Nevada purchased the Inyo in 1974; it was restored to 1895 vintage, including a wider smoke stack and a new pilot (<b>cow</b> <b>catcher)</b> without a drop coupler. The Inyo is still operational and displayed at the Nevada State Railroad Museum in Carson City. The express car (No. 21) and passenger car (No. 4) are also at the museum.|$|E
50|$|The Gillig Trolley is {{produced}} in collaboration with Cable Car Classics of Healdsburg, California. It is available in 30 ft, 35 ft, and 40 ft lengths. The vintage-style trolley appearance package exterior features include frameless bonded side windows, maintenance-free wood-like trim, ornate gold pinstriping, custom window and body graphic decals, roof cupola, functional solid brass bell, <b>cow</b> <b>catcher,</b> roof perimeter LED ropelights, and front center brass trolley lamp. The interior has solid American white oak seats, optional seat cushions, leather hand straps, brass handrails, stop request pull ropes, wood trim, and woodgrain wall panels and floor covering. In addition to conventional diesel, the Gillig Trolley is available with optional power trains, including Allison hybrid-electric, all-electric, and CNG.|$|E
50|$|Early on {{in their}} lives the {{locomotives}} were initially allocated to Ipswich Engine Shed and were fitted with <b>cow</b> <b>catchers</b> for working the dockside tramway lines. As time passed and traffic levels declined at Ipswich, they were transferred away from Ipswich with D2950 being recorded at Great Yarmouth (which had a quayside tramway) and D2951 at Goole which had a dock system. D2950 and D2951 were both transferred from Ipswich to Goole in December 1966.|$|R

5000|$|Terminus Legion is a {{supporter}} {{group that was}} created in March 2011 by graphic designer Matt Stigall, who wanted a way to show that Atlanta fans would support soccer despite {{the perception of the}} city as a [...] "lazy sports town". The group was named after the name given to Atlanta when it was first settled, and its logo featuring a <b>cow</b> <b>catcher</b> and railroad ties reflect the city's history as a locomotive hub. In the days since the expansion team was awarded, its membership doubled to over 500, and in the time leading up to 2017, Stigall said the group would support [...] "all Atlanta soccer" [...] including the Atlanta Silverbacks of the NASL and at the grassroots level, and make road trips to D.C. United and Orlando City matches.|$|E
5000|$|Rio Grande Southern Railroad (RGS), Motor No. 2 (nicknamed Galloping Goose Number 2) is a {{gasoline}} engine powered narrow gauge railroad motorcar. It was converted on August 12, 1931 from a 1927 Buick [...] "Master Six" [...] 4-door sedan. The Buick was cut behind the rear doorpost and extended with sheet metal 18 in {{to form an}} enlarged passenger compartment. The steering column was removed. The couch from the RGS office become the back seat {{as it is shown}} being requisitioned for Goose No. 2 on the statement covering construction. The front axle was removed and replaced with a swiveling two-axle lightweight railroad truck with sixteen-inch diameter wheels that carried and guided the front of the Goose. Ahead of the front truck the pilot (<b>cow</b> <b>catcher)</b> is attached to the frame. There were two small pivoted scrapers attached {{to the rear of the}} pilot to keep small objects on the track from derailing the lightweight front truck. During the winter season a small snowplow was attached to the front of the pilot.|$|E
50|$|Rio Grande Southern Railroad (RGS), Motor Number 6 (affectionately nicknamed Galloping Goose Number 6) is a {{gasoline}} engine powered narrow gauge railroad motor car. The Goose body and chassis were built from a Buick automobile. The new Buick body {{was cut off}} behind {{the front seat and}} a new rear wall installed. The steering wheel was removed as it was not needed, but the other controls remained. The front axle was removed and replaced with a swiveling two axle lightweight railroad truck with sixteen inch diameter wheels that carried and guided the front of the Goose. Ahead of the front truck is the pilot (<b>cow</b> <b>catcher)</b> attached to the frame. Two small pivoted scrapers attached {{to the rear of the}} pilot slide on the rails to keep small objects on the track from derailing the lightweight front truck. During the winter season a small snow plow (now stored on the car's flatbed) was attached to the front of the pilot.The rear of the car frame was lengthened using steel channel riveted together but welded to the frame to carry the truck type flat-bed platform. The bed has short stake racks around the sides to keep materials from falling off.The Goose was originally powered by the 6-cylinder engine, clutch and transmission that came with the Buick. The drive chain powers the rear swiveling two axle truck assembly mounted under the rear frame and platform bed. The drive shaft turns only the forward axle. The rearmost axle is driven by roller chains and sprockets mounted outside of the wheels on each side. The rear truck has twenty four-inch diameter cast wheels.The braking is accomplished by brake shoes between the axles on each truck being pushed against the wheel treads. These are actuated by linkage connecting them to the normal foot pedal and parking brake lever. The foot brake is connected to the front truck and the parking brake lever is connected to the rear truck. Goose No. 6 received air brakes about 1939.The paint colors of Goose No. 6 early on is still an item of much discussion. Examination of the paint layers on the rear bed revealed only black and then aluminum that was used after 1935.|$|E
50|$|The company {{only had}} two {{locomotives}}: outside-cylindered 2-6-4Ts, built by Kitson & Co. of Leeds in 1904, {{which were the}} first 2-6-4T locomotives to run in Britain - the first standard gauge examples being the Great Central Railway's Class 1B of 1914. Number 1 was named E.R. Calthrop, after the line's engineer, and number 2 was named J.B. Earle (the resident engineer). Due {{to the influence of}} Calthrop, the locomotives had a somewhat colonial appearance with large headlights which were never used. They also had fittings for <b>cow</b> <b>catchers</b> - again never fitted, and they sported rerailing jacks by the smokebox. The locos were originally painted brown with gold and black lining, after the grouping replaced by crimson lake with gold and black lining. Latterly, after the Great Depression had set in, they ran in plain black.|$|R
