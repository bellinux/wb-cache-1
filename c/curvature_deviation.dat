40|$|In this work, a {{new method}} for mesh {{simplification}} and surface reconstruction {{specifically designed for}} the needs of CAD/CAM engineering design and analysis is introduced. The method simplifies the original free-form face model by first constructing restricted <b>curvature</b> <b>deviation</b> regions, generating a boundary conforming finite element quadrilateral mesh of the regions, and then fitting a smooth surface over the quadrilateral mesh using the plate energy method. It is more general in scope than existing methods because it handles models with free-form faces and non-manifold geometry, not just triangular or polygonal faces. It produces a high-quality quadrilateral mesh which is suited for both Finite Element Analysis and CAD/CAM. The smooth surface obtained by energy functional stabilization over limited curvature regions preserves the number of quadrilateral elements, and is best suited for surface modeling.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the tangent-plane n-atic bond-orientational order on a deformable spherical vesicle to explore continuous shape changes {{accompanied by the}} development of quasi-long-range order below the critical temperature. The n-atic order parameter ψ = ψ 0 einΘ, in which Θ denotes a local bond orientation, describes vector, nematic and hexatic orders for n = 1, 2 and 6 respectively. Since the total vorticity of the local order parameter on a surface of genus zero is constrained to 2 by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the ordered phase on a spherical surface should have 2 n topological vortices of minimum strength 1 /n. Using the phenomenological model including a gauge coupling between the n-atic order and the curvature, we find that vortices tend to be separated as far as possible at the cost of local bending, resulting in a non-spherical equilibrium shape, although the tangent-plane n-atic order expels the local <b>curvature</b> <b>deviation</b> from the spherical surface in the ordered phase. Thus the spherical surface above the transition temperature transforms into ellipsoidal, tetrahedral, octahedral, icosahedral and dodecahedral surfaces along with the development of the n-atic order below the transition temperature for n = 1, 2, 3, 6 and 10 respectively. close 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of DNA structural fluctuations {{at room temperature}} is generally modelled with a simple one-dimensional worm-like elastic model that approximates {{the energy of the}} DNA deformations from its intrinsic sequence-dependent curvature as proportional to the square of the <b>curvature</b> <b>deviations,</b> although this approximation should be suitable for small deformations of B-DNA canonical structure. Although the high curvature of DNA in nucleosomes exclude the first order elasticity approach, the high-resolution structures of the nucleosome show that DNA essentially retains the B conformation following an almost cylindrical super-helix. However, a few significant kinks largely independent of sequence are present; in fact, the distortion energy evaluated adopting the canonical persistence length of 50 nm is in the range of base pair stacking energies. This means that unstaking of some dinucleotide steps could occur in phase along the sequence as it appears in the X-ray nucleosome structures, probably at TA sequence positions, due to the lowest stacking energy proper of this dinucleotide. The good results in predicting the thermodynamic stability of nucleosomes obtained adopting elastic models suggest the hypothesis that the DNA super-helical distortion involved in the elastic model represents an ideal fitting, almost equivalent in energy, of the actual nucleosomal structures, which is the result of local structural arrangements optimized according to the different specific histone-DNA interactions along the sequence...|$|R

40|$|Many image {{processing}} problems require {{the enhancement of}} crossing elongated structures. These problems cannot easily be solved by commonly used coherence-enhancing diffusion methods. Therefore, we propose a method for coherence-enhancing diffusion on the invertible orientation score of a 2 D image. In an orientation score, the local orientation is represented by an additional third dimension, ensuring that crossing elongated structures are separated from each other. We consider orientation scores as functions on the Euclidean motion group, and use the group structure to apply left-invariant diffusion equations on orientation scores. We describe how we can calculate regularized left-invariant derivatives, and use the Hessian to estimate three descriptive local features: <b>curvature,</b> <b>deviation</b> from horizontality, and orientation confidence. These local features are used to adapt a nonlinear coherence-enhancing, crossing-preserving, diffusion equation on the orientation score. We propose two explicit finite-difference schemes to apply the nonlinear diffusion in the orientation score and provide a stability analysis. Experiments on both artificial and medical images show that preservation of crossings is the main advantage compared to standard coherence-enhancing diffusion. The use of curvature leads to improved enhancement of curves with high curvature. Furthermore, the use of deviation from horizontality makes it feasible {{to reduce the number}} of sampled orientations while still preserving crossings...|$|E

We also studied the associations between dopaminergic pharmacotherapy and scoliosis (defined by a spinal <b>curvature</b> <b>deviation</b> of 10 ° or larger). MethodsaaThe study population comprised 97 patients (42 men and 55 women) with idiopathic PD. All of the patients submitted to a whole-spine scanograph to allow measurement of the degree of scoliosis by Cobb’s method. ResultsaaTrue scoliosis was found in 32 of the 97 PD patients, and was observed more frequently in women than in men (28 vs. 4, respectively; p= 0. 006). The age of patients without scoliosis was significantly lower than that of those with scoliosis (66. 5 ± 9. 2 years vs. 72. 8 ± 7. 3 years, respectively, mean±SD, p< 0. 001). There was no correlation between PD symptom laterality and scoliosis. The rate of occurrence of scoliosis did not differ between de novo and levodopa (Ldopa) -treated patients. ConclusionsaaWe suggest that neither L-dopa treatment nor the laterality of the initial symptoms of PD is related to the appearance of scoliosis.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that viable {{architectural}} structures can be identified by locating the critical points of the gravitational potential energy congruent with some fixed surface metric. This is because, if the walls are thin, the lowest energy modes of deformation are strain-free, and thus described by surface isometries. If it is to stand, however, an arch had better possess some minimum rigidity. The bending energy consistent with this construction protocol, we will show, can only depend on <b>curvature</b> <b>deviations</b> away from the reference equilibrium form. The question of stability, like the determination of equilibrium, turns on the geometry. We show how to construct the self-adjoint operator controlling the response to deformations consistent with isometry. As illustration, we reassess the stability of a simple catenary arch in terms of the behavior of the ground state of this operator. The energy of this state increases monotonically with the bending rigidity and it is possible to identify the critical rigidity above which the arch is rendered stable. While this dependence may be monotonic, it exhibits a number of subcritical kinks indicating significant qualitative changes in the ground state associated with eigenvalue crossovers among the unstable modes in the spectrum; the number of such competing modes increasing rapidly as the rigidity is lowered. The initial collapse of a subcritical arch is controlled by the ground state; on the critical threshold, there are two unstable modes of equal energy, one raising the arch at its center, the other lowering it. The latter dominates as the instability grows. The qualitative behavior of the ground state changes as the rigidity is lowered [...] -its nodal pattern as well as its parity undergoing abrupt changes as the intervals between crossovers converge [...] -complicating the prediction of the dominant initial mode of collapse.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the morphological changes in the root canal trajectory on extracted teeth after preparation with Endoflare/Revo-S®, Endoflare/HeroShaper® and ProTaper® using Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). Methods: 39 root canals with similar curvatures were divided into three homogeneous groups (n =  13). Root canals in Group 1 were shaped with Endoflare/Revo-S®; Group 2 with Endoflare/Hero Shaper®, and Group 3 with ProTaper®. All specimens were scanned pre- and postoperatively using the Kodak® 9000 C 3 D imaging system. Changes in both degree and position of the root canal curvature were assessed. Canal transportation was calculated for each slice by comparing the position of the root canal centroid before and after instrumentation. Statistical analysis was carried out by the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test (p <  0. 05), and Mann–Whitney test applying the Bonferroni correction (p <  0. 05). Results: The mean of curvature degree decreases significantly (p <  0. 003) for each group, with no statistical differences between the three groups. Mean canal transportation scores ranged from 52  μm (Revo-S®) to 85  μm (ProTaper®) in the apical third; 51  μm (Revo-S®) to 87  μm (ProTaper®) in the middle third, and 77  μm (HEROShaper®) to 119  μm (ProTaper®) in the cervical third. In the apical and the middle parts, Revo-S® produced statistically less transportation than HEROShaper® (respectively p =  0. 01708, p =  0. 01328) and ProTaper® (respectively p =  0. 02402, p =  0. 0202).

Each individual joint (prismatic joint or revolute joint) is modeled as a linear spring stiffness. The object mass and the link masses are also included. We consider not only pure rolling contact but also frictionless sliding contact. The grasp stability is investigated using the potential energy method. This paper makes the following contributions: (i) Grasp wrench vectors and grasp stiffness matrices are analytically derived {{not only for}} the rolling contact but also for the sliding contact; (ii) It is shown in detail that the vectors and the matrices are given by functions of grasp parameters such as the contact conditions (rolling contact and sliding contact), the contact position, the contact force, the local curvature, the link shape, the object mass, the link masses, and so on; (iii) By using positive definiteness of the difference matrix of the grasp stiffness matrices, it is analytically proved that the rolling contact grasp is more stable than the sliding contact grasp. The displacement direction affected by the contact condition deviation is derived; (iv) By using positive definiteness of the differential matrix with respect to the local curvatures, it is analytically proved that the grasp stability increases when the local curvatures decrease. The displacement direction affected by the local <b>curvature</b> <b>deviation</b> is also derived; (v) Effects of the object mass and the joint positions are discussed using numerical examples.

The widths of slots made in plan-parallel plates of rock materials were measured both on the top and on the bottom. The difference between these widths has been used for evaluation of the taper—the angle of the cut walls inclination.

Idealized hydrologic responses reflect increased landscape connectivity with a distinct shift toward more rapid storm response shapes throughout the development process. Unexpectedly high temporal variance observed in the forested watershed across analyses indicates inherent differences in temporal digital topographic datasets. Results of this thesis highlight fundamental geomorphic changes caused by development practices while developing methods and rationale for temporal DEM-based geomorphic studies...|$|R
40|$|Spinal <b>curvature</b> and {{postural}} <b>deviation</b> {{are commonly}} found in female patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess the effect of applying a tailor-made posture correction girdle on patients with early scoliosis with the aim to help them to improve their imbalanced posture and reduce the likelihood of curve progression. A total of 10 subjects who were female adolescents with symptoms of early scoliosis were recruited through a school-screening program to undertake a 3 -month wear trial with the posture correction girdle. The Vicon motion capture system has also been employed to evaluate the short-term effectiveness of this therapeutic girdle on posture correction. The results show that the imbalanced posture of the subjects improves after the 3 -month wear trial, and the effect is particularly significant for the acromion in the frontal plane in a standing posture. Posture could be improved with posture training. This study shows that there is an improving trend in posture and effectiveness of motion control through the use of the posture correction girdle.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, thanks to high {{resolution}} DTMs derived by LiDAR technology, new methodologies for features extraction based on landform curvature have been developed. In a small dolomitic basin, the Rio Col Duro, a series of elaborations were carried out {{in order to test}} the effectiveness of these new methods for channel network recognition respect to traditional methods such as Area threshold, Slope-Area threshold, and Strahler order. Initially the traditional methods have been used at different DTM grid cell size. The results suggested that 1 m DTM should be considered as optimal for channel network extraction. Nevertheless compared to traditional methods landform curvature is proposed as a useful approach for channels extraction. It recognizes incision and convergence typical of channel morphology. The advantage to investigate micro-topography of an area, especially in the Alps, is crucial to understand the range of real morphological forms. Threshold values for channel network extraction calculated as multiples (1, 2 and 3 times) of <b>curvature</b> standard <b>deviation</b> have been used. Different kernels of curvature calculation have been applied to limit the “noise” and refine the extraction. Curvature, related only to geometric surface, is more suitable to describe real convergence in the area, even if it is not able to trace a continuous path in the drainage network. However, this method is useful only when using a high resolution DTM and an intermediate (not too small, not too large) kernel for curvature calculation. The traditional methods are still considered a valid approach for channel network extraction, but they identify channels also within large and uniform hillslopes where actual channelized forms are not present. Curvature is therefore proposed as a new challenge for such kind of analysis...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2 nd International Conference on Biomedical Electronics and Devices-BIODEVICES: Porto, Portugal: jan. 14 - 17, 2009 The {{incidence}} of {{problems related to}} rachialgiae is so frequent and usual {{that it must be}} studied {{as if it were an}} epidemic and social disease (Knoplich, 2003). Instruments that evaluate the spinal column in a standing position, in a global way, are needed to attain a better insight into this problem. This work presents a completely safe instrument to assess the evolution of all the vertebra locations throughout time, in order to study the biomechanical changes in women during pregnancy. A mechanical system, registered as Vertebral Metrics, with the objective of evaluating the <b>curvatures</b> and lateral <b>deviations</b> of the spinal column in the standing position was built. A measuring part, which is the body of the instrument, and a supporting part, where the previous part is mounted, constitute the new non-invasive instrument. The measuring part consists of 17 identical adjustable mechanical blocks that allow us to reproduce the position of each vertebra of the spinal column, from the first cervical vertebra o the first sacral vertebra. Vertebral Metrics was originally planned and built to be applied to pregnant women. However, after redefining dimensions of the different parts it can be applied to any type of population, in the future...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough many intact rock types {{can be very}} strong, a {{critical}} confining pressure can eventually be reached in triaxial testing, such that the Mohr shear strength envelope becomes horizontal. This critical state has recently been better defined, and correct <b>curvature</b> or correct <b>deviation</b> from linear Mohr–Coulomb (M-C) has finally been found. Standard shear testing procedures for rock joints, using multiple testing of the same sample, in case of insufficient samples, can be shown to exaggerate apparent cohesion. Even rough joints {{do not have any}} cohesion, but instead have very high friction angles at low stress, due to strong dilation. Rock masses, implying problems of large-scale interaction with engineering structures, may have both cohesive and frictional strength components. However, it is not correct to add these, following linear M-C or nonlinear Hoek–Brown (H-B) standard routines. Cohesion is broken at small strain, while friction is mobilized at larger strain and remains {{to the end of the}} shear deformation. The criterion ‘c then σn tan φ’ should replace ‘c plus σntan φ’ for improved fit to reality. Transformation of principal stresses to a shear plane seems to ignore mobilized dilation, and caused great experimental difficulties until understood. There seems to be plenty of room for continued research, so that errors of judgement of the last 50 years can be corrected...|$|R
40|$|Einstein {{has shown}} that the matter curves the space-time. In its model, the space-time is a {{mathematical}} conceptualization unifying the space and the time that accounts for measured physical phenomena (delay of the perihelion of Mercury, <b>deviation,</b> <b>curvature</b> of light by a large mass, relativity of length and time, propagation of gravitational waves, caused in particular by coalescence of black holes, which materialize by infinitesimal deformations DL / L of space-time (10 - 21)), etc. The question that then comes to mind is whether the mathematical conceptualization of space-time has a physical reality? In this case, what is the material of the fabric of the space-time that undulates or bends under gigantic masses in motion? Where, from a mechanical point of view, can we find an equivalent Young's modulus E to the fabric of the space-time? A first clue is the Casimir's force, which tells us that the vacuum of space is not empty [...] . From recent publications on the subject and simple analogies based on the strength of materials, we will show that if the E-module of space-time exists, it seems incommensurably large whatever the approach considered (elastic plates in 2 dimensions, plates analyzed by a tensor calculation in 4 dimensions, strings, Casimir force). In any case, only a measure of the latter would make it possible to decide definitively...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform the}} study of the {{stability}} of the Lorenz system by using the Jacobi stability analysis, or the Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory. The Lorenz model plays an important role for understanding hydrodynamic instabilities {{and the nature of the}} turbulence, also representing a non-trivial testing object for studying non-linear effects. The KCC theory represents a powerful mathematical method for the analysis of dynamical systems. In this approach we describe the evolution of the Lorenz system in geometric terms, by considering it as a geodesic in a Finsler space. By associating a non-linear connection and a Berwald type connection, five geometrical invariants are obtained, with the second invariant giving the Jacobi stability of the system. The Jacobi (in) stability is a natural generalization of the (in) stability of the geodesic flow on a differentiable manifold endowed with a metric (Riemannian or Finslerian) to the non-metric setting. In order to apply the KCC theory we reformulate the Lorenz system as a set of two second order non-linear differential equations. The geometric invariants associated to this system (nonlinear and Berwald connections), and the <b>deviation</b> <b>curvature</b> tensor, as well as its eigenvalues, are explicitly obtained. The Jacobi stability of the equilibrium points of the Lorenz system is studied, and the condition of the stability of the equilibrium points is obtained. Finally, we consider the time evolution of the components of the deviation vector near the equilibrium points. Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in Int.
