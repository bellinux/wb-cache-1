5|$|An {{important}} parameter {{determining the}} future {{evolution of the}} Universe theory is the density parameter, Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> of that density. This selects one of three possible geometries depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its <b>critical</b> <b>value,</b> or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E

40|$|Historically, it {{has been}} {{accepted}} practice for <b>critical</b> <b>values</b> for the Winsorized t test for independent samples {{to be based on}} adjusted degrees of freedom depending on the number of total non-Winsorized (approximate) values. Recently, a new such table of Winsorized <b>critical</b> <b>values</b> has been developed via approximate randomization by Monte Carlo simulation. Based on eight common data distributions estimated from Psychology and Education along with the normal and five Mathematical distributions, these two tables of values were compared with respect to robustness to types I and II errors through Monte Carlo simulations for one and 10 % Winsorized values per end. 20 % Winsorized results were generally non-robust for approximate <b>critical</b> <b>values</b> and mixed for Monte Carlo-derived <b>critical</b> <b>values.</b> With one Winsorized value per end, for small samples, type I error results generally support the use of the newly-developed table of Monte Carlo-derived <b>critical</b> <b>values</b> over the approximate <b>critical</b> <b>values.</b> For larger samples (one Winsorized value per end), approximate <b>critical</b> <b>values</b> become increasingly robust (in most cases, stringently-so for samples of 90 or more) to type I error while maintaining an advantage over Monte Carlo-derived <b>critical</b> <b>values</b> with respect to type II error...|$|R

5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} Universe {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe. Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that is very close to the <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|E

25|$|At {{any given}} instant, the {{electron}} will naturally be pushed towards the lower-voltage {{side of the}} tube. The electron will then oscillate {{back and forth as}} the voltage changes. At the same time, a strong magnetic field is applied, stronger than the <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> in the original design. This would normally cause the electron to circle back to the cathode, but due to the oscillating electrical field, the electron instead follows a looping path that continues toward the anodes.|$|E

25|$|At most {{points of}} the Riemann sphere, this {{transformation}} is a local homeomorphism: it maps a small disk centered {{at any point in}} a one-to-one way into another disk. However, at certain critical points, the mapping is more complicated, and maps a disk centered at the point in a k-to-one way onto its image. The number k is known as the degree of the critical point and the transformed image of a critical point is known as a <b>critical</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{superconductor}} {{with little}} or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In Type I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> Hc. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a baroque pattern of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. In Type II superconductors, raising the applied field past a <b>critical</b> <b>value</b> H'c1 leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength H'c2, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are TypeI, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are TypeII.|$|E

25|$|A {{narrow band}} or {{strongly}} correlated electronic system and degenerated ground states are important points to understand in explaining superconductivity in fullerene solids. When the inter-electron repulsion U {{is greater than}} the bandwidth, an insulating localized electron ground state is produced in the simple Mott–Hubbard model. This explains the absence of superconductivity at ambient pressure in caesium-doped C60 solids. Electron-correlation-driven localization of the t1u electrons exceeds the <b>critical</b> <b>value,</b> leading to the Mott insulator. The application of high pressure decreases the interfullerene spacing, therefore caesium-doped C60 solids turn to metallic and superconducting.|$|E
25|$|Since {{all of the}} {{electrons}} in the flow experienced this looping motion, the amount of RF energy being radiated was greatly improved. And as the motion occurred at any field level beyond the <b>critical</b> <b>value,</b> {{it was no longer}} necessary to carefully tune the fields and voltages, and the overall stability of the device was greatly improved. Unfortunately, the higher field also meant that electrons often circled back to the cathode, depositing their energy on it and causing it to heat up. As this normally causes more electrons to be released, it could sometimes lead to a runaway effect, damaging the device.|$|E
