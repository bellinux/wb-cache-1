5|$|Throughout {{his time}} in the General Assembly, Breckinridge had battled with typhoid fever. In an 1828 letter to his wife, who was visiting {{relatives}} in Virginia, he recounted that he had been bedridden and near death for two months. Finally, in February 1829, the illness subsided. Only then <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> told about the death of his daughter, Louisiana, which had occurred a month earlier. The illness, combined with the news of the death of his daughter, caused Breckinridge to turn to religion.|$|E
500|$|Edward III of England married John of Gaunt, {{his third}} {{surviving}} son, to Henry's heiress Blanche of Lancaster. On Henry's death, Edward conferred on Gaunt the second {{creation of the}} title of Duke of Lancaster, which made Gaunt, after Edward, the wealthiest landowner in England. Gaunt enjoyed great political influence during his lifetime, but upon his death in 1399 his lands were confiscated by Richard II. [...] Gaunt's exiled son and heir Henry of Bolingbroke returned home and gathered military support in clear contravention of Richard's treason act of 1397, which included a definition of treason [...] of [...] "or ... raiseth People and rideth against the King to make War within his Realm ...". Although he claimed his aim was restoration of his Lancaster inheritance, this Act and Henry's knowledge of Richard's charactersuspicious and vindictiveprobably meant Henry knew that only by removing Richard from power <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> secure. Henry unified popular opposition to Richard II, {{took control of the}} kingdom and Richardrecognising that he had insufficient support to resistsurrendered to Henry’s forces at Conwy Castle. Henry instigated a commission to decide who should be king. Richard was forced to abdicate and although Henry was not next in line, he was chosen by an unlawfully constituted parliament dominated by his supporters. After the first unrest of his reign and a revolt by the Earls of Salisbury, Gloucester, Exeter and Surrey, Richard reputedly starved to death. There is some debate as to whether this was self-inflicted or ordered by Henry to end the risk of restoration without leaving incriminating marks on the body.|$|E

2500|$|In Knut Hamsun's 1892 novel Mysteries, the characters, on {{a couple}} of occasions, briefly discuss Charles Stewart Parnell, {{particularly}} in relation to Gladstone: [...] "Dr. Stenerson had a high opinion of Parnell, but if Gladstone was so opposed to him, he must know what he was about—with apologies to the host, Mr. Nagel, who couldn't forgive Gladstone for being an honourable man". Parnell's death shocks the character Eleanor in Virginia Woolf's novel The Years, published in 1937: [...] "...how <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> dead?

This came about because Novatian had allegedly made himself antipope; Cornelius was emphasizing the perceived need for recognition of one bishop, one head of the Church.|$|E
2500|$|Evangelical writer Donald Macleod {{suggests}} that the sinless nature of Jesus Christ involves two elements. [...] "First, Christ was free of actual sin." [...] Studying the gospels there is no reference to Jesus praying for the forgiveness of sin, nor confessing sin. The assertion is that Jesus did not commit sin, nor <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> proven guilty of sin; he had no vices. In fact, he is quoted as asking, [...] "Can any of you prove me guilty of sin?" [...] in John 8:46. [...] "Secondly, he was free from inherent sin ("original sin" [...] or [...] "ancestral sin")." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Culavamsa states {{only that}} Parākramabāhu [...] "carried on rule for thirty-three years", {{and that he}} died in Polonnaruwa. He was succeeded by Vijayabahu II of Polonnaruwa, {{described}} as his [...] "sister's son", who he had summoned from Sinhapura, capital of Kalinga. It {{is highly unlikely that}} Vijayabahu was son of either Pabhavati or Mitta, Parākramabāhu's sisters who were married to Manabharana of Ruhuna, as this would not explain why he had to be summoned from Kalinga. Nor <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> son of Gajabahu and Bhaddavati, the other named sister of the king, as the Culavamsa explicitly states that Gajabahu had no sons who outlived him. It has been postulated that Vijayabahu was in fact the son of an unknown fourth sister who had been married to a king of Kalinga. His place of burial is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926 Luckner raised {{funds to}} buy a sailing ship which he called the Vaterland and he {{set out on a}} {{goodwill}} mission around the world, leaving Bremen on 19 September and arriving in New York on 22 October 1926. An entertaining speaker, he was widely admired for his seamanship and for having fought his war with such a minimal loss of life. This opened many doors for him in the United States, where he spoke on hundreds of occasions across the country, both in German and later, increasingly, in English. He won the support of many notable people, including diplomats, politicians, and even some of the American Legion. Henry Ford presented Luckner with a motor car, and the city of San Francisco made him an honorary citizen. US President Calvin Coolidge wanted to meet him, but Luckner declined at the request of his government. Feeling that his [...] "goodwill mission", as he called it in his travelogue, Seeteufel erobert Amerika ("Sea-devil conquers America"), could neither have greater success elsewhere, nor <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> financially sustained by the income as a speaker, however popular and successful; he returned to Germany, where he arrived on 19 April 1928.|$|E
