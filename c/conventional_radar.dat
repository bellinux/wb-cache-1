25|$|The CDS {{system worked}} by storing the X and Y {{positions}} as voltages.

Along the side of the display was a series of buttons that allowed the operator to indicate that they had placed the cursor on one of up to eight targets.|$|E

These examples provide a better view in the estimation of the rainfall by Polarimetric rainfall. The paper produces details about the rain drop size and shape, rain drop distribution, areal mean rate values, average drop sizes and various concordances are discussed here. Moreover the properties and parametric values of rain fall and its estimates, β and axis ratio relation are also described in this paper...|$|R
25|$|The DEW Line was {{proposed}} {{as a solution}} to both of these problems, using <b>conventional</b> <b>radar</b> systems that could both detect and characterize an attack, while being located far to the north where they would offer hours of advanced warning. This would not only provide ample time for the defenses to prepare, but also allow the Strategic Air Command to get its active aircraft airborne long before Soviet bombers could reach their bases. The need was considered critical and the construction was given the highest national priorities. Advanced site preparation began in December 1954, and the construction was carried out in a massive logistical operation that took place mostly during the summer months when the sites could be reached by ships. The 63-base Line reached operational status in 1957. The MCL was shut down in the early 1960s, and much of the Pinetree line was given over to civilian use.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of the TRR solved a problem with early pulse radar units. It {{is relatively easy to}} jam a <b>conventional</b> <b>radar</b> by sending out additional pulses of radio signal on the same frequency. Unless the transmitter has encoded some additional form of information in the signal, the receiver cannot determine which pulse it sent out and which is from the jammer. Note that this has no effect on the determination of the direction to the target, which is the same for both the original and jammer pulses. However, it makes the determination of range difficult or impossible. The TRR solves this problem by providing a separate ranging system on another frequency. By making the signal wide-frequency, the jammer has to likewise broadcast across a similar bandwidth, limiting the energy in any one frequency and allowing the operator to tune the receiver to find an unjammed band. Combining range from the TRR and direction from the TTR provided complete information on the target.|$|E

40|$|<b>Conventional</b> <b>radars,</b> {{used for}} {{atmospheric}} remote sensing, usually operate {{at a single}} polarization and frequency to estimate storm parameters such as rainfall and water content. Because of the complex structure of hydrometeors <b>conventional</b> <b>radars</b> do not succeed in obtaining detailed information because they just use horizontal reflectivity. For these reasons, the potentiality of the dual polarized weather radar is investigated, {{in order to have}} better rainfall estimates and more thorough ground-clutter removal, using horizontal and differential reflectivity at the same time. In this light, a radar meteorology campaign was conducted over the city of Rome (Italy), using measurements collected by the polarimetric Doppler radar Polar 55 C located in the South-East of the city at a distance of 15 km from the downtown and by a raingauge network. The goodness of the results is tested by comparison of radar rainfall estimates with raingauges rainfall measurements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSpace-time {{adaptive}} processing (STAP) is {{an effective}} method adopted in airborne radar to suppress ground clutter. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is a new radar concept and has superiority over <b>conventional</b> <b>radars.</b> Recent proposals have been applying STAP in MIMO configuration to {{the improvement of the}} performance of <b>conventional</b> <b>radars.</b> As waveforms transmitted by MIMO radar can be correlated or uncorrelated with each other, this article develops a unified signal model incorporating waveforms for STAP in MIMO radar with waveform diversity. Through this framework, STAP performances are expressed as functions of the waveform covariance matrix (WCM). Then, effects of waveforms can be investigated. The sensitivity, i. e., the maximum range detectable, is shown to be proportional to the maximum eigenvalue of WCM. Both theoretical studies and numerical simulation examples illustrate the waveform effects on the sensitivity of MIMO STAP radar, based on which we can make better trade-off between waveforms to achieve optimal system performance...|$|R
2500|$|The initial {{development}} {{and design of}} ARPAs were stand-alone units. That is because {{they were designed to}} be an addition to the <b>conventional</b> <b>radar</b> unit.

40|$|Conventional multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar is a {{flexible}} technique which enjoys {{the advantages of}} phased-array radar without sacrificing its main advantages. However, due to its range-independent directivity, MIMO radar cannot mitigate nondesirable range-dependent interferences. In this paper, we propose a range-dependent interference suppression approach via frequency diverse array (FDA) MIMO radar, which offers a beamforming-based solution to suppress range-dependent interferences and thus yields much better DOA estimation performance than <b>conventional</b> MIMO <b>radar.</b> More importantly, the interferences located at the same angle but different ranges can be effectively suppressed by the range-dependent beamforming, which cannot be achieved by <b>conventional</b> MIMO <b>radar.</b> The beamforming performance as compared to <b>conventional</b> MIMO <b>radar</b> is examined by analyzing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).
