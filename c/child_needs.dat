The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every <b>child</b> <b>needs</b> to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E

Schooling can begin earlier, from 3–6, in kindergarten. Preschool education usually lasts for 2 years, before they proceed to primary school at age 7. There is no formal preschool curriculum except a formal mandatory training and certification for principals and teachers before they may operate a preschool. The training covers lessons on child psychology, teaching methodologies, and other related curricula on childcare and development. Preschool education is not compulsory.|$|E

Since holistic education seeks to educate the whole person, there are some key factors that are essential to this type of education. First, <b>children</b> <b>need</b> to learn about themselves. This involves learning self-respect and self-esteem. Second, <b>children</b> <b>need</b> to learn about relationships. In learning about their relationships with others, there is a focus on social [...] "literacy" [...] (learning to see social influence) andemotional [...] "literacy" [...] (one's own self in relation to others). Third, <b>children</b> <b>need</b> to learn about resilience. This entails overcoming difficulties, facing challenges and learning how to ensure long-term success. Fourth, <b>children</b> <b>need</b> to learn about aesthetics - This encourages the student to see the beauty of what is around them and learn to have awe in life.|$|R
25|$|F64.2 Gender {{identity}} {{disorder of}} childhood: A disorder, usually first manifest during early childhood (and always well before puberty), {{characterized by a}} persistent and intense distress about assigned sex, together {{with a desire to}} be (or insistence that one is) of the other sex. There is a persistent preoccupation with the dress and activities of the opposite sex and repudiation of the individual's own sex. The diagnosis requires a profound disturbance of the normal gender identity; mere tomboyishness in girls or girlish behavior in boys is not sufficient. Gender identity disorders in individuals who have reached or are entering puberty should not be classified here but in F66.0.In the DSM of mental disorders used by psychologists in the United States, gender identity disorder is given two sets of criteria. Criterion A indicates that a child identifies {{as a member of the}} opposite sex. The <b>child</b> <b>needs</b> to demonstrate four of the five following symptoms: dressing as a member of the opposite sex, primarily befriending members of the opposite sex, demonstrating a desire to engage in play activities characteristic of the opposite sex, and actively stating that they wish to be the opposite sex. Criterion B, on the other hand, indicates that the child does not identify with the sex they were born. This could manifest itself as a dislike of styles of dress characteristic of the sex they were born, avoidance of association with members of their born sex, and distress towards the aspects of their physiology which indicate their born gender (Bradley, Zucker, 1997).|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} ideasthesia bears {{implications}} for understanding how synesthesia develops in children. Synesthetic children may associate concrete sensory-like experiences {{primarily to the}} abstract concepts that they have otherwise difficulties dealing with. Synesthesia may thus {{be used as a}} cognitive tool to cope with the abstractness of the learning materials imposed by the educational system [...] referred to also as a [...] "semantic vacuum hypothesis". This hypothesis explains why the most common inducers in synesthesia are graphemes and time units [...] both relating to the first truly abstract ideas that a <b>child</b> <b>needs</b> to master.|$|E
500|$|The {{state of}} affairs in which the child did not have this {{relationship}} he termed [...] "maternal deprivation". This term covered a range from almost complete deprivation, not uncommon in institutions, residential nurseries and hospitals, to partial deprivation where the mother, or mother substitute, was unable to give the loving care a small <b>child</b> <b>needs,</b> to mild deprivation where the child {{was removed from the}} mother's care but was looked after by someone familiar whom he trusted. Complete or almost complete deprivation could [...] "entirely cripple the capacity to make relationships". Partial deprivation could result in acute anxiety, depression, neediness and powerful emotions which the child could not regulate. The end product of such psychic disturbance could be neurosis and instability of character. However, the main focus of the monograph was on the more extreme forms of deprivation. The focus was the child's developing relationships with his mother and father and disturbed parent–child relationships in the context of almost complete deprivation rather than the earlier concept of the [...] "broken home" [...] as such.|$|E

2500|$|Two leading feminist Muslim {{scholars}} {{who are seeking}} to increase women's rights through the reinterpretation of religious texts are Amina Wadud and Asma Barlas. [...] Both women embrace Islam as a religion that preaches gender equality. [...] They see societal practices, not Islam, as the main problem. [...] Wadud points out the three reasons that the Qur'an views as acceptable forms of polygyny: if the husband is not sexually satisfied he may take another wife rather than turn to prostitutes or an affair, if the first wife is unable to reproduce or another woman with <b>child</b> <b>needs</b> {{to be taken care}} of, and/or if the husband is financially stable enough to care for another woman in the Muslim community. According to Wadud, the form of polygyny that the Qur'an supports focuses on [...] "justice: dealing justly, managing funds justly, justice to the orphans, and justice to the wives." [...] Barlas, who published her theological research several years later, argues a very similar point. [...] Both feminist scholars point out the origin of the Islamic theory of polygyny in Ayah 4:3. [...] This verse of the Qur'an was not meant to utilize polygyny as a way to oppress women, but to ensure that they were taken care of.|$|E

60|$|But if {{the child}} thus seeks the mother, does it then know the mother alone? To an infant the mother is the whole universe. Yet the <b>child</b> <b>needs</b> more than the mother. It needs as well the {{presence}} of men, the vibration from the present body of the man. There may not be any actual, palpable connection. But from the great voluntary center in the man pass unknowable communications and unreliable nourishment of the stream of manly blood, rays which we cannot see, and which {{so far we have}} refused to know, but none the less essential, quickening dark rays which pass from the great dark abdominal life-center in the father to the corresponding center in the child. And these rays, these vibrations, are not like the mother-vibrations. Far, far from it. They do not need the actual contact, the handling and the caressing. On the contrary, the true male instinct is to avoid physical contact with a baby. It may not need even actual presence. But present or absent, there should be between the baby and the father that strange, intangible communication, that strange pull and circuit such as the magnetic pole exercises upon a needle, a vitalistic pull and flow which lays all the life-plasm of the baby into the line of vital quickening, strength, knowing. And any lack of this vital circuit, this vital interchange between father and child, man and child, means an inevitable impoverishment to the infant.|$|E
60|$|To {{make matters}} worse, doctors are hideously poor. The Irish gentleman doctor of my boyhood, who took {{nothing less than}} a guinea, though he might pay you four visits for it, seems to have no {{equivalent}} nowadays in English society. Better be a railway porter than an ordinary English general practitioner. A railway porter has from eighteen to twenty-three shillings a week from the Company merely as a retainer; and his additional fees from the public, if we leave the third-class twopenny tip out of account (and I am by no means sure that even this reservation need be made), are equivalent to doctor's fees in the case of second-class passengers, and double doctor's fees in the case of first. Any class of educated men thus treated tends to become a brigand class, and doctors are no exception to the rule. They are offered disgraceful prices for advice and medicine. Their patients are for the most part so poor and so ignorant that good advice would be resented as impracticable and wounding. When you are so poor that you cannot afford to refuse eighteenpence from a man who is too poor to pay you any more, it is useless to tell him that what he or his sick <b>child</b> <b>needs</b> is not medicine, but more leisure, better clothes, better food, and a better drained and ventilated house. It is kinder to give him a bottle of something almost as cheap as water, and tell him to come again with another eighteenpence if it does not cure him. When you have done that over and over again every day for a week, how much scientific conscience have you left? If you are weak-minded enough to cling desperately to your eighteenpence as denoting a certain social superiority to the sixpenny doctor, you will be miserably poor all your life; whilst the sixpenny doctor, with his low prices and quick turnover of patients, visibly makes much more than you do and kills no more people.|$|E
60|$|And now--to {{end this}} lecture with more {{pleasing}} thoughts--What becomes of this breath which passes from your lips? Is it merely harmful; merely waste? God forbid! God has forbidden that anything should be merely harmful or merely waste in this so wise and well-made world. The carbonic acid which passes from your lips at every breath--ay, even that which oozes from the volcano crater when the eruption is past--is a precious boon {{to thousands of}} things of which you have daily need. Indeed there {{is a sort of}} hint at physical truth in the old fairy tale of the girl, from whose lips, as she spoke, fell pearls and diamonds; for the carbonic acid of your breath may help hereafter to make the pure carbonate of lime of a pearl, or the still purer carbon of a diamond. Nay, it may go--in such a world of transformations do we live--to make atoms of coal strata, which after being buried for ages beneath deep seas, shall be upheaved in continents which are yet unborn, and there be burnt for the use of a future race of men, and resolved into their original elements. Coal, wise men tell us, is on the whole breath and sunlight; the breath of living creatures who have lived in the vast swamps and forests of some primeval world, and the sunlight which transmuted that breath into the leaves and stems of trees, magically locked up for ages in that black stone, to become, when it is burnt at last, light and carbonic acid as it was at first. For though you must not breathe your breath again, you may at least eat your breath, if you will allow the sun to transmute it for you into vegetables; or you may enjoy its fragrance and its colour {{in the shape of a}} lily or a rose. When you walk in a sunlit garden, every word you speak, every breath you breathe, is feeding the plants and flowers around. The delicate surface of the green leaves absorbs the carbonic acid, and parts it into its elements, retaining the carbon to make woody fibre, and courteously returning you the oxygen to mingle with the fresh air, and be inhaled by your lungs once more. Thus do you feed the plants; just as the plants feed you: while the great life-giving sun feeds both; and the geranium standing in the sick child's window does not merely rejoice his eye and mind by its beauty and freshness, but repays honestly the trouble spent on it; absorbing the breath which the <b>child</b> <b>needs</b> not, and giving to him the breath which he needs.|$|E
