5|$|Hood {{needed to}} defend the city of Atlanta, which was an {{important}} rail hub and industrial center for the Confederacy, but his army was small {{in comparison to the}} armies that Sherman commanded.

5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily <b>come</b> <b>forward,</b> a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E

The members of the ACLT freely volunteer their time in attempting to raise awareness in the Black community; enabling potential donors to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> and be involved in the process of offering hope and a healthy future to someone whose disorder may otherwise prove fatal. Dixon has also backed Nickelodeon's See Something, Say Something campaign, a UK anti-bullying initiative.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{rumination}} in {{otherwise healthy}} adults became decreasingly rare {{starting in the}} 1900s, {{and the majority of}} published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally healthy patients appeared thereafter. At first, adult rumination was described and treated as a benign condition. It is now described as otherwise. While the base of patients to examine has gradually increased as more and more people <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> with their symptoms, awareness of the condition by the medical community and the general public is still limited.|$|E
5|$|The Country Wife {{was first}} {{performed}} in January 1675, by the King's Company, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. This luxurious playhouse, designed by Christopher Wren and with room for 2,000 spectators, had opened only the year before. It was of compact design, retaining {{in spite of}} its large seating capacity much of the intimate actor/audience contact of the Elizabethan theatre, still with an almost Elizabethan-size forestage or apron stage, on which actors would <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> for maximum audience contact.|$|E
50|$|It was {{initially}} unknown {{who built the}} original version, and it remained a local mystery for 25 years until Gene Stilp, a local activist, <b>came</b> <b>forward</b> and admitted to constructing the initial replica.

5|$|Ultimately, B Company {{succeeded in}} holding their hastily {{constructed}} defensive positions {{throughout the night}} and until 05:00 on 8 October when the Chinese finally gave up. In order to preserve its remaining strength, the Chinese 191st Division was forced to pull back by , surrendering the control of Hill 217 without a fight. At first light more than 120 Chinese dead and wounded lay around the Australian defences and {{in contrast to the}} savage fighting during the night, Chinese stretcher parties were allowed to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> and collect their wounded under a flag of truce. The Australians had been victorious but were now exhausted after five days of heavy fighting.|$|E
5|$|As in the First World War, white Rhodesians {{volunteered for}} the forces readily and in large numbers. Over 2,700 had <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> before the war was three weeks old. Somewhat ironically, the Southern Rhodesian recruiters' main problem was not {{sourcing}} manpower but rather persuading men in strategically important occupations such as mining to stay home. Manpower controls were introduced to keep certain men in their civilian jobs. The SRAF accepted 500 recruits {{in the days following}} the outbreak of war, prompting its commander Group Captain CW Meredith to contact the Air Ministry in London with an offer to run a flying school and train three squadrons. This was accepted. In January 1940 the Southern Rhodesian government announced the establishment of an independent Air Ministry to oversee the Rhodesian Air Training Group, Southern Rhodesia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS).|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

5|$|Odin {{will make}} {{directly}} for Fenrir and the god Thor, by Odin's side, {{will be unable}} to help him because he will be fighting Jörmungandr. The god Freyr will engage the fiery being Surtr and, since Freyr lacks the sword he gave his servant Skírnir, Freyr will fall after a rough struggle. The god Tyr will fight the hound Garmr and the two will kill one another. Thor will kill the serpent Jörmungandr but after nine steps will collapse to the ground, dead from Jörmungandr's venom. Fenrir will eat Odin, but immediately after Odin's son Víðarr will <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> and set his foot on to the wolf's lower jaw, and grasp its upper jaw, ripping its mouth apart, killing it. Loki and Heimdallr will kill one another and, after their death, Surtr will spray fire over the earth and burn the entire world.|$|E
5|$|Wartime proved hard on {{the film}} business. On September 23, 1915, Famous Players {{informed}} McKernan that “On account of the boat Hesperian having been torpedoed by a German submarine, {{it will be necessary}} to skip two Weeklies (short films), these having <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> to ourselves from our London representative via this boat. Regretting this occurrence, and trusting you will appreciate our position on this...”. McKernan’s supply of new films was decreased as the war dragged on, and McKernan advertised less and less frequently. Further complicating things, parts for the theatre’s Edison and Simplex projectors were difficult to come by at the best of times, and the complex machines proved difficult to maintain. McKernan did not live to see business pick up. He contracted Spanish Influenza and pneumonia in rapid succession, and died on February 18, 1919.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Jordan's storyline {{in which}} his former nanny writes a tell-all book {{revealing}} {{that he has never}} actually had an affair with anyone mirrored—though in reversal—the real life of professional golfer Tiger Woods' extramarital affairs scandal that occurred in late 2009. In one scene, it is revealed that women have <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> admitting to never have had a sexual relationship with Tracy; After news broke of Woods's infidelities, numerous women came forward admitting to having affairs with the golfer. To re-establish his womanizing persona, Tracy holds a press conference announcing he is leaving show business {{to spend more time with}} a stripper; In December 2009, Woods announced he would take an indefinite leave from professional golf to focus on his marriage after he admitted infidelity. Other women, who Tracy did not have a relationship with, have released voice mails to the news media. In one of them, Tracy leaves a message to his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), in which he is loving and sincere in the message; One of Woods's mistress produced voice and text messages as evidence of a relationship with the golfer. As a result of him being outed as monogamous, Tracy loses various endorsements; After admitting to his affairs, Woods lost various endorsement deals with different companies.|$|E

5|$|The {{meeting on}} 17 January was crowded. Many {{attendees}} were not electors, as franchise {{was attached to}} land ownership in excess of £50, or yearly rental over £10, and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long, including absentee owners in England. There had been rumours beforehand that somebody would <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> to oppose Sewell. William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting. Sewell spoke at length about various issues: {{that he should be}} elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis, that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the issues, that he had no conflict of interest with the steam ship company that provided New Zealand's postal service with England, {{that he did not have}} land holdings in the North Island more valuable than holdings in Canterbury, that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony last year. He disagreed with Stafford's government on some issues. The two most important disagreements were land policy, where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments, rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in the north, and native policy, where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori; in fact, the First Taranaki War started in March 1860. As a solution, Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries; this was the first time, as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware, that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician. The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel, and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862. The Lyttelton Times argued, against the objection of many, that such an idea had merit for further consideration.|$|E
5|$|With the Australian and Viet Cong {{positions}} now {{too close}} to each other, O'Halloran could neither move forward nor withdraw. Artillery began to fire {{in support of the}} Australians, however it initially fell too far to the rear to be effective, and it had to be adjusted by the B Company forward observer, Captain Jim Ryan, himself under heavy fire. 5 Platoon was still in danger of becoming isolated and O'Brien now suggested he move A Company forward to assist B Company, however this was rejected by Mackay who feared the two companies clashing in the confusion. Meanwhile, O'Halloran called for the APCs to <b>come</b> <b>forward</b> to provide assistance, while the platoon sergeant—Sergeant Mervyn McCullough—guided a section from 6 Platoon forward to reinforce 5 Platoon, and begin evacuating the casualties. Bolstered by reinforcements and with accurate artillery covering fire O'Halloran now felt that he {{was in a position to}} extract his platoon. Yet at that moment two rounds from one of the howitzers fell short, and while one of the shells harmlessly exploded against a tree, the other landed just to the right of the 5 Platoon headquarters, killing two men and wounding eight others, including six of the seven reinforcements from 6 Platoon. Following an urgent radio call from O'Halloran, the artillery ceased fire. Shortly afterwards an RPG round hit the same area, wounding McCullough.|$|E

After Muhammad had {{announced that he had}} received a revelation confirming Aisha's innocence, he had her three of her accusers, who had <b>come</b> <b>forward,</b> punished by eighty lashes.
