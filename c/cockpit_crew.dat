5|$|In May 2009, it was {{reported}} that the airline terminated the assignments of 130 American contract Hawaii-based Boeing 747 pilots and closed its Oahu office. Japan-based JAL <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> now operates the five daily flights previously operated by the JALways crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight was}} {{under the command of}} an {{experienced}} <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew,</b> consisting of Captain Henrique Stefanini Di Sacco (53) and First Officer Kleyber Aguiar Lima (54). Both pilots had been flying for over 30 years. The Captain had accrued nearly 13,700 flight hours throughout his career and the First Officer had almost 14,800 hours of flying experience.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{development}} of the longer range 747-400 began. The variant had a new glass cockpit, which allowed for a <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> of two instead of three, new engines, lighter construction materials, and a redesigned interior. Development cost soared, and production delays occurred as new technologies were incorporated {{at the request of}} airlines. Insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 747-400. The -400 entered service in 1989.|$|E
40|$|Consider three {{facts about}} <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews.</b> One, <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> are teams. Two, the captain {{is the team}} leader. And three, <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> are richly entwined with the organizational, technological, and {{regulatory}} contexts in which they operate. None of these three facts is controversial. If taken seriously, however...|$|R
50|$|Microphones {{that work}} {{much like a}} stenomask are used by {{aircraft}} ground crews to communicate with <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> in airport environments with extreme engine noise, and are usually part of their headsets.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> always {{operate in}} an {{organizational}} context, and the transactions between {{the crew and}} representatives of that context (e. g., organizational managers, air traffic controllers) are consequential for any crew's performance. For a complete understanding of crew performance a look beyond the traditional focus on individual pilots is provided to see how team- and organization-level factors can enhance (or impede) the ability of even well-trained individuals to work together effectively. This {{way of thinking about}} <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> (that is, viewing them as teams that operate in organizations) offers some potentially useful avenues for thinking about next steps in the development of CRM training programs. Those possibilities are explored, emphasizing how they can enrich (not replace) individually-focussed CRM training...|$|R
5|$|Flight 2801 was a {{chartered}} flight {{flown by}} Vnukovo Airlines {{on behalf of}} Arktikugol, which operated mines at the two company towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden in Svalbard. The aircraft was a Tupolev Tu-154M, with registration RA-85621, serial number 86A 742 and date of manufacture 14 January 1987. The flight consisted of a crew of eleven, including a <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> of four (two aircraft pilots, one engineer and one navigator), a cabin crew of five and two technicians. The pilot in command (PiC) had previously landed at Svalbard Airport; the first officer had not and was the piloting pilot.|$|E
5|$|JAL Express (JEX) was {{established}} on April 1, 1997, as a wholly owned domestic subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines (JAL), {{with an initial}} capital of ¥5.8 million. The airline operates scheduled passenger services to regional domestic destinations in Japan, {{as well as some}} low-demand flights for JAL under wet-lease agreement. It was anticipated that the airline may enter services on the domestic trunk and short-haul international routes. On July 1, 1998, JAL Express commenced operations from Osaka to Miyazaki and Kagoshima with two Boeing 737-400s, non-Japanese <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew,</b> and short-term contracted cabin attendants. The airline's cabin attendants are called Sky Cast, their duties include cleaning the 150-seat cabin between flights.|$|E
25|$|On {{board the}} plane were six crew members, of which four were <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> {{and two were}} cabin crew.|$|E
50|$|Crew {{resource}} management {{grew out of}} the 1977 Tenerife airport disaster where two Boeing 747 aircraft collided on the runway killing 583 people. A few weeks later, NASA held a workshop on the topic, endorsing this innovative training. United Airlines was the first airline to provide CRM training for its <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> in 1981. By the 1990s, it had become a global standard.|$|R
50|$|Hackman (2003) {{emphasizes}} {{this point}} via {{an example of}} his previous research {{on the effectiveness of}} airline <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews.</b> The study looked at 300 crews from various airlines located in the U.S., Europe, and Asia (Hackman, 1993). The crews varied based on success, and the current barriers they were facing, which included things such as economic difficulty and other external stressors.|$|R

25|$|Civil Aviation Authority {{released}} the final investigation report comprising 78 pages on 21 January 2015. The {{report found that}} the primary causes of the accident include the ineffective management by the <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> of the basic flight parameters such as airspeed, altitude, descent rate, attitude, as well as thrust management. The report {{also found that the}} ineffective automated flight deck management in extreme adverse weather conditions by the <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> caused the accident.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} {{moments after the}} crash, the <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> told flight attendants to delay {{evacuating}} the aircraft as they were communicating with the tower. A flight attendant seated at the second door {{on the left side}} (door 2L) observed fire outside the aircraft near row 10 and informed the <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew,</b> at which point the evacuation order was given some 90 seconds after the aircraft came to rest. Flight attendants told NTSB investigators that there was no fire inside the cabin when the evacuation began.|$|E
500|$|The Tornado {{features}} a tandem-seat <b>cockpit,</b> <b>crewed</b> by a pilot and a navigator/weapons officer; both electromechanical and electro-optical controls {{are used to}} fly the aircraft and manage its systems. An array of dials and switches are mounted {{on either side of}} a centrally placed CRT monitor, controlling the navigational, communications, and weapons-control computers. BAE Systems developed the Tornado Advanced Radar Display Information System (TARDIS), a [...] multi-function display, to replace the rear cockpit's Combined Radar and Projected Map Display; the RAF began installing TARDIS on the GR4 fleet in 2004.|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} framework has been synthesized {{for the use}} of cognitive processes to understand team functions. Three different pilot-copilot-flight engineer <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> were observed {{over the course of a}} set of mission conducted in a B 727 simulator at NASA-Ames. Only experienced commercial aviators were used in positions for which they were officially qualified; one of the flights involved a generator malfunction, and another was marked by a serious fuel leak. All flights were videotaped and shown to the crews immediately after each session. Transcripts prepared from these videotapes logged the person uttering each comment and the exact time of the comment...|$|R
25|$|There {{were five}} Pan Am crew members aboard: three <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> and two pursers. The pilot was Captain Alf N. Monsen, a veteran pilot with 13,565 hours of flying time. His copilot was First Officer Laurence A. Foster, another captain who was serving as copilot and first officer due to {{personnel}} reductions at Pan Am. The flight engineer was C. L. Dunwoody.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} three <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> members {{were the last}} {{to be removed from}} the plane, at around 20:00 that evening, because the cockpit had to be {{examined}} before it could be cut open to get to these crew members. Also, some of the survivors say {{that at least one of}} the pilots was alive after the crash. The relatives of the passengers on the flight were sent to Amsterdam by Turkish Airlines shortly after.|$|E
25|$|Flight 103 {{was under}} the command of Captain James Bruce MacQuarrie (55), an {{experienced}} pilot with almost 11,000 flight hours, of which more than 4,000 had been accrued in 747 aircraft. First Officer Ray Wagner (52) had approximately 5,500 flight hours in the 747 and a total of almost 12,000 hours. Flight Engineer Jerry Don Avritt (46) had more than 8,000 hours of flying experience. He had come to Pan Am through the merger with National Airlines. The <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> was based at JFK.|$|E
50|$|ECAir, {{since its}} creation, is 70% {{owned by the}} Government of the Republic of the Congo, 15% by seaport of Pointe-Noire and 15% by Heli-Avia company. To launch the airline, the Government engaged Lufthansa Consulting, who managed the {{complete}} start-up process preparation, and developed a five-year business plan, including the future network and fleet structure for the new airline. From the outset, all <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> and some cabin crews and technical support for ECAir have been provided by Geneva-based carrier PrivatAir. After Lufthansa Consulting was phased out, the airline obtained specialised consultancy services mainly via the company CoeM.|$|R

40|$|With the {{increase}} of warning Systems the cockpit will become more crowded with different warnings. <b>Cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> {{spend a lot of}} time recognizing the cockpit warning indicators, identifying the nature of the problem, and choosing the correct procedure. To avoid increasing workloads in the cockpit, warning Systems need to be integrated. This paper discusses the possibilities for intégration, based on a multi-agent System. Two layers of intégration can be identified that prevent unnecessary warnings and prioritize simultaneous warnings: direct agent-to-agent communication, and a 'selector'. From a human perspective, the intégration should lead to a décision support System rather than a new automation which needs to be monitored only...|$|R
25|$|Flight 990's <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew</b> {{consisted}} of 57-year-old Captain Ahmed El-Habashi, 36-year-old First Officer Adel Anwar who was switching duty with another co-pilot {{so he could}} return home in time for his wedding, 52-year-old relief Captain Raouf Noureldin, 59-year-old relief First Officer Gameel Al-Batouti, and the airline's chief pilot for the Boeing 767, Captain Hatem Rushdy. Captain El-Habashi was a veteran pilot {{who had been with}} EgyptAir for 36 years and had accumulated approximately 14,400 total flight hours, more than 6,300 of which were in the 767. Relief First Officer Al-Batouti had close to 5,200 flight hours in the 767 and a total of roughly 12,500 hours.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve the}} desired long range, the PBB became a fairly large aircraft, with a {{wingspan}} of 139 feet 8½ inches (42.59 m) and a crew of ten. Despite its size, it was powered by just two Wright R-3350 Duplex Cyclone radial engines, driving three-bladed Curtiss Electric propellers. It was the largest twin-engined flying boat flown during World War II. For a flying boat, the PBB was aerodynamically clean, with a cantilever wing set high on the fuselage. The planing bottom had a single step, and the non-retractable outrigger floats were attached to streamlined, cantilever struts. The lower hull was divided with seven watertight compartments, and a short upper deck provided seating for the <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew.</b> The wing of the PBB was constructed in a center section and two outer panels. The center section carried the engine nacelles and contained the internal bomb bays, as well as fuel and oil tanks. The outer wing panels contained main and auxiliary, integral fuel tanks.|$|E

Paulo. [...] Attorneys representing Airbus responded in a Brazilian court filing that Airbus accepts no responsibility, laying {{the blame for the}} disaster with the <b>cockpit</b> <b>crew,</b> the airline and the poor state of the runway.|$|E
40|$|We use deficit {{functions}} (DFs) {{to decompose}} an aviation schedule of aircraft flights into a minimal number of periodic and balanced chains (flight sequences). Each chain visits periodically a set S of airports and {{is served by}} several <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> circulating along the airports of this set. We introduce the notion of ”chunks” which are a sequence of flights serviced by a crew in one day according to contract regulations. These chunks are then used to provide crew schedules and rosters. The method provides a simplicity {{for the construction of}} aircraft schedules and crew pairings which is absent in other approaches to the problem...|$|R
5000|$|Myanmar Airways International (MAI) {{took off}} in August 1993, {{initially}} created as {{a joint venture between}} Myanma Airways and Singapore-based Highsonic Enterprises, with the support of Royal Brunei Airlines. It boasted a Singapore management team (many ex-Singapore Airlines staff), new Boeing aircraft, all-expatriate <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews,</b> improved training for flight attendants and new UK Civil Aviation Authority operating standards. Eventually, the original joint venture was terminated and MAI became a wholly owned Myanmar company. In January 2001, a new joint venture was formed in which Region Air Myanmar (HK) Ltd., took a 49% stake and a local businessman through his company Zan Co. took an 11% share and Myanma Airways retained 40%.|$|R
5000|$|The ATC {{cleared the}} {{aircraft}} {{for an emergency}} landing in Karachi. The <b>cockpit</b> <b>crews</b> later acknowledged. This was the last transmission from the aircraft to the tower.
