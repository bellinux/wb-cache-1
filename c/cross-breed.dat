5|$|The Welsh crosses {{well with}} many other breeds, and has {{influenced}} the Pony of the Americas and the British Riding Pony. Many are also cross-bred with Thoroughbreds, and other horse breeds. The Welsh Pony {{has contributed to the}} founding of several other horse and pony breeds. The Morgan horse is one such breed, being in part descended from Welsh Cobs left behind by British forces {{after the end of the}} American Revolutionary War. They are crossed with Arab horses to produce riding horses, and with Thoroughbreds to produce jumpers, hunters, and eventers. Welsh mares have also been used to breed polo ponies that were agile and nimble. The Welsh Pony was used to create the Welara, a <b>cross-breed</b> of the Welsh and the Arab horse, which has been registered in America as a separate breed since 1981.|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} <b>cross-breed</b> successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E
25|$|Detasseling corn is {{removing}} the pollen-producing flowers, the tassel, from {{the tops of}} corn (maize) plants and placing them on the ground. It {{is a form of}} pollination control, employed to <b>cross-breed,</b> or hybridize, two varieties of corn.|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} method {{has been developed}} to produce F 1 -generation cysts from different zygogenetic strains and their <b>cross-breeds.</b> The F 1 cysts {{were used to determine}} the quantitative heritability of the following characteristics: cyst hatchability, cyst diameter, larval growth, and temperature resistance of the freshly-hatched nauplii. Data are given for cysts produced from nine strains and seven <b>cross-breeds.</b> Important differences for all characteristics studied were noted between the cross-bred and the parental strains...|$|R
25|$|As {{a symbol}} of cowardice, the white feather {{supposedly}} comes from cockfighting {{and the belief that}} a cockerel sporting a white feather in its tail {{is likely to be a}} poor fighter. Pure-breed gamecocks do not show white feathers, so its presence indicates that the cockerel is an inferior <b>cross-breed.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Cross-breed</b> animals : Genetic hybrids of {{wild and}} {{domestic}} parents. They may be forms intermediate between both parents, forms {{more similar to}} one parent than the other, or unique forms distinct from both parents. Hybrids can be intentionally bred for specific characteristics or can arise unintentionally {{as the result of}} contact with wild individuals.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas where}} Africanized bees are well established, {{purchased}} and pre-fertilized (i.e. mated) European queens {{can be used}} to maintain a hive's European genetics and behavior. However, this practice can be expensive since these queens must be purchased and shipped from breeder apiaries in areas which are completely free of Africanized bees, such as northern U.S. states or Hawaii. As such this is generally not practical for most commercial beekeepers outside of the U.S. and {{one of the main reasons}} why Central and South American beekeepers have had to learn to manage and work with the existing Africanized honey bee. Any effort to <b>cross-breed</b> virgin European queens with Africanized drones will result in the offspring exhibiting Africanized traits; only 26 escaped swarms in 1957, and nearly six decades later there does not appear to be a lessening to any noticeable degree of the typical Africanized characteristics.|$|E

50|$|Long ago {{people came}} {{from beyond the}} sky and landed on Gorth. There they raised the {{humanoid}} natives out of the wild state and led them to develop a civilization analogous to that of Medieval Europe. Then they went away, leaving behind {{a few of their}} number, memories, and a small population of <b>cross-breeds.</b> Kincar s’Rud is one of those <b>cross-breeds.</b> Part native and part Star Lord, he has assumed that he will inherit the throne of a small fief when his grandfather dies. Instead, his grandfather bestows upon him the livery of a Star Lord and warns him to leave Styr Holding immediately, because his uncle intends to kill him in order to take the throne for himself.|$|R
50|$|Hybrid fruits {{are created}} through the {{controlled}} speciation of fruits that creates new varieties and <b>cross-breeds.</b> Hybrids are grown using plant propagation {{to create new}} cultivars.

25|$|The family goes to {{the local}} YMCA to attend one-time-only free classes, {{along with many other}} Springfieldians who admit they will never return to pay for regular classes. Lisa takes {{gymnastics}} and gets yelled at by the Russian coach for being too old. Bart gets tricked into taking an etiquette class by a black man dressed as a gangsta rapper, who happens to be the husband of the prim and proper etiquette teacher. Homer participates in a basketball class for men over the age of 35, but suffers a torn ACL after a dunk attempt ends with the backboard crashing down on his leg. After Homer gets his surgery, he is told by Dr. Hibbert that he cannot go to work and must stay home. Homer finds himself extremely bored, even going so far as attempting to <b>cross-breed</b> Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II. One evening, Ned wants Marge to watch Rod and Todd while he attends a Chris Rock concert (that he misinterprets to be an abbreviation for a christian rock concert and after is surprised by the language). But Marge is out identifying the body of her Uncle Lou (which ends up being a very much alive Hans Moleman, although the morgue attendant seems convinced that he is dead), so Ned asks Homer instead. Rod and Todd enjoy having Homer take care of them, which gives Homer the idea to establish his own day care center.|$|E
500|$|The Russian {{military}} {{established the}} Red Star kennels in 1924 {{to improve the}} performance of working dogs and to conduct military dog research. The Red Star kennel developed [...] "Laikoid" [...] dogs, which were a <b>cross-breed</b> of Spitz-type Russian Laikas with German Shepherds. By the 1980s, the ability of Russia's bomb and narcotic detection dogs were assessed as being inadequate. Klim Sulimov, a research scientist with the DS Likhachev Scientific Research Institute for Cultural Heritage and Environmental Protection, began cross-breeding dogs with their wild relatives {{in an attempt to}} improve their scent-detection abilities. The researchers assumed that during domestication dogs had lost some of their scent-detection ability because they no longer had to detect prey. Sumilov crossed European jackals with Laikas, and also with fox terriers to add trainability and loyalty to the mix. He used the jackal because he believed that it was the wild ancestor of the dog, that it had superior scent-detecting ability, and, because it was smaller with more endurance than the dog, it could be housed outdoors in the Russian climate. Sulimov favored a mix of one quarter jackal and three-quarters dog. Sulimov's program continues today {{with the use of the}} hybrid Sulimov dogs at the Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow by the Russian airline Aeroflot.|$|E

2500|$|Husky [...] is {{a general}} name for a sled-type of dog used in {{northern}} regions, differentiated from other sled-dog types by their fast pulling style. They are an ever-changing <b>cross-breed</b> of the fastest dogs. The Alaskan Malamute, by contrast, is [...] "the largest and most powerful" [...] sled dog, and was used for heavier loads. Huskies are used in sled dog racing. In recent years, companies have been marketing tourist treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions as well. Huskies are also today kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure trekking dogs.|$|E
5000|$|The Oxford Down is an English {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep {{developed in the}} 1830s by crossing the Cotswold, Hampshire and South Down breeds, and using the resulting <b>cross-breeds</b> to {{form the basis of}} the present-day breed. [...] This breed is primarily raised for meat.|$|R
25|$|Domestication can be {{considered}} as the final phase of intensification in the relationship between animal or plant sub-populations and human societies, but it is divided into several grades of intensification. For studies in animal domestication, researchers have proposed five distinct categories: wild, captive wild, domestic, <b>cross-breeds</b> and feral.|$|R
5000|$|The next {{mention of}} Morgan-Arabian <b>cross-breeds</b> {{comes in the}} 1920s.

Hearst is credited with having coined the word [...] "Morab" [...] for crosses between the two breeds.|$|R
2500|$|The Rabbis {{interpreted}} [...] to {{set forth}} seven Noahide laws binding on all people: (1) {{to set up}} courts of justice, (2) not to commit idolatry, (3) not to commit blasphemy, (4) not to commit sexual immorality, (5) not to commit bloodshed (see [...] ), (6) not to commit robbery, and (7) not to eat flesh cut from a living animal (see [...] ). Rabbi Hanina taught that they were also commanded not to consume blood from a living animal. Rabbi Leazar taught that they were also commanded not to <b>cross-breed</b> animals. Rabbi Simeon taught that they were also commanded not to commit witchcraft. Rabbi Johanan taught that they were also commanded not to emasculate animals. And Rabbi Assi taught that the children of Noah were also prohibited to do anything stated in [...] "There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter {{to pass through the}} fire, one that uses divination, a soothsayer, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or one that consults a ghost or a familiar spirit, or a necromancer."

2500|$|May Wallace {{shared her}} love of plants with her son {{while he was still}} a boy, {{teaching}} him to <b>cross-breed</b> pansies. When the African-American [...] "plant doctor" [...] and future agronomist George Washington Carver became a student and later an instructor at Iowa State University, the Wallaces took him into their home, as racial prejudice prevented Carver from living in the dormitories. As a boy, Wallace accompanied Carver on nature walks, identifying the botanical structures of wild flowers and prairie grasses. Carver left for Tuskegee when Wallace was eight, but his influence on Wallace was deep and lasting. By the age of ten, Wallace was experimenting with plant breeding in his own plot. He also developed a keen interest in math and statistics. At fifteen, he conducted experiments to demonstrate that the then-conventional method of judging the quality of corn strains solely by such esthetic qualities as the beauty and symmetry of the ears was deeply flawed, failing {{to take into account the}} vigor and productivity of the whole plant as measured quantitatively. Wallace's experiments proved that there was no relationship between yield and appearance. Where plant hybridity had traditionally been viewed negatively as [...] "mongrelization" [...] signaling decline, Wallace's work introduced the concept of hybrid vigor.|$|E
6000|$|Although by the aid {{of careful}} {{selection}} the near interbreeding of sheep may be long continued without any manifest evil, yet {{it has often been}} the practice with farmers to cross distinct breeds to obtain animals for the butcher, which plainly shows that good of some kind is derived from this practice. We have excellent evidence on this head from Mr. S. Druce (17/14. 'Journal R. Agricult. Soc.' volume 14 1853 page 212.), who gives in detail the comparative numbers of four pure breeds and of a <b>cross-breed</b> which can be supported on the same ground, and he gives their produce in fleece and carcase. A high authority, Mr. Pusey, sums up the result in money value during an equal length of time, namely (neglecting shillings), for Cotswolds 248 pounds, for Leicesters 223 pounds, for Southdowns 204 pounds, for Hampshire Downs 264 pounds, and for the crossbred 293 pounds. A former celebrated breeder, Lord Somerville, states that his half-breeds from Ryelands and Spanish sheep were larger animals than either the pure Ryelands or pure Spanish sheep. Mr. Spooner concludes his excellent Essay on Crossing by asserting that there is a pecuniary advantage in judicious cross-breeding, especially when the male is larger than the female. (17/15. Lord Somerville 'Facts on Sheep and Husbandry' page 6. Mr. Spooner in 'Journal of Royal Agricult. Soc. of England' volume 20 part 2.
