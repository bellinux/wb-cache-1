For Internet measurements, the IETF has defined a Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) architecture providing high functionality, but requiring rather complex configuration. This contribution suggests an application-oriented highlevel interface to the RTFM architecture that simplifies configuration by hiding several details and that thereby facilitates the integration of standardized traffic flow measurements into management applications. The simplification leads to a restriction of the available functionality. However, the remaining functionality still matches the requirements of a large range of management applications. Besides several simplifications, also one extension is contained in the suggested interface. The RTFM architecture requires a reader of flow measurement data to poll for new information.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} the system architecture for a terminal-based location service enabler in the 3 rd Generation (3 G) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). A location service enabler provides {{data about the}} geographical position of mobile terminals to requesting clients. Since location data {{can be regarded as}} a type of presence information, we propose an architecture that builds on the IMS presence specifications. We show that several mechanisms for processing presence like notification handling, access control and privacy management apply to location data as well. It is therefore possible to reuse {{a large part of the}} IMS presence infrastructure. Based on the observation that the processing of trigger conditions for location information and <b>creating</b> <b>notification</b> messages should be done in the terminal itself, we propose a terminalbased location enabler. The terminal uses a built-in method to determine its geographical position such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) module.

40|$|Notification systems alert {{individuals}} or groups of changing information that is of interest to them. The {{problem is that it}} is difficult for people to gather notifications of personal interest; they must either rely on the generic offerings of the information provider, or construct their own services through coding. In this paper, we contribute a simple yet effective method that lets people <b>create</b> custom <b>notification</b> elements by image assembly, where notifications are triggered through visual differencing. First, after finding information of interest on a web page, the person constructs a visual collage selected from regions on the page. These are regions of the fully rendered bitmap view of the page i. e., they are not coupled to the page’s underlying HTML markup. The composite image created from this collage will be used to assemble a notification of relevant changes to that web page. Second, the person specifies one or more regions on the page that will be compared for visual differences over time, and how often the page should be revisited to check for these differences. The system will automatically generate a notification (the composite image plus a title and timestamp) when differences go beyond a userprovided threshold. Finally, the person can view the notifications in several ways: as only the most recently changed version (to illustrate current state), or as an image history that can be either browsed individually or played back as a continuous video stream (to see changes over time).

30|$|The {{cooperative}} {{decision making}} mechanism will be implemented in the CRM. For a more efficient use of the available spectrum and to fully exploit the opportunistic nature of our scheme, we consider monitoring and decision-making on a per-RB basis instead of on a per-frequency-band basis (i.e., containing several RBs). The input data considered by the decision mechanism includes all the channel state reports from the UEs served by the same eNodeB and the geographical position of the UEs obtained through the aforementioned location services. Every channel state <b>notification</b> <b>creates</b> a new entry in the CRM containing the UE identifier, the estimated geographical location of the UE, the channel or resource monitored, the licensed activity state sensed in that resource and the time in seconds when the channel state report was received. Once all this data is collected from different UEs, the CRM can make decisions about the vacuity of the monitored resources at different locations. The collected sensing reports are classified by their distance to the eNodeB in different ranges, whose width is given by a multiple of the TA resolution (Dist_TA = 10 m). For each range and RB, an independent cooperative decision will be made.|$|R

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Information science and learning technologies. Researchers have identified user presence, awareness, and a sense of community as important components of Computer Supported Collaborative Environments (CSCE) (Dourish & Bellotti, 1992; Erickson & Kellogg, 2003; Moody, 2000; Prinz, 1999). To support user actions and interactions sufficient to create and sustain a sense of community, recent CSCE have been developed with notification systems to provide activity notifications to users. However, these notification systems typically transmit generic notifications as actions occur and do not provide mechanisms for analyzing and providing notifications based on user preference or social context. A challenge facing developers of CSCE is to <b>create</b> a <b>notification</b> system for delivering awareness information based on the ever-changing preferences, interests, and social contexts of users. To address this challenge, this study articulated and advanced a theoretical framework for developers to use when integrating activity notifications into existing CSCE. The proposed framework is based on the importance of user preferences and social context and is derived from the Locales Framework (Fitzpatrick, 1998). The principles of this new development framework are Social Context, Awareness in Context, Activity Discovery, Trends in Activity, Meaning of Activity, and Notification Customization. To evaluate the concepts of this framework, this study developed a context-aware activity notification system for an existing CSCE based on the framework's proposed principles. During the development process, it was determined that not only could the Framework for Notification be used to provide notifications based on user preference and social context, but the use of the proposed Framework afforded a richer understanding of the collaborative needs of users for both the theorists discussing the implications of activity notifications and the developers working to provide those notifications...|$|R
40|$|Tracking tasks {{remains one}} of the most {{difficult}} issues facing any working team of administrators. Even with the implementation of commercial tools available today, e-mail and hallway conversations remain the standard for task management in many organizations; however, these make it difficult and time consuming to remain current on issues, and do nothing to summarize the long-term history of tasks and completion thereof. Many commercial tools are available to handle task management, and most work quite well for stereotype models of their intended environments – development teams, help desk, etc. Unfortunately, these systems often have limitations which prevent their use (or a simple deployment) in a pre-existing, working environment. Other systems are difficult or timeconsuming to use, and remain ignored in favor of task accomplishment. Few freely available systems provide the statistics to analyze productivity, generate statistics, and otherwise please management.

40|$|Quality is a concept, which {{cannot be}} {{measured}} on a time scale. Man’s understanding of quality goes far back into prehistory, perhaps even a million years before the first tools were made. For a long time quality assessment hinged predominantly {{on the quality of}} consumer products – their composition, attributes, distinguishing features, and so on. The globalization of world economy together with the expansion of international trade has led to the fast processes of quality internationalization, as a crucial element of companies’ competitiveness. These processes appear by wider application of the same methods, principles and criteria while determining quality policy, <b>creating</b> international accreditation, <b>notification</b> and quality certification systems in various countries. The development of quality management concepts covers a very long time. During this period, core quality objects have changed significantly – from quality of primitive working tools to commodities, then to services, processes, organizations’ quality and organizational performance, etc. Quality is important not only as a measure of how competitive a business is, it also determines the efficacy of state’s governance and other public sector organizations, the stability of a nation’s economy, and the quality of life its citizens enjoy. This is why it is necessary to broaden our understanding of quality, in order for other aspects (e. g. social quality, quality oriented value, quality culture, partnership, quality of economic management, etc.) to also be covered. These changes are reflected in the new book – scientific monograph in French – “Quality Management.
