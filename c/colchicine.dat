Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E

Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms.

40|$|Orientation of nucleus, centriole, microtubules, and microfilaments within human {{neutrophils}} in a gradient of chemoattractant (5 percent Escherichia coli endotoxin-activated serum) {{was evaluated}} by electron microscopy. Purified neutropils (hypaque-Ficoll) {{were placed in}} the upper compartment of chemotactic chambers. Use of small pore (0. 45 μm) micropore filters permitted pseudopod penetration, but impeded migration. Under conditions of chemotaxis with activated serum beneath the filter, the neutrophil population oriented at the filter surface with nuclei located away from the stimulus, centrioles and associated radial array of microtubules beneath the nuclei, and microfilament-rich pseudopods penetrating the filter pores. Reversal of the direction of the gradient of the stimulus (activated serum above cells) resulted in a reorientation of internal structure which preceded pseudopod formation toward the activated serum and migration off the filter. Coordinated orientation of the entire neutrophil population did not occur in buffer (random migration) or in a uniform concentration of activated serum (activated random migration). Conditions of activated random migration resulted in increased numbers of cells with locomotory morphology, i. e. cellular asymmetry with linear alignment of nucleus, centriole, microtubule array, and pseudopods. Thus, activated serum increased the number of neutrophils exhibiting locomotory morphology, and a gradient of activated serum induced the alignment of neutrophils such that this locomotory morphology was uniform in the observed neutrophil populayion. In related studies, cytochalasin B and <b>colchicines</b> were used to explore the role of microfilaments and microtubules in the neutrophil orientation and migration response to activated serum. Cytochalasin B (3. 0 μg/ml) prevented migration and decreased the microfilaments seen, but allowed normal orientation of neutrophil structures. In an activated serum gradient, <b>colchicines,</b> but not lumicolchicine, decreased the orientation of nuclei and centrioles, and caused a decrease in centriole-associated microtubules in concentrations as low as 10 (- 8) to 10 (- 7) M. These <b>colchicines</b> effects were associated with the rounding of cells and impairment of pseudopod formation. The impaired pseudopod formation was characterized by an inability to form pseudopods {{in the absence of a}} solid substrate, a formation of narrow pseudopods within a substrate, and a defect in pseudopod orientation in an activated serum gradient. Functional studies of migration showed that <b>colchicines,</b> but not lumicolchicine, minimally decreased activated random migration and markedly inhibited directed migration, but had not effect on random migration. These studies show that, although functioning microfilaments are probably necessary for neutrophil migration, intact microtubules are essential for normal pseudopod formation and orientation, and maximal unidirectional migration during chemotaxis...|$|R

30|$|Gloriosa superba L., (family Colchicaceae). It is a {{climbing}} herb {{and native}} of South Africa. Its flower {{is a national}} flower of Tamil Eelam, Zimbabwe, and state flower of Tamil Nadu. It is an endangered medicinal plant in southern India. Since 2000 B.C., it is {{being used as a}} traditional medicine by the tribes. The entire plant has been used in Siddha, Ayurveda and Unani medicine. G. superba is a tuberous plant with plow- (or) finger-shaped cylindrical tubers that are pure white when it is young [34]. It contains two major alkaloids namely <b>Colchicines</b> and Colchicosides. The seeds consist of <b>colchicines,</b> which are 2 – 5 times higher than in the tubers. Due to the medicinal value, this plant is collected from the wild and it belongs to rare plant species in India. It has been included in the Red data book. The major problems in commercial cultivation of this plant are because of low propagation rate of seeds and the viability of seeds being only 50  % [35, 36]. It takes four or five vegetative cycles to finish the reproductive phase [37]. These conventional propagation methods are less efficient. Hence, {{there is a need to}} improve the mass propagation of medicinal plant through nanotechnology applications. Nowadays, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles are used in crop production [5, 38, 39]. Arora et al.
