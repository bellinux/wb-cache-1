5|$|Many {{organochlorine}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. Chlorinated organic compounds {{are found in}} nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, steroids, and fatty acids. Organochlorides, including dioxins, are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires, and dioxins {{have been found in}} the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> including dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.|$|E

25|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} tetrachloroethylene as a Group 2A carcinogen, {{which means}} {{that it is probably}} carcinogenic to humans. Like many <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> tetrachloroethylene is a central nervous system depressant and can enter the body through respiratory or dermal exposure. Tetrachloroethylene dissolves fats from the skin, potentially resulting in skin irritation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{chemicals}} undergo reactive decay {{or chemical}} change, especially {{over long periods}} of time in groundwater reservoirs. A noteworthy class of such chemicals is the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as trichloroethylene (used in industrial metal degreasing and electronics manufacturing) and tetrachloroethylene used in the dry cleaning industry. Both of these chemicals, which are carcinogens themselves, undergo partial decomposition reactions, leading to new hazardous chemicals (including dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride).|$|E
25|$|The thermal {{cracking}} reaction is highly endothermic, and is generally {{carried out in}} a fired heater. Even though residence time and temperature are carefully controlled, it produces significant quantities of chlorinated hydrocarbon side products. In practice, EDC conversion is relatively low (50 to 60 percent). The furnace effluent is immediately quenched with cold EDC to stop undesirable side reactions. The resulting vapor-liquid mixture then goes to a purification system. Some processes use an absorber-stripper system to separate HCl from the <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> while other processes use a refrigerated continuous distillation system.|$|E

In 2001 a series of press reports culminating in a book called Fateful Harvest unveiled a widespread practice of recycling industrial byproducts into fertilizer, resulting in the contamination of the soil with various metals. Ordinary municipal landfills {{are the source of}} many chemical substances entering the soil environment (and often groundwater), emanating from the wide variety of refuse accepted, especially substances illegally discarded there, or from pre-1970 landfills that may have been subject to little control in the U.S. or EU. There have also been some unusual releases of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, commonly called dioxins for simplicity, such as TCDD.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, two reporters for the Niagara Falls Gazette, David Pollak and David Russell, tested several {{sump pumps}} near Love Canal and found toxic {{chemicals}} in them. The Gazette published reports, once in October 1976 {{and once in}} November 1976, of chemical analyses of residues near the old Love Canal dumpsite indicated presence of 15 organic chemicals, including three toxic <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The matter went quiet {{for more than a}} year and was resurrected by reporter Michael Brown, who then investigated potential health effects by carrying forth an informal door-to-door survey in early 1978, finding birth defects and many anomalies such as enlarged feet, heads, hands, and legs.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the monitoring requirements of the 1979 Council Directive 79 / 923 /EC {{on the quality of}} shellfish waters, water and shellfish samples were collected from 22 major shellfish growing areas and analysed for physicochemical parameters, trace metal levels and <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> concentrations. Fin-fish were also collected from five Irish fishing ports and analysed for total mercury content in compliance with the European Commission's Decision of 19 May 1993 on mercury in fisheries products. Selected samples of fin-fish were also analysed for trace metal and <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> concentration. As there are no generally accepted European standards for the concentration of these contaminants in shellfish or fin-fish, the levels were compared with the available standards and guidance values compiled by the Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPAR) countries for human consumption. As in previous years, the water quality from shellfish growing areas was good and conformed to the guidelines and requirements of the Directive. Petroleum hydrocarbons were not observed in any of the shellfish waters or as deposits on the shellfish. <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> levels were very low, evidence of the clean, unpolluted nature of Irish shellfish and shellfish producing waters. Trace metal levels were consistently low with the exception of lead in mussel tissue from Wexford Harbour, which was elevated, and cadmium in oyster tissue, which was slightly elevated in some samples but did not exceed the Dutch human consumption tolerance value of 1. 0 mg kg- 1. The concentration of mercury in fin-fish selected from catches at Irish fishing ports ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 27 µg g- 1 wet weight. These levels were well within the maximum limits set down in the EC Decision for mercury in fisheries products. <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and trace metal levels were also very low in fish tissue.

2500|$|Since {{chlorinated}} hydrocarbon pesticides dissolve in fats {{and are not}} excreted, organisms tend to retain them almost indefinitely.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, Canada, differs {{regionally}} in {{trophic status}} and {{local and regional}} inputs of contaminants. Spatial and temporal trends in contaminant levels in bioindicator species such as colonial waterbirds could offer insights into the potential for contaminant bioaccumulation in Great Slave Lake. Persistent <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> contaminants, mercury (Hg), and selenium (Se) were examined in herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs and livers collected from various locations on Great Slave Lake in 1995. Eggs were collected in May and June, and livers in May and August. Also, the relationship between contaminants and trophic level, as inferred from stable-nitrogen isotope analysis (δ 15 N), was examined in four colonial waterbird species: herring gull, mew gull (L. canus), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), and black tern (Chlidonias niger). Finally, the co-accumulation of mercury and selenium was examined in eggs of these birds. There were no differences in <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> concentrations among four sampling sites (colonies). Concentrations did not differ between herring gull adults collected in early May and those collected in early August. <b>Chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> concentrations in eggs of herring gull, mew gull, Caspian tern, and black tern were related to their trophic positions as inferred from their δ 15 N values in their lipid-free egg yolks. Concentrations in these colonial waterbirds were much higher than those in fish from Great Slave Lake, but lower than those in their conspecifics from the Great Lakes. It is probable that a relatively {{large proportion of the}} <b>chlorinated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> contaminant load in colonial waterbird eggs on Great Slave Lake results from exposure to and storage of such contaminants at more heavily contaminated wintering and staging areas.
