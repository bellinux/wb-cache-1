5|$|Labrador {{colouration}} {{is controlled}} by multiple genes. It is possible for recessive genes to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected pigmentation effects to {{different parts of the}} body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown ("liver", caused by having two genes for chocolate), or several other colours. A Labrador <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> genes for a different colour, for example a black Labrador <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> recessive genes for the other two colours. DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.|$|E
5|$|Like all livestock, Brumbies <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> the {{parasite}} Cryptosporidium parvum, which {{can result in}} serious gastroenteritis in people drinking contaminated drinking water.|$|E
5|$|About 10 to 20 {{white-tailed deer}} {{per square mile}} (2.6 to 5.2 deer per square kilometer) live along {{the river and the}} parkway, more than the {{ecosystem}} <b>can</b> <b>carry.</b> They eat low-lying plants, shrubs, and tree saplings, reducing the food supply for smaller animals. The deer also collide with cars—in Hastings, about 1.6 times per month.|$|E
50|$|Miniature UAVs {{range from}} micro air {{vehicles}} (MAVs) that <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> by an infantryman, to man-portable UAVs that <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> and launched like an infantry man-portable air-defense system.|$|R
5000|$|Special sorting {{personnel}} is not required. While vent sexing <b>can</b> only be <b>carried</b> out by {{highly trained}} personnel, feather-sexing <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> out by personnel without training.|$|R
5000|$|Another growth {{field in}} UAVs are {{miniature}} UAVs, ranging from [...] "micro aerial vehicles (MAVs)" [...] and miniature UAVs that <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> by an infantryman to UAVs that <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> and launched like an infantry man-portable air-defense system.|$|R
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> more than eight times their weight.|$|E
5|$|The AgustaWestland AW101 is a {{medium-sized}} multi-role helicopter. Two versions are in service with the UK armed forces, {{where it is}} known as Merlin. The utility version <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> up to twenty-four troops seated or sixteen stretcher patients and the HM2 anti-submarine warfare variant has a dipping sonar and sonar-buoys, and a complete electronic warfare suite.|$|E
5|$|The engine can {{accommodate}} high-load operating conditions {{and has been}} designed for low-speed operation. It <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> up to 260kilograms. The hovercraft is equipped with GPS and the construction costs are lower than usual {{for this type of}} vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Customs {{clearance}}: Monday through Thursday, 5:00 am to 4:00 pm, Friday, 5:00 am to 2:30 pm, Saturday, 8:00 am to 12:00 pm; {{beyond the}} regular customs service hours, customs clearance <b>can</b> <b>carried</b> out {{after making a}} previous agreement with the Papp forwarding agency ...|$|R
25|$|The Kh-55 <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> by the Tupolev Tu-95MS ('Bear-H') and Tu-142M ('Bear-F'), and the Kh-55SM {{is carried}} by the Tupolev Tu-160 ('Blackjack'). Sixteen Kh-55's <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> by the Tu-95MS16 (Tu-95MSM) variant, ten on underwing hardpoints and six on an MKU-5-6 rotary launcher.|$|R

5|$|The {{state has}} the highest average and peak Internet speeds in the United States, with the third-highest worldwide. Northern Virginia's data centers <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> up to 70% of the nation's {{internet}} traffic, and in 2015 the region was the largest and fastest growing data center market in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Under Act No. 119/2002 Coll. {{every citizen}} {{that meets the}} act's {{conditions}} {{has the right to}} have firearms license issued and may then obtain a firearm. Holders of D (exercise of profession) and E (self-defense) licenses, which are also shall-issue, <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> up to two concealed firearms for protection.|$|E
5|$|Zinc in rivers {{flowing through}} {{industrial}} and mining areas {{can be as}} high as 20ppm. Effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50ppb. Concentrations of zinc as low as 2ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> in their blood.|$|E
50|$|Advantages: because radical {{intermediates}} are {{not charged}} species, reaction conditions are often mild and functional group tolerance is high. Reactions <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> out in nearly any solvent, and products are often synthetically useful compounds that <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> on using existing functionality or groups introduced during radical trapping.|$|R
50|$|Pumps can {{be fitted}} to a bracket {{on the bike}} frame, either a clamp on, screw on, or a braze-on peg, or they <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> in a pannier or other bag on the bike, or they <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> by the rider in a backpack, pocket, etc.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} forming carboxylate-alumoxane {{nanoparticles}} comprises subjecting a mixture comprising boehmite and carboxylic acid to mechanical shear. The method <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> {{out at a}} temperature above ambient and preferably a temperature greater than 80 ° C., and <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> out {{in the absence of}} a liquid phase...|$|R
5|$|All {{elephants}} {{have several}} distinctive features, {{the most notable}} {{of which is a}} long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.|$|E
5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} underwater vehicles (ROVs) <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E
5|$|Certain weapons can be dual-wielded, {{allowing}} the player to trade accuracy, {{the use of}} grenades and melee attacks for raw firepower. The player <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> two weapons at a time (or three if dual-wielding; one weapon remains holstered), with each weapon having advantages and disadvantages in different combat situations. For example, most Covenant weapons eschew disposable ammo clips for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced if depleted. However, these weapons can overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading, but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire. The player <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> a total of eight grenades (four human grenades, four Covenant) to dislodge and disrupt enemies. New in Halo 2 {{is the ability to}} board enemy vehicles that are near the player and traveling at low speeds. The player or AI latches onto the vehicle and forcibly ejects the other driver from the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The vessel is 293.8 m long, with {{a beam of}} 32.2 m. The 93,330-gross ton vessel {{can reach}} a maximum speed of 23 kn. Magnifica has 1,259 cabins - 2,550 {{passengers}} <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> at double occupancy, while 3,605 <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> at full capacity. The ship has 1,027 crew.|$|R
5|$|Ammunition has weight, {{reducing}} the amount that <b>can</b> be <b>carried.</b>|$|R
30|$|It <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> {{out during}} {{production}} of the well.|$|R
5|$|In August 2005 the Australian Government passed {{approval}} for the acquisition of two Canberra-class landing helicopter dock ships; these will displace over 20,000 tonnes, <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> over 1,000 troops, and will potentially be able to operate fixed wing aircraft. The project is expected to cost between A$1.5 and A$2billion, and be completed by around 2014. The new ships will be named Canberra and Adelaide.|$|E
5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
5|$|Like DNA, RNA <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> genetic information. RNA viruses have genomes {{composed}} of RNA that encodes {{a number of}} proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. Viroids are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.|$|E
50|$|Cylinder {{volume to}} user's choice. Large {{cylinders}} <b>can</b> be <b>carried.</b>|$|R
50|$|H-infinity loop-shaping <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> out using commercially {{available}} software.|$|R
5000|$|Ammunition has weight, {{reducing}} the amount that <b>can</b> be <b>carried.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Deepak-class tanker <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> 17,900 tonnes of cargo, {{including}} 15,500 tonnes {{of liquid}} cargo (water, ship and aircraft fuel) and 500 tonnes of solid cargo (victuals and ammunition). The modern cargo handling facility {{on board the}} ship enables transfer of heavy solid cargo via a 30 tonne capacity deck crane, and simultaneous fuelling of multiple ships at sea, and can refuel {{at the rate of}} 1,500 tonnes per hour. Workshop facilities on the ship can support other ships of the fleet and it is capable of supporting heavy helicopters.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom {{is a large}} fighter with a {{top speed}} of over Mach2.2. It <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> more than 18,000 pounds (8,400kg) of weapons on nine {{external}} hardpoints, including air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles, and various bombs. The F-4, like other interceptors of its time, was designed without an internal cannon. Later models incorporated an M61 Vulcan rotary cannon. Beginning in 1959, it set 15 world records for in-flight performance, including an absolute speed record, and an absolute altitude record.|$|E
5|$|The average horse <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they <b>can</b> <b>carry,</b> the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E

30|$|However, {{there are}} also {{numerous}} limitations imposed on HGVs when transporting freight. Regulatory boards limit {{the weight of the}} vehicle to 44 tonnes and limit the size of the trailer that <b>can</b> be <b>carried</b> [32]. HGVs <b>can</b> therefore <b>carry</b> significantly less in a single journey than when compared to rail or sea.|$|R
