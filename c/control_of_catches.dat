40|$|Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing {{has played}} a major role in the {{overexploitation}} of global fish populations. In response, international regulations have been imposed and many fisheries have been “eco-certified” by consumer organisations, but methods for independent <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> certificates and eco-labels are urgently needed. Here we show that by using gene- associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), individual marine fish can be assigned back to population of origin with unprecedented high levels of precision. By applying high differentiation SNP assays in four commercial marine fish on a pan-European scale we find 93 - 100 % of individuals could be correctly assigned to origin in policy-driven case studies. We show how case- targeted SNP assays can be created and forensically validated using a centrally maintained and publicly available database. Our results demonstrate how application of gene-associated markers will likely revolutionise origin assignment and become highly valuable tools for fighting illegal fishing and mislabelling worldwide.

40|$|Myosin from a {{molluscan}} catch {{muscle is}} unusual in being phosphorylated in the rod by an endogenous heavy chain kinase. The overall structure of the molecule resembles that of other muscle myosins, although the tail is somewhat longer (approximately equal to 1700 A). At low ionic strength the unphosphorylated molecules associate in filaments that display a striking axial repeat of 145 A. Phosphorylation of the rod enhances myosin solubility {{in the range of}} NaCl between 0. 05 and 0. 15 M. Depending on the ionic strength and the counterions present, the soluble species corresponds to an antiparallel folded dimer (15 S) or to a folded monomer (10 S). Unphosphorylated myosin can also be partially solubilized into folded monomers by addition of ATP in 0. 15 M NaCl. A similar molecular folding has also been observed in smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosins that depends, however, on the state of phosphorylation of the light chains in the myosin head.

40|$|Increased {{attention}} has been paid over recent years to the Over exploitation of small-scale fishery resources. This paper offers a simple bio-economic model of fishery exploitation orientated towards both Lake Malombe Chambo (Oreochromis sp.) and the Whole Lake Malombe Fishery. The catching of Chambo in Lake Malombe has historically been important to Malawi Fisheries, and the changes that have taken place in the Fishery have had major social and economic consequences on communities around the Lake. Bioeconomic exploration of this fishery has been based on the catch, effort and price data from 1976 to 1999. It has been demonstrated here that, Chambo. Fishery provides a unique illustration of the economic and biological effects of technological (gear type) change in situations where access to the natural resource remains virtually unrestricted (open access). The components of the model are explained with reference to their guiding economic (Maximum Economic Yield) and biological (Maximum Sustainable Yield) reference points. And it is estimated in the study that if yield of Chambo falls below 6900 tons and 14 621 tons for the Whole fishery, then {{the rate at which the}} population regenerates itself falls below the rate of extraction. The paper also draws the problem of effort over capacity as the current capacity exceeds, by a wide margin, the capacity that would be required to harvest a sustained yield. In addition to the over capacity is the problem of selectivity in the gear types. Such over capacity and non-selectivity in fishing gear makes <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> and efforts difficult and threatens the fishery...|$|R

40|$|Management of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, {{has become}} {{increasingly}} stringent since {{the implementation of the}} first groundfish fishery management plan (FMP) in 1977, yet overfished stock status is evidence of ineffective management.

The cod stock assessment model includes two assumptions about the species: cod are non-migratory, and cod natural mortality has remained the same since its last evaluation 28 years ago. I present two studies that contradict the assumption that cod are non-migratory, and provide three reasons that cod natural mortality has increased: heightened competition and predation, habitat damage, and genetic modification resulting from selective harvest. To avoid the overfishing that results, I recommend that the model equation be changed to include migration frequency and utilize an increased value for the natural mortality parameter. Unti...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Earthquakes {{are one of}} {{the natural}} hazards that occur due to sudden violent {{movement}} of earth’s surface which releases energy and has destructive power {{in many parts of the}} world. The development of recent technologies for the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> seismic hazards <b>catches</b> the attention <b>of</b> structural engineers to make the structures seismically resistant. The seismic base isolation technique is a passive protective system. It limits the effects of the earthquake attack through a flexible base which decouples the structure from the ground motion, and the structural response accelerations are usually less than that of the ground acceleration. This technique has been incorporated and studied practically in many multi-storey structures. In the present work, a laminated rubber bearing isolator has been designed and the properties of the isolator are obtained. Then the dynamic analysis of the structure has been carried out and the performance of the building with and without isolator is studied. A parametric study has also been conducted and the results can be used in the implementation of a real time structure to improve its seismic performance.
