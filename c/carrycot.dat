Emma's father Pete Townshend is the lead guitarist and principal songwriter of the rock band The Who. Pete Townshend has said that when his first daughter was born, “the room was filled with angels,” although he later speculated that this might have been an acid flashback. As a baby, her parents took her to Woodstock in a <b>carrycot,</b> and she was brought up following the teachings of the Indian spiritual leader Meher Baba.|$|E
50|$|A travel {{system is}} {{typically}} a set {{consisting of a}} chassis with a detachable baby seat and/or <b>carrycot.</b> Thus a travel system can be switched between a pushchair and a pram. Another benefit of a travel system is that the detached chassis (generally an umbrella closing chassis) when folded will usually be smaller than other types, to transport it in a car trunk or boot. Also, the baby seat will snap into a base meant to stay in an automobile, becoming a car seat. This allows undisturbed movement of the baby into or out of a car and a reduced chance of waking a sleeping baby.|$|E

A <b>carrycot</b> is a restraint system intended to accommodate and restrain the child in a supine or prone position with the child's spine perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle. Carrycots are designed to distribute the restraining forces over the child's head and body, excluding its limbs, {{in the event of}} a big crash. It must be put on the rear seat of the car. Some models can be changed to face forward after the baby has reached the weight limit which is normally about 15-20 kilograms.|$|E
