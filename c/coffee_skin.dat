One way to evaluate it is analyzing the performance of the feed gas production value in vitro. Feed ingredients tested in this study were the flour of coffee hull, peanut hull, field grass, turn leaves, rice straw and fermented rice straw. Samples weighed 200 ± 5 mg, put into a 100 ml syringe glass, added 30 ml buffalo rumen liquor with bicarbonate buffer medium, then incubated in the water bath at 39 ° C for 48 hours. Neway software and random block design with 4 blocks are used to calculate the value of fitted gas and to analyze the variance. The variables measured were gas production 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, organic material degradable, gas production potential (a+b), gas production rate (k). The highest gas production 24, 48 and 72 hours from the field grass treatment (C) was 36. 33, 51. 12 and 56. 29 ml/ 200 mg DM but 96 hours of rice straw ie 59. 60 ml/ 200 mg DM, while the lowest (24, 48, 72 and 96 hours) of <b>coffee</b> <b>skin</b> (6. 08, 7. 77, 7. 61, and 7. 68 ml/ 200 mg DM respectively).

40|$|In {{an effort}} to produce more energy using organic wastes as an energy source, multistep {{anaerobic}} digestion (MAD) has gained attention in recent years. The energy potentiality of the MAD approach has been verified experimentally using two carbon sources: glucose, as the more easily biodegradable carbon source, and a rich lignocelluloses material (<b>coffee</b> seed <b>skin)</b> waste. Energy production is analysed by evaluating the energy produced as hydrogen plus methane using the efficiency (h) parameter to determine the energy produced versus the energy embedded in the sources. Four fermentation tests, each repeated three times, were performed: one-step and two-step AD with glucose, and one-step and threestep AD with <b>coffee</b> seed <b>skins</b> (including a pretreatment step). The two-step AD efficiency (h ¼ 74. 5 %) using glucose was 48 % higher than the one-step AD (50. 4 %), while the efficiency using lignocelluloses material was 28. 5 % (2. 4 {{times higher than the}} one-step AD).

40|$|Perspective on the Development of Bio-Activator Compost to Control the Attacks of Phytophthora capsici on Pepper (Piper nigrum). Bio-activator {{microbes}} can {{be found}} enormously in the compost, for instance bacteria (Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp), actinomycetes (Streptomyces spp.) and fungi (Trichoderma spp, Aspergillus spp, Penicillium spp). This research aimed to assess the development of bio-activator in controlling P. capsici and increasing production {{and quality of the}} pepper. Activity was done in the field trials in the upland and lowland as the center of pepper plants in Lampung using a factorial randomized design group with five replications. The first factor was microbial bio-activator formula and the second factor was three doses of compost namely 1, 2 and 3 kg/pepper plants. Each plant was given zeolite, which was 0. 5 kg/tt and fulfat acid 1 % as amount of 200 cc/tt. The study showed that microbial activators significantly suppressed P. capsici attacks and increased the production of pepper. In the uplands, the intensity of P. capsici decreased to 83. 31 %, while in the lowlands, the disease intensity that was caused by P. capsici decreased by 99 - 100 %. The results of chemical and biological analysis of soil showed that the application of bio-activator compost increased the diversity of the types and the amounts of microbes in the rhizosphere as well as increased the nutrient availability. Combination treatment of bio-activator compost from coffee leather of 3 kg/tt were able to suppress the intensity of the disease BPB to more than 50 % and increase the production of more than 30 %. Key words: piper nigrum, bioactivator, <b>coffee</b> <b>skin,</b> Phytophthora capsicii. Di dalam kompos banyak ditemukan mikroba bioaktifator, yaitu bakteri (Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp), aktinomiset (Streptomyces spp.) dan cendawan (Trichoderma spp, Aspergillus spp, Penicillium spp.). Bioaktivator dapat dimanfaatkan untuk mengendalikan serangan P. capsicii dan meningkatkan produksi serta mutu hasil lada. Kegiatan ini bertujuan mengkaji pengembangan bioaktivator untuk pengendalian Phytopthora capsici dan peningkatan produksi serta mutu hasil lada. Pengkajian dilakukan dalam format uji lapangan didataran tinggi dan rendah sentra lokasi tanaman lada di Lampung. Pengkajian menggunakan Rancangan Acak Kelompok pola faktorial dengan lima ulangan. Faktor pertama ialah bentuk formula mikroba bioaktivator dan faktor kedua ialah tiga dosis kompos yaitu 1, 2 dan 3 kg/tanaman lada. Setiap tanaman juga diberikan zeolit 0. 5 kg/tt dan asam fulfat 1 % 200 cc/tt. Hasil pengkajian menunjukkan bahwa mikroba aktivator nyata menekan serangan P. capsicidan meningkatkan produksi lada. Di dataran tinggi intensitas serangan P. capsicimenurun hingga 83. 31 %, sedang di dataran rendah intensitas serangan P capsicimenurun hingga 99 - 100 %. Hasil analisis kimia tanah dan mikroba tanah menunjukkan bahwa aplikasi kompos bioaktivator meningkatkan keragaman jenis dan jumlah mikroba di dalam rhizosfer serta meningkatkan ketersediaan hara.
