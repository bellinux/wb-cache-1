40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{looked at}} the role that tires play in <b>car</b> <b>crash.</b> In {{the course of our}} study, we {{analyzed}} various causes of tire related <b>car</b> <b>crash</b> which includes; tire pressure (under-inflation and over-inflation) and abnormal wears. Bad inflation pressure of tires, either under-inflation or over-inflation causes tires to wear easily and increases poor vehicle handling by drivers. The solution to the crashes originating from tire was also outlined; inflating the tire with its recommended inflation, using good tires that are not up to six years from the date of manufacture and also the use of tires with good tread will prevent tire related <b>car</b> <b>crash.</b> Keywords [...] -Tire, <b>car</b> <b>crash,</b> inflation, prevention, wear, thread.

5|$|As {{the train}} departs King's Cross, Hedwig the owl flies {{alongside}} while {{passing through the}} outskirts of London. Hedwig flies away and Dementors arrive from over the nearby buildings. At the same time Harry, Ron, and Hermione pass along the corridor side of the carriage looking for food. The journey enters a tunnel; upon its exit, it passes by Malfoy Manor during a stormy night. Next, the train passes through a second tunnel and {{the lights in the}} compartments go out as a Dementor enters the train and passes along the corridor; Harry Potter uses his magic to defeat the Dementor. After exiting the tunnel, riders are greeted by Hagrid flying on a motorbike with Hogwarts in the background. As the train enters a forest, the flying Ford Anglia appears and starts driving through the terrain. The <b>car</b> <b>crashes</b> soon after and the train leaves the forest, passing by Hogwarts once again before arriving at Hogsmeade Station with Hagrid greeting passengers.|$|E
5|$|Bond survives {{attacks by}} Jaws, Chang's replacement, during Rio Carnival {{and on the}} Sugarloaf Cable Car. After Jaws' cable <b>car</b> <b>crashes,</b> he is rescued from the rubble by Dolly, and the two fall in love. Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid {{indigenous}} to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River while under attack from Drax's forces; he eventually finds Drax's base near Iguazu Falls. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole the loaned shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead escape and pose as pilots on Moonraker 6. The shuttles dock with Drax's space station, hidden from radar by a cloaking device.|$|E
40|$|Study objectives: The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the impact of drowsy driving and day sleepiness {{on the possibility of}} <b>car</b> <b>crash</b> involvement in Athens area of Greece. Additionally, an attempt was made to elucidate other driving parameters that could be potential predictors of <b>car</b> <b>crash</b> risk, after controlling for socio demographic characteristics. Participants: A sample of 640 amateur drivers aged 19 to 65 was studied through personal interviews. Design: The questionnaire included items about drowsy driving, day sleepiness, symptoms of sleep disorder and hours of sleep and work during the week preceding the interview as contributing factors to <b>car</b> <b>crash</b> risk. In addition, drivers reported the years of possessing a driver licence, the total amount of kilometres and the distribution of kilometres driven in national, city and rural roads. Results: The logistic regression analysis showed drowsy driving and day sleepiness as significant predictors of <b>car</b> <b>crash</b> risk: higher scores of drowsy driving and higher day sleepiness increased the <b>car</b> <b>crash</b> risk. Additionally, driving experience was related to higher <b>car</b> <b>crash</b> risk. Conclusion: There is a need for expanding our investigation in other urban areas of Greece and for information exchange among research teams of southeast Mediterranean countries aiming at promoting safety-driving cultures...|$|R

5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, and the <b>car</b> <b>crashes</b> and spins if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{starts in}} a {{courtroom}} where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired Lawyer is accusing her of bringing devastation upon Springfield because of her selfish desire {{to be accepted by}} others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and asked them if she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is easier to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends {{in a short period of}} time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous <b>car</b> <b>crashes</b> and deaths.|$|E

25|$|His {{most celebrated}} novel {{in this regard}} is Crash, in which cars symbolise the {{mechanisation}} of the world and man's capacity to destroy himself with the technology he creates.

Ballard's disturbing novel was turned into a controversial—and likewise disturbing—cerebral film by David Cronenberg.|$|E
