5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} forages {{actively}} in low vegetation, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. It often forages in one area {{for a while before}} moving on to the next. It mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars, <b>crane</b> <b>flies,</b> and spiders. It may supplement its diet with seeds, berries, and fruit in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Diptera were {{traditionally}} {{broken down}} into two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, distinguished by the differences in antennae. The Nematocera are recognized by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and <b>crane</b> <b>flies.</b> The Brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae. Subsequent studies have identified the Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in the Nematocera. The construction of a phylogenetic tree {{has been the subject}} of ongoing research. The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{is largely}} insectivorous and feeds on both pest and other arthropods. The food range includes spiders, <b>crane</b> <b>flies,</b> moths, mayflies, dragonflies, damsel flies, grasshoppers, earwigs, lacewings, caddisflies, flies, beetles, sawflies, bees, wasps and ants. Prey are consumed in both adult and larvae stages of development, and common starlings will also feed on earthworms, snails, small amphibians and lizards. While {{the consumption of}} invertebrates is necessary for successful breeding, common starlings are omnivorous and can also eat grains, seeds, fruits, nectar and food waste if the opportunity arises. The Sturnidae differ from most birds in that they cannot easily metabolise foods containing high levels of sucrose, although they can cope with other fruits such as grapes and cherries. The isolated Azores subspecies of the common starling eats the eggs of the endangered roseate tern. Measures are being introduced to reduce common starling populations by culling before the terns return to their breeding colonies in spring.|$|E

25|$|The diet of D. sylvestris larvae was {{determined}} based on close analysis of larval pellets and observation. It {{was found that}} the wasp larvae consumed both other insects and nectar from flowers. The queen finds the insects or nectar and returns to the nest to feed them to each of the larvae during the queen nest before workers take over foraging and feeding activities. At this time, workers begin feeding the larvae, using the same types of food. Insects included many types of flies, including but not limited to march flies (Bibionidae) and <b>crane</b> <b>flies</b> (Tipulidae). The type of insects that were chosen as the main food source depended on the time of the season. These wasps prefer to feed on flies and tend to avoid ants or spiders. Queens were also observed feeding larvae nectar from flowers one drop at a time by putting her tongue and their mouths together. This nectar comes from flowers of plants such as blackberry, raspberry, and Rhododendron. Nectar seems to be {{a very important part of}} the larval diet as both queen and workers took more trips and more time collecting it than either insects or pulp for the nests. Experiments on larvae have shown that the sugar in the nectar is a necessary energy source and that without it larvae will quickly become unable to survive. Therefore, both insects and nectar are an important part of the larval diet.|$|E
500|$|True flies are insects of {{the order}} Diptera, the name being derived from the Greek δι- di- [...] "two", and πτερόν pteron [...] "wings". Insects of this order use only {{a single pair of}} wings to fly, the hindwings having evolved into {{advanced}} mechanosensory organs known as halteres, which act as high-speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics. Diptera is a large order containing an estimated 1,000,000 species including horse-flies, <b>crane</b> <b>flies,</b> hoverflies and others, although only about 125,000 species have been described.|$|E

2500|$|Some species, {{especially}} Pholcus phalangioides, {{are commonly}} called daddy long-legs spider, granddaddy long-legs spider, carpenter spider, daddy long-legger, or vibrating spider. Confusion often arises because the name [...] "daddy long-legs" [...] is also applied to two distantly related arthropod groups: the harvestmen (which are arachnids but not spiders), and <b>crane</b> <b>flies</b> (which are insects).|$|E
2500|$|English {{speakers}} may colloquially {{refer to}} species of Opiliones as [...] "daddy longlegs" [...] or [...] "granddaddy longlegs", but this name {{is also used}} for two other unrelated groups of arthropods: the <b>crane</b> <b>flies</b> of the family Tipulidae, and the cellar spiders of the family Pholcidae, most likely because of their similar appearance. Harvestmen are {{also referred to as}} [...] "shepherd spiders" [...] in reference to how their unusually long legs reminded observers of the ways that some European shepherds used stilts to better observe their wandering flocks from a distance.|$|E
2500|$|Mouldboard ploughing, in {{cold and}} {{temperate}} climates, no deeper than 20cm, aerates the soil by loosening it. It incorporates crop residues, solid manures, limestone and commercial fertilisers along with oxygen. By doing so, it reduces nitrogen losses by denitrification, accelerates mineralization and increases short-term nitrogen availability for transformation {{of organic matter}} into humus. It erases wheel tracks and ruts caused by harvesting equipment. It controls many perennial weeds and pushes back the growth of other weeds until the following spring. It accelerates soil warming and water evaporation in spring because of the lesser quantity of residues on the soil surface. It facilitates seeding with a lighter seeder. It controls many enemies of crops (slugs, <b>crane</b> <b>flies,</b> seedcorn maggots-bean seed flies, borers). It increases the number of [...] "soil-eating" [...] earthworms (endogea) but is detrimental to vertical-dwelling earthworms (anecic).|$|E

2500|$|Mosquitoes {{are members}} of a family of nematocerid flies: the Culicidae (from the Latin , meaning [...] "midge" [...] or [...] "gnat"). Superficially, {{mosquitoes}} resemble <b>crane</b> <b>flies</b> (family Tipulidae) and chironomid flies (family Chironomidae). In particular, the females of many species of mosquitoes are blood-eating pests and dangerous vectors of diseases, whereas members of the similar-looking Chironomidae and Tipulidae are not. Many species of mosquitoes are not blood eaters and of those that are, many create a [...] "high to low pressure" [...] in the blood to obtain it and do not transmit disease. Also, in the bloodsucking species, only the females suck blood. Furthermore, even among mosquitoes that do carry important diseases, neither all species of mosquitoes, nor all strains of a given species transmit the same kinds of diseases, nor do they all transmit the diseases under the same circumstances; their habits differ. For example, some species attack people in houses, and others prefer to attack people walking in forests. Accordingly, in managing public health, knowing which species or even which strain of mosquito one is dealing with is important.|$|E
