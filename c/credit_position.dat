50|$|Capital {{began to}} flow {{in and out}} of Japan {{following}} the Meiji Restoration of 1868, but policy restricted loans from overseas. In the aftermath of World War II, Japan was a debtor nation until the mid-1960s. Subsequently, capital controls were progressively removed, in part as a result of agreements with the United States. This process led to rapid expansion of capital flows during the 1970s and especially the 1980s, when Japan became a creditor nation and the largest net investor in the world. This <b>credit</b> <b>position</b> resulted both from foreign direct investment by Japanese corporations, and portfolio investment (holdings of foreign exchange by the central government). In particular, the rapid increase of Japan's direct investments overseas, much exceeding foreign investment in Japan, led to some tension with ths US {{at the end of the}} 1980s.|$|E

In the first stage of the V-IGARCH (1, 1) model, heteroscedasticity with the mean returns through residuals was observed, where the estimated coefficients were negative. This finding indicated that maximizing returns requires efficient use of trading margins as well as availability of <b>credit</b> <b>positions.</b> The first stage estimation showed that returns decreased by 2.2663 % as a consequence of non-realization of efficient trading margins and effective <b>credit</b> availability <b>positions.</b> This was the result of endogenous and exogenous conditional probabilistic values, which were estimated with the second stage V-IGARCH (1, 1) regression models.|$|R

50|$|Credit {{scorecards}} are mathematical models which {{attempt to}} provide a quantitative estimate of {{the probability that a}} customer will display a defined behavior (e.g. loan default, bankruptcy or a lower level of delinquency) with respect to their current or proposed <b>credit</b> <b>position</b> with a lender. Scorecards are built and optimized to evaluate the credit file of a homogeneous population (e.g. files with delinquencies, files that are very young, files that have very little information). Most empirically derived credit scoring systems have between 10 and 20 variables. Application scores tend to be dominated by credit bureau data which typically amounts to over 80% of the predictive power from closer to 60% in the late 1980s for UK scorecards. Indeed there has been an increasing trend to minimize applicant or non-verifiable variables from scorecards which has increased the contribution of the credit bureau data.|$|E
5000|$|But {{the latent}} {{monopolist}} must justify {{the exclusion of}} a competitor from a market which he controls. Where, as here, a business group understandably susceptible to the temptations of exploiting its natural advantage against competitors prohibits one previously acceptable from hawking his wares beside them any longer {{at the very moment}} of his affiliation with a potentially lower priced outsider, they may be called upon for a necessary explanation. The conjunction of power and motive to exclude with an exclusion not immediately and patently justified by reasonable business requirements establishes a prima facie case of the purpose to monopolize [...] Defendants thus had the duty to come forward and justify Gamco's ouster. This they failed to do save by a suggestion of financial unsoundness obviously hollow {{in view of the fact}} that the latter's affiliation with Sawyer & Co. put it in a far more secure <b>credit</b> <b>position</b> than it had enjoyed even during its legal tenancy.

5000|$|Each item {{a member}} country {{exported}} would add bancors to its ICB account, and each item it imported would subtract bancors. Limits would {{be imposed on}} the amount of bancor a country could accumulate by selling more abroad than it bought, and {{on the amount of}} bancor debt it could rack up by buying more than it sold. This was to stop countries building up excessive surpluses or deficits. Each country's limits would be proportional to its share of world trade ... Once initial limits had been breached, deficit countries would be allowed to depreciate, and surplus countries to appreciate, their currencies. This would make deficit country goods cheaper, and surplus country goods more expensive, with the aim of stimulating a rebalancing of trade. Further bancor debit or <b>credit</b> <b>position</b> breaches would trigger mandatory action. For chronic debtors, this would include oligatory currency depreciation, rising interest payments to the ICB Reserve Fund, forced gold sales, and capital export restrictions. For chronic creditors, it would include currency appreciation and payment of a minimum of 5 percent interest on excess credits, rising to 10 percent on larger excess credits, to the ICB's Reserve Fund. Keynes never believed that creditors would actually pay what in effect were fines; rather, he believed they would take the necessary actions ... to avoid them.|$|E

Research and development (R&D) tax incentives offered by foreign countries and differences between U. S. and foreign tax rates provide opportunities that may influence where multinationals decide to locate their innovative activities. Using firm-level patenting data that identifies the country-specific location of innovations from 1986 to 2000, I examine the relation between innovative activities performed {{in a foreign country}} and these tax incentives using the Heckman (1979) two step estimation approach. I find evidence that the foreign percentage of innovative activities is associated with the attractiveness of foreign R&D tax incentives and with an increase in {{the effect of}} U. S. R&D allocation rules. In addition, the results suggest that firms in excess foreign tax <b>credit</b> <b>positions</b> decrease the amount of R&D activities in a foreign location with increased foreign tax rates, consistent with income shifting incentives. In contrast, I find that the firms in deficit foreign tax <b>credit</b> <b>positions</b> increase their foreign R&D activities with increasing foreign tax rates.

40|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 made {{significant}} {{changes to the}} foreign tax laws. The rule changes {{make it easier for}} U. S. multinationals to be in an excess foreign tax <b>credit</b> <b>position</b> and alter the way they allocate interest expense between domestic and foreign source income. As a result, there are incentives for U. S. multinationals to increase the debt levels of their foreign subsidiaries. This dissertation examines whether foreign subsidiaries of U. S. multinationals: (1) have increased the use of debt (relative to equity) in response to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and (2) have made location (in a high-tax versus low-tax country) a more important variable in financing decisions after 1986. A large sample of foreign subsidiaries of U. S. multinationals, which represents forty four percent of the Fortune 500, is used for testing the hypotheses of the dissertation. A second large sample of foreign subsidiaries of non-U. S. multinationals is used as a control and as a basis of comparison. The results indicate that foreign subsidiaries of U. S. multinationals have significantly increased the use of debt (relative to equity) in the years after 1986. This increase in debt is shown to be positively associated with the foreign tax credit characteristics of the U. S. parent, such as the U. S. parent's ratio of foreign assets to worldwide assets and their foreign tax <b>credit</b> <b>position.</b> During this same time period foreign subsidiaries of non-U. S. multinationals have slightly decreased the use of debt. The results also indicate that the location of the foreign subsidiary of the U. S. multinational has a different effect on its financing behavior after 1986. After 1986, foreign subsidiaries of U. S. multinationals located in high-tax countries have made a significant shift towards debt, while foreign subsidiaries of U.

40|$|AbstractWithin the new Basel {{regulatory}} framework for market risks, non-securitization <b>credit</b> <b>positions</b> in the trading book are subject to a separate default risk charge (formally incremental default risk charge). Banks using the internal model approach are required to use a two-factor model and a 99. 9 % VaR capital charge. This model prescription is intended to reduce risk-weighted asset variability, a known feature of internal models, and improve their comparability among financial institutions. In this paper, we analyze the theoretical foundations and relevance of these proposals. We investigate the practical implications of the two-factor and correlation calibration constraints through numerical applications. We introduce the Hoeffding decomposition of the aggregate unconditional loss to provide a systematic-idiosyncratic representation. In particular, we examine the impacts of a J-factor correlation structure on risk measures and risk factor contributions for long-only and long-short credit-sensitive portfolios...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{factors that}} {{influence}} the amount of foreign retained earnings permanently reinvested abroad and the market valuation of these earnings. I {{examine the effects of}} repatriation taxes and the difference between foreign and domestic profitability on the amount of foreign subsidiary earnings that firms reinvest abroad using the permanently reinvested earnings designation as a proxy for foreign retained earnings. This extends prior work that examines the effect of repatriation taxes on repatriations by including both foreign and domestic profitability and by allowing the effects to vary by the firm's foreign tax <b>credit</b> <b>position.</b> The results are consistent with the hypotheses and indicate that foreign retained earnings increase with the difference between foreign and domestic after-tax-returns. Foreign retained earnings decrease with the foreign tax rate for firms in binding foreign tax credit positions, but are not related to the foreign tax rate for firms in nonbinding foreign tax credit positions. Next, I examine how earnings management incentives affect the amount of foreign subsidiary earnings designated as permanently reinvested, controlling for the effects of profitability and repatriation taxes. I examine whether firms that are close to debt covenant violation or that fail to meet their target earnings have higher permanently reinvested earnings. The permanently reinvested earnings designation provides the opportunity to manage earnings because U. S. repatriation taxes need not be recognized in financial statement income if the earnings are designated as permanently reinvested. I find no evidence of earnings management to meet debt covenants; however, I do find evidence of earnings management to meet target earnings. Finally, I examine the market valuation of taxes on permanently reinvested earnings and whether this valuation differs for earnings managers and non-earnings managers. I hypothesize that because the tax estimate is undiscounted, the market values taxes on permanently reinvested earnings more negatively for earnings managers than for non-earnings managers because it perceives the investment to be of a shorter duration. The results support this hypothesis and suggest that the market recognizes earnings management attempts and values the tax estimate as if the reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings by earnings managers is not permanent...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this project is to {{evaluate}} the biological and economic feasibility of restoring high-quality forests on mined land, and to measure carbon sequestration and wood production benefits that would be achieved from forest restoration procedures. We are currently estimating the acreage of lands in VA, WV, KY, OH, and PA mined under SMCRA and reclaimed to non-forested post-mining land uses that are not currently under active management, and therefore {{can be considered as}} available for carbon sequestration. To determine actual sequestration under different forest management scenarios, a field study was installed as a 3 x 3 factorial in a random complete block design with three replications at each of three locations, Ohio, West Virginia, and Virginia. The treatments included three forest types (white pine, hybrid poplar, mixed hardwood) and three silvicultural regimes (competition control, competition control plus tillage, competition control plus tillage plus fertilization). Each individual treatment plot is 0. 5 acres. Each block of nine plots requires 4. 5 acres, and the complete installation at each site requires 13. 5 acres. The plots at all three locations have been installed and the plot corners marked with PVC stakes. GPS coordinates of each plot have been collected. Tree survival, height and diameter were measured after the first growing season. There were significant treatment and treatment x site interactions. A STELLA{reg_sign}-based model helped us develop insight as to whether it is possible to differentiate the permanent SOC from the C contained in the labile forms of SOM. The model can be used for predicting the amount of C sequestered on mine lands, and the amount of C that is expected to reside in the mine soil for more than 1, 000 years. Based on our work, it appears that substantial carbon payments to landowners would be required to reach ''profitability'' under present circumstances. However, even though the payments that we examine could generate non-negative LEVs, {{there is no guarantee that}} the payments will actually cause landowners to reforest in practice.

30|$|This {{study found}} that trading margins, credit availability, and price discreteness affect the {{variance}} of returns in the Indian futures markets. The {{study also found that}} market participation was inadequate as a result of endogenous and exogenous conditional probabilistic reasons. Efficient trading margins and effective <b>credit</b> availability <b>positions</b> were not realized. Price discreteness had a negative impact on returns, as trading prices and credit availability in each of the trading hours were inversely related. Trading risks, and hence losses, were not minimized by hedging positions. The monopoly power in the Nifty market was 8.9526. Given this monopoly power, returns were less elastic with respect to the existing trading margins, financial resources, and market microstructure (price discreteness) that were available for reinvestment. Therefore, before investing in derivatives (index futures), market investors should evaluate trading margins, <b>credit</b> availability <b>positions,</b> and price discreteness. Through these signals, investors will be able to gain essential market knowledge and participate accordingly in trading for efficient returns.|$|R
