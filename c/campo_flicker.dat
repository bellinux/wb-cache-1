500|$|All {{members of}} the family Picidae nest in cavities, nearly always in the trunks and {{branches}} of trees, well away from the foliage. Where possible, an area of rotten wood surrounded by sound timber is used. Where trees are in short supply, the gilded flicker and ladder-backed woodpecker excavate holes in cactus and the Andean flicker and ground woodpecker dig holes in earth banks. The <b>campo</b> <b>flicker</b> sometimes chooses termite mounds, the rufous woodpecker prefers to use ants nests in trees and the bamboo woodpecker specialises in bamboos. Woodpeckers also excavate nest holes in residential and commercial structures as well as wooden utility poles.|$|E

50|$|The Andean flicker (Colaptes rupicola) is a South American {{species of}} woodpecker. It {{is found in}} grassland, shrubland and Polylepis {{woodland}} at altitudes of 2000 - 5000 m in the Puna ecoregion. Together with the <b>campo</b> <b>flicker</b> and ground woodpecker, {{it is one of}} the few largely terrestrial woodpeckers.|$|E
50|$|The ground {{woodpecker}} (Geocolaptes olivaceus) {{is one of}} {{only three}} ground-dwelling woodpeckers in the world (the others are the Andean and <b>Campo</b> <b>flickers).</b> It inhabits rather barren, steep, boulder-strewn slopes in relatively cool hilly and mountainous areas of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland and has yet to be recorded outside of Southern Africa. It is found in a broad swath running from south-west to north-east, from the Cape Peninsula and Namaqualand to Mpumalanga.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{aggressive}} and will defend rich food sources from other nectarivores; {{due to its}} size, it is generally dominant over other species of hummingbirds. Even much larger birds are attacked by diving at them when they perch; particularly when breeding the swallow-tailed hummingbird will go and [...] "dive-bomb" [...] birds twice its own length or more, such as <b>Campo</b> <b>flickers</b> (Colaptes campestris), curl-crested jays (Cyanocorax cristatellus) or smooth-billed anis (Crotophaga ani), until they have enough and leave. Disturbed by much larger birds such as Guira cuckoos (Guira guira) or hawks, it will usually just give warning calls, but a female swallow-tailed hummingbird has been observed to attack a Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsonii) [...] weighing {{more than a hundred}} times as much as the hummingbird [...] in mid-air. Warning calls are also given at mammalian carnivores and humans, though in urban environment this hummingbird may tolerate human observers for prolonged time, even when nesting, if they keep a distance of 10 meters or so.|$|R
50|$|The pampas flicker (Colaptes campestris campestroides) is a {{woodpecker}} in {{the family}} Picidae, it is usually considered conspecific with the <b>campo</b> <b>flicker</b> (Colaptes campestris), but some authorities consider it a distinct species. It is found in south-eastern Brazil, central and southern Paraguay, Uruguay and north-western and western Argentina.|$|E

50|$|The <b>campo</b> <b>flicker</b> (Colaptes campestris) is {{a species}} of bird in the {{woodpecker}} family. It is found {{in a wide range}} of open and semi-open habitats in eastern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and north-eastern Argentina, with isolated populations in Amap√° and southern Suriname. Though it frequently can be seen in trees or bushes, it is among the very few woodpeckers that spends a significant portion of its life on the ground. It breeds in holes in trees, termite mounds or earth banks. It is generally common, and therefore considered to be of least concern by IUCN. The southern population has a white (not black) throat, and is sometimes considered a separate species, the pampas flicker (Colaptes campestroides).|$|E
