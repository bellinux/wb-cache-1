40|$|Scattered Shadows, by {{the author}} of the {{groundbreaking}} Black Like Me, is a memoir comprising essays written in the 1940 s and 1950 s covering Griffin 2 ̆ 7 s gradual descent into blindness after a war injury, and the sudden, spontaneous, inexplicable restoration of his vision ten years later. Here Griffin beautifully recounts his eventual acceptance, and even embracing, of his disability. For avid readers, who read many good things all the time, it is a revelation to come across a book that is as outstanding as this one. Page after page is filled with intelligence, insight, and occasional humor. The chapter titled 2 ̆ 2 The Blind Man of Tours 2 ̆ 2 exemplifies the book 2 ̆ 7 s poignancy. Griffin recalls his exchange with a blind beggar in France, whom he visited to gain understanding of what lay ahead for him as his vision was fading. The beggar, who presented himself as a vagabond by day, appeared in silk brocade and leather slippers when he greeted Griffin at the door of his room. The two listened to classical music as they carried on a conversation that was deeply meaningful and satisfying to both of them, and instructive to Griffin. The editing, by Griffin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>widow</b> 2 ̆ 7 s second husband, is excellent.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} position of slaveholding widows in the eastern states of the American South between 1790 and 1860. Widowhood significantly changed the responsibilities and social position of slaveholding women, endowing them with legal independence and property rights. Slaveholding widows routinely did white men 2 ̆ 7 s work: managing plantations, hiring overseers, commanding slaves, and contracting with merchants. Slaveholding widows 2 ̆ 7 actions as household heads and independent women raise critical questions about the ways that gender and slavery shaped white women 2 ̆ 7 s access to and exercise of power. Using concepts of feminine dependence, familial interdependence, and master-class privilege to facilitate and justify their work, these widows avoided being treated as transgressive or anomalous. Performing both women 2 ̆ 7 s and men 2 ̆ 7 s work in a society supposedly characterized by rigid patriarchy, these widows helped to shape the meanings of gender for their households, their families, and their communities. Moreover, the comparatively advantageous position of its widows reveals the extent {{and the limits of}} the slaveholding class 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> power: <b>widows</b> participated in, contributed to, and benefited from the 2 ̆ 2 fictive mastery 2 ̆ 2 of the slaveholding class.
