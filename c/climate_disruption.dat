2500|$|Climate {{engineering}} {{opens up}} various {{political and economic}} issues. The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to solar radiation management tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, solar radiation management methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional <b>climate</b> <b>disruptions.</b> As {{a result of these}} differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called [...] "free rider problem"), whereas the key governance issue for solar radiation management is making sure actors do not do too much (the [...] "free driver" [...] problem).|$|R

40|$|Global warming’ {{may be a}} {{familiar}} term, but it is seriously misleading. Human actions are causing a massive disruption to the planet's climate that is severe, rapid, very variable over space and time, and highly complex. The biosphere itself is complex and its responses to even simple changes are difficult to predict in detail. One can likely only be certain that many changes will be unexpected and some unfortunate. Even the simple, slow warming of the climate will produce complex consequences to species numbers and distributions because of how species depend on each other. An alternative approach to worrying about details is to concentrate on understanding the most significant ecological changes, ones that are irreversible — so-called ‘tipping points’. Once such a point has been passed, even if society managed to restore historical climatic conditions, it might not restore the historical ecological patterns.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{disaster}} risk reduction programs and climate initiatives across the globe have focused largely on the intimate connections between vulnerability, recovery, adaptation, and coping mechanisms. Recent focus, however, is increasingly paid to community resilience. Community, placed at the intersection between the household and national levels of social organization, is crucial in addressing economic, social, or environmental disturbances disrupting human security. Resilience measures a community’s capability of bouncing back—restoring the original pre-disaster state, as well as bouncing forward—the capacity to cope with emerging post-disaster situations and changes. Both the ‘bouncing back’ and ‘moving forward’ properties of a community are shaped and reshaped by internal and external shocks such as climate threats, the community’s resilience dimensions, {{and the intensity of}} economic, social, and other community capitals. This article reviews (1) the concept of resilience in relation to climate change and vulnerability; and (2) emerging perspectives on community-level impacts of climate change, resilience dimensions, and community capitals.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} climate {{vulnerabilities}} of four least developed Asian countries—Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, and the Maldives—before discussing how efforts are underway to strengthen infrastructural, organizational, and community-based adaptation. Infrastructural adaptation {{refers to the}} assets, technologies, or “hardware” that can withstand climate change impacts, such as climate-proofed irrigation systems, roads, or electricity networks. Organizational adaptation refers to the endurance of an effective institution or set of institutions, usually government ministries or departments, in charge of planning and policy, {{as well as its}} capacity to develop and revise climate policies.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{provided}} {{ample evidence that}} global climate dynamics at time-scales between multiple weeks and several years can be severely affected by the episodic occurrence of both, internal (climatic) and external (non-climatic) perturbations. Here, we aim to improve our understanding on how regional to local disruptions of the "normal" state of the global surface air temperature field affect the corresponding global teleconnectivity structure. Specifically, we present an approach to quantify teleconnectivity based on different characteristics of functional climate network analysis. Subsequently, we apply this framework to study the impacts of different phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{as well as the}} three largest volcanic eruptions since the mid 20 th century on the dominating spatiotemporal co-variability patterns of daily surface air temperatures. Our results confirm the existence of global effects of ENSO which result in episodic breakdowns of the hierarchical organization of the global temperature field.

40|$|A {{dramatic}} {{population growth}} is projected for the least developed {{countries of the world}} (United Nations 2013), which will also suffer disproportionally from ongoing and predicted <b>climate</b> <b>disruptions</b> (IPCC 2013). More frequently occurring extreme weather events have led to yield losses and decreasing cattle populations—aggravating an already precarious situation and leading to critical food shortages. Food security is a function of food availability, food accessibility, food stability and food utilisation (FAO 2002; Ziervogel and Ericksen 2010). Climate change and population growth are seen as key drivers of food insecurity severely affecting farming systems (Muller et al. 2011; Haberl et al. 2011, Strengers et al. 2010), as well as the global energy demand and therefore induced biofuel production (Von Braun 2007 a), changing trade patterns through liberalisation and globalisation (Von Braun 2007 b; Lotze-Campen et al. 2010), and the state of health of the population (10 – 20 % AIDS rate in East Africa). Cause–effect chains, in which food security is involved (droughts– diseases–health–human capital), are also drivers over large regions (Ziervogel and Ericksen 2010). Most of these drivers do not only lead to a productivity decline, but also often result in a degraded natural resource base and declining soil fertility (Graef et al. 2000).
