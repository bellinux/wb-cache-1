40|$|It is {{the object}} of the {{presented}} paper to provide an electromechanical rotary valve actuating system for opening and closing valves of an internal combustion engine capable of separately controlling both the inlet and exhaust valve operations of each individual cylinder in a multi-cylinder engine. This indicates that only one valve will be required for each cylinder of the engine. Previously published versions of this concept require a separate valve for intake and exhaust in each cylinder. The system provides an alternative to the <b>camshaft</b> <b>assembly</b> in an attempt to overcome the limitations and inadequacies inevitably posed by a fully mechanical system. The prototype development is approached in a theoretical manner beginning with the conceptualization and design of a rotating disk with a notches and corresponding closure surfaces to open and close the flow path. The actuated disk and notch design is then refined and followed by the design of an inlet and exhaust manifold to correspond to the valve design and the theorizing and design of a sealing gasket. The rotating speed of the valve is determined by a general idling speed and can be varied to provide variable valve timing with the motor. The final assembly eliminates a majority of the moving parts currently used in camshaft systems like the cam camshaft rocker arm push rod and springs and results in a significantly lighter valve actuation system. By eliminating the translatory motion of valves the problem of valves slamming on the valve seats at high velocities is eliminated thus greatly reducing engine wear...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we address}} the problem of {{controlling}} robots with arbitrarily-switched constraints and unknown dynamics. Switching between different constraints of a robot would result in a switched nonlinear system that does not inherit the behavior of its individual subsystems. In order to guarantee stable performance of robots with arbitrarily switched constraints and unknown dynamics, we propose a Robust Adaptive Fuzzy Control (RAFC) strategy that can guarantee global stable performance under such challenging conditions. The suggested control strategy relies on the synergy of the Sliding Mode Control (SMC) that adds robustness against possible dynamics parameters drift, finding a Common Lyapunov Function (CLF) that guarantees stability under arbitrary constraints switching, and Direct Adaptive Fuzzy System (DAFS) that relaxes the need for knowing the precise robot dynamics. Experiments are performed on a KUKA Lightweight Robot (LWR) doing <b>camshaft</b> caps <b>assembly</b> of an automotive powertrain. The given robotic assembly process falls in the category of switched constrained robots and the efficiency of the suggested RAFC strategy in controlling such a robotic task will be shown...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} as Surface Engineering, 2005, 21, (1), pp. 67 - 71. It {{is available from}} [URL] Doi: 10. 1179 / 174329405 X 30039 Diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings have been investigated for application in the automotive valve train and, in particular, the <b>camshaft</b> drive <b>assembly.</b> The drive assembly can have various force transfer devices, such as an overhead bucket tappet assembly or a cam follower assembly. Force transfer devices operate in severe tribological contact situations with maximum Hertzian stresses approaching 1 GN m− 2 and temperatures in the range 100 – 150 °C. Lubrication is often partially starved and, therefore, the thermochemical properties and surface finish of the components are critical to their successful operation. For motor sport applications, DLC offers improved wear resistance over steel alone; and for passenger vehicles, the high hardness and commensurately lower friction coefficient that DLC gives against steel counterfaces offers improvements in fuel economy and lower wear. This paper presents the results from {{an investigation of the}} wear of DLC coated shims against standard production camshafts. DLC offers benefits in terms of reducing shim wear, but increases the wear of the camshaft. The wear mechanism observed for DLC is dependent on the oil type, but generally it is a pitting type mechanism. The cam wear occurs by plastic ratchetting. The consequences of the results are discussed in terms of the implementation of such coatings in standard valve train applications...|$|R
40|$|This Low Friction (High Efficiency Roller Bearing) Engine (LFE) report {{presents}} {{the work done}} by The Timken Company to conduct a technology demonstration {{of the benefits of}} replacing hydrodynamic bearings with roller bearings in the crankshaft and <b>camshaft</b> <b>assemblies</b> of an internal combustion engine for the purpose of collecting data sufficient to prove merit. The engines in the present study have been more extensively converted to roller bearings than any previous studies (40 needle roller bearings per engine) to gain understanding of the full potential of application of bearing technology. The project plan called for comparative testing of a production vehicle which was already respected for having demonstrated low engine friction levels with a rollerized version of that engine. Testing was to include industry standard tests for friction, emissions and fuel efficiency conducted on instrumented dynamometers. Additional tests for fuel efficiency, cold start resistance and other measures of performance were {{to be made in the}} actual vehicle. Comparative measurements of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), were planned, although any work to mitigate the suspected higher NVH level in the rollerized engine was beyond the scope of this project. Timken selected the Toyota Avalon with a 3. 5 L V- 6 engine as the test vehicle. In an attempt to minimize cost and fabrication time, a ‘made-from’ approach was proposed in which as many parts as possible would be used or modified from production parts to create the rollerized engine. Timken commissioned its test partner, FEV Engine Technology, to do a feasibility study in which they confirmed that using such an approach was possible to meet the required dimensional restrictions and tolerances. In designing the roller bearing systems for the crank and cam trains, Timken utilized as many production engine parts as possible. The crankshafts were produced from production line forgings, which use Timken steel, modified with special machining and heat treatment. Timken designed and manufactured all of the roller bearing related components such as the thrust bearing package. The production connecting rods and camshafts could not be used for the roller bearing engine, so new ones were produced according to the team’s designs using Timken steel. The remaining miscellaneous components were designed and procured by FEV. Timken prepared a display version of the crankshaft portion of the production engine without connecting rods which could be driven by a motor through a cogged-belt and electrically actuated clutch arrangement. A modified version was also made in which the engine was outfitted with roller bearings on the main bearing positions. Preliminary tests showed that the rollerized engine was running with 1 / 3 less friction than the standard display engine. Additional friction testing and noise characterization was cut short because of shipping damage to the rollerized engine display and because of other project priorities. The team did successfully demonstrate the ability to package roller bearings satisfactorily in numerous locations in a typical automotive engine. The scope of this project did not include durability demonstration and that subject would have to be addressed in any follow-on work. In the actual test phase, the rollerized engine did show significantly less friction in motored dynamometer tests compared to its production equivalent. The 5 - 10 % improvement measured in this study was about half that seen in other studies. However, the fired test results did not show a reduction in friction which did not match prior experience or expectations. Subsequent teardown and inspection of the rollerized engine revealed potential sources of excessive friction in the experimental application. These features would be eliminated in a design not based on modification of production parts. The team is confident (based on experience) that friction reduction would be realized with proper modifications...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} Contact-State (CS) monitoring for peg-in-hole force-controlled robotic assembly tasks. In order to perform such a monitoring target, the wrench (Cartesian forces and torques) and pose (Cartesian position and orientation) signals of the manipulated object are firstly captured for different CS's of the object (peg) {{with respect to the}} environment including the hole. The captured signals are employed in building a model (a recognizer) for each CS and in the framework of pattern classification the CS monitoring would be addressed. It will be shown that the captured signals are non-stationary, i. e. they have non-normal distribution that would result in performance degradation if using the available monitoring approaches. In this article, the concept of the Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) is used in building the likelihood of each signal and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed in finding the GMM parameters. The use of the GMM would accommodate the signals non-stationary behavior and the EM algorithm would guarantee the estimation of the optimal parameters set of the GMM for each signal and hence the modeling accuracy would be significantly enhanced. In order to see the performance of the suggested CS monitoring scheme, we installed a test stand that is composed of a KUKA Lightweight Robot (LWR) doing a typical peg-in-hole tasks. Two experiments are considered; in the first experiment we use the EM-GMM in monitoring a typical peg-in-hole robotic assembly process and in the second experiment we consider the robotic <b>assembly</b> of <b>camshaft</b> caps <b>assembly</b> of an automotive powertrain and use the EM-GMM in monitoring its CS's. For both experiments, the excellent monitoring performance will be shown. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the EM-GMM with that obtained when using available CS monitoring approaches. Classification Success Rate (CSR) and computational time will be considered as comparison indices and the EM-GMM will be shown to have a superior CSR performance with reduced a computational time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] A fixture is {{designed}} and built to hold, support and locate every component to ensure that each is drilled or machined with accuracy and manufactured individually. A fixture can be designed for a particular job. A brake spider includes a spider body with a central opening and a slot for receiving a <b>camshaft</b> and bracket <b>assembly.</b> The brake spider is attached to axle housing via the central opening. The form to be used depends on the shape and requirement of the work piece to be machined. In the existing fixture, used for modeling brake spider component, only five components were machined per hour. In the present work, detailed study of brake spider component is carried out and design is modified to increase the productivity. The new fixture design is carried out by using CATIA V 5 modeling software and it is critically evaluated {{for the failure of}} piston rod component, by finite element method (FEM) using ANSYS software. This modified design is adapted in the fabrication of fixture and is tested for its productivity. It is found that there is a considerable enhancement in the productivity to seven components per hour with required accuracy.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} developing novel Contact-State (CS) modeling, control strategy, {{and environment}} position localization (position searching) for force-guided robotic assembly processes of rigid and flexible objects. For the CS modeling, the wrench (Cartesian force and torque) signals of the manipulated object are captured for different {{phases of the}} considered assembly processes and using the Expectation Maximization-based Gaussian Mixtures Model (EM-GMM), a recognizer is developed for each CS of the assembly. The suggested EM-GMM CS modeling scheme is shown to have excellent Classification Success Rate (CSR) with reduced computational efforts. For the control part, it is shown throughout the thesis that a force-guided robotic assembly process is a hybrid nonlinear system with arbitrary switching signal resulted from the constraints arbitrary switching during the assembly. Furthermore, the robot dynamics is frequently unknown, which {{is the case in}} many industrial robots, that would make the force-guided robotic assembly process to be an unknown hybrid nonlinear system with arbitrary switching. In order to overcome such a control challenge, a Decentralized Robust Adaptive Fuzzy Control (DRAFC) strategy is derived that guarantees stable performance under constraints arbitrary switching and unknown dynamics. For the environment position localization, the EM-GMM CS modeling scheme is integrated with a spiral search path and the precise hole position is identified for cases of position uncertainty. Experiments are conducted on a KUKA Lightweight Robot (LWR) doing different force-guided assembly tasks for rigid and flexible objects. Excellent performance is reported for the proposed EM-GMM CS recognition scheme, the DRAFC strategy, and the suggested position searching algorithm. The suggested EM-GMM CS recognition, DRAFC strategy, and position localization schemes are compared with the availably corresponding schemes and the superiority of the suggested schemes is shown. The reasons behind the superiority of the EM-GMM CS recognition scheme are the accommodation of the captured signals non-stationary behavior, employing optimized number of GMM components in the modeling process, and employing the EM algorithm that iteratively increases the log-likelihood. The causes behind the superiority of the DRAFC strategy are addressing the unknown nonlinear dynamics of the robot, accommodating the constraints arbitrary switching, and the robustness against possible dynamics parameters drift. The reasons behind the surpassing of the suggested position localization strategy are the robustness against the surface roughness and reduced computational efforts. The proposed EM-GMM CS modeling scheme, DRAFC strategy, and position searching scheme are applied to the entire peg-in-hole assembly processes of rigid and flexible objects. Excellent Localization Success Rate (LSR) was resulted when using the suggested schemes. Furthermore, the proposed CS modeling scheme, control strategy, and localization approach are applied to a couple of applications in automotive industry; the first one is the <b>camshaft</b> caps <b>assembly</b> of a cylinder head and the other is the air-intake manifold assembly of a powertrain. Efficient force-guided robotic assembly processes are obtained for both considered applications...|$|R
