500|$|The New York Post had {{reported}} in November 2006 that Pamela Anderson {{filed for divorce}} from her husband Kid Rock after he reacted unfavourably to the film during a screening. The Posts article specifically claimed he had said of {{her role in the}} film, [...] "You're nothing but a whore! You're a slut! How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that movie?" [...] In an interview on The Howard Stern Show, Anderson confirmed that Rock was upset by her appearance in the film, but did not confirm that this was the cause of the separation.|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{was also}} an {{advocate}} and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming {{to the defense of}} the cast and crew of Justin Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans. Ebert responded that [...] "nobody would say such a thing to a bunch of white filmmakers: how <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this to [...] "your people"?... Asian-American characters {{have the right to be}} whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent 'their people'!" [...] He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance, and also supported a number of Asian-American films, having them also screen at his film festival (such as [...] Eric Byler's Charlotte Sometimes).|$|E
2500|$|Copies of the SNCC speech were {{distributed}} on August 27, {{and met with}} immediate disapproval {{from many of the}} organizers. Archbishop Patrick O'Boyle objected most strenuously to a part of the speech that called for immediate action and disavowed [...] "patience". The government (and more moderate civil rights leaders) could not countenance SNCC's explicit opposition of Kennedy's civil rights bill. That night, O'Boyle {{and other members of the}} Catholic delegation began preparing a statement announcing their withdrawal from the March. Reuther convinced them to wait and called Rustin; Rustin informed Lewis at 2 A.M. on August 28 that his speech was unacceptable to key members of the March. (Rustin also reportedly contacted Tom Kahn, mistakenly believing that Kahn had edited the speech and inserted the line about Sherman's March to the Sea. [...] Rustin asked, [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this? Do you know what Sherman did?) But Lewis did not want to change the speech. Other members of SNCC, including Stokely Carmichael, were also adamant that the speech not be censored.|$|E

2500|$|The {{incident}} was {{caught on tape}} by a crew from the Spanish television company PVS, and the videotape showed that Kasparov's fingers were free of the knight for about 1/25 of a second, or a single frame of the video. Tournament director Carlos Falcon did not forfeit Kasparov when the videotape evidence was made available to him. As U.S. chess journalist Shelby Lyman pointed out, {{in the majority of}} sports [...] "instant replays" [...] do not overrule a referee's original decision and chess is no exception. The video has never been publicly released, at the request of tournament sponsor Luis Rentero. At one point Polgár reportedly confronted Kasparov in the hotel bar, asking him, [...] "How <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this to me?" [...] Following this incident, Kasparov bluntly told an interviewer [...] "... she just publicly said I was cheating. ... I think a girl of her age should be taught some good manners before making such statements." [...] Subsequently, Kasparov refused to speak to her for three years. Kasparov told reporters that his conscience was clear, as he was not aware of his hand leaving the piece. Although Polgár recovered {{by the end of the}} tournament, she went into a slump over the next six rounds, gaining only half a point. The incident may also have had an effect on Kasparov, who turned out a subpar performance in the tournament.|$|E
