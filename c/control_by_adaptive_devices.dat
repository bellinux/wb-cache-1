40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we design}} and {{implement}} an improved hardware-based evolutionary digital filter (EDF) version 2. The EDF is an adaptive digital filter which is <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>adaptive</b> algorithm based on evolutionary computation.

The FFC module has high computational ability to calculate the output and the fitness value since its submodules run in parallel. However, hardware size of the FFC module is large, and many machine cycles are needed. Thus, in the hardware-based EDF version 2, we combine the two modules to reduce its hardware size and machine cycles.

IAV was internalized by both myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs but only mDCs supported viral replication. Although infected mDCs efficiently presented endogenous IAV antigens on MHC class II, {{this was not the case}} for presentation on MHC class I. Indeed, cross-presentation by uninfected cells of minute amounts of endocytosed, exogenous IAV was - 300 -fold more efficient than presentation of IAV antigens synthesized by infected cells and resulted in a statistically significant increase in expansion of IAV-specific CD 8 T cells. Furthermore, IAV infection also impaired cross-presentation of other exogenous antigens, indicating that IAV infection broadly attenuates presentation on MHC class I molecules.

We develop gossiping algorithms which are efficient with respect to both the time and communication measured {{as the number of}} point-to-point messages. If the adversary is allowed to fail up to t nodes, among the total of n, where additionally n-t = Ω (n/polylog n), then one among our algorithms completes gossiping in time O(log 2 t) and with O(n polylog t) messages. We prove a lower bound which states that the time has to be at least Ω i log nlog(n log n) -log t j if the communication is restricted to be O(n polylog n). We also show that one can solve efficiently a more demanding consensus problem with crash failures by resorting to one of our gossiping algorithms. If the adversary is allowed to fail t nodes, where n- t = Ω (n/polylog n), we obtain a time-optimal solution that is away from the communication optimality by at most a polylogarithmic factor...|$|R

We compared adaptive immune defenses in two closely related species that have contrasting inflammatory immune responses, the widespread and abundant house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the less abundant tree sparrow (Passer montanus). We found that the house sparrow, which we have previously shown mounts weaker inflammatory responses, exhibits stronger adaptive immune defenses, including antibody responses, natural antibody titers, and specific T-cell memory, than the tree sparrow. Conversely, tree sparrows, which mount strong inflammatory responses, also mount stronger nonspecific inflammatory T-cell responses but weaker specific adaptive responses. Prevalence of avian malaria parasite infections, which are <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>adaptive</b> immune defenses, was higher in the geographically restricted tree sparrow than in the ubiquitous house sparrow. Together these data describe distinct immune defense profiles between two closely related species that differ greatly in numbers and distributions.

40|$|A Non-Uniform Memory-Access (NUMA) {{machine is}} {{currently}} the most deployed type of a hardware architecture for high performance computing. System virtualization {{on the other hand}} is increasingly adopted for various reasons. In a virtualized NUMA system, the NUMA attributes are transparent to guest OS’s. Thus, a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) is required to have NUMA-aware resource management. Tradeoffs between performance, power, and energy are observable as virtual cores (vcores) and/or virtual addresses are mapped in different ways. For example, sparsely located vcores have an advantage in memory caching compared to densely located vcores. On the other hand, densely located vcores tend to save power. Such tradeoffs lead to an abstract question: how a VMM as a resource manager can optimally or near-optimally execute guests under a NUMA architecture.

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} is {{an important}} tool {{in many areas of}} science. Increasingly complex mathematical models are being solved in large computer simulations, complementing and sometimes replacing traditional experimental techniques as the main tool of scientific investigation. In any such computer simulation, it is pivotal that the quality of the computed solution may be determined. However, the assessment of the quality of a computed solution is challenging, both mathematically and computationally. As a consequence, the quality of the solution must often be assessed manually by the scientist or engineer running the simulation. This is unreliable as well as time-consuming, and it effectively prevents computer simulation from realizing its full potential as a standard tool in science and industry. Computer simulations often require large computational resources, in particular the simulation of complex biological processes studied in the proposed research. It is therefore of utmost importance that computational resources are used as efficiently as possible, to make new results readily available and to expand the realm of which processes may be simulated. We thus identify reliability and efficiency as two key challenges in computer simulation. These two challenges are addressed <b>by</b> error <b>control.</b> <b>By</b> (<b>adaptive)</b> error <b>control,</b> the resolution of the simulation is chosen such that the computed solution satisfies a given accuracy requirement with minimal work.

40|$|When blood {{flows through}} a bifurcation, {{red blood cells}} (RBCs) travel into side {{branches}} at different hematocrit levels, and it is even possible that all RBCs enter into one branch only, leading to a complete separation of plasma and RBCs. To quantify this phenomenon via particle-based mesoscopic simulations, we developed a general framework for open boundary conditions in multiphase flows that is effective even for high hematocrit levels. The inflow at the inlet is duplicated from a fully developed flow generated in a pilot simulation with periodic boundary conditions. The outflow is <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>adaptive</b> forces to maintain the flow rate and velocity gradient at fixed values, while the particles leaving the arteriole at the outlet are removed from the system. Upon validation of this approach, we performed systematic 3 D simulations to study plasma skimming in arterioles of diameters 20 to 32 microns. For a flow rate ratio 6 : 1 at the branches, we observed the "all-or-nothing" phenomenon with plasma only entering the low flow rate branch. We then simulated blood-plasma separation in arteriolar bifurcations with different bifurcation angles and same diameter of the daughter branches. Our simulations predict {{a significant increase in}} RBC flux through the main daughter branch as the bifurcation angle is increased. Finally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the new methodology in simulations of blood flow in vessels with multiple inlets and outlets, constructed using an angiogenesis model...|$|R
40|$|Cancer <b>control</b> <b>by</b> <b>adaptive</b> {{immunity}} {{involves a}} number of defined death and clearance mechanisms. However, efficient inhibition of exponential cancer growth by T cells and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) requires additional undefined mechanisms that arrest cancer cell proliferation. Here we show that the combined action of the T-helper- 1 -cell cytokines IFN-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) directly induces permanent growth arrest in cancers. To safely separate senescence induced by tumour immunity from oncogene-induced senescence, we used a mouse model in which the Simian virus 40 large T antigen (Tag) expressed {{under the control of}} the rat insulin promoter creates tumours by attenuating p 53 - and Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When combined, IFN-γ and TNF drive Tag-expressing cancers into senescence by inducing permanent growth arrest in G 1 /G 0, activation of p 16 INK 4 a (also known as CDKN 2 A), and downstream Rb hypophosphorylation at serine[*] 795. This cytokine-induced senescence strictly requires STAT 1 and TNFR 1 (also known as TNFRSF 1 A) signalling in addition to p 16 INK 4 a. In vivo, Tag-specific T-helper 1 cells permanently arrest Tag-expressing cancers by inducing IFN-γ- and TNFR 1 -dependent senescence. Conversely, Tnfr 1 (-/-) Tag-expressing cancers resist cytokine-induced senescence and grow aggressively, even in TNFR 1 -expressing hosts. Finally, as IFN-γ and TNF induce senescence in numerous murine and human cancers, this may be a general mechanism for arresting cancer progression...|$|R

While each car optimizes its navigation planning locally to ensure the driver reaches his destination, all cars coordinate their actions in a distributed way {{in order to minimize}} the risk of safety hazards and collisions. These systems control the physical aspects of car movement using cyber technologies like local and remote sensor data and distributed V 2 V and V 2 I communication. They are thus cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we consider a distributed car control system that is inspired by the ambitions of the California PATH project, the CICAS system, SAFESPOT and PReVENT initiatives. We develop a formal model of a distributed car control system in which every car is <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>adaptive</b> cruise <b>control.</b> One of the major technical difficulties is that faithful models of distributed car control have both distributed systems and hybrid systems dynamics. They form distributed hybrid systems, which makes them very challenging for verification. In a formal proof system, we verify that the control model satisfies its main safety objective and guarantees collision freedom for arbitrarily many cars driving on a street, even if new cars enter the lane from on-ramps or multi-lane streets.

40|$|Under the {{scenario}} in which, within a traffic flow, each vehicle is <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>adaptive</b> cruise <b>control</b> (ACC), and the macroscopic one-vehicle {{probability distribution function}} fits the Paveri-Fontana hypothesis, a set of reduced Paveri-Fontana equations considering the ACC effect is derived. With the set, by maximizing the specially defined informational entropy deviating from a certain reference homogeneous steady state, the Navier-Stokes-like equations considering ACC are introduced. For a homogeneous steady traffic flow in a single circular lane, when the steady velocity or density is perturbed along the lane, numerical simulations indicate that ACC-controlled vehicles require less time for re-equilibration than manually driven vehicles. The re-equilibrated steady densities for ACC and manually driven traffic flows are all close to the original values; {{the same is true}} for the re-equilibrated steady velocity for manually driven traffic flows. For ACC traffic flows, the re-equilibrated steady velocity may be higher or lower than the original value, depending upon a parameter ω (introduced to solve the distribution function of the reference steady state), and the headway time (introduced in ACC models). Also, the simulations indicate that only an appropriate parameter set can ensure the performance of ACC; otherwise, ACC may result in low traffic running efficiency, although traffic flow stability becomes better.
