40|$|Mimosa pudica (<b>common</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>plant)</b> is a {{problematic}} weed in many crops in tropical countries. Eight experiments {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of light, seed scarification, temperature, salt and osmotic stress, pH, burial depth, and rice residue on the germination, seedling emergence, and dormancy of M. pudica seeds. Scarification released the seeds from dormancy and stimulated germination, though the germination of the scarified seeds was not influenced by light. The scarification results indicate that a hard seed coat is the primary mechanism that restricts germination. The germination increased markedly with the exposure to high temperature "pretreatment" (e. g. 150 °C), which was achieved by placing non-scarified seeds in an oven for 5 min followed by incubation at 35 / 25 °C day/night temperatures for 14 days. The germination of the scarified seeds was tolerant of salt and osmotic stress, as some seeds germinated even at 250 mmol L- 1 NaCl (23 %) and at an osmotic potential of - 0. 8 MPa (5 %). The germination of the scarified seeds was > 74 % over a pH range of 5 - 10. The seedling emergence of the scarified seeds was 73 - 88 % at depths of 0 - 2 cm and it gradually decreased with an increasing depth, with no seedling emergence at the 8 cm depth. The rice residue applied to the soil surface at rates of ≤ 6 t ha- 1 did not influence the seedling emergence and dry weight. The information gained from this study identifies some of the factors that facilitate M. pudica becoming a widespread weed in the humid tropics and might help in developing components of integrated weed management practises to control this weed...|$|E

40|$|Redwood {{forests are}} not {{traditionally}} {{known for a}} diverse vascular plant flora or {{a large number of}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>plant</b> taxa. Approximately 90 percent of redwood forests are privately owned and most are managed for timber production. Historically, information on <b>sensitive</b> <b>plants</b> in the redwoods has been scarce because few <b>sensitive</b> <b>plant</b> surveys were conducted on public lands, botanists have typically not had access to private lands, and no botanical survey data was requested in the permitting process for projects on managed timberlands. Prior to 1999, most of the information available on <b>sensitive</b> <b>plants</b> in redwood forests was based upon early twentieth century herbarium specimens. In the late 1990 s, state agencies began requesting <b>sensitive</b> <b>plant</b> survey data for projects conducted in managed redwood stands. Five years of plant surveys have resulted in an improved understanding of the ecology and distribution of many <b>sensitive</b> <b>plant</b> taxa. For taxa whose distribution and ecology have become better understood, landscape-level approaches to conservation are being developed.

40|$|The {{decisions}} animals make {{to adjust}} their antipredator behavior to rapidly changing conditions have been well studied. Inducible defenses in plants are an antipredator behavior that acts on a longer time scale, but <b>sensitive</b> <b>plants,</b> Mimosa pudica, {{have a much more}} rapid antipredator response; they temporarily close their leaves when touched. The time they remain closed is defined as hiding time. We studied hiding time in <b>sensitive</b> <b>plants</b> and found that individual plants differed significantly in their hiding times. We then showed that the effect of individual explained substantial variation in hiding time on a short time scale. Finally, on a longer time scale, individuality persisted but the amount of variation attributed to individual decreased. We hypothesized that variation in plant condition might explain this change. We therefore manipulated sunlight availability and quantified hiding time. When deprived of light for 6 h, <b>sensitive</b> <b>plants</b> significantly shortened their hiding times. But when only half a plant was deprived of light, hiding times on the deprived half and light exposed half were not significantly different. This suggests that overall condition best explains variation in <b>sensitive</b> <b>plant</b> antipredator behavior. Just like in animals, <b>sensitive</b> <b>plant</b> antipredator behavior is condition dependent, and, just like in animals, a substantial amount of the remaining variation is explained by individual differences between plants. Thus, models designed to predict plasticity in animal behavior may be successfully applied to understand behavior in other organisms, including plants...|$|R

Further, the potassium dichromate was used as the source of hexavalent Cr. The results indicated that Cr adversely affects both the growth and yield of plants. The soil properties vary with Cr and different fertilizer amendments and the yield of both plants were affected by Cr. We conclude that metal accumulation of seeds of green gram was higher than corn and the application of single fertilizer either farm yard manure (FYM) or nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium (NPK) enhances the growth and yield of both the tolerant and <b>sensitive</b> <b>plants</b> in the mixed crop cultivations...|$|R
