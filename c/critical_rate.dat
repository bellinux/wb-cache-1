50|$|Variable water inflow {{increase}} the ice flow rate. Observations show that subglacial water drains either through channels at low pressure or through interconnected cavities at high pressure. Above a <b>critical</b> <b>rate</b> of water flow, channelization and glacier deceleration results. Higher rates of steady water flow actually suppress glacial movement. Episodic increases in water input {{such as those}} produced by strong diurnal melt cycles result in temporary water pressure excursions. Such spikes produce ice acceleration. Similarly, rain and surface lake drainage events will cause movement.|$|E

5000|$|Among enlisted sailors, 12 {{consecutive}} years of good conduct (categorized as no court-martial convictions and no non-judicial punishments) entitles the sailor {{to wear a}} good conduct variation of their rate insignia: the chevrons which are normally red are replaced with gold. The perched eagle remains silver. However, the high year tenure initiative mandates that a {{petty officer second class}} may only have 14 years of service. If a PO2 fails to make petty officer first class within that time, the petty officer is involuntarily separated for not meeting advancement requirements. However, this may be waived in the event the sailor holds a <b>critical</b> <b>rate,</b> Navy Enlisted Classification or security clearance.|$|E
50|$|Unlike in most {{tactical}} RPGs, {{instead of}} gaining experience points each turn, {{all the characters}} get {{the same amount of}} points at the end of battle. After earning enough experience points, the character will level up and become stronger and possibly learn a spell. There are also skill points, gained when a character strikes the finishing blow. The more of these points a character has, the higher his or her <b>critical</b> <b>rate</b> becomes. Inotium, the in-game money, is also won after every battle. Occasionally monsters will join Cornet after they are defeated. These monsters can then be used in battle, like puppets, and can use special monster abilities.|$|E

5000|$|Weapons and shields: There {{are three}} {{different}} elemental weapons (fire, ice and lightning) that deal increased damage against certain enemy types (for instance, fire weapons do extra damage against orc-type enemies). The starting weapon {{and the secret}} [...] "power" [...] weapon do not deal elemental damage but instead can inflict critical hits randomly; the [...] "power weapon" [...] increases damage and has a higher <b>critical</b> <b>rate.</b> Characters can also pick up and use single-use projectile weapons such as spears and throwing axes; the crossbow is unique in {{that it can be}} fired five times. There are five different shields that allow you to completely negate enemy attacks before breaking.|$|E
50|$|Force Archers are a {{variation}} of Wizards who prefer to manipulate rather than amplify Force. Because of this, their skills have a lesser area of effect {{in comparison to the}} Wizard's skills but, in contrast, their damage is more precise, more accurate and with a higher critical hit rate. They visualize and create a weapon in a way similar to the Force Shielder, which is the Astral Bow; this weapon enhances their accuracy and <b>critical</b> <b>rate.</b> They also possess the highest attack range of all classes, even higher than that of a Wizard. Unique to this class, they possess supportive magic such as powerful single-target and party Healing skills, as well as many useful buffs, especially some used on new players alongside the Wizard's. Their skills have the fastest casting time of all, giving them a high damage per second value. Force Archers value Intelligence and Dexterity, both for magical power and dodging, as well as the balanced Battle Set and dual Crystals.|$|E

30|$|Barrier {{impacts on}} water cut and <b>critical</b> <b>rate</b> of {{horizontal}} wells in bottom water-drive reservoirs {{have been recognized}} but not investigated quantitatively. Considering the existence of impermeable barriers in oil formations, this paper developed a horizontal well flow model and obtained mathematical equations for the <b>critical</b> <b>rate</b> when water cresting forms in bottom-water reservoirs. The result shows that the barrier increases the <b>critical</b> <b>rate</b> and delays water breakthrough. Further study of the barrier size and location shows that increases in the barrier size and {{the distance between the}} barrier and oil-water contact lead to higher critical rates. The <b>critical</b> <b>rate</b> gradually approaches a constant as the barrier size increases. The case study shows the method presented here can be used to predict the <b>critical</b> <b>rate</b> in a bottom-water reservoir and applied to investigate the water cresting behavior of horizontal wells.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} pre-factor for {{the random}} coding bound is proved. Specifically, for channels with <b>critical</b> <b>rate</b> not equal to capacity, if a regularity condition is satisfied (resp. not satisfied), then for any ϵ > 0 a pre-factor of O(N^- 1 / 2 (1 - ϵ + ρ̅^∗_R)) (resp. O(N^- 1 / 2)) is achievable for rates above the <b>critical</b> <b>rate,</b> where N and R is the blocklength and rate, respectively. The extra term ρ̅^∗_R {{is related to}} the slope of the random coding exponent. Further, the relation of these bounds with the authors' recent refinement of the sphere-packing bound, as well as the pre-factor for the random coding bound below the <b>critical</b> <b>rate,</b> is discussed.

40|$|Reliability in Ricean multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) {{channels}} {{is crucial}} for safety related vehicle-tovehicle (V 2 V) applications. In Ricean channels, there is a Signalto-Noise Ratio-dependent <b>critical</b> data <b>rate</b> below which signaling with zero outage is possible. The link will be more reliable the higher this <b>critical</b> data <b>rate</b> is. We present results of spectral efficiency and outage probability from channel sounder measurements of V 2 V MIMO radio channels in the 5. 2 GHz band. Our results show that MIMO channels with higher spatial correlation lead to lower ergodic capacity and a reduced <b>critical</b> data <b>rate.</b> Nevertheless, the temporal evolution of the ergodic capacity and <b>critical</b> data <b>rate</b> shows that the channel with the strongest line of sight (LoS) component also has the highest capacity...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} role of phylogenetic trees on {{correlations}} in mutation processes. Generally, correlations decay exponentially with the generation number.

For mutation rates smaller than a <b>critical</b> <b>rate,</b> the underlying tree morphology is almost irrelevant, while mutation rates higher than this <b>critical</b> <b>rate</b> lead to strong tree-dependent correlations. We show analytically that identical critical behavior underlies all multiple point correlations. This behavior generally characterizes branching processes undergoing mutation.
