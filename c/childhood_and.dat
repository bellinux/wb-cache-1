5|$|<b>Childhood</b> <b>and</b> {{adolescence}} {{allows the}} development of an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on <b>childhood</b> <b>and</b> adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{association}} between eczema and asthma is well documented, but the temporal sequence of this association {{has not been}} closely examined. Objectives: To examine the {{association between}} <b>childhood</b> eczema <b>and</b> asthma incidence from preadolescence to middle age, <b>and</b> between <b>childhood</b> eczema <b>and</b> asthma persisting to middle age. A further aim was to examine any effect modification by nonallergic childhood exposures on the association between <b>childhood</b> eczema <b>and</b> both <b>childhood</b> asthma <b>and</b> later life incident asthma. Methods: Data were gathered from the 1968, 1974, and 2004 surveys of the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study. Multivariable logistic regression examined the association between <b>childhood</b> eczema <b>and</b> <b>childhood</b> asthma. Cox regression examined the association between <b>childhood</b> eczema <b>and</b> asthma incidence in preadolescence, adolescence, and adult life. Binomial regression examined the association between <b>childhood</b> eczema <b>and</b> <b>childhood</b> asthma persisting to age 44 years. Results: Childhood eczema {{was significantly associated with}} <b>childhood</b> asthma <b>and</b> with incident asthma in preadolescence (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 70; 95 % CI, 1. 05 - 2. 75), adolescence (HR, 2. 14; 95 % CI, 1. 33 - 3. 46), and adult life (HR, 1. 63; 95 % CI, 1. 28 - 2. 09). Although childhood eczema was significantly associated with asthma persisting from childhood to middle age (relative risk, 1. 54; 95 % CI, 1. 17 - 2. 04), this association was no longer evident when adjusted for allergic rhinitis. Conclusion: Childhood eczema increased the likelihood of childhood asthma, of new-onset asthma in later life and of asthma persisting into middle age...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Childhood</b> {{emotional}} <b>and</b> behaviour {{problems are}} antecedents for later psychopathology. This study investigated genetic and environmental influences shaping the longitudinal association between <b>childhood</b> emotional <b>and</b> behaviour problems and specific PEs. Method: In a community-based twin sample, parents reported on emotional and behaviour problems when twins were ages 7 and 12 years. At age 16 years, specific PEs were measured using self-reports and parent reports. Structural equation model-fitting was conducted. Results: <b>Childhood</b> emotional <b>and</b> behaviour problems were {{significantly associated with}} paranoia, cognitive disorganisation and parent-rated negative symptoms in adolescence (mean r =. 15 –. 38), {{and to a lesser extent}} with hallucinations, grandiosity and anhedonia (mean r =. 04 -. 12). Genetic influences on <b>childhood</b> emotional <b>and</b> behaviour problems explained significant proportions of variance in adolescent paranoia (4 %), cognitive disorganisation (8 %) and parent-rated negative symptoms (3 %). Unique environmental influences on <b>childhood</b> emotional <b>and</b> behaviour problems explained ≤ 1 % of variance in PEs. Common environmental influences were only relevant for the relationship between <b>childhood</b> emotional <b>and</b> behaviour problems and parent-rated negative symptoms (explaining 28 % of variance) and are partly due to correlated rater effects. Conclusions: <b>Childhood</b> emotional <b>and</b> behaviour problems are significantly, if weakly, associated with adolescent PEs. These associations are driven in part by common genetic influences underlying both emotional and behaviour problems and PEs. However, psychotic experiences in adolescence are largely influenced by genetic and environmental factors that are independent of general <b>childhood</b> emotional <b>and</b> behaviour problems, suggesting they are not merely an extension of <b>childhood</b> emotional <b>and</b> behaviour problems...|$|R

5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic <b>childhood</b> <b>and</b> thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E

The aim of this study was to examine associations between personality disorder, childhood temperament, adverse <b>childhood</b> experiences, <b>and</b> victimisation. The Prisoner Cohort Study was carried out as part of the dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD) service development programme commissioned by the Home Office. The study comprised 1396 male offenders interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID II) to diagnose personality disorders in addition to reveal selfreported experiences of <b>childhood</b> victimisation <b>and</b> disadvantage. Independent and joint relationships were examined between reported temperament <b>and</b> adverse <b>childhood</b> experiences <b>and</b> Axis II disorders measured at interview. Prisoners with personality disorder reported adverse <b>childhood</b> experiences <b>and</b> victimisation more frequently than those with no personality disorder. Different childhood experiences were interrelated with specific personality disorder categories. Associations between temperamental features and specific personality disorders were increased by the addition of adverse childhood experiences (joint effects). A difficult temperament <b>and</b> <b>childhood</b> adversity increase the likelihood of personality disorder in prisoners and may be risk factors to target for future early intervention...|$|R
40|$|Master of EducationThere {{has been}} a lot of {{academic}} interest in understanding the relationships between early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> the parents of children in their care. The literature has identified that despite knowing the importance of a positive relationship with parents early childhood staff find these relationships difficult. The literature has identified many barriers to an equitable relationship forming between early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> parents. The literature also suggested possible solutions. This masters study examined the relationship between early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> parents by exploring what each thinks of the other and how they see each other. -This study asks the question: "Do the "images" early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> parents have of each other contribute or become a barrier to an equitable relationship developing"? The participants in the study were from three child care centres in metropolitan Melbourne, eleven early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> nine parents whose children attended - the centres. Three data collection methods were used: - Face-to-face semi-structured interviews - Participant Little Narrative Conference (PLNC) - Journals/diaries Grounded Theory was used to firstly code and then analyse the data. The themes that developed included: - the communication styles between early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> parents, - the types of knowledge early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> parents have of the child and the respect or otherwise each has of the other's knowledge - the roles parents play in the early <b>childhood</b> service <b>and</b> how the early <b>childhood</b> staff saw <b>and</b> encouraged those roles. The data from the semi-structured interviews and PLNC mirrored the issues raised in the literature review. It was the journals/diaries that provided new data to examine as well as offering a different perspective in which to review data from the other data collection methods. The journal/diary data from both the early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> the parents provided a new lens through which to look at the relationships between early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> parents. The study found that it was not so much the images early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> parents had of each other but the images early childhood staff had of themselves which enhanced or became a barrier to an equitable relationship forming. These new understandings offer a different way forward towards the possibility of more equitable relationships forming between early <b>childhood</b> staff <b>and</b> parents and opened up possibilities for further study.
