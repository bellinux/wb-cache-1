Shifting {{the bulk of his}} forces across to the left bank of the Tigris, he then split his remaining troops into three elements. Two columns were to march around the marshes and attack the Ottoman positions from the rear. Column A, composed of the 2nd Dorsets, 117th Mahrattas, and a company of sappers, under the command of Brigadier General Delamain, was given the job of clearing the Ottoman positions between the Suwada and Ataba marshes. <b>Column</b> <b>B,</b> comprising the 17th (Ahmednagar) Brigade with the 20th Punjabis and 104th Wellesley's Rifles, under the command of Brigadier General Hoghton, were assigned to strike at the rear trench line of the Ottoman positions. The third element, the 18th (Belgaum) Brigade under Brigadier General Fry, would make a demonstration along the Ottoman front, fixing the defenders in position. Brigadier General Delamain would oversee the flanking maneuver. The Cavalry Brigade would circle around and set up astride the anticipated lines of retreat {{on the left side of}} the river. However, all of this would hinge upon the Anglo-Indian forces executing a night march across the desert and around the marshes.|$|E

Approximately 82 % {{of the chemical}} oxygen demand (COD) and 81 % total nitrogen were removed by the system when tap water diluted TCMS was continuously fed (dilution ratio, 1 : 4). Sulfide which was produced during anaerobic hydrolysis was used as part of electron donors for denitrification in column D.

50|$|Yet another {{regularity}} is the co-movement between {{output and}} the other macroeconomic variables. Figures 4 - 6 illustrated such relationship. We can measure this in more detail using correlations as listed in <b>column</b> <b>B</b> of Table 1. Procyclical variables have positive correlations since it usually increases during booms and decreases during recessions. Vice versa, a countercyclical variable associates with negative correlations. Acyclical, correlations close to zero, implies no systematic relationship to the business cycle. We find that productivity is slightly procyclical. This implies workers and capital are more productive {{when the economy is}} experiencing a boom. They aren't quite as productive when the economy is experiencing a slowdown. Similar explanations follow for consumption and investment, which are strongly procyclical. Labor is also procyclical while capital stock appears acyclical.|$|E
