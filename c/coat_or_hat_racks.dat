50|$|Wooden geta are {{provided}} for short walks outside when entering the house. It {{is generally considered}} polite to wear shoes instead of sandals, but sandal wearers may carry a pair of white socks to put over their bare feet or stockings, so that their bare feet will not touch the slippers that the host offers, or they may use tabi socks, worn with the sandals. The shoes are turned around so that the toe faces the door after taking them off. During the winter time, if a guest is wearing a <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat,</b> the guest will remove the <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat</b> before the host opens the door. When the guest is leaving, {{he or she does}} not put on the <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat</b> until the door has closed.|$|R
60|$|Crickets during {{stacking}} {{time were}} innumerable and voracious as rust or fire. They ate our <b>coats</b> <b>or</b> <b>hats</b> if we left them beside the stack. They gnawed the fork handles and devoured any straps {{that were left}} lying about, but their multitudinous song was a beautiful inwrought part of the symphony.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} objects of the scene, from Ravenshaw's point of view, was poor Winklemann's house--a small one which stood on a low spot already surrounded by water. In front of it was Winklemann himself, wading through the flood, without <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat,</b> and carrying a large bundle in his arms.|$|R

The main purpose of this experiment is to simulate the condition where suspects captured by the surveillance cameras are trying to masquerade themselves by wearing covers like rain <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat.</b> This experiment is also useful to identify the ability of the proposed method to discriminate individuals who wear loose outfits like baggy pants and skirt (for ladies) which can obstruct the gait pattern from being observed properly.|$|R

5000|$|The Alliance in Telluride advertised {{that there}} was no strike, and, with the militia, they [...] "acted as a {{fortified}} employment agency for the mines." [...] Meanwhile, union miners could have pockets stuffed with money, but were still found guilty of vagrancy and expelled. Finally, the Citizens' Alliance in Telluride acted as a vigilante mob, issuing itself national guard rifles and rounding up the remaining sixty-five union men and supporters late on an icy night. Some of the detainees were without shoes and shirt, most without <b>coats</b> <b>or</b> <b>hats.</b> About fourteen of them were injured, at least one was robbed, and all were forced out of town.|$|R

60|$|I grew {{desperate and}} {{wondered}} if I could escape. Perhaps I might slip {{out of the back}} door and run for it, without my great <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat</b> although the night was so cold and I should probably be taken up as a lunatic. No, it was impossible for I had forged a chain that might not be broken. I had passed my word of honour. Well, I was in for it and after all what was there of which I need be afraid that I should tremble and shrink back as though I were about to run away with somebody's wife, or rather to be run away with quite contrary to my own inclination? Nothing at all. A mere nonsensical ordeal much less serious than a visit to the dentist.|$|R
60|$|The wild {{note of the}} hound manifestly stirred Bo to irrepressible action. Snatching up Dale's lighter rifle, {{she shoved}} it into her saddle-sheath, and, leaping on the mustang, she ran him over brush and brook, {{straight}} down the park toward the place Pedro was climbing. For an instant Helen stood amazed beyond speech. When Bo sailed over a big log, like a steeple-chaser, then Helen answered to further unconsidered impulse by frantically getting her saddle fastened. Without <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat</b> she mounted. The nervous horse bolted almost before she got into the saddle. A strange, trenchant trembling coursed through all her veins. She wanted to scream for Bo to wait. Bo was out of sight, but the deep, muddy tracks in wet places and the path through the long grass afforded Helen an easy trail to follow. In fact, her horse needed no guiding. He ran {{in and out of}} the straggling spruces along the edge of the park, and suddenly wheeled around a corner of trees to come upon the gray mustang standing still. Bo was looking up and listening.|$|R

Dresses were often accompanied by the Minoan corset, an early form of corset created as a close fitting blouse, designed to narrow the waist, as a narrow waist was prized in Minoan culture. The belt, also kept tight, and used to narrow the waist before the corset, a long <b>or</b> short <b>coat,</b> <b>or</b> a <b>hat</b> were used to supplement the female outfit. Ancient brooches, widespread in the Mediterranean, were used throughout the period.|$|R

At {{the end of the day}} the shamrock which has been worn in the <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> the <b>hat</b> is removed and put into the final glass of grog or tumbler of punch; and when the health has been drunk or the toast honoured, the shamrock should be picked out from the bottom of the glass and thrown over the left shoulder.The shamrock is still chiefly associated with Saint Patrick's Day, which has become the Irish national holiday, and is observed with parades and celebrations worldwide. The custom of wearing shamrock on the day is still observed and depictions of shamrocks are habitually seen during the celebrations.|$|R

60|$|The {{hall was}} round, painted white and dimly lit by an {{overhead}} electric globe. In the centre {{was a huge}} green vase filled with great branches {{of some sort of}} blossoms. Not a picture hung upon the walls, nor was there any hall stand, chest, closet for <b>coats</b> <b>or</b> <b>hats,</b> <b>or</b> any of the usual furbishings of such a place. There were three rugs upon the polished floor and nothing else except a yawning stairway and closed doors. Whatever servants might be in attendance were evidently in a distant part of the building. Not a sound was to be heard. Still without any lack of courage, but oppressed with that curious sense of unreality, she turned almost automatically towards the door on the left and opened it. Again it closed behind her noiselessly. She realised that she was in one of the principal reception rooms of the house, dimly lit as the hall from a dome-shaped globe set into the ceiling. She moved a yard or two across the threshold and stood looking about her. Here again there was an almost singular absence of furniture. The walls were hung with apple-green silk, richly embroidered. There were some rugs upon the polished floor, a few quaintly carved chairs set with their backs against the wall, and opposite to her the ebony cabinet of which La Belle Nita had spoken. She moved towards it. Somehow or other, she found herself with the other key in her hand, stooping down. She counted the drawers--one, two three--fitted in the key, turned it, and realised with a little start the presence in the drawer of a roll of parchment, tied around with tape and sealed with a black seal. She laid her hand upon it, but even at that moment she felt a shiver pass through her body. There had been no sound in the room, which she could have sworn had been empty when she entered it, yet she had now a conviction that she was not alone. She turned slowly around, her lips parted, breathing quickly. Standing {{in the middle of the}} room, a grim, commanding figure in his flowing green robes, the dim light flashing upon the great diamonds in his belt, stood Prince Shan.|$|R
60|$|Feb. 28.--As I pass'd the {{military}} {{headquarters of the}} city, {{not far from the}} President's house, I stopt to interview some of the crowd of escapees who were lounging there. In appearance they were the same as previously mention'd. Two of them, one about 17, and the other perhaps 25 or '6, I talk'd with some time. They were from North Carolina, born and rais'd there, and had folks there. The elder had been in the rebel service four years. He was first conscripted for two years. He was then kept arbitrarily in the ranks. This is the case with {{a large proportion of the}} secession army. There was nothing downcast in these young men's manners; the younger had been soldiering about a year; he was conscripted; there were six brothers (all the boys of the family) in the army, part of them as conscripts, part as volunteers; three had been kill'd; one had escaped about four months ago, and now this one had got away; he was a pleasant and well-talking lad, with the peculiar North Carolina idiom (not at all disagreeable to my ears.) He and the elder one were of the same company, and escaped together--and wish'd to remain together. They thought of getting transportation away to Missouri, and working there; but were not sure it was judicious. I advised them rather to go to some of the directly northern States, and get farm work for the present. The younger had made six dollars on the boat, with some tobacco he brought; he had three and a half left. The elder had nothing; I gave him a trifle. Soon after, met John Wormley, 9th Alabama, a West Tennessee rais' d boy, parents both dead--had the look of one for a long time on short allowance--said very little--chew'd tobacco at a fearful rate, spitting in proportion--large clear dark-brown eyes, very fine--didn't know what to make of me--told me at last he wanted much to get some clean underclothes, and a pair of decent pants. Didn't care about <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat</b> fixings. Wanted a chance to wash himself well, and put on the underclothes. I had the very great pleasure of helping him to accomplish all those wholesome designs.|$|R

The picture was probably taken in the context of an article reporting on the slaughterhouse in Sütlüce on the Golden Horn, maybe on the occasion of the preparations for Kurbanbayramı. Preparations for this religious holiday and the start of festivities were reported in short articles and pictures that sometimes reappeared a year or two later on the same or similar occasions...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{production}} of The Sorcerer he appeared as [...] "the oldest inhabitant" [...] of the village of Ploverleigh. For the first run of H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), he understudied both Grossmith (as Sir Joseph Porter) and Temple (as Dick Deadeye). When Grossmith's father suffered a fatal collapse, Thornton took over in mid-performance to allow his colleague {{to go to his}} father. He played Sir Joseph and Deadeye at other times during the run. He had roles in short companion pieces, Cups and Saucers, After All!, and In the Sulks. During the run of the next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Pirates of Penzance, Thornton understudied, and occasionally played, the principal roles of General Stanley and Samuel. During these four years, he continued to keep his office job, contriving to keep his managers there ignorant of his theatrical work: [...] "A <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat</b> conspicuously displayed often served to encourage the belief that he was 'somewhere about' the great warehouse when, in fact, he had rushed away to the Opera Comique for a rehearsal." [...] In 1881, Thornton created the small principal role of Major Murgatroyd in the new Gilbert and Sullivan opera Patience. He at last felt able to resign his office job, where he felt his prospects were limited. He also occasionally deputised for Grossmith as Bunthorne and took a role for a time in the curtain raiser Uncle Samuel. In 1882, he realised an ambition to act in a strong serious dramatic role. For Florence Terry's farewell performance, a revival of W. S. Gilbert's play Broken Hearts was billed. A strong cast was chosen, including Terry's sister Marion Terry, May Fortescue and Julia Gwynne, but the two actors who had previously played the role of the misanthropic dwarf Mousta were unavailable. Thornton asked to play the part. [...] "What, Major Murgatroyd?" [...] said Gilbert, thinking the idea preposterous, but he gave Thornton a chance and was impressed. Thornton again appeared in Broken Hearts at his own benefit performance at the Savoy Theatre in February 1883. The theatrical newspaper The Era wrote, [...] "Mr Frank Thornton's usual line of characters could hardly have prepared the audience for the strength and passion he infused into the part of Mousta." [...] At the benefit, among other items, Grossmith premiered his musical sketch, The Drama on Crutches.|$|R
60|$|As he sat there, torturing {{himself with}} futile regrets, a faint shadow fell across his eyes. Looking toward the moon, hanging {{low in the}} west, he saw what seemed a vague, watery cloud {{obscuring}} her; but as it moved so that her beams lit up one side of it he perceived the clear, sharp outline of a human figure. The apparition became momentarily more distinct, and grew, visibly; it was drawing near. Dazed as were his senses, half locked up with terror and confounded with dreadful imaginings, Mr. Brentshaw yet could but perceive, or think he perceived, in this unearthly shape a strange similitude to the mortal part of the late Milton Gilson, as that person had looked when taken from The Tree five years before. The likeness was indeed complete, even to the full, stony eyes, and a certain shadowy circle about the neck. It was without <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat,</b> precisely as Gilson had been when laid in his poor, cheap casket by the not ungentle hands of Carpenter Pete--for whom some one had long since performed the same neighborly office. The spectre, if such it was, seemed to bear something in its hands which Mr. Brentshaw could not clearly make out. It drew nearer, and paused at last beside the coffin containing {{the ashes of the}} late Mr. Gilson, the lid of which was awry, half disclosing the uncertain interior. Bending over this, the phantom seemed to shake into it from a basin some dark substance of dubious consistency, then glided stealthily back to the lowest part of the cemetery. Here the retiring flood had stranded a number of open coffins, about and among which it gurgled with low sobbings and stilly whispers. Stooping over one of these, the apparition carefully brushed its contents into the basin, then returning to its own casket, emptied the vessel into that, as before. This mysterious operation was repeated at every exposed coffin, the ghost sometimes dipping its laden basin into the running water, and gently agitating it to free it of the baser clay, always hoarding the residuum in its own private box. In short, the immortal part of the late Milton Gilson was cleaning up the dust of its neighbors and providently adding the same to its own.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{this period}} sailors {{supplied}} or {{made their own}} clothing. Sailors developed traditional clothing suitable for their work: loose-fitting trousers with belts made of rope; tunics that slipped over the head, with arms to above the wrist so that the cloth would not foul in ropes passing through a cleat or pulley. For cold weather, a jumper was knitted from yarn or wool. For wet weather, old sail cloth {{was made into a}} <b>coat</b> (with <b>hat</b> <b>or</b> attached hood) that was waterproofed with tallow or fat. In these days, the officers would designate certain afternoons to [...] "make and mend" [...] (clothing). A sailor with little clothing to make or mend used this time as [...] "time off".|$|R
6000|$|... "There, {{it shows}} a light," [...] {{observed}} Flaxmore, as we tore along Oxford Street. At that moment a stupid cabman blocked up the way. There was a terrific shout from all the firemen, at once! but the man did not hear. Our driver attempted both to pull up and to turn aside; the first was impossible, the latter he did so effectively that he not only cleared the cab but made straight at a lamp-post on the other side! A crash seemed inevitable, but Flaxmore, observing the danger, seized the rein {{next to him and}} swung the horses round. We flew past, just shaving the lamp-post, and in three minutes more pulled up at a house which was blazing in the upper floors. Three engines were already at work on it. Flaxmore and his men at once entered the burning house, which by that time was nearly gutted. I stood outside looking on, but soon became anxious to know what was doing inside, and attempted to enter. A policeman stopped me, but at that moment Flaxmore came out like a half-drowned rat, his face streaked with brick-dust and charcoal. Seeing what I wanted he led me into the house, and immediately I found myself in a hot shower-bath which did not improve my <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> <b>hat!</b> At the same time I stepped up to the ankles in hot water! Tons of water were being poured on the house by three powerful engines, and this, in passing through so much heated material had become comfortably warm. The first thing I saw on entering was a foaming cataract! This was the staircase, down which the water rushed, breaking over masses of fallen brickwork and debris, with a noise like a goodly Highland burn! Up this we waded, but could get no further than the room above, as the upper stair had fallen in. I was about to descend {{in order to try to}} reach the roof by some other way, when a fireman caught me by the collar, exclaiming--"Hold on, sir!" [...] He thought the staircase was about to fall. [...] "Bolt now, sir," [...] he added, releasing me. I bolted, and was out in the street in a moment, where I found that some of the firemen who had first arrived, and were much exhausted, were being served with a glass of brandy. If there were any case in which a teetotaller might be justified in taking spirits, it would be, I think, when exhausted by toiling for hours amid the heat and smoke and danger of a fire-- nevertheless I found that several of the firemen there were teetotallers.|$|R
