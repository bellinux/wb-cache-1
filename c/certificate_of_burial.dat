40|$|In {{this article}} the author {{deals with the}} manner <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> and the customs common to the Jews in the {{relation}} <b>of</b> the <b>burial</b> <b>of</b> Jesus. The Jews uniformly disposed of the corpse by entombment where possible, and failing that, by interment; extending this respect to the remains even o f the slain enemy and malefactor, {{in the latter case}} by express provision of law. The interments are a chronicle of the strong family feeling among the Jews. Thus it was deemed a misfortune or an indignity, not only to be deprived <b>of</b> <b>burial,</b> but, in a lesser degree, to be excluded from the family sepulchre. The relation of the evangelistic narrative to the mode o f burial o f the Jews is obvios. Departing from the Roman Law which anexed a further penalty to execution, the refusal <b>of</b> <b>burial,</b> and the request for the body, the author analyses the duty <b>of</b> <b>burial,</b> the time <b>of</b> <b>burial,</b> the preparation <b>of</b> the body (washing, annointing, clothing), the place <b>of</b> <b>burial</b> (its site and shape) and the large stone capable of being rolled, confirming all with the OT, NT and Rabbinical texts...|$|R
