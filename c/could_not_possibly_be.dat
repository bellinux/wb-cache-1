25|$|Bohr was {{compelled}} to modify {{his understanding of the}} uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see EPR paradox) published an analysis of widely separated entangled particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.|$|E

He understood the parabola, {{both in terms of}} conic sections {{and in terms of the}} ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x).

500|$|Expo {{did not get}} off to {{a smooth}} start; in 1963, many top {{organizing}} committee officials resigned. The main reason for the resignations was Mayor Drapeau's choice of the site on new islands to be created around the existing St. Helen's Island and also that a computer program predicted that the event <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> constructed in time. Another more likely reason for the mass resignations was that on April 22, 1963, the federal Liberal government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson took power. [...] This meant that former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservative government appointees {{to the board of directors}} of the Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition were likely forced to resign.|$|E

500|$|Von Neumann's {{abstract}} treatment permitted him also {{to confront}} the foundational issue of determinism versus non-determinism, and in the book he presented a proof that the statistical results of quantum mechanics <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> averages of an underlying set of determined [...] "hidden variables," [...] as in classical statistical mechanics. In 1966, John S. Bell published a paper arguing that the proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid. However, in 2010, Jeffrey Bub argued that Bell had misconstrued von Neumann's proof, and {{pointed out that the}} proof, though not valid for all hidden variable theories, does rule out a well-defined and important subset. Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation, and that von Neumann did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories.|$|E
500|$|A {{more recent}} American immigrant, Ernst Skarstedt, who visited Sweden in 1885, {{received}} the same galling impression of upper-class arrogance and anti-Americanism. The laboring classes, in their turn, appeared to him coarse and degraded, drinking heavily in public, speaking in a stream of curses, making obscene jokes in front of women and children. Skarstedt felt surrounded by [...] "arrogance {{on one side and}} obsequiousness on the other, a manifest scorn for menial labor, a desire to appear to be more than one was". This traveller too was incessantly hearing American civilization and culture denigrated from the depths of upper-class Swedish prejudice: [...] "If I, in all modesty, told something about America, it could happen that in reply I was informed that this <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> so or that the matter was better understood in Sweden." ...|$|E
500|$|As a {{means of}} augmenting the meagre {{allowance}} provided by her father, Mitford began writing, encouraged by Waugh. Her first efforts, anonymous contributions to gossip columns in society magazines, led to occasional signed articles, and in 1930 The Lady engaged her to write a regular column. That winter, she embarked on a full-length novel, Highland Fling, in which various characters—mostly identifiable among her friends, acquaintances and family—attend a Scottish house-party which develops chaotically. The book made little impact when {{it was published in}} March 1931, and she immediately began work on another, Christmas Pudding. Like the earlier novel, the plot centres on a clash between the [...] "Bright Young People" [...] and the older generation. Hamish Erskine is clearly identifiable in the character of [...] "Bobby Bobbin", and John Betjeman is the basis for the supporting role of Bobby's tutor. The thinly disguised caricatures pervading the book shocked Lady Redesdale, who thought it <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> published under Mitford's own name.|$|E

500|$|In 1934, Birkett {{acted as}} {{counsel for the}} second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was {{described}} as [...] "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>be</b> Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] in block capitals. The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [...] her up." [...] A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.|$|E
