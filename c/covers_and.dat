40|$|The common {{confusion}} of land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> land use in many datasets is problematic for many data integration activities. This paper proposes an approach for {{the separation of}} land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> land use based on data primitives. Data primitives are those dimensions that describe at the most fundamental level the processes under investigation. In this case they provide building blocks that to allow land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> land use to be separated. A series of data primitives were identified from the literature and applied to US National Land Cover Dataset (2001). Mapped outputs, separating the concepts of form (land <b>cover)</b> <b>and</b> function (land use), show the degree of land use, the degree of land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> locations where the concepts of use <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> are confused. The separation of land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> land use facilities the integration of land data for environmental modelling and planning activities. The work promotes the need for land use <b>and</b> land <b>cover</b> to be maintained as distinct concepts in data collection activities...|$|R

40|$|Land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> {{land use}} data present {{information}} about the physical coverage of the earth surface (land <b>cover)</b> <b>and</b> its socio-economic purpose (land use). As such, land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> land use information {{can be regarded as}} basic information, describing the composition (occurrence of land cover/land use categories) and the configuration (spatial pattern) of the territory. Configuration and composition of land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> land use are the elements shaping the countryside. They are site specific and basically related to the geophysical conditions (e. g. topography, soil, climate) and are a reflection and consequence of the cultural, social and economic development in the past and present. Thus, land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> land use {{can be seen as the}} interface between natural conditions and human influence providing a sound framework for linking socio-economic development with (at least) some environmental impacts. Of specific interest is the analysis of changes in land <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> land use as a first attempt to capture impacts and consequences of socio-economic development.

As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company.

40|$|Canopy {{structural}} parameters {{are often used}} to give adequate representation of vegetated ecosystems for various purposes including primary productivity, climate system, water and carbon gas exchanges, and radiation extinction. Canopy {{structural parameters}} are usually described using several pseudo-synonymous terms, often measuring different components of vegetation canopies. Standardization in the definitions has fallen short, leading to confusion of terms even in standard text books making the comparison of historic measures futile. Here we clarify concepts {{that have been used}} for fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness measures. The fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness concepts considered are canopy closure, canopy cover, canopy openness, crown closure, crown completeness, crown cover, crown porosity, site openness and tilt openness. New methodologies are presented to obtain large scale fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness measures using hemispherical photography. The new methodologies and variations in definitions of fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness concepts are demonstrated using photographic measurements in complex topography. The results indicate that both fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness parameters can be estimated with a few point-based measurements using hemispherical photography. Hemispherical photography is therefore less time, labour and resource intensive, as compared to point based measuring techniques of canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness. Most of the commonly and interchangeably used concepts of fractional canopy element <b>cover</b> <b>and</b> openness measures represent physically different structural properties of a vegetated ecosystem...|$|R
