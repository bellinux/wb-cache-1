The charges were dropped in 1983 after Amway and its Canadian subsidiary pleaded guilty to criminal <b>customs</b> <b>fraud</b> charges. The companies paid a fine of $25 million CAD, the largest fine ever imposed in Canada at the time. In 1989 the company settled the outstanding customs duties for $45 million CAD.

50|$|In November 1907, {{two weeks}} before Havemeyer's death, a raid of the docks at the Havemeyer plant in Brooklyn by the U.S. Treasury Department {{revealed}} that the scales {{that were used to}} weigh incoming raw sugar had been tampered with and the firm had underpaid import duties. Two United States special customs agents, Richard Parr and James O. Brzezinski, tipped off by a disgruntled employee, discovered a concealed spring inserted into the scale which permitted the checker to exert pressure so as to reduce the weight. The criminal case against the American Sugar Refining Company was brought to federal court in New York in 1908 by District Attorney Henry L. Stimson and Felix Frankfurter, and was won by the government in 1909. A civil suit followed to collect custom duties owed to the government. To avoid further litigation and bad publicity, the American Sugar Refining Company agreed to settle the <b>customs</b> <b>fraud</b> case for $2 million in back payment. Individual officers of the American Sugar Refining Company were tried separately for criminal involvement. In 1909 dock foreman Oliver Spitzer was convicted for attempted bribery. Ernest Gerbracht, superintendent, and Charles R. Heike, secretary, and five company checkers were also convicted.|$|E
5000|$|Investigation {{within the}} US {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} five interconnected working groups involving all seven of the major Japanese companies, which met from 1964 until at least 1974. The groups, actively shared data {{on topics such as}} production, inventory, and shipment sizes. The information was then in ways similar to the ones already implemented in Japan. The cartels maintained an economic policy of increasing prices at the Japanese market while also dumping their products abroad, in an effort to damage their American competitors through predatory pricing. American companies failed to exploit their sudden competitive advantage on the Japanese market, while also suffering heavy losses domestically. The restructuring of the American television market resulted in the exit of 21 companies and the fall of numerous others into Japanese hands. Dumping and the aggressive use of rebates were determined to be forms of <b>customs</b> <b>fraud</b> under the 1921 U.S. Anti-Dumping Act, however. The U.S. Federal agencies such as the International Trade Commission conducted dozens of investigations, resulting in the Japanese-American Orderly Marketing Agreement, which limited the import of Japanese TV sets. In April 1980, the companies involved in the cartel were ordered to pay $66 million; however the collection of the fine was delayed for a significant time period as litigation continued.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} some factors that reduce evasion of customs duties in developing countries. Following the recent literature on customs evasion, we proxy <b>customs</b> <b>fraud</b> by discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics. Estimates first {{show that the}} more frequently a product is imported, the more <b>customs</b> <b>fraud</b> reduces. We argue that this result {{is indicative of the}} fact that customs officers use what they have learned from similar import declarations - use customs' internal information - to better assess the compliance of declarations. Then, we show that relying on an information provider - a pre-shipment inspection company in our case - seems to increase tax enforcement. Results indicate that pre-shipment inspections significantly reduce observed discrepancies in trade statistics. In line with previous studies, we find that the semi-elasticity of evasion increases with the tax rate. Finally, estimates confirm that enforcement is product-varying. Results are robust to various robustness checks...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{provide a}} new {{approach}} to the evaluation of pre-shipment inspection (PSI) programs as ways of improving tariff-revenue collection and reducing fraud when customs administrations are corrupt. They build a model highlighting the contribution of surveillance firms to the generation of information and describing how incentives for fraud and collusive behavior between importers and customs are affected by the introduction of PSI. The authors show theoretically that the introduction of PSI has an ambiguous effect on the level of <b>customs</b> <b>fraud.</b> Empirically, the econometric results suggest that PSI reduced fraud in the Philippines, it increased it in Argentina, and did not have significant impact in Indonesia.

40|$|Customs administrations in {{developing}} countries increasingly use risk-based techniques relying on data mining and statistical scoring. By demonstrating the value of using data analysis techniques to orient frontline controls so as to facilitate legal trade and combat fraud more effectively, these projects have helped promote a cultural change in these organizations. However, these risk management techniques {{may prove to be}} ineffective in assessing fraud risks based only on frauds detected by customs inspectors. In a context of moral hazard and low-performing customs administration, one way to address this weakness is to expand the approach by relying on other sources of information such as discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics. Several studies use these statistical discrepancies (mirror data) to identify fraudulent declarations and estimate their effects. By comparing Gabon's import customs data with discrepancies in its bilateral trade data, this paper stresses the usefulness of simultaneously analyzing <b>customs</b> <b>fraud</b> records and mirror trade statistics data. Such an analysis helps quantifying undetected fraud and therefore constitutes a valuable tool to target ex post audits. Then, based on the combination of these databases, the paper defines indicators to monitor the performance of customs controls...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} {{of the fact that the}} Congolese {{government}} has agreed to embark on a neoliberal project aiming to reform and modernize the country’s customs services, Kasumbalesa, a booming border town on the international frontier between Congo and Zambia, has recently been equipped with a “guichet unique” or “single window” facility. Although this new facility is considered a major landmark in Congo’s fight against <b>customs</b> <b>fraud,</b> and is believed to be a significant step forward in the process of formalizing the international trade between Congo and Southern Africa, it has not led to the complete disappearance of various unofficial arrangements at the border. In this article, Kasumbalesa’s world of customs is analyzed through the use of Sally Falk Moore’s concept of the “semi-autonomous social field”. It is shown that, despite the introduction of the single windows facility, customs officials in Kasumbalesa and their clients continue to negotiate their own arrangements for the import and export of goods. We argue that the introduction of the single window facility has had four unexpected outcomes: it has given rise to a growing competition between customs services for access to illicit revenues; old corruption techniques have been recycled in order to avoid the restrictions imposed by the new system; there has been a growing trend towards the use of “customs brokers”; and, finally, the provincial authorities appear to have resorted to the creation of a “shadow institution” in order to step up their fiscal revenues...|$|E
40|$|Anglophone African {{countries}} have been implementing reform and modernization initiatives in their Customs administrations. This paper outlines the progression of key reform and modernization initiatives in these countries since the early 1990 s, and assesses the gap between these reforms and those of more modern Customs agencies. The review suggests that Customs administration reform and modernization initiatives in Anglophone African countries generally lag behind international good practice and {{it is necessary to}} speed up implementation if revenue, trade facilitation, and trade chain security objectives are to be achieved. The findings also have implications on the design of reform programs and focus of potential technical assistance for the outstanding reform agenda.
