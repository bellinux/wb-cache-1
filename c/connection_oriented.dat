40|$|We {{present a}} striate-cortical model which proposes a direct {{relationship}} between cellular synchronization and perceptual salience. The model focuses {{on the role of}} the long-range horizontal <b>connections</b> between <b>oriented</b> simple cells in striate cortex and is able to account for current physiological and psychophysical results on contour alience. We demonstrate that horizontal connections between realistically-modeled multi-compartment pyramidal cells and interneurons can generate robust context-dependent synchronization. Closed contours induce better synchronization in the network tha open contours, and closure thus increases perceptual salience, as observed psychophysically by Kovács and Julesz. This result is a general topological property of synchronization. The model supports a temporal synchronization solution to the binding problem, in that changes in synchronization are directly linked to changes in visual perception...|$|R

Namely the traditional approach is based on block oriented schemes in which causal relations play an important role. However this causality is artificially generated in order to fulfil appropriate conditions for simulation on conventional sequential computers. Fortunately new concepts {{which are based on}} object oriented approaches, physically <b>oriented</b> <b>connections</b> and algebraic manipulation enable so called acausal modelling.

40|$|We present {{formulations}} of two condition measures (one for linear programming (LP) due to Ye, {{and the other}} for a matrix) as optimization problems over sign constraints. We construct, based on LP duality, a dual characterization of Ye's condition measure in the setting of Karmarkar's form. The elementary formulations (without utilizing the dual characterization) lead to trivial proofs of some results relating these two condition measures for polyhedra in Karmarkar's form. Such interpretations, using the sign constraints, allow for the definition of families of condition measures that are "between" the two condition measures. Our viewpoint provides further understanding of the relationship of the two condition measures. As a result of this new understanding, we point to a <b>connection</b> with <b>oriented</b> matroids and prove that a conjecture of Vavasis and Ye on the relationship of these two condition measures is false.
