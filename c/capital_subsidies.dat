In addition, we investigate whether the technology structure of “hidden” production may facilitate or counteract the effects of fiscal policies on firm behavior. Among our results we stress the following: first, <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> promote tax evasion; these subsidies induce firms to increase actual capital accumulation (a level effect), but also produce a reduction in the regular share of aggregate capital stock (a composition effect). Second, tax relief reduces underground activities and fosters capital accumulation, as well as aggregate production. Third, the technology structure matters for determining how to allocate resources between formal and informal production, hence the amount of reported revenues.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the nexus among {{selected}} firm-oriented fiscal policies (tax relief and <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies),</b> physical capital accumulation and underground activities. In particular, we examine the implications of fiscal policies aimed to support firms, such as <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> and tax allowances, {{in the presence of}} an underground economy. In addition, we investigate whether the technology structure of “hidden” production may facilitate or counteract the effects (the effectiveness) of the fiscal policies on firm behavior. Subsidies programmes and tax advantages for “infant” industries or depressed areas are often justified because the industry is not competitive enough and prices do not show full flexibility. However, granting <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> and tax allowances to firms has also important implications for underground activities and tax evasion. Underground activities occur in many countries, and there are significant indications that this phenomenon is large and increasing.

With international capital mobility and a <b>capital</b> tax (<b>subsidy),</b> the optimal emission tax rate is smaller (larger) compared to the rate when capital is untaxed.

We consider a tractable macroeconomic model with risk-less physical capital and risky human capital {{in which the government}} chooses optimally a system of flat-rate taxes/subsidies as well as the level of spending on public services. We show that it is always socially optimal to subsidize investment in human capital as long as i) there is some human capital risk and ii) public services are valued by individual households. A quantitative study based on a calibrated version of the model reveals that the optimal human <b>capital</b> <b>subsidy</b> is substantial, but the corresponding welfare gains are small due to strong general equilibrium effects. However, for the small open economy version of the model with constant interest rate and wages, the welfare gains from implementing the optimal human <b>capital</b> <b>subsidy</b> are large. ∗We would like to thank seminar participants at Zurich University and the Stanford Summer Workshop for helpful comments...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a simple model within which interjurisdictional tax competition and vertical interactions between two overlapping governments that share the same tax base can be analyzed simultaneously. We find that interjurisdictional tax competition reduces the global tax rate set by both overlapping governments (federal and local) but is unable to solve completely the distortion arising from vertical externalities. The model is also extended to allow for government subsidies to industrial capital. We give sufficient conditions for <b>capital</b> <b>subsidies</b> to be more efficient to attract capital when they are granted at a federal level rather than at a local level.
