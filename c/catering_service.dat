M.

2500|$|The private {{placement}} in 1987 allowed sufficient financing {{of a new}} terminal building. It was a [...] pointed building that was planned to have the largest possible surface facing the tarmac—to allow the highest possible number of aircraft to park. It was constructed {{in such a way}} that it could be easily expanded in both directions. The new terminal was completed in 1991 and cost NOK47 million. This also included a [...] tarmac, and expansion of the taxiway and parking for 300 cars. There was also a need to upgrade the runway, which had had no major maintenance since construction. The end of the Cold War had reduced the threat level and the military no longer saw a need to keep Torp at as high a level. However, the civilian airport operator needed the upgrades. They proposed that the airport operator advance the money, but this was rejected by the Defence Estates Agency. NATO decided that they had too many air stations, and was not willing to pay either. The airport operator still took the chance that the military would repay the advance, since it had done so in similar situation earlier. The runway was upgraded for NOK10 million in 1989, but only NOK1 million was refunded in 1993. The first charter flights from Torp were conducted in 1989.
