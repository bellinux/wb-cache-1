5|$|Once Montgomery {{had flown}} out, another two C-130s arrived in Khâm Đức to {{continue}} the evacuation; the first aircraft picked up 130 people, and the one after that took out 90. There were now {{only a few people}} remaining on the ground in Khâm Đức, and most of them were U.S. Special Forces soldiers and indigenous CIDG personnel. Major James L. Wallace flew into Khâm Đức and extracted the last group of people, as the ammunition dumps began to explode, and the aircrews reported witnessing hysteria among the Vietnamese soldiers who had lost family members in Bucher's crash. However, just when the aircrews believed the mission was over, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Jay Van Cleeff was ordered to reinsert the three-man <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Team,</b> which had been airlifted out of the compound earlier in the day by Colonel Cole. In protest, Van Cleeff argued that the camp was almost completely evacuated, but the control center insisted that the <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Team</b> be reinserted to complete their task of coordinating the evacuation. At about 16:20, Van Cleeff landed his aircraft on the runway and the <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Team</b> – led by Major John W. Gallagher – immediately disembarked from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, {{in order to take}} off. However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, in addition to the damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to take off. So the aircrew aborted the take off, offloaded the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to take off for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Team</b> (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E

500|$|One {{of the key}} {{problems}} for the early phase of the U.S. air program in Laos {{was the lack of}} forward air control (FAC) that would have pinpointed ground targets in the rugged, jungle-covered terrain for strike aircraft. The Air Force had no such aircraft in Laos, or anywhere else, having phased out its own programs after the Korean War. In 1963 the Air Force dispatched four [...] "sheep-dipped" [...] Air Commandos of the <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Teams</b> to Laos to work with the CIA. <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Teams</b> consisted of personnel who parachuted into a forward zone and provided air control for the aerial delivery of another unit (usually paratroops).|$|R
50|$|The Rodeo {{competition}} was renamed Airlift Rodeo beginning in 1987 by the MAC commander General Duane Cassidy {{in an effort}} to more accurately reflect the purpose of the event. The roles of the maintenance, Security Police, and <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>teams</b> also expanded in 1987. The latter two participated in overland infiltration event using Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) gear help to create realism, and the <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>teams</b> conducted High Altitude-Low Opening (HALO) jumps and established drop zones. Additionally, comedian Bob Hope performed at Rodeo, filming a two-hour program for his 84th birthday. President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of the Air Force Edward Aldridge Jr. were also on hand for Bob Hope’s performance.|$|R

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}}. Lt. Col. Jackson distinguished himself as pilot of a C-123 aircraft. Lt. Col. Jackson volunteered to attempt the rescue of a 3-man USAF <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Team</b> from the Special Forces camp at Kham Duc. Hostile forces had overrun the forward outpost and established gun positions on the airstrip. They were raking the camp with small arms, mortars, light and heavy automatic weapons, and recoilless rifle fire. The camp was engulfed in flames and ammunition dumps were continuously exploding and littering the runway with debris. In addition, eight aircraft had been destroyed by the intense enemy fire and one aircraft remained on the runway reducing its usable length to only 2,200 feet. To further complicate the landing, the weather was deteriorating rapidly, thereby permitting only one air strike prior to his landing. Although fully aware of the extreme danger and likely failure of such an attempt. Lt. Col. Jackson elected to land his aircraft and attempt to rescue. Displaying superb airmanship and extraordinary heroism, he landed his aircraft near the point where the <b>combat</b> <b>control</b> <b>team</b> was reported to be hiding. While on the ground, his aircraft was the target of intense hostile fire. A rocket landed in front of the nose of the aircraft but failed to explode. Once the <b>combat</b> <b>control</b> <b>team</b> was aboard, Lt. Col. Jackson succeeded in getting airborne despite the hostile fire directed across the runway in front of his aircraft. Lt. Col. Jackson's profound concern for his fellow men, at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself, and the Armed Forces of his country.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. Air Force {{became a}} {{separate}} service in 1947, Air Force pathfinders {{were assigned to}} a provisional Pathfinder Squadron. The Air Force looked for ways {{to get rid of}} pathfinders, believing that electronic navigation aids could replace them and the pathfinders role became increasingly neglected by the Air Force. During the Korean War pathfinders were only used in the three main airdrops early in the war. Meanwhile, in Washington D.C. the Air Force and Army leadership were at odds about which service would have ownership of the pathfinder mission. The Department of Defense eventually sided with the Air Force having full control of all air traffic control duties. Despite the resolution the Army never inactivated their pathfinder units which has subsequently become more specialized towards helicopters. After the DOD sided with the Air Force being chosen for the pathfinder mission they expected six teams of pathfinders to be formed from Army-to-Air Force transfers but only got eleven men, enough to form one team. In 1953 the Pathfinder Squadron was discontinued and the pathfinder team was assigned to the 1st Aerial Port Squadron and officially designated a <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Team.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{battle for}} Khâm Đức and Ngok Tavak was {{considered}} a defeat for U.S. forces, described by one historian as [...] "a Khe Sanh in reverse." [...] Unlike the previous fight at Khe Sanh, the application of American airpower [...] "averted a massacre" [...] but could not prevent the North Vietnamese from dominating the high ground surrounding Khâm Đức. General Creighton Abrams described the loss at Khâm Đức as a [...] "minor disaster". U.S. decisions at Khâm Đức may have been influenced at a higher command level {{by the events of}} Battle of Khe Sanh in 1968, which were subjected to intense media comparison with the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, and the clash of operational thinking between General Westmoreland and the senior USMC generals. If there was any lesson to be learned for General Westmoreland and other U.S. commanders, the battle of Khâm Đức showed that [...] "air power was not a cure-all". The command and control system of the United States Air Force during the ordeal was imperfect, as demonstrated by the [...] "blunders involving the combat control teams." [...] A final, notable outcome of Khâm Đức was that it closed the last Special Forces CIDG camp in the I Corps Tactical Zone in close proximity to the border with Laos. This made ground surveillance of the Ho Chi Minh Trail much more difficult, allowing North Vietnam to move supplies and develop new branches of the trail. Despite setbacks, the evacuation of the Khâm Đức Special Forces Camp strongly highlighted the morale, discipline and the motivation of the U.S. Air Force personnel {{who took part in the}} operation. From the very first day of the struggle at Khâm Đức, it was clear that ground units were not prepared for an emergency evacuation, due to the lack of experience in terms of integrating the numbers and types of aircraft in such a small geographical area. U.S. aircrews had to improvise by establishing their own procedures, in order to extract both military and civilian personnel from the besieged Special Forces Camp. Despite having lost two C-130 aircraft, U.S. pilots were undeterred from completing their mission, indeed, their bravery was exemplified by Lieutenant Colonel Joe M. Jackson, who received a Medal of Honor for the rescue of the three-man <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Team.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Combat Control Team" [...] {{comes from}} World War II where allied troop-carrier squadrons {{developed}} gliderborne teams called Combat Control Teams. A <b>Combat</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Team</b> consisted of one glider pilot and four enlisted technicians. They utilized a jeep and a trailer-mounted radio to pass critical information to aircraft. [...] The {{first time they}} were used was during Operation Varsity in 1945, when two teams with the 18th Airborne Corps infiltrated German lines.

50|$|On 2 August 2016 the {{remaining}} pathfinder {{company in the}} 101st Airborne Division was inactivated in a ceremony at Fort Campbell, KY. Media accounts erred in stating that “seventy-two years of service came to an end” with the inactivation of the company.

Documentation on when pathfinders returned to the division is sparse, but most likely took place in the 1960s with the advent of helicopter warfare and the shift of the pathfinder mission from control of fixed-wing aircraft, which had gone to USAF <b>combat</b> <b>control</b> <b>teams,</b> to Army rotary wing aircraft. When the 101st Airborne Division stood down in Vietnam in early 1972, soldiers with time remaining on their tours, to include pathfinders, were reassigned to other units, such as the 3d Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (Separate), and the division flag returned to Fort Campbell, KY.
