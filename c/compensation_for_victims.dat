2500|$|On 21 January 2014, Israel {{announced}} plans for 381 new settler homes in the West Bank. The Palestinians condemned this move, and also ruled {{out the possibility of}} the peace talks extending beyond the nine-month deadline. On 22 January, Abbas said he would like Russia to take {{a more active role in}} the negotiations. On 27 January, the Palestinians said they would not allow [...] "a single settler" [...] to remain in a Palestinian state, but that this did not stem from anti-Jewish attitudes. Rather, Jews living in the West Bank would have the option of remaining if they renounced their Israeli citizenship and applied to be citizens of Palestine. A poll has shown that 4.5% of Jewish settlers would consider becoming Palestinian citizens under such an arrangement. On 31 January, according to Martin Indyk, the framework for the US-backed Middle East peace deal will allow up to 80 per cent of Jewish settlers to remain in the West Bank. The deal would redraw borders so that some 80 per cent of settlers' homes would be redesignated as being in Israel, while other parcels land would be handed back to Palestinian control in a proposed land-swap deal. Another key point of the framework would be that Israel would be allowed to retain a role in maintaining security along the West Bank's border with neighbouring Jordan. The new security arrangements would see a zone created with hi-tech fences equipped with sensors and drone surveillance planes flying overhead. Also the final peace treaty could also provide <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>victims</b> on both sides of the historic conflict.|$|E
