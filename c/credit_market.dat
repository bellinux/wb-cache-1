Sudden inflation {{during the reign of}} Commodus damaged the <b>credit</b> <b>market.</b> In the mid-200s, the supply of specie contracted sharply. Conditions during the Crisis of the Third Century—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector by the year 300. Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or fiduciary currency, general economic anxieties came to a head under Aurelian, and bankers lost confidence in coins legitimately issued by the central government. Despite Diocletian's introduction of the gold solidus and monetary reforms, the <b>credit</b> <b>market</b> of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.|$|E

40|$|Economists have {{observed}} that informal <b>credit</b> <b>markets</b> may mitigate micro-entrepreneurial rationing in formal <b>credit</b> <b>markets.</b> While informal <b>credit</b> <b>markets</b> may have that effect, the uniformity and magnitude of the mitigation is not apparent. We analyse micro-enterprise credit rationing on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the United States. We find that micro-entrepreneurs have virtually no access to formal <b>credit</b> <b>markets</b> and that informal <b>credit</b> <b>markets</b> have differential impacts on micro-entrepreneurs' rationing in formal <b>credit</b> <b>markets.</b> Informal markets appear to ease credit rationing the most for the mid-size micro-enterprises in our sample, with the smallest and largest micro-enterprises still facing severe rationing constraints. We also find that micro-enterprises of all sizes face a positive probability of credit rationing. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

25|$|The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) and Financial Sector Reform Programme (FSRP) {{were formed}} in 1990, upon {{contracts}} with the World Bank. These programs sought to remove government distortions and lessen the financial repression. Policies made use of the McKinnon-Shaw hypothesis, which stated that removing distortions augments efficiency in the <b>credit</b> <b>market</b> and increases competition. The policies therefore involved banks providing loans on a commercial basis, enhancing bank efficiency and limiting government control to monetary policy only. FSRP forced banks to have a minimum capital adequacy, to systematically classify loans and to implement modern computerised systems, including those that handle accounting. It forced the central bank to free up interest rates, revise financial laws and increase supervision in the <b>credit</b> <b>market.</b> The government also developed the capital market, which was also performing poorly.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} a simple theory and empirical {{evidence on the}} asymmetric effect of <b>credit</b> <b>markets</b> on output decline and output growth. When <b>credit</b> <b>markets</b> are underdeveloped and enterprise activity is financed outside the banking sector, exogenous shocks may induce a break-up of both credit and production chains, leading to sudden and sharp collapses in output. The development of a banking sector can reduce the probability of such collapses. Using industry-level data across a large cross-section of countries, the empirical analysis suggests that <b>credit</b> <b>markets</b> play a more important role in softening output declines than in fostering growth or recovery.

Around 95% of Argentine senior citizens (5.7 million) receive ANSES pensions, whose amount is adjusted semi-annually. Argentines {{in the labor force}} earning less than 5,200 pesos (us$350) monthly, are entitled to benefits upon marriage; pregnancy, birth, or adoption of a child; for maternity leave or prenatal care; and for a disability in a child or spouse, as well as to a modest unemployment insurance benefit for up to 6 months. The most important poverty relief program administered by the ANSES is the Asignación Universal por Hijo (Universal Childhood Entitlement). The benefit, 340 pesos (us$70) a month per child, is assigned to 3.6 million children under age 18 (30% of the nation's total), and includes the deposit of 20% of the check in a savings account accessible only upon certification of the child's vaccination and enrollment in school. The program was budgeted at around us$2.5 billion for 2011 (6% of the total). Other recent programs include Conectar Igualdad, which envisaged the purchase of 3 million netbooks for secondary school students and teachers; and PRO.CRE.AR, a subsidized mortgage initiative for moderate income borrowers largely shut out of the nation's tight <b>credit</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E

More frequently, they needed money to help purchase basic necessities during lean months between harvests, and so were [...] "forced to sell their products at deflated prices during post-harvest glut, in order to pay loans taken during the pre-harvest 'starvation' season". Moreover, though land had traditionally been relatively available, the means of production (such as seed or cattle for ploughing) had always been scarce, and smallholders' lands were sometimes sold in times of distress to purchase these. At other times, peasants were simply compelled by force to take on debt.|$|E

A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth. He showed that, in accordance with the <b>credit</b> <b>market</b> imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth. He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment. Perotti concluded that, [...] "more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education. Both are reflected in higher rates of growth. Also, very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable, which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth." ...|$|E
