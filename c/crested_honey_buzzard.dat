50|$|The {{similarity}} in plumage between juvenile <b>crested</b> <b>honey</b> <b>buzzards</b> and the Spizaetus hawk-eagles may have arisen as a partial protection against predation by larger raptors. The eagles have stronger bills and talons, {{and are likely}} to be less vulnerable than the Pernis species. Similar mimicry is shown by the juveniles of the European <b>honey</b> <b>buzzard,</b> which resembles the common buzzard. Although the northern goshawk is capable of killing both species, {{it is likely to be}} more cautious about attacking the better protected Buteo species.|$|R

50|$|The raptor {{subfamily}} Perninae {{includes a}} number of medium-sized broad-winged species. These are birds of warmer climates, although the Pernis species (European honey buzzard and <b>crested</b> <b>honey</b> <b>buzzard)</b> have a more extensive range.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{study on}} the {{avifauna}} of the Seonheul Gotjawal region of Jeju-do (Is.), a survey site of long-term ecological study, was conducted between February of 2011 and January of 2012. A total of 54 species and 1, 039 individuals of birds were observed, with 30 species and 164 individuals observed during spring, 31 species and 174 individuals during summer, 30 species and 206 individuals during fall and 28 species and 868 individuals during winter. In terms of dominant species, Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata) was the most dominant at 500 individuals (48. 12 %), followed by Rook (Corvus frugilegus) at 250 individuals (24. 06 %), Black-billed Magpie (Pica pica) at 36 individuals (3. 46 %), Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) at 34 individuals (3. 27 %) and Great Tit (Parus major) and Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) at 26 individuals (2. 50 %) each. The overall species diversity was 1. 95, with the value 2. 69 during spring, 2. 87 during summer, 2. 81 during fall and 1. 29 during winter. The species diversity was low during the winter, because Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata) and Rook (Corvus frugilegus) were observed at a relative high level {{when compared to other}} species, at 500 individuals and 250 individuals respectively. Government protected species included 8 natural monument species, such as Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata), Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Lesser Cuckoo (Cuculus poliocephalus) and Fairy Pitta (Pitta nympha), and 8 endangered species of Japanese Night Heron (Gorsachius goisagi), Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus), <b>Crested</b> <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzard</b> (Pernis ptilorhychus), Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), Fairy Pitta (Pitta nympha) and Black Paraside Flycatcher (Terpsiphone atrocaudata). Since subtropical birds, such as Japanese Night Heron (Gorsachius goisagi), White-bellied Green Pigeon (Treron sieboldii) and Chestnut-winged Cuckoo (Clamator coromandus) were observed during the study, {{there is a need for}} a continuous monitoring of their migratory pattern and breeding...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} the water-crossing behavior of Western Marsh Harriers (Circus aeruginosus), mostly adults, and European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> (Pernis apivorus), mostly juveniles, {{in relation to}} wind conditions, time of the day, flocking and age classes, at a watchsite in central Italy during the autumn migration en route to Africa. Although European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> are less suited than Western Marsh Harriers to undertake long sea crossings, they were more in-clined to leave the coast when migrating in flocks. Few birds of both species chose to fly along the coast. Western Marsh Harriers, such as European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> migrating alone, under-took the water crossing rather than stopping migration (birds roosting at the site or flying back inland) during the absence of wind and vice versa during head winds. Conversely, European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> migrating in flocks were not affected in their decision (crossing or stopping migration) by wind direction. Both species undertook the water crossing rather than stopping migration during mornings and vice versa during afternoons. Finally, in both species, adults and juveniles showed the same behavior {{in front of a}} water barrier. This result was expected {{in the case of the}} Western Marsh Harrier but not from the European <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzard</b> since, in this spe-cies, the water-crossing tendency is age dependent with adults avoiding sea crossings.

40|$|Record {{numbers of}} <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> over the Low Countries in August-September 2013. During August and September 2013, two large waves of <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> Pernis apivorus {{flew over the}} Low Countries. The first wave, on 25 and 26 August was {{observed}} in the Netherlands and mid Belgium in numbers which are exceptional for this region (max 746 individuals over Bichterweerd). The cause for the so far westerly shift of the migration corridor, which under normal circumstances runs {{to the east of}} the Low Countries, is a typical weather pattern: on one side a low-pressure area with precipitation which comes to a halt above NW Europe {{and on the other side}} a high-pressure area above north or central Europe. As the high-pressure area overcomes the low-pressure area, a short and intense migration peak develops of raptors and storks which for days have been driven against the weather front by a strong easterly wind (4 - 5 Bft.) and have been forced to postpone their migration. The relatively large numbers of <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> on 25 and 26 August perhaps indicate moderate success in certain parts of the species’ breeding grounds in NW Europe. The second wave of <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzard</b> migration, which followed a peak in Falsterbo on 3 rd September of 4152 individuals, did not reach the Netherlands and Flanders. A weak easterly wind on 6 th September moved the migration corridor over southeast Belgium. In Harze (Luik province), 1079 <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> were counted on that day. Although it is becoming clearer that the weather pattern described regularly leadsto record migration over the Low Countries, it remains difficult to predict where precisely the sometimes narrow migration corridor will occur...|$|R

40|$|Drei zugunerfahrene Wespenbussarde wurden nach zehn- bzw. zwölfjähriger Volierenhaltung unter mitteleuropäischen Naturtagbedingungen in Bezug auf ihr jahresperiodisches Verhalten untersucht. Registriert wurde die Flugaktivität von zwei Weibchen. Zusätzlich wurde an diesen und einem Männchen die individuelle Körpermasse im Jahresverlauf aufgezeichnet. Der Anstieg der Flugaktivität mit einem signifikanten Anteil im Oktober wird als Zugunruhe gedeutet. Die Wespenbussarde entwickelten eine deutliche Herbstzugdisposition mit individuellen Charakteristiken im zeitlichen Ablauf. Das jahresperiodische Verhalten nach der langen Volierenhaltung unter falscher Fotoperiode im Winter ist ein Indiz für das Vorliegen einer endogenen Rhythmik. After 10 resp. 12 {{years of}} being caged in an outdoor aviary exposed to central European {{environmental}} conditions, 3 Honey Buzzards’ seasonal behaviour was studied. The <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> had no previous migratory flight experience. All measurements were taken in the outdoor aviary. Recorded was the flight activity of 2 females using a light brake. Their individual body mass was also recorded and a third <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzard</b> (male) ’s measurements were taken as well. The flight activity increased significantly in October. During this time the <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> also showed other restless behaviour such as excited looking around and flapping their wings on the seat. This behaviour and the annual increase of flight activity is interpreted as migratory restlessness, {{which is the first}} evidence of this behaviour on a bird of prey. Also a roosttime restlessness (for definition see Berthold 1988) was ascertained. It depends on seasons, especially between November and February. The <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzards</b> developed a positive autumn migratory disposition (fat deposition). The mass of fattening during the autumn migratory period is within the range of wild conspecifics. The temporal fattening and breakdown of fat deposition shows individual characteristics. As the photoperiod controls the fat deposition, these details and the migratory restlessness even after the long time being exposed to the “wrong” winter photo period conditions could be indications of endogenous rhythms on the <b>Honey</b> <b>Buzzard...</b>|$|R
