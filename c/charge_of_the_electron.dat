5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E
5|$|The University of Chicago {{has been}} the site of some {{important}} experiments and academic movements. In economics, the university has {{played an important role}} in shaping ideas about the free market and is the namesake of the Chicago school of economics, the school of economic thought supported by Milton Friedman and other economists. The university's sociology department was the first independent sociology department in the United States and gave birth to the Chicago school of sociology. In physics, the university was the site of the Chicago Pile-1 (the first controlled, self-sustaining man-made nuclear chain reaction, part of the Manhattan Project), of Robert Millikan's oil-drop experiment that calculated the <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron,</b> and of the development of radiocarbon dating by Willard F. Libby in 1947. The chemical experiment that tested how life originated on early Earth, the Miller–Urey experiment, was conducted at the university. REM sleep was discovered at the university in 1953 by Nathaniel Kleitman and Eugene Aserinsky.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, some {{theoretical}} physics models predict {{the existence of}} these magnetic monopoles. Paul Dirac observed in 1931 that, because electricity and magnetism show a certain symmetry, just as quantum theory predicts that individual positive or negative electric charges can be observed without the opposing charge, isolated South or North magnetic poles should be observable. Using quantum theory Dirac showed that if magnetic monopoles exist, then one could explain the quantization of electric charge—that is, why the observed elementary particles carry charges that are multiples of the <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron.</b>|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1908, while a {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, Millikan worked on an oil-drop experiment in which he measured the charge on a single electron. J. J. Thomson had already discovered the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron. However, the actual charge and mass values were unknown. Therefore, if one of these two values were to be discovered, the other could easily be calculated. Millikan and his then graduate student Harvey Fletcher used the oil-drop experiment to measure the <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> (as well as the electron mass, and Avogadro's number, since their relation to the electron charge was known).|$|E
25|$|His basic {{approach}} was to combine several fundamental constants {{in order to}} produce a dimensionless number. In many cases these would result in numbers close to 1040, its square, or its square root. He was convinced that the mass of the proton and the <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> were a natural and complete specification for constructing a Universe and that their values were not accidental. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, Paul Dirac, also pursued this line of investigation, which has become known as the Dirac large numbers hypothesis, and some scientists even today believe it has something to it.|$|E
25|$|But now {{suppose that}} the {{electrons}} in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed {{on one side of}} the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −eV added to it, where −e is the <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> and V the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.|$|E

2500|$|The {{premise of}} the {{fine-tuned}} Universe assertion is that a small change {{in several of the}} dimensionless physical constants would make the Universe radically different.

2500|$|Both Planck {{units and}} au {{are derived from}} certain {{fundamental}} properties of the physical world, and are free of anthropocentric considerations. It {{should be kept in}} mind that au were designed for atomic-scale calculations in the present-day universe, while Planck units are more suitable for quantum gravity and early-universe cosmology. Both au and Planck units normalize the reduced Planck constant. Beyond this, Planck units normalize to 1 the two fundamental constants of general relativity and cosmology: the gravitational constant G and the speed of light in a vacuum, c. Atomic units, by contrast, normalize to 1 the mass and <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron,</b> and, as a result, the speed of light in atomic units is a large value, [...] The orbital velocity of an electron around a small atom is of the order of 1 in atomic units, so the discrepancy between the velocity units in the two systems reflects the fact that electrons orbit small atoms much slower than the speed of light (around 2 orders of magnitude slower).|$|E
2500|$|There is some {{controversy}} over selectivity in Millikan's use of results from his second experiment measuring the electron charge. [...] This {{issue has been}} discussed by Allan Franklin, a former high-energy experimentalist and current philosopher of science at the University of Colorado. [...] Franklin contends that Millikan's exclusions of data do not affect the final value of the charge obtained, but that Millikan's substantial [...] "cosmetic surgery" [...] reduced the statistical error. [...] This enabled Millikan to give the <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> to better than one half of one percent; in fact, if Millikan had included all of the data he discarded, the error would have been within 2%. [...] While this would still have resulted in Millikan's having measured the charge of e− {{better than anyone else}} at the time, the slightly larger uncertainty might have allowed more disagreement with his results within the physics community, which Millikan likely tried to avoid. David Goodstein argues that Millikan's statement, that all drops observed over a sixty-day period were used in the paper, was clarified in a subsequent sentence which specified all [...] "drops upon which complete series of observations were made". Goodstein attests that this is indeed the case and notes that five pages of tables separate the two sentences.|$|E
2500|$|If {{one used}} Planck's energy quanta, {{and demanded that}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation at a given frequency could only transfer energy to matter in integer multiples of an energy quantum hν, then the photoelectric effect could be explained very simply. Low-frequency light only ejects low-energy electrons because each electron is excited by the absorption of a single photon. Increasing {{the intensity of the}} low-frequency light (increasing the number of photons) only increases the number of excited electrons, not their energy, because the energy of each photon remains low. Only by increasing the frequency of the light, and thus increasing the energy of the photons, can one eject electrons with higher energy. Thus, using Planck's constant h to determine the energy of the photons based upon their frequency, the energy of ejected electrons should also increase linearly with frequency; the gradient of the line being Planck's constant. These results were not confirmed until 1915, when Robert Andrews Millikan, who had previously determined the <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electron,</b> produced experimental results in perfect accord with Einstein's predictions. While the energy of ejected electrons reflected Planck's constant, the existence of photons was not explicitly proven until the discovery of the photon antibunching effect, of which a modern experiment can be performed in undergraduate-level labs. This phenomenon could only be explained via photons, and not through any semi-classical theory (which could alternatively explain the photoelectric effect). When Einstein received his Nobel Prize in 1921, it was not for his more difficult and mathematically laborious special and general relativity, but for the simple, yet totally revolutionary, suggestion of quantized light. Einstein's [...] "light quanta" [...] would not be called photons until 1925, but even in 1905 they represented the quintessential example of wave-particle duality. Electromagnetic radiation propagates following linear wave equations, but can only be emitted or absorbed as discrete elements, thus acting as a wave and a particle simultaneously.|$|E
