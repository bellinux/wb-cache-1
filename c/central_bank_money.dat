25|$|Since <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> {{currently}} exists {{mainly in}} the form of electronic records (electronic money) rather than {{in the form of}} paper or coins (physical money), open market operations can be conducted by simply increasing or decreasing (crediting or debiting) the amount of electronic money that a bank has in its reserve account at the central bank.

50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, money {{creation}} {{in a modern}} economy does not directly involve the manufacturing of new physical money, such as paper currency or metal coins. Instead, when the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> expands the <b>money</b> supply through open market operations (e.g., by purchasing government bonds or commercial bank assets), it credits the accounts that the government or commercial banks hold at the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> (termed high-powered <b>money).</b> Governments or commercial banks may draw on these accounts to withdraw physical <b>money</b> from the <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> Commercial banks may also return soiled or spoiled currency to the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> in exchange for new currency.|$|R

2500|$|At {{least one}} {{textbook}} states {{that when a}} loan is made by the commercial bank, the bank is keeping {{only a fraction of}} <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> as reserves and the money supply expands {{by the size of the}} loan.

However, the central bank may shrink commercial bank money by shrinking <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>money,</b> since reserves are required - thus fractional-reserve money creation is likened to a string, since the central bank can always pull money out by restricting <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>money,</b> hence reserves, but cannot always push money out by expanding <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>money,</b> since this may result in excess reserves, a situation referred to as [...] "pushing on a string".|$|E

40|$|What is {{the role}} of <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> in {{ensuring}} financial stability? This paper addresses this controversial subject, in part by drawing on the experiences in Europe, Japan, and the United States, and by examining four questions. What is meant by financial stability? Do <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> have a natural role in ensuring financial stability? What does a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> need to execute this role effectively? How far have <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> actually gone in safeguarding financial stability? The experience drawn on in the paper suggest that central banks: have a natural role to play; at times may require supervisory information to execute this natural role; and have incurred risks to their balance sheets to ensure financial stability.

40|$|The {{monetary}} policy process has two stages: (1) setting {{the value of}} intermediate or final monetary targets {{on the basis of}} available information, and (2) setting the instruments of {{monetary policy}} in order to neutralize stochastic disturbances and to render the actual value of the intermediate target {{as close as possible to}} the targeted value. After becoming independent, Slovenia had to establish an independent <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> and create effective instruments of monetary policy. Slovenia did away with the nonmarket instruments of monetary policy that were used in the former Yugoslavia. Old, selective instruments of monetary policy were replaced by new instruments: an open market policy, Lombard loans, minimum reserve requirements, bills with warrants, twin bills, and foreign currency bills. Slovenia must use open-market policy instruments as the core instrument; the fiscal component should be eliminated; minimum reserve requirements should not change frequently due to fluctuations deriving from reserve ratio movements; refinancing policy should have a safety valve function to satisfy unexpected demand for the <b>central</b> <b>bank's</b> <b>money.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|For the {{purposes}} of macroeconomics, burning money is equivalent to removing the money from circulation, and locking it away forever; the salient feature {{is that no one}} may ever use the money again. Burning money shrinks the money supply, and is therefore a special case of contractionary monetary policy that can be implemented by anyone. In the usual case, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> withdraws <b>money</b> from circulation by selling government bonds or foreign currency. The difference with money burning is that the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> does not have to exchange any assets of value for the money burnt. Money burning is thus equivalent to gifting the money back to the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> (or other <b>money</b> issuing authority). If the economy is at full employment equilibrium, shrinking the money supply causes deflation (or decreases the rate of inflation), increasing the real value of the money left in circulation.|$|R
