40|$|Process Description The Federal Paper Board Company at Augusta {{produces}} a nominal 1500 - 2000 tons per day (TPD) of bleached <b>coated</b> <b>paperboard</b> converted from kraft process wood pulp. The mill {{was purchased by}} Federal in 1985 (from Continental Forest Industries) and various plant renovations and additions have been made since that time to improve plant efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and increase production capacity. All pulp is produced in three Kamyr continuous digesters, the oldest of which is presently on stand-by status. Bleaching is accomplished with two older 4 -stage [(CD) Eo H D] plants and a new 3 -stage [(CD) (Eo) (D) ] plant. One of the older bleach plants {{has been put on}} standby and the other will be converted into a [(CD) (E,) D N D] sequence. The elimination of hypochlorite and high C 10, substitution should significantly reduce chloroform and dioxin formation during the bleaching process. Other plant changes planned for completion by 1994 include the addition of a fourth paperboard mill and a new lime kiln which will bring mill capacity to about 2800 - 3000 TPD. At that time, employment at the mill is expected to reach over 1000 persons.

40|$|The convertability and barrier {{properties}} of paperboard coated with hydroxypropyl-cellulose (HPC) based dispersions were studied via tray pressing trials, oil resistance measurements and microscopic analyses. To improve the oil {{resistance of the}} HPC-based coatings and to maximize their convertability, talc, gelatin and latex were used as additives in coating formulations. The oil resistance of the coatings improved to some extent with these additives, but scanning electron micrographs revealed the existence of pinholes particularly in coatings with a high HPC content. The <b>coated</b> <b>paperboard</b> samples were pressed into rectangular trays and the convertability of the paperboards was evaluated with a microscope. Thereafter, the oil resistance of the trays was determined in order to clarify how the tray pressing process affected the oil resistance. Pure HPC coating did not provide appreciable oil resistance to the paperboard, but the composite coatings resisted oil up to 11 minutes at the tray corners, which were considered the most demanding regions in the tray. The pure HPC coating was sticky and tended {{to stick to the}} converting tools in the press forming. Adding talc to the coating dispersion reduced this problem. By applying a thin pre-coating layer, it was possible to raise the blank holding force in the pressing process from 1. 16 kN to 1. 55 kN without causing rupture in the tray corner areas or compromising the quality of the creases. With commercial polyethylene-terephthalate-coated reference paperboard, the use of such a high force resulted in long rupture and opened creases, which confirms the excellent applicability of the developed dispersion-coating recipes for the tray-pressing process. These observations suggest that convertibility is not necessarily a major problem with bio-based dispersion barrier coatings and that more attention should be paid to their {{barrier properties}} and particularly to the prevention of pinholes being formed during the coating process...|$|E

The objectives of the work were to develop a method for analysis of the dark and light areas of oriented mottle, to analyse these areas, and to clarify the effect from the print, <b>coating</b> and <b>paperboard</b> surface related factors. This would clarify the origin of oriented mottle and predict oriented mottle on unprinted paperboard.

The results from the study showed that the intensity differences between the dark halftone dots were enhanced in the dark areas, the coating amount was lower in the dark areas and the ink did not penetrate into the paperboard. The other results showed that areas with high transmission corresponded to dark areas, smoother micro roughness, lower coating amount and high topography.

The packaging industry {{claims to have}} engaged extensively with matters of sustainabilityand that it has taken many steps to improve resource efficiency associated {{with this type of}} packaging. Yet, the 2011 recycling rate of used beverage cartons (UBCs) in South Africa was 0. 9 %,implying that significant volumes are going to landfill disposal. UBCs are a source of high quality fullybleached furnish (paper fibres), which are routinely recovered and recycled in many other countries,and this practice has been shown by multiple life cycle assessments (LCAs) to reduce environmentalimpacts. The sustainability awareness of different actors in the LPB supply chain was assessed as the first objective, including both South African and international actors in the comparison. Similarities in sustainability reporting were determined by a content analysis of the annual reports supported by two analyses principled on multi-criteria analysis (MCA). The purposively chosen actors in the LPB supply chain were grouped into three namely, manufacturers, organisations and ‘retailers and brand owners’. An analysis using the three focal issues of the Nampak 2010 sustainability report, namely carbon footprint, recycling and training, as search terms shows variation in focus amongst manufacturers to be as wide as that in the two other groups though Stora Enso (an international manufacturer) is noted as having the having the most similar focus. PACSA is the organisation that has the most similar focus to the three Nampak-identified criteria. The four-criteria principled MCA with LCA as the fourth criterion indicates that Stora Enso has the most similar focus to that of Nampak; PACSA is the organisation that has the most similar focus to the four criteria and also had the most focus similar focus to Nampak for the single criterion of ‘recycling’. It is concluded that sustainability awareness in the LPB supply chain is more nuanced in the international companies (based on the date of first responding, word counts in the reports and use of LCA) but is similar between the three company groups in the supply chain.

40|$|Calendering of coated and {{uncoated}} paper {{is widely used}} to enhance optical properties such as gloss and print quality. The aim of this thesis is to characterize coatings and prints, and to validate models using experimental results from optical measurements of physical samples. Calendering of coated paper often leads to a brightness decrease. The mechanism for this is not altogether clear. One common {{explanation is that the}} porosity of the coating layer decreases and hence the scattering decreases. By comparing simulated and measured results it was shown that modifications of the surface properties account for the brightness decrease of ground calcium carbonate coated substrates with calendering. Monte Carlo light scattering simulations, taking into account the measured decrease of surface microroughness and increased effective refractive index, showed that surface modifications accounted for most of the observed brightness decrease of the ground calcium carbonate coated substrate, whereas the bulk scattering and absorption coefficients were not affected by calendering. It was also shown that the scattering coefficient is significantly dependent on the coat weight whereas the physical absorption coefficient is not. The penetration of ink in the z-direction of a substrate influences the quality of the print. The ink penetration affects print density, mottling and dot gain, common print effects that influence the preference of consumers. The pressure in the printing nip and the porosity of the substrate both affect the amount of ink that is pressed into the porous structure of a coating layer during printing. By printing pilot <b>coated</b> <b>paperboard</b> with different coating porosity and measuring the resulting optical properties of the prints, a basis for simulations of the different layers, that is to say the coating, the print and the mixed layer in between, was created. Results show that ink distribution is strongly affected by the roughness of the substrate. Fibres and fibre flocks underneath the two coating layers created an unevenly distributed coating thickness that affected the print quality. Differences in pore size and pore size distribution also affected the behaviour of the ink. A coating layer of broad pigment particle size distribution resulted in a relatively low print density, in comparison to coatings of narrowly distributed particle sizes. Comparison of dot gain showed that the coating layer of a narrow particle size distribution had a relatively low dot gain compared to others. In this work, these results are explained by the differences in ink distributions on and in the coating layers...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{consumer}} habits and {{the replacement of}} solid trans fats in foodstuffs with unsaturated fats have increased the demand for low-cost grease-resistant packaging materials worldwide. Taking into account the global aim to reduce our dependence on oil-based plastics, new bio-based solutions are needed {{to meet the demand}} for sustainable packaging solutions, and the development of such materials was the focus of the work reported in this thesis. Pigmented dispersion barrier coatings were prepared using a blade-coating technique on commercial solid bleached sulphate paperboard. The coatings consisted of a bio-based component, hydroxypropylated starch or hydroxypropyl cellulose, a styrene-butadiene latex binder, and talc. The grease resistance in terms of time taken for a model grease to penetrate the <b>coated</b> <b>paperboard</b> varied between a few hours and several days, depending on the coating composition and on the ambient temperature during the test. Particular attention was given to coatings that prevented oil to penetrate the whole 24 h test period described in ISO 16532 - 1. The feasibility of producing barrier-coated boards was studied from the viewpoints of the finishing and converting processes and their end-use applications. The findings suggested that corona treatment should be used with caution if the board is to be printed, since it may cause a drastic decrease in oil penetration time due to strike through that occur if the voltage of the discharge is sufficiently high to change the electrical conductivity of the sample. The oil barrier was impaired regardless of whether the uncoated or the coated side of the board was treated with corona. Moreover, the coatings did not prevent the occurrence of reverse side effects. Unexpectedly, contact angle determinations suggested that exposure to heat in converting processes may even improve the oil repellency of dispersion coatings containing pigments due to the migration of latex towards the outer surface. Migrated latex also induced self-healing of the coating, according to scanning electron microscope (SEM) images that indicated the disappearance of pinholes. The oil and grease resistance (OGR) was, however, dependent on the oil viscosity and fatty acid composition. Particularly with moderately grease-resistant samples, the penetration time of pure coconut and rapeseed oils was considerably longer than that of their mixtures. Finally, press forming of paperboard led to a decrease in oil penetration time, but none of the studied coating compositions completely lost their barrier properties. The developed coating formulations seem to have a potential in many commercial sustainable packaging applications in a transitional period before implementation of completely bio-based coatings on an industrial scale. Potential uses may include e. g. instant meal trays and fast food packages, but particular attention should be paid to the effects of converting and finishing processes on the physical and barrier properties of the materials...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{industry}} is constantly {{looking for new}} ideas for improving paper products while competition and raw material prices are increasing. Many paper products are pigment coated. Coating layer is {{the top layer of}} paper, thus by modifying coating pigment also the paper itself can be altered and value added to the final product. In this thesis, synthesis of new plastic and hybrid pigments and their performance in paper and paperboard coating is reported. Two types of plastic pigments were studied: core-shell latexes and solid beads of maleimide copolymers. Core-shell latexes with partially crosslinked hydrophilic polymer core of poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-methacrylic acid) and a hard hydrophobic polystyrene shell were prepared to improve the optical properties of coated paper. In addition, the effect of different crosslinkers was analyzed and the best overall performance was achieved by the use of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). Furthermore, the possibility to modify core-shell latex was investigated by introducing a new polymerizable optical brightening agent, 1 -[(4 -vinylphenoxy) methyl]- 4 -(2 -henylethylenyl) benzene which gave promising results. The prepared core-shell latex pigments performed smoothly also in pilot coating and printing trials. The results demonstrated that by optimizing polymer composition, the optical and surface properties of coated paper can be significantly enhanced. The optimal reaction conditions were established for thermal imidization of poly(styrene-co-maleimide) (SMI) and poly(octadecene-co-maleimide) (OMI) from respective maleic anhydride copolymer precursors and ammonia in a solvent free process. The obtained aqueous dispersions of nanoparticle copolymers exhibited glass transition temperatures (Tg) between 140 - 170 ºC and particle sizes from 50 - 230 nm. Furthermore, the maleimide copolymers were evaluated in paperboard coating as additional pigments. The maleimide copolymer nanoparticles were partly imbedded into the porous coating structure and therefore the full potential of optical property enhancement for paperboard was not achieved by this method. The possibility to modify maleimide copolymers was also studied. Modifications were carried out via N-substitution by replacing part of the ammonia in the imidization reaction with amines, such as triacetonediamine (TAD), aspartic acid (ASP) and fluorinated amines (2, 2, 2 - trifluoroethylamine, TFEA and 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4 -heptafluorobuthylamine, HFBA). The obtained functional nanoparticles varied in size between 50 - 217 nm and their Tg from 150 - 180 ºC. During the coating process the produced plastic pigments exhibited good runnability. No significant improvements were achieved in light stability with TAD modified copolymers whereas nanoparticles modified with aspartic acid and those containing fluorinated groups showed the desired changes in surface properties of the <b>coated</b> <b>paperboard.</b> Finally, reports on preliminary studies with organic-inorganic hybrids are presented. The hybrids prepared by an in situ polymerization reaction consisted of 30 wt% poly(styrene- co-maleimide) (SMI) and high levels of 70 wt% inorganic components of kaolin and/or alumina trihydrate. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images and characterization by Fourier Transform Infrared Spcetroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) revealed that the hybrids had conventional composite structure and inorganic components were covered with precipitated SMI nanoparticles attached to the surface via hydrogen bonding. In paper coating, the hybrids had a beneficial effect on increasing gloss levels...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{intensive}} {{research has been}} carried out in order to replace oil-based polymers with bio-based polymers due to growing environmental concerns. So far, most of the barrier materials used in food packaging are petroleum-based materials. The purpose of the barrier is to protect the packaged food from oxygen, water vapour, water and fat. The mechanical and barrier properties of coatings based on starch-plasticizer and starch-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) -plasticizer blends have been studied in the work described in this thesis. The plasticizers used were glycerol, polyethylene glycol and citric acid. In a second step, polyethylene coatings were extruded onto paperboard pre-coated with a starch-PVOH-plasticizer blend. The addition of PVOH to the starch increased the flexibility of the film. Curing of the film led to a decrease in flexibility and an increase in tensile strength. The flexibility of the starch-PVOH films was increased more when glycerol or polyethylene glycol was added than citric acid. The storage modulus of the starch-PVOH films containing citric acid increased substantially at high temperature. It was seen that the addition of polyethylene glycol or citric acid to the starch-PVOH blend resulted in an enrichment of PVOH at the surface of the films. Tensile tests on the films indicated that citric acid acted as a compatibilizer and increased the compatibility of the starch and PVOH in the blend. The addition of citric acid to the coating recipe substantially decreased the water vapour transmission rate through the starch-PVOH <b>coated</b> <b>paperboard,</b> which indicated that citric acid acts as a cross-linker for starch and/or PVOH. The starch-PVOH coatings containing citric acid showed oxygen-barrier properties similar to those of pure PVOH or of a starch-PVOH blend without plasticizer when four coating layers were applied on a paperboard. The oxygen-barrier properties of coatings based on a starch-PVOH blend containing citric acid indicated a cross-linking and increase in compatibility of the starch-PVOH blends. Polyethylene extrusion coating on a pre-coated paperboard resulted in a clear reduction in the oxygen transmission rate for all the pre-coating formulations containing plasticizers. The addition of a plasticizer to the pre-coating reduced the adhesion of polyethylene to pre-coated board. Polyethylene extrusion coating gave a board with a lower oxygen transmission rate when the paperboard was pre-coated with a polyethylene-glycol-containing formulation than with a citric-acid-containing formulation. The addition of polyethylene glycol to pre-coatings indicated an increase in wetting of the pre-coated paperboard by the polyethylene melt, and this may have sealed the small defects in the pre-coating leading to low oxygen transmission rate. The increase in brittleness of starch-PVOH films containing citric acid at a high temperature seemed to have a dominating effect on the barrier properties developed by the extrusion coating process.  Over the last few decades, industry and academia have made joint efforts to generate knowledge about renewable barrier materials in order to replace the oil-based barrier materials currently used in food packaging. This work has focused on the possibility of producing a material with high oxygen barrier properties including polyethylene as a moisture protection. The flexibility of starch films was increased by adding poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH) to the starch and the addition of a plasticizer to the starch-PVOH blend films further increase the flexibility of the films. The plasticizers used were glycerol, polyethylene glycol and citric acid. Curing of the films reduce their flexibility. The addition of citric acid to a starch-PVOH blend increased the compatibility of the starch-PVOH blend and affected the barrier properties of the coating layers containing citric acid. When a sufficient number of coating layers was applied, the starch-PVOH-citric-acid coatings showed oxygen-transmission-rate-values {{similar to those of the}} pure PVOH and of the starch-PVOH blend without plasticizers. Polyethylene extrusion coating on pre-coated paperboard resulted in a clear reduction in the oxygen transmission rate of all the pre-coating recipes based on starch-PVOH blends. The polyethylene extrusion coating showed a higher oxygen transmission rate for a board pre-coated with citric-acid-containing recipes than for a board pre-coated with polyethylene-glycol-containing recipes...|$|E
40|$|A {{new design}} for permanent, low-cost, and planar fluidic {{channels}} on TiO 2 nanoparticle <b>coated</b> <b>paperboard</b> is demonstrated. Initially superhydrophobic TiO 2 nanoparticle coatings {{can be converted}} to hydrophilic by ultraviolet (UVA) light, and fluidic channels can be generated. A simple water treatment after the UVA illumination converts the channels permanent when nanoparticles are removed from the illuminated and wetted areas as shown by water contact angle, FE-SEM, XPS, and ToF-SIMS analysis. This suggests new routes for inexpensive, easy to use point-of-care diagnostics based on planar fluidic channels.

40|$|Disposable cups can be {{made from}} {{conventional}} petro-plastics, bioplastics, or <b>paperboard</b> (<b>coated</b> with petro-plastics or bioplastics). This study compared ten life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of disposable cups with the aim to evaluate the robustness of their results. The selected studies have only one impact category in common, namely climate change with global warming potential (GWP) as its category indicator. Quantitative GWP results of the studies were closer examined. GWPs within and across each study show none of the cup materials to be consistently better than the others. Comparison of the absolute GWPs (after correction for the cup volume) also shows no consistent better or worse cup material. An evaluation of the methodological choices and the data sets used in the studies revealed their influence on the GWP. The differences in GWP can be attributed to a multitude of factors, i. e., cup material and weight, production processes, waste processes, allocation options, and data used. These factors basically represent different types of uncertainty. Sensitivity and scenario analyses provided only the influence of one factor at once. A systematic and simultaneous use of sensitivity and scenario analyses could, in a next research, result in more robust outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to verify the approach on starch-gelatin blending for the <b>paperboard</b> <b>coating</b> formulations with enhanced barrier and mechanical properties. Based on that, another objective was to find out, how the approach will function with wood-based polysaccharides (CMC, EHEC and HPC) by analyzing their barrier properties and convertibility. The last objective was to find out, if pigments can be used in the composition of polysaccharide-protein blends without causing any negative effect on stated properties. The whole process chain of the barrier coating development was studied in the research. The methodology applied included pilot-scale coating and converting trials for the evaluation of mechanical properties of obtained coatings, namely their exposure to cracking with the loss of barrier properties. The results obtained indicated that the combination of starch with gelatin, in fact, improves the grease barrier properties and flexibility of starch-based coatings, thereby confirming the offered approach. The similar results were obtained for CMC, exhibited elevated barrier properties and surface coverage, proving that the approach also functions with wood-based polysaccharides. The introduction of equal amounts of talc gave various effects at different gelatin dosages on barrier properties of wood-based polysaccharides. Mainly, the elevation of grease barrier properties was observed. The convertibility of talc-filled coatings was not sufficient...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lignin {{derivatives}} are phenylpropanoid biopolymers {{derived from}} pulping and biorefinery processes. The possibility to utilize lignin derivatives from {{different types of}} processes in advanced enzyme-catalyzed oxygen-scavenging systems intended for active packaging was explored. Laccase-catalyzed oxidation of alkali lignin (LA), hydrolytic lignin (LH), organosolv lignin (LO), and lignosulfonates (LS) was compared using oxygen-scavenging coatings and films in liquid and gas phase systems. Results: When coatings containing lignin derivatives and laccase were immersed in a buffered aqueous solution, the oxygen-scavenging capability increased in the order LO < LH < LA < LS. Experiments with coatings containing laccase and LO, LH or LA incubated in oxygen-containing gas in air-tight chambers and at a relative humidity (RH) of 100 % showed that <b>paperboard</b> <b>coated</b> with LO and laccase reduced the oxygen content from 1. 0 % to 0. 4 % during a four-day period, which was far better than the results obtained with LA or LH. LO-containing coatings incubated at 92 % RH also displayed activity, with a decrease in oxygen from 1. 0 % to 0. 7 % during a four-day period. The oxygen scavenging {{was not related to}} the content of free phenolic hydroxyl groups, which increased in the order LO < LS < LH < LA. LO and LS were selected for further studies and films containing starch, clay, glycerol, laccase and LO or LS were characterized using gel permeation chromatograpy, dynamic mechanical analysis, and wet stability. Conclusions: The investigation shows that different lignin derivatives exhibit widely different properties as a part of active coatings and films. Results indicate that LS and LO were most suitable for the application studied and differences between them were attributed to a higher degree of laccase-catalyzed cross-linking of LS than of LO. Inclusion in active-packaging systems offers a new way to utilize some types of lignin derivatives from biorefining processes...|$|R
