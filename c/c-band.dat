A standard <b>C-banding</b> karyotype of Ps. juncea has been developed based on the <b>C-bands</b> of chromosomes in geographically diverse materials.

Based on <b>C-banded</b> karyotype, one deletion-t ranslocation heterozygote, four primary trisomies, one double-deletion trisomic, and two tertiary trisomies were identified. These cytogenetic stocks will be useful in genetic studies of Russian wildrye. Genetic variations in Russian wildrye were analyzed at chromosomal, protein and DNA levels using <b>C-banding,</b> isozymes, and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) techniques, respectively.
