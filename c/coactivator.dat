5|$|Late LTP is {{induced by}} changes in gene {{expression}} and protein synthesis {{brought about by the}} persistent activation of protein kinases activated during E-LTP, such as MAPK. In fact, MAPK—specifically the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of MAPKs—may be the molecular link between E-LTP and L-LTP, since many signaling cascades involved in E-LTP, including CaMKII and PKC, can converge on ERK. Recent research has shown that the induction of L-LTP can depend on coincident molecular events, namely PKA activation and calcium influx, that converge on CRTC1 (TORC1), a potent transcriptional <b>coactivator</b> for cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). This requirement for a molecular coincidence accounts perfectly for the associative nature of LTP, and, presumably, for that of learning.|$|E

Along with <b>coactivators</b> that possess histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or methyltransferase activity, other <b>coactivators</b> that lack recognizable chromatin-modifying activity have been discovered whose mechanism of action is largely unknown. The presence of multiple protein-protein interaction motifs within mechanistically undefined <b>coactivators</b> suggests that they function as adaptor molecules, either recruiting or stabilizing promoter-specific protein complexes.

40|$|Gonadal steroid hormones act {{throughout}} the body to elicit changes in gene expression that result in profound effects on reproductive physiology and behavior. Steroid hormones exert many of these effects by binding to their respective intracellular receptors, which {{are members of a}} nuclear receptor superfamily of transcriptional activators. A variety of in vitro studies indicate that nuclear receptor <b>coactivators</b> are required for efficient transcriptional activity of steroid receptors. Many of these <b>coactivators</b> are found in a variety of steroid hormone-responsive reproductive tissues, including the reproductive tract, mammary gland, and brain. While many nuclear receptor <b>coactivators</b> have been investigated in vitro, we are only now beginning to understand their function in reproductive physiology and behavior. In this review, we discuss the general mechanisms of action of nuclear receptor <b>coactivators</b> in steroid-dependent gene transcription.

40|$|Steroid {{receptor}} <b>coactivators</b> (SRCs) exert profound {{effects on}} animal development and physiology. These <b>coactivators</b> are nuclear proteins and transcription co-regulators that function {{to facilitate the}} transcription initiation mediated by nuclear receptors, {{as well as by}} other well-known transcription factors. However, how these co-regulators are functionally regulated is poorly understood. During genome-wide screening for SRC-interacting proteins, we identified a novel ankyrin repeat containing protein, SIP (SRC-Interacting Protein), which interacts with SRC <b>coactivators</b> in the cytoplasm. We demonstrated that extracellular stimuli such as the addition of estrogen, induced phosphorylation of SIP in its PEST (Proline, Glutamate, Serine, and Threonine rich) domain by casein kinase II. The phosphorylation of SIP resulted in dissociation of SRC proteins from SIP in the cytoplasm and led to subsequent nuclear translocation of SRC proteins and gene coactivation. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments indicate that SIP functions to sequester SRC <b>coactivators</b> in the cytoplasm and buffer the availability of these <b>coactivators,</b> thus providing a mechanism for the regulation of the transcription regulators...|$|R

25|$|The bromodomain is a motif that is {{responsible}} for acetylated lysine recognition on histones by nucleosome remodelling proteins. Posttranslational modifications of N- and C-terminal histone tails attracts various transcription initiation factors that contain bromodomains, including human transcriptional <b>coactivator</b> PCAF, TAF1, GCN5 and CREB-binding protein(CBP), to the promoter and have a significance in regulating gene expression. Structural analysis of transcription factors has shown that highly conserved bromodomains are essential for protein to bind to acetylated lysine.This suggests that specific histone site acetylation has a regulatory role in gene transcriptional activation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{proteins}} that have acetylating abilities but differ in structure to the previously mentioned families. One HAT is called steroid receptor <b>coactivator</b> 1 (SRC1), {{which has a}} HAT domain located at the C-terminus end of the protein along with a basic helix-loop-helix and PAS A and PAS B domains with a LXXLL receptor interacting motif in the middle. Another is ATF-2 which contains a transcriptional activation (ACT) domain and a basic zipper DNA-binding (bZip) domain with a HAT domain in-between. The last is TAFII250 which has a Kinase domain at the N-terminus region, two bromodomains located at the C-terminus region and a HAT domain located in-between.|$|E
25|$|Transcriptional regulators, {{as well as}} {{a growing}} number of other factors, {{regulate}} the induction of beige fat. Three regulators of transcription are central to WAT browning and serve as targets for many of the molecules known to influence this process. These include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma <b>coactivator</b> 1 alpha (PGC-1α). The list of molecules that influence browning has grown in direct proportion to the popularity of this topic and is constantly evolving as more knowledge is acquired. Among these molecules are irisin and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which have been well-studied and are believed to be important regulators of browning. Irisin is secreted from muscle in response to exercise and has been shown to increase browning by acting on beige preadipocytes. FGF21, a hormone secreted mainly by the liver, has garnered a great deal of interest after being identified as a potent stimulator of glucose uptake and a browning regulator through its effects on PGC-1α. It is increased in BAT during cold exposure and is thought to aid in resistance to diet-induced obesity FGF21 may also be secreted in response to exercise and a low protein diet, although the latter has not been thoroughly investigated. Data from these studies suggest that environmental factors like diet and exercise may be important mediators of browning.|$|E

500|$|Tbr1 and CASK {{also play}} an {{important}} role in activation of the RELN gene. One study suggests that CASK acts as a <b>coactivator</b> of TBR1, interacting with CINAP (CASK-interacting nucleosome assembly protein) to form a complex with Tbr1. The Tbr1/CASK/CINAP complex regulates expression of NMDAR2b [...] and RELN, which both play important roles in long-term potentiation.|$|E
500|$|CREB-binding protein (CBP), a {{transcriptional}} coregulator, {{is essential}} for cell function because as a <b>coactivator</b> at {{a significant number of}} promoters, it activates the transcription of genes for survival pathways. Furthermore, the amino acids that form CBP include a strip of 18 glutamines. [...] Thus, the glutamines on CBP interact directly with the increased numbers of glutamine on the HTT chain and CBP gets pulled away from its typical location next to the nucleus. [...] Specifically, CBP contains an acetyltransferase domain to which HTT binds through its polyglutamine-containing domain. Autopsied brains of those who had Huntington's disease also have been found to have incredibly reduced amounts of CBP. In addition, when CBP is overexpressed, polyglutamine-induced death is diminished, further demonstrating that CBP {{plays an important role in}} Huntington's disease and neurons in general.|$|E

40|$|Virion protein 16 (VP 16) of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) is a potent {{transcriptional}} activator of viral immediate-early (IE) genes. The VP 16 activation domain can recruit various transcriptional <b>coactivators</b> to target gene promoters. However, the role of transcriptional <b>coactivators</b> in HSV- 1 IE gene expression during lytic infection had not been fully defined. We showed previously that transcriptional <b>coactivators</b> such as the p 300 and CBP histone acetyltransferases and the BRM and Brg- 1 chromatin remodeling complexes are recruited to viral IE gene promoters in a manner dependent mostly {{on the presence of}} the activation domain of VP 16. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these transcriptional <b>coactivators</b> are required for viral IE gene expression during infection of cultured cells. The disrupted expression of the histone acetyltransferases p 300, CBP, PCAF, and GCN 5 or the BRM and Brg- 1 chromatin remodeling complexes did not diminish IE gene expression. Furthermore, IE gene expression was not impaired in cell lines that lack functional p 300, or BRM and Brg- 1. We also tested whether these <b>coactivators</b> are required for the VP 16 -dependent induction of IE gene expression from transcriptionally inactive viral genomes associated with high levels of histones in cultured cells. We found that the disruption of <b>coactivators</b> also did not affect IE gene expression in this context.

40|$|HTLV-I Tax is pivotally {{involved}} in leukemogenesis, and it potently transactivates viral transcription from the LTR. Mechanisms through which Tax activates LTR have been established, but <b>coactivators</b> {{of this process}} remain to be identified and characterized. We have recently shown that all {{three members of the}} newly identified TORC family of transcriptional regulators are <b>coactivators</b> of Tax for LTR-driven expression. TORC coactivation requires CREB, but not ATF 4 or other bZIP factors. Tax physically interacts with TORC 1, TORC 2, and TORC 3, relocating them to specific intranuclear subdomains. a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicates an association of TORC 1, TORC 2, and TORC 3 with the 21 -bp repeats of the HTLV- 1 LTR.

40|$|The {{paradigm}} of activation via ordered recruitment {{has evolved into}} a complicated picture as the influence of <b>coactivators</b> and chromatin structures on gene regulation becomes understood. We present here a comprehensive study of many elements of activation of ADH 2 and FBP 1, two glucose-regulated genes. We identify SWI/SNF as the major chromatin-remodeling complex at these genes, whereas SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn 5 -acetyltransferase complex) is required for stable recruitment of other <b>coactivators.</b> Mediator plays a crucial role in expression of both genes but does not affect chromatin remodeling. We found that Adr 1 bound unaided by <b>coactivators</b> to ADH 2, but Cat 8 binding depended on <b>coactivators</b> at FBP 1. Taken together, our results suggest that commonly regulated genes share many aspects of activation, but that gene-specific regulators or elements of promoter architecture may account for small differences in the mechanism of activation.

The {{extent to}} which transcriptional <b>coactivators</b> are involved in modulating tissue-specific functions of the VDR is unclear. Hence, the current studies investigated the role of p 160 <b>coactivators</b> in regulating VDR function and interaction with RXR. Two p 160 <b>coactivators,</b> glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein- 1 (GRIP 1) and receptor-associated coactivator- 3 (RAC 3), which are expressed in an inverse fashion in cell lines representative of calcitriol target tissues, interacted directly with the VDR, both in vitro and in yeast cells, {{but only in the}} presence of calcitriol. Deletional analyses of VDR indicated that GRIP 1 and RAC 3 required an intact VDR activation function (AF- 2) domain for efficient interaction as well as additional but distinct regions of the VDR. Coexpression experiments in yeast cells indicated that both GRIP 1 and RACE coassemble with the VDR to form an active transcriptional complex. They also form ternary complexes with VDR homodimers and VDR:RXR alpha heterodimers. In mammalian cells, GRIP 1 augmented VDR activation of the osteocalcin promoter, whereas RAC 3 enhanced VDR activation indirectly through RXR.
