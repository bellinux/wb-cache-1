5000|$|The {{first thing}} {{recommendation}} {{to control the}} gall nematodes is to plant healthy seeds in area not infested. Nematode-free seeds are important to avoid disseminating the pathogen to other areas. However, if areas are already contaminated, other measures will be needed.Some nematicides are still applied to stop J2 from infecting coffee plants. However, due phytotoxicity and high value their use became unpractical. Thus, new cultural methods started to be applied such as irrigation control, remove diseased plants, spacing rows and others not as common. M. exigua can survive for six months without the host, while M. coffeicola just survive for few days or weeks. Thus, not planting host plants for a period greater than six months can eradicate both plant feeders. Grafting [...] is another method applied to control Meloidogyne species that attacks coffee. Resistant varieties are used as a support (stock) such Apoatã, which will provide nutrients to the other variety on the top (scion) such Mundo Novo, {{that will be the}} one with flower and coffee fruit production. It is an easier method, that does not harm the environment. Other cultivar that is used to control M. exigua is IAPAR 59. It carries Mex-1 resistance gene, that causes Hypersensitive Response (HR) in the plant, also having low reproductive factor to M. exigua. This is a <b>competitive</b> <b>variety</b> with good agronomic factors.|$|E

40|$|Summary Weeds {{are a major}} {{constraint}} to rice {{production in}} direct-seeded systems as they increase production costs and cause yield loss. Herbicides are widely used but, {{with the threat of}} herbicide resistance and a scarcity of new molecules, interest has increased in cultural approaches, based on understanding of weed biology, within integrated weed management programs. Approaches include use of stale seedbed techniques, tillage practices, making the crop more competitive with the use of <b>competitive</b> <b>varieties,</b> nar-row crop row spacing and high crop seed rate, use of crop residue as mulches, and optimum time and depth of flooding. There is also scope to integrate herbicides with cultural practices to improve the sustainable use of herbicides.

Ecological processes in genetically diverse crops were investigated by conducting field trials with winter barley varieties (Hordeum vulgare), grown as monocultures or as three-way mixtures in fungicide treated and untreated plots at three sites. Mixtures achieved yields comparable to the best performing monocultures whilst enhancing yield stability despite being subject to multiple predicted and unpredicted abiotic and biotic stresses including brown rust (Puccinia hordei) and lodging. There was compensation through competitive release because the most <b>competitive</b> <b>variety</b> overyielded in mixtures thereby compensating for less competitive varieties. Facilitation was also identified as an important ecological process within mixtures by reducing lodging. This study indicates that crop varietal mixtures have the capacity to stabilise productivity even when environmental conditions and stresses are not predicted in advance. Varietal mixtures provide a means of increasing crop genetic diversity without the need for extensive breeding efforts.

40|$|ABSTRACT Weed {{control is}} {{consider}} the major obstacle for the growers in the organic farming. Lower plant productivity in organic farming mainly {{related to the}} poor weed control. It is widely known, in most cases, that losses caused by weeds exceeded the losses from any category of agricultural pests. Under water-stress condition, weeds can reduce crop yields more than 50 % through moisture competition alone. In {{the light of the}} environmental and toxicological problems created by herbicides, it has become necessary to develop the safety methods for controlling weeds. Soil Solarization, Mulching, Biodegradable Mulch, Natural Herbicides, Hot Water, and Agronomic Practices have been successfully adopted in many countries as safe methods for controlling weeds in the organic farming. In addition, there are some promising new and non-traditional measures such as Fresnel Lens, Electrical Weed Control, Lasers, etc which could be employed for controlling the weeds in organic farming. Also the agronomic practices such as choice of <b>competitive</b> <b>varieties,</b> stale seedbeds {{had a significant impact on}} weeds. The growers in organic farming should keep these three points in mind: 1) start clean stay clean successful, 2) Prevention is always better than treatment and, 3) One year's seeds will lead to seven year's weed infestation. Successful and sustainable weed management systems are those that employ combinations of techniques rather than relying on one method.

The results showed significantly reduction in weed population with herbicides application (P=. 05). Percentage reductions over control ranged from 65 to 91 percent in 2009 and from 68 to 87 percent in 2010. The herbicides Stam (PE), RiceForce (Pe) and ButaForce (Pe) were the most effective in reducing weed population (P=. 05). All herbicides treatments gave significantly higher grain yields than control plots. Grain yields increased with increased rates of application but yields from full and three-quarter doses were similar. Yields of the two varieties at Rokupr were similar to Gbomsamba.

To identify indices to be least affected by weather conditions. To investigate the correlation dependence between grain quality indices in the years with contrasting weather conditions and conduct the analysis of variance. Methods. Parameters of grain and flour quality of bread spring wheat lines were determined using conventional methods at the laboratory of grain quality of V.  M. Remeslo Myronivka Institute of Wheat, NAAS of Ukraine, protein content in flour was measured {{with the use of}} the SPECTRAN 119 M device. Results. Contrasting weather conditions were considered including arid ones (2013) – that had negative effect on 1000 kernel weight, but at the same time positively influenced the averaged grain quality indices; with excess humidity (2014) – they resulted in decreasing of all technological indices; optimal ones (2015) – allowed to obtain maximum indices of grain and flour quality. Paired coefficients of correlation between different para­meters of grain and flour quality were calculated. The most number of strong and medium correlations was found in a dry year (33. 3 %), the smallest one – in a wet year (13. 0 %). Such indices as flour strength, dough dilution and protein content depended on the conditions of the growing year least of all. Grain-unit response was the most considerable to the humid conditions of the year. The analysis of variance showed that climatic conditions had significant effect on the quality indices of grain and flour. At the same time, an important genotypic component was revealed in indices of dough resilience (63 %), bread volume and rating (61 and 53 % respectively), the flour strength (42 %), crude gluten quality (33 %), bread porosity (30 %). With climate variations, the genotypic conditionality of the content of protein and especially crude gluten was expressed insignificantly. Conclusions.

40|$|Restricted until 26 June 2010. Product {{proliferation}} {{has been}} observed in many product categories over the years. It is commonly believed that increasing variety would potentially attract more customers and hence yield more profit. However, there are variety-associated costs as well, and whether firms in a competitive environment would benefit from increasing product variety is unclear. Therefore, this dissertation studies how to balance {{the costs and benefits}} of product variety in presence of competition. More specifically, the following research questions are explored: In presence of competition, how should a firm choose the product strategies that involve production technology (mass production or mass customization), product selection or assortment planning, pricing, and inventory decisions in order to maximize its overall profits? How do these decisions interact with each other, and what is the effect of market characteristics and cost factors on these variety-related decisions?; We analyze <b>competitive</b> <b>variety</b> management problems along different dimensions: in the first essay, we study the competitive production technology strategies faced by manufacturers and the trade-offs between standard products and customized products, along with variety, lead time and pricing decisions; in the second essay we examine the assortment planning and inventory decisions faced by retailers, in consideration of the competitor's choices; the third essay studies the interaction between variety and pricing strategies in presence of competition and the effect of firm reputation on these decisions, which may apply to both manufacturers and retailers.; This dissertation makes the following contributions: 1. It proposes a modeling framework to analyze the product variety management problems in a competitive setting. In contrast to the models in literature, it incorporates customers' heterogeneous preferences for firm and for product attribute, and it models customer behaviors in response to firms' production technology, product assortment and pricing strategies. Therefore, we are able to analyze how these decisions should be made in order to maximize a firm's profit in competition. 2.

40|$|The {{inherent}} genetic {{similarity between}} oat (Avena sativa L.) and wild oat (Avena fatua L.) precludes selective herbicide use to control wild oat. Consequently, large reductions in oat yield and quality due to wild oat consistently constrain oat production in western Canada. Traditionally, delayed seeding followed by tillage prior to planting {{was used to}} control wild oat, but new {{studies have shown that}} this practice also results in substantial reductions to oat yield and quality. Thus, new methods are needed to ameliorate the adverse effects of wild oat competition on oat. Planting more <b>competitive</b> <b>varieties</b> with earlier emergence and larger seeds may minimize losses associated with wild oat competition. Therefore, the objectives of this research were i) to determine the influence of wild oat emerging at different times and varying densities on oat yield and quality and ii) to determine the relative importance of seed size and genotype in affecting wild oat – oat competition. High densities of early emerging wild oat greatly reduced oat yield and increased wild oat contamination. Observed oat yield losses were as great as 70 % and resulted in a 15 % wild oat contamination level. Wild oat that emerged before oat also had higher biomass and reproductive output than wild oat that emerged after oat. Furthermore, early emerging wild oat reduced percentage plump oat kernels and increased percentage thin kernels. Oat plants established from large caryopses produced 18 % more biomass and 15 % more panicles m- 2 than plants established from small caryopses. In addition, wild oat produced 31 % less biomass and fewer panicles m- 2 when grown with oat plants established from large caryopses. CDC Boyer appeared to be the most <b>competitive</b> of the <b>varieties</b> examined, having significantly higher biomass and panicle production both in the presence and absence of wild oat competition.

Experiments on word similarity and association reveal that our model achieves results <b>competitive</b> with a <b>variety</b> of classical models. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a refined empirical investigation concerning country-specific determinants of horizontal and vertical intra-industry trade (IIT,) in relation to South Africa using the gravity model of trade in a panel data setting. Prior to investigating the case of South Africa's intra-industry trade a critical review of the relevant theoretical, methodologcal, and empirical literature is provided. The study operationalises the theoretical dstinction between horizontal and vertical IIT using the latest methodology of decomposing total IIT into horizontal intra-industry trade (HIIq and vertical intra-industry trade (WIT,). Thts study makes several advances on earlier empirical studies of intra-industry trade determinants. These include the introduction of new countq-specific determinants of intraindustry trade that previous studies have not examined. Furthermore, it is the first empirical study that traces the relationshp between intra-industry trade flows and intellectual property rights (IPRs). Moreover, to ensure the sensitivity and robustness of the results, several econometric approaches have been used in estimating the gravity model of South Africa's intra-industry trade: the consistent coefficient approach, the fixed effects approach, the random effects approach, and the between effects approach. The econometric results are generally satisfactory in terms of economic interpretation and statistical significance and thus offer new empirical validation to the theoretical explanatory variables. The key findngs suggest the following: the volume of South Africa's IIT has increased during the study period and its WIT exceeds its HIIT. The latter result reflects the nature of South Africa's trade as it imports high valued added products and exports primary and mineral products. South Africa's intra-industry trade and its two components are positively related to market size and standard of living, and negatively related to geographcal distance. Furthermore, separately, the IPRs and the imitation ability of South Africa's tradmg partners are not important factors in determining IIT flows; however, the interaction between them is an important factor. Thts study also reveals South Africa should pursue its intra-industry trade with rest of world concentrating on local industries that produce most <b>competitive</b> <b>varieties,</b> absorbing labor and other resources from the production of other varieties...|$|R
25|$|Utricularia {{can survive}} almost {{anywhere}} {{where there is}} fresh water for {{at least part of}} the year; only Antarctica and some oceanic islands have no native species. The greatest species diversity for the genus is seen in South America, with Australia coming a close second. In common with most carnivorous plants, they grow in moist soils which are poor in dissolved minerals, where their carnivorous nature gives them a <b>competitive</b> advantage; terrestrial <b>varieties</b> of Utricularia can frequently be found alongside representatives of the carnivorous generaSarracenia, Drosera and othersin very wet areas where continuously moving water removes most soluble minerals from the soil.|$|R

Participants indicated that their decision to purchase fresh meat from either a modern retail outlet or the traditional market was influenced by eight themes. The themes identified were the perceptions of freshness, Halal assurance, having good relationships with retailers, good quality meat, <b>competitive</b> price, convenience, <b>varieties</b> of products to choose from and retail outlets that have a good and pleasant environment for shoppers. Despite the increased number of supermarkets and hypermarkets, {{not only are the}} traditional markets able to coexist with modern retail formats, but they remain the preferred place to buy fresh meat...|$|R
