5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of}} the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E
25|$|Pressure in {{the primary}} circuit is {{maintained}} by a pressurizer, a separate vessel that {{is connected to the}} primary circuit and partially filled with water which is heated to the saturation temperature (boiling point) for the desired pressure by submerged electrical heaters. To achieve a pressure of , the pressurizer temperature is maintained at 345°C (653°F), which gives a subcooling margin (the difference between the pressurizer temperature and the highest temperature in the reactor core) of 30°C (54°F). As 345°C is the boiling point of water at 155 bar, the liquid water is {{at the edge of a}} phase change. Thermal transients in the reactor <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> result in large swings in pressurizer liquid/steam volume, and total pressurizer volume is designed around absorbing these transients without uncovering the heaters or emptying the pressurizer. Pressure transients {{in the primary}} <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> manifest as temperature transients in the pressurizer and are controlled through the use of automatic heaters and water spray, which raise and lower pressurizer temperature, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Through-tool <b>coolant</b> <b>systems,</b> {{also known}} as through-spindle <b>coolant</b> <b>systems,</b> are systems plumbed to deliver coolant through {{passages}} inside the spindle and through the tool, directly to the cutting interface. Many of these are also high-pressure <b>coolant</b> <b>systems,</b> in which the operating pressure can be hundreds to several thousand psi (1to30MPa)—pressures comparable to those used in hydraulic circuits. High-pressure through-spindle <b>coolant</b> <b>systems</b> require rotary unions that can withstand these pressures. Drill bits and endmills tailored for this use have small holes at the lips where the coolant shoots out. Various types of gun drills also use similar arrangements.|$|R

5000|$|Depressurization systems: These {{systems are}} {{designed}} to maintain reactor pressure within safety limits. Additionally, if reactor water level cannot be maintained with high-pressure <b>coolant</b> <b>systems</b> alone, the depressurization system can reduce reactor pressure to a level at which the low-pressure <b>coolant</b> <b>systems</b> can function.|$|R
25|$|With {{the steam}} {{generators}} no longer receiving feedwater, heat and pressure {{increased in the}} reactor <b>coolant</b> <b>system,</b> causing the reactor to perform an emergency shutdown (SCRAM). Within eight seconds, control rods were inserted into the core to halt the nuclear chain reaction. The reactor continued to generate decay heat and, because steam was no longer {{being used by the}} turbine, heat was no longer being removed from the reactor's primary water loop.|$|E
25|$|The reactor is {{equipped}} with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS), consisting of dedicated water reserve tank, hydraulic accumulators, and pumps. ECCS piping is integrated with the normal reactor cooling system. In case of total loss of power, the ECCS pumps {{are supposed to be}} powered by the rotational momentum of the turbogenerator rotor for the time before the diesel generators come online. The Chernobyl disaster occurred during a botched test of this system. The ECCS has three systems, connected to the <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> headers. In case of damage, the first ECCS subsystem provides cooling for up to 100 seconds to the damaged half of the coolant circuit (the other half is cooled by the main circulation pumps), and the other two subsystems then handle long-term cooling of the reactor.|$|E
25|$|Astronauts Wolf and Marshburn began EVA 2 at 15:27 UTC {{out of the}} Quest airlock. The EVA was to {{transfer}} the spare components brought by the shuttle from the ICC-VLD to External Stowage Platform-3. The spares were handled by Wolf riding the station's robotic arm to the P3 truss stowage platform where he and Marshburn attached them for long term storage. The purpose of the spares was to provide redundancy to the station in the period following the shuttle's retirement. The spares unloaded include a Ku-Band Space-to-Ground antenna, a pump module for the <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> and a drive unit for the station's robotic arm's mobile transporter. A planned installation of a camera on the Japanese Experiment Facility was postponed to a future EVA for want of time. Meanwhile, the malfunctioning toilet was set right with the replacement of internal parts and cleared for normal use after tests.|$|E

The oil tanks themselves had no separate <b>coolant</b> controlling <b>systems.</b> The <b>coolant</b> header tank was in the forward nacelle, behind the propeller. The remaining <b>coolant</b> <b>systems</b> were controlled by the coolant radiators shutters in the forward inner wing compartment, between the nacelle and the fuselage and behind the main engine cooling radiators, which were fitted in the leading edge.

25|$|Before launch, two Captive Firing Tests were {{conducted}} on the rocket which was to launch HTV-1. The first test, which consisted of firing the first stage for ten seconds, was originally scheduled to occur at 02:30 UTC on 27 March 2009, however it was cancelled after the launch pad's <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> failed to activate. This was later discovered to {{have been due to}} a manual supply valve not being open. The test was rescheduled for 1 April, but then postponed again due to a leak in a pipe associated with the launch facility's fire suppression system. The test was rescheduled for 2 April, when it was successfully conducted at 05:00 UTC. Following this, the second test, which involved a 150-second burn of the first stage, was scheduled for 20 April. This was successfully conducted at 04:00 UTC on 22 April, following a two-day delay due to unfavourable weather conditions. A ground test, using a battleship mockup of the rocket was subsequently conducted on 11 July.|$|E
25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was methanol (methyl alcohol). Methanol was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E
25|$|Neutron {{poisoning}} and tritium {{production from}} lithium-6 - Lithium-6 {{is a strong}} neutron poison; using LiF with natural lithium, with its 7.5% lithium-6 content, prevents reactors from starting. The high neutron density in the core rapidly transmutes lithium-6 to tritium, losing neutrons that are required to sustain break-even breeding. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which is nearly identical, chemically, to ordinary hydrogen. In the MSR the tritium is quite mobile because, in its elemental form, it rapidly diffuses through metals at high temperature. If the lithium is isotopically enriched in lithium-7, and the isotopic separation level is high enough (99.995% lithium-7), the amount of tritium produced {{is only a few}} hundred grams per year for a 1GWe reactor. This much smaller amount of tritium comes mostly from the lithium-7 - tritium reaction and from beryllium, which can produce tritium indirectly by first transmuting to tritium-producing lithium-6. LFTR designs that use a lithium salt, choose the lithium-7 isotope. In the MSRE, lithium-6 was successfully removed from the fuel salt via isotopic enrichment. Since lithium-7 is at least 16% heavier than lithium-6, and is the most common isotope, lithium-6 is comparatively easy and inexpensive to extract. Vacuum distillation of lithium achieves efficiencies of up to 8% per stage and requires only heating in a vacuum chamber. However, about one fission in 90,000 produces helium-6, which quickly decays to lithium-6 and one fission in 12,500 produces an atom of tritium directly (in all reactor types). Practical MSRs operate under a blanket of dry inert gas, usually helium. LFTRs offer a good chance to recover the tritium, since it is not highly diluted in water as in CANDU reactors. Various methods exist to trap tritium, such as hydriding it to titanium, oxidizing it to less mobile (but still volatile) forms such as sodium fluoroborate or molten nitrate salt, or trapping it in the turbine power cycle gas and offgasing it using copper oxide pellets. ORNL developed a secondary loop <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> that would chemically trap residual tritium so that it could be removed from the secondary coolant rather than diffusing into the turbine power cycle. ORNL calculated that this would reduce Tritium emissions to acceptable levels.|$|E

500|$|Cooling {{this large}} engine whilst minimising {{aerodynamic}} drag posed new challenges {{for both the}} Rolls-Royce and Supermarine design teams. Traditional cooling methods using honeycomb-type radiators were known to cause high drag in flight; consequently {{it was decided to}} use the surface skins of the S.6 wings and floats as heat exchangers, employing a double-skinned structure through which the coolant could circulate. Engine oil was cooled in a similar manner using channels in the fuselage and empennage skins. The S.6 was described at the time as a [...] "flying radiator", and it had been estimated that this <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> dissipated the equivalent of 1,000hp (745kW) of heat in flight. However, even with this system in use, engine overheating was noted during the race flights, requiring the pilots to reduce the throttle setting to maintain a safe operating temperature.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} of a pressurizer, Steam generators, and reactor coolant pumps (RCPs).

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the engine coolant gets too hot, it might boil while inside the engine, causing voids (pockets of steam), leading to {{localized}} hot spots and the catastrophic {{failure of the}} engine. If plain water were {{to be used as}} an engine coolant, it would promote galvanic corrosion. Proper engine coolant and a pressurized <b>coolant</b> <b>system</b> can help obviate the problems which make plain water incompatible with automotive engines. With proper antifreeze, a wide temperature range can be tolerated by the engine coolant, such as [...] to [...] for 50% (by volume) propylene glycol diluted with water and a 15 psi pressurized <b>coolant</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On January 5, 2012, General Motors {{announced}} that it would offer a customer satisfaction program to provide modifications to the Chevrolet Volt to reduce the chance that the battery pack could catch fire days or weeks after a severe accident.

40|$|In recent years, {{several small}} modular reactor (SMR) designs have been developed. These {{nuclear power plants}} (NPPs) not only offer a small power size (less than 300 MWe), a reduced spatial footprint, and modularized compact designs {{fabricated}} in factories and transported to the intended sites, but also passive safety features. Some light water (LW) -SMRs have already been granted by Department of Energy: NuScale and mPower. New LW-SMRs are mainly inspired by the early LW-SMRs (such as process-inherent ultimate safety (PIUS), international reactor innovative and secure (IRIS), and safe integral reactor (SIR)). LW-SMRs employ significantly fewer components to decrease costs and increase simplicity of design. However, new physical challenges have appeared with these changes.
