40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a study on}} Augmented Reality (AR) development as a new performance approach for collaborative space of urban design work. Here, the participants- e. g. architects, structure engineers, equipment vendors, etc- can view an urban design process through AR scenes by Head-Mounted Display (HMD) glasses. Nowadays, the AR technology has been supported as a great graphical computing technology which promises to offer several advantages of applying for the digital architecture and construction fields. The AR effects enable users to examine 3 D project models integrated into real environment in an intuitive way and real-time. Therefore, this research focuses on an establishment a kind of smart AR discussion space- the Augmented Reality <b>Conference</b> <b>Desk</b> (named as ARCdesk for short). As the result, the participants can examine a planning process of urban design work in 3 D/ 4 D multi-phases by intuitive ways. In particular, all participants also can examine the digital urban mock-up from free views and they also can interact with whole models (or each part) during architectural discussion. As the novelty of research, the participants were suggested to manage and create the input digital urban models basing on use a range of available Google Earth facilities which are usability for architectural design, such as the Google SketchUp, Google Building Marker and Google 3 D Warehouse. This example also involves the conceptual combination of AR and 4 D construction simulation within indoor condition in order to simulate the phases such urban growing up. The implementation bases on the main technical theme: the imagery vision- based AR tracking and the Tangible Augmented Reality...|$|E

40|$|The World Wide Web (WWW) {{is today}} the most {{successful}} service of the Internet. The richness of information available combined with easy access to this information makes it a premier information gathering tool for researchers and consumers, however, the model of today's WWW {{does not include the}} users. The WWW is a purely information focused environment, consisting of documents and links between these documents. The virtual world formed by the linked information on the WWW is completely separated from the world of its users. The CoBrow 1 project [6] proposes to extend the model of the WWW to include its users. This will enable many new applications like WWW based <b>conferencing,</b> help <b>desks,</b> online presentations, online tours, and group entertainment. We believe that the WWW is well suited to become the unifying platform for synchronous, interactive collaboration across the Internet. CoBrow has developed a model of a WWW that includes its users. The approach chosen is to associate users [...] ...|$|R
50|$|With the {{emergence}} of hot desking and the increasing presence of technology in the workplace, tools {{have been developed to}} make it easier to utilize hot desking in an office environment, to standardize the process, and to automatically enforce basic business rules or policies. Generally, using the hot desking method is accomplished by installing and operating by a piece of software which integrates with the company's email and calendaring systems, with the telephony or PBX systems, and is tailored to the office of each individual company. These software systems usually also allow the company to manage many space-related resources such as <b>conference</b> rooms, <b>desks,</b> offices, and project rooms. Sophisticated software systems for managing these space resources often also manage the support equipment and services such as audio-visual equipment and catering for meeting rooms, lockers and carts for desks and offices, and parking spaces for the people actually using those space resources on the same day.|$|R
5000|$|Asilomar State Beach is a narrow, 1 mi {{strip of}} sandy beach and rocky coves. A 1 mi trail, which {{runs through the}} dunes, is open to pedestrians. This trail is {{wheelchair}}-accessible, and a beach wheelchair {{is available at the}} <b>Conference</b> Grounds front <b>desk,</b> located inside the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Social Hall. [...] Bicycling is allowed on the paved bike lane along the road, running parallel to the Coast Trail. The ocean off shore is protected as the Asilomar State Marine Reserve, part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. [...] The rocky coves are home to thousands of species, some of which are unique to the bay. As a sanctuary, it is illegal to disturb biota, i.e., collection and removal of shells and/or live specimens.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to propose a {{resigned}} structure to better suit {{the activities of the}} Santa Clara University Multicultural Center. The renovation entails proposing a preliminary structural design system that includes a new, light-weight PLN 3 metal deck roofing system provided by Verco Decking, Inc. Nine deep long span 56 DLH truss joists will be implemented to support the metal deck. Two large trusses comprised of member sizes HSS 9 x 9 x½ and LL 3 ½x 3 ½x 5 / 16 x 3 / 8 will be used to support the nine truss joists. Four concrete columns, 15 ft in height and 2 ft in diameter, will be erected to uphold each end of the two steel trusses. Lastly, column footings of 4. 52 ̆ 7 x 4. 52 ̆ 7 x 3. 02 ̆ 7 will be used to support each concrete column. The architectural components of the renovation aim to include a complete redesign of the existing common area of the original building as well as implementing an extension to allow for more space. The architectural components include a new general meeting area layout, four private study rooms, one <b>conference</b> room, a <b>desk</b> reception and storage facility area, as well as an emergency exit extension and multipurpose activity center. The total cost of renovation is estimated to be 864, 341. 00 with a cost per square foot of 156. 58. The duration of this project is expected to last 11 weeks, starting from June 15 to August 28...|$|R
