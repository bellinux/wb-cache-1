For this reason, the vast majority of MVR units feature a desuperheater between the compressor and the main heat exchanger.|$|R

40|$|A rig was {{constructed}} {{to test the}} performance characteristics and compare the hydraulic forces exerted on a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>type</b> artificial heart impeller. A conventional shaft, seal and bearing system, while driven by a small electric motor, supported the impeller which was separated from the pump casing by a 6 axis force transducer (JR 3 Inc).

At physiological operating conditions, {{the results indicate that}} the double entry/exit centrifugal pump encounters a smaller radial force and significantly reduced axial thrust. These experimental results are valuable in the design of a magnetic bearing system to suspend the impeller of a centrifugal artificial heart pump.

40|$|A small, high-pressure, LOX {{turbopump}} was designed, fabricated and tested. The pump is a single-stage <b>centrifugal</b> <b>type</b> {{with power}} to the pump supplied by a single-stage partial-admission axial-impulse turbine. Design conditions included an operating speed of 7330 rad/s (70, 000 rpm), pump discharge pressure of 2977 N/sqcm (4318 psia), and a pump flowrate of 16. 4 Kg/s (36. 21 lb/s). The turbopump contains a self-compensating axial thrust balance piston to eliminate axial thrust loads on the bearings during steady-state operation. Testing of the turbopump was achieved usng a gaseous hydrogen high-pressure flow to drive the turbine, which generally is propelled by LOX/LH 2 combustion products, at 1041 K (1874 R) inlet temperature and at a design pressure ratio of 1. 424.

40|$|A density sensing factor {{has been}} {{isolated}} from Dictyostelium discoideum {{and is known}} as conditioned media factor (CMF). CMF {{has been shown to}} cause starved vegetative Dictyostelium cells to differentiate into one of two cell <b>types,</b> <b>stalk</b> or spore cells. One interesting aspect of CMF concerns its release: CMF mRNA is present in vegetative Dictyostelium cells, yet secretion of the CMF protein only occurs during early and late development. My research reveals evidence that CMF is sequestered in the plasma membrane of vegetative cells. Further experiments show that CMF anti-sense transformants are motile but do not form cell aggregates. I suggest that CMF may have a role in chemotaxis which could involve interactions with components of the cytoskeleton.

The general method employed was to record the development of single sprays by means of special high-speed photographic apparatus capable of taking 25 consecutive pictures of the moving spray at a rate of 4, 000 per second. Investigations were made concerning the effects on spray characteristics, of the helix angle of helical grooves, the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the orifice to that of the grooves, the ratio of orifice length to diameter, and the position of the seat. Maximum spray penetration was obtained with a ratio of orifice length to diameter of about 1. 5. Slightly greater penetration was obtained with the seat directly before the orifice...|$|R

Hardness, residual stress and crystal transformation of areas affected by shot peening or grit blasting are examined. In order to clarify the influences of those factors on the surface integrity, a medium carbon steel (C: 0. 45 %, 180 HV) and an austenitic stainless steel (SUS 304, 210 HV) were peened by a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>type</b> peening machine using cast steel particles (650 - 800 HV).

Positive displacement types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as twin screw compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single fan blade is too low and cannot be used.|$|R
