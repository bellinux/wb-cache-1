The {{hurricane}} produced Jamaica's deadliest {{natural disaster}} of the 20th century, causing more than 152 deaths and $50,000,000 in damages. The hurricane {{was described as}} Tampico's worst tropical cyclone since 1936, and it <b>caused</b> <b>more</b> than 100 fatalities in the surrounding areas. Many bodies were not recovered after flooding. The hurricane produced peak gusts of 160mph (260km/h) at the airport, and its strongest sustained winds were unmeasured in mainland Mexico, suggesting {{that it may have}} been a Category4 hurricane at landfall.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Winifred was {{the last}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall in the busy 1992 Pacific hurricane season. Impacting western Mexico, especially Colima and Michoacán, Hurricane Winifred brought heavy rain and destruction to the area.

5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and <b>caused</b> <b>more</b> glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|Emigration to {{the west}} {{decreased}} over the following years, but {{it is likely that}} the drop in numbers was <b>caused</b> <b>more</b> by fears over the outcome of the ongoing Mexican-American War than by the cautionary tale of the Donner Party. In 1846, an estimated 1,500 people migrated to California. In 1847, the number dropped to 450 and to 400 in 1848. The California Gold Rush spurred a sharp increase, however, and 25,000 people went west in 1849. Most of the overland migration followed the Carson River, but a few forty-niners used the same route as the Donner Party and recorded descriptions about the site.|$|E

5|$|However, Evans {{may have}} overly {{emphasised}} a political {{interpretation of the}} sermon for his own political gain; the see of Derry had just opened and Evans wished to have his friend William Nicolson take the position. Evans' political intrigue provoked Swift during an inspection of the clergy of Meath at Trim. Swift, as vicar of Laracor spoke during a synod to defend himself, his sermons, and his politics, and instead of resolving the issue, only <b>caused</b> <b>more</b> dispute between the two.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, an {{explosion}} {{on a ship}} at the Port of Texas City caused fires and destruction throughout the city's industrial complex and other ships creating one of nation's worst industrial accidents.

5|$|In the Atlantic, Irene {{produced}} moderate {{rainfall and}} winds along its path, although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane. A total of 96homes were destroyed, and 1,200people were left homeless. The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, killing {{three people in}} Rivas. In neighboring Costa Rica, Hurricane Irene <b>caused</b> <b>more</b> than $1million (USD) in damage to the banana crop. Later, the remnants of Hurricane Olivia produced rainfall in the southwest United States. Flooding was reported near Yuma, Arizona, which closed a major highway, and the moisture produced snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two centuries}} since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the {{wetlands}} around New Orleans have diminished, and the elevation has dropped due to subsidence. These {{have increased the}} threat to the city of a significant hurricane strike. The 1812 hurricane was not a worst-case scenario for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have <b>caused</b> <b>more</b> damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E

In early October, Newfoundland was again struck by a {{tropical}} cyclone– Hurricane Ophelia. Though a weaker storm, Ophelia <b>caused</b> <b>more</b> damage than expected as it destroyed infrastructure repaired in the wake of Igor.

Aims: To compare explanatory models among people with schizophrenia from four cultural backgrounds and explore their relationship with clinical and psychological characteristics.

Results: When biological and supernatural causes of illness were compared, Whites cited biological <b>causes</b> <b>more</b> frequently than the three non-White groups, who cited supernatural <b>causes</b> <b>more</b> frequently. When biological and social causes were compared, Whites cited biological <b>causes</b> <b>more</b> frequently than Africanâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Caribbeans and Bangladeshis, who cited social <b>causes</b> <b>more</b> frequently.

The Sarajevo Agreement, regarding the implementation of the ceasefire, was signed on 2 January 1992, bringing the campaign to an end. Nonetheless, the JNA took several more months to withdraw from Croatia as it was replaced by the UN peacekeepers. In 1991 alone, the conflict <b>caused</b> <b>more</b> than 7,000 deaths and the internal displacement of 400,000–600,000 people.

5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war <b>caused</b> <b>more</b> delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E
