25|$|Astrocytes are macroglial {{cells in}} the central nervous system. Astrocytes are derived from {{heterogeneous}} populations of progenitor {{cells in the}} neuroepithelium of the developing central nervous system. There is remarkable similarity between the well known genetic mechanisms that specify the lineage of diverse neuron subtypes and that of macroglial cells. Just as with neuronal <b>cell</b> <b>specification,</b> canonical signaling factors like Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Fibroblast growth factor (FGFs), WNTs and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), provide positional information to developing macroglial cells through morphogen gradients along the dorsal–ventral, anterior–posterior and medial–lateral axes. The resultant patterning along the neuraxis leads to segmentation of the neuroepithelium into progenitor domains (p0, p1 p2, p3 and pMN) for distinct neuron types in the developing spinal cord. On the basis of several studies it is now believed that this model also applies to macroglial <b>cell</b> <b>specification.</b> Studies carried out by Hochstim and colleagues have demonstrated that three distinct populations of astrocytes arise from the p1, p2 and p3 domains. These subtypes of astrocytes can be identified {{on the basis of}} their expression of different transcription factors (PAX6, NKX6.1) and cell surface markers (reelin and SLIT1). The three populations of astrocyte subtypes which have been identified are 1) dorsally located VA1 astrocytes, derived from p1 domain, express PAX6 and reelin 2) ventrally located VA3 astrocytes, derived from p3, express NKX6.1 and SLIT1 and 3) and intermediate white-matter located VA2 astrocyte, derived from the p2 domain, which express PAX6, NKX6.1, reelin and SLIT1. After astrocyte specification has occurred in the developing CNS, it is believed that astrocyte precursors migrate to their final positions within the nervous system before the process of terminal differentiation occurs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{generation}} of cellular {{diversity in the}} nervous system involves the mechanism of asymmetric cell division. Besides an array of molecules, including the Par protein cassette, a heterotrimeric G protein signalling complex, Inscuteable {{plays a major role}} in controlling asymmetric cell division, which ultimately leads to differential activation of the Notch signalling pathway and correct specification of the two daughter cells. In this context, Notch is required to be active in one sibling and inactive in the other. Here, we investigated the requirement of genes previously known to play key roles in sibling <b>cell</b> fate <b>specification</b> such as members of the Notch signalling pathway, e. g., Notch (N), Delta (Dl), and kuzbanian (kuz) and a crucial regulator of asymmetric cell division, inscuteable (insc) throughout lineage progression of 4 neuroblasts (NB 1 - 1, MP 2, NB 4 - 2, and NB 7 - 1). Notch-mediated <b>cell</b> fate <b>specification</b> defects were cell-autonomous and were observed in all neuroblast lineages even in cells born from late ganglion mother cells (GMC) within the lineages. We also show that Dl functions non-autonomously during NB lineage progression and clonal cells do not require Dl from within the clone. This suggests that within a NB lineage Dl is dispensable for sibling <b>cell</b> fate <b>specification.</b> Furthermore, we provide evidence that kuz is involved in sibling <b>cell</b> fate <b>specification</b> in the central nervous system. It is cell-autonomously required in the same postmitotic cells which also depend on Notch function. This indicates that KUZ is required to facilitate a functional Notch signal in the Notch-dependent cell for correct <b>cell</b> fate <b>specification.</b> Finally, we show that three neuroblast lineages (NB 1 - 1, NB 4 - 2, and NB 7 - 1) require insc function for sibling <b>cell</b> fate <b>specification</b> in <b>cells</b> born from early GMCs whereas insc is not required in cells born from later GMCs of the same lineages.

There is belief that Dullard may have other targets that is not only associated with the nuclear envelope. In recent studies, dullard interacts with BMP type 1 to inhibit dependent phosphorylation.

Either removal or ectopic expression of mPar 3 prevents radial glial progenitors from dividing asymmetrically yet generates different outcomes in daughter <b>cell</b> fate <b>specification.</b> Furthermore, the expression level of mPar 3 affects Notch signaling, and manipulations of Notch signaling or Numb expression suppress mPar 3 regulation of radial glial {{cell division}} and daughter <b>cell</b> fate <b>specification.</b> These results reveal a critical molecular pathway underlying asymmetric cell division of radial glial progenitors in the mammalian neocortex...|$|R

In Arabidopsis thaliana, stomatal development is preceded by asymmetric cell divisions, and stomatal distribution follows the one-cell spacing rule, reflecting {{the coordination of}} <b>cell</b> fate <b>specification.</b> Stomatal development and patterning are regulated by both genetic and environmental signals. Here, we report that Arabidopsis MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3 (MPK 3) and MPK 6, two environmentally responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and their upstream MAPK kinases, MKK 4 and MKK 5, are key regulators of stomatal development and patterning.

5000|$|The gonads have an {{important}} role in germ cell development, converting the bipotential cells into gametogonia.

Male somatic <b>cell</b> <b>specification</b> involves the Y-chromosome specific Sry gene, which regulates the specification of Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Without the specification of those cells, the gonad formation is regulated by the X-chromosomes, forming the ovaries. After the fate of the gonads is finalised, the sex specification of the germ cells occurs at 12.5-15.5 days.Sex specification of the germ cells requires the repression of pluripotency [...] and relies on the communication between the somatic cells of the gonads and germ cells Reitzel et al., 2015. The mechanisms for male and female differentiation are markedly different, since a population of sperm producing spermatogonia are retained throughout development and into adult life [...] Reitzel et al., 2015, unlike oogonia which only produce oocyte in utero.When the germ cells reach the gonads, they undergo proliferation via mitosis and at 13.5 days of rat development they begin to undergo meiosis in the ovary but arrested at the mitotic stage in the testes. In the ovary, after mitosis, the gametogonium undergo meiosis, which is initiated by intrinsic competence factor DazL and extrinsic retinoic acid, excreted by the mesonephros. Retinoic acid is the major factor in meiosis, upregulating genes including ‘‘Stra8’‘, ‘‘Dmc1’‘ and ‘‘Sycp3’‘, which all have a role in meiosis.

Key known factors act to signal between the stem cells and an underlying group of cells thought to act as the stem cell niche. In Arabidopsis thaliana the homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) is essential for stem cell initiation and maintenance at shoot and flower meristems.
