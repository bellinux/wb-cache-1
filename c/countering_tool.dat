40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a new development}} of an incremental, robot based sheet metal forming process {{for the production of}} sheet metal components for limited-lot productions and prototypes. The kinematic based generation of the shape is implemented by means of two industrial robots, which are interconnected to a cooperating robot system. Compared to other incremental sheet metal forming machines this system offers a high geometrical form flexibility without the need of any workpiece dependent tools. The principle of the procedure is based on flexible shaping by means of a freely programmable path-synchronous movement of two robots. So far, the final shape is produced by the incremental infeed of the forming tool in depth direction and its movement along the contour in lateral direction on each level. The <b>counter</b> <b>tool,</b> with its simple geometry, was used to support the sheet metal on the backside by moving synchronously along the outer contour, constantly on the same level. This corresponds to a fixed backplate used in other incremental sheet metal forming processes. Due to the use of a new robot system with extended control algorithms for cooperating robots, {{it will be possible to}} release the <b>counter</b> <b>tool</b> from its constant path on the outer contour and support the forming tool right on the opposite side of the sheet to generate a predefined gap between the two hemispherical tools. This way at each moment a small part of a full die, as it is used in other processes, is simulated without the need of producing a workpiece dependent die.

40|$|Dieless rivet {{clinching}} {{is a new}} {{joining method}} working with a flat anvil as a <b>counter</b> <b>tool.</b> The joining process requires neither predrilled holes nor special machinery set-ups. By superimposing the straight movement of the punch with a wobble movement a noticeable reduction of the necessary joining force can be reached. Potential application areas, where {{the use of the}} dieless rivet clinching is of special advantage compared to conventional joining methods, are those where the contoured die used in the conventional joining methods is causing problems. For example in tasks where joining equipment with a wide outreach is required, the realization of a proper alignment between the contoured die and the punch in conventional joining methods is very costly. As the <b>counter</b> <b>tool</b> in dieless rivet clinching is a flat anvil misalignments do not affect the formation of the joint. Also advantageous in dieless rivet clinching is the fact, that a change of the joining task does not require a change of the joining tools for all possible joining operations are done with the same flat anvil. Thus huge savings can be made as there are no or only little costs for purchasing, storing, changing and aligning the joining tools. For selected joining tasks the influence of relevant process parameters and characteristics of the rivet on the formation of the joint in dieless rivet clinching was investigated. Through extensive experiments and supporting FEM-calculations the principle of the formation of the joint and the effects of important parameters have been analyzed in detail. The general knowledge acquired in the research project can help to choose the right rivets and process parameters even for joining tasks, that have not been researched yet. The limits concerning the tasks that can be joined with the dieless rivet clinching have been profoundly researched. It was found that the joining of sheets with a similar thickness is feasible. The same is true for the joining of sheets with a different thickness as long as the thinner sheet is positioned on the rivet side and the thicker sheet is positioned on the anvil side. It is possible to join sheets of the same material as well as sheets of different materials. If sheets of different materials are to be joined the positioning of the sheet with the higher strength on the rivet side has proven to be advantageous. For a selected joining task the strength values of dieless rivet clinched joints where tested and compared to the strength values of joints similar in size, that where made by conventional joining methods using a contoured die. The results show, that dieless rivet clinched joints under both static and cyclic shear tension load have considerably higher strength values than self-pierce riveted joints. On the other hand the peel tension strength and the head tension strength values of dieless rivet clinched joints are only slightly higher than the values of clinched joints. The peel tension strength and the head tension strength values of self-pierce riveted joints are noticeably higher. It could be shown, that the dieless rivet clinching is a joining method that in respect to both technological and economical aspects can be a substitution for conventional joining methods using a contoured die...|$|R

The combination of both effects make it possible to decrease the heating time to only one second or less. Dieless clinching and dieless rivet clinching, both methods were simulated using the Finite Elements Method (FEM) to analyze the influence of the geometrical parameters of the punch in dieless clinching and of the rivet in dieless rivet clinching.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of managing data centres is controlling the power consumption of applications running on servers. Developers, in particular, should evaluate each of their applications from a power consumption point of view. One can conduct an evaluation by creating models that predict power usage while running applications on servers. For this purpose, this study creates a non-exclusive test bench that can collect data on subsystem utilization by using a performance <b>counter</b> <b>tool.</b> Based on the selected subsystem performance, various models have been created to estimate the power consumption of applications running on servers. The author's models are created based on collecting the performance on four subsystems (i. e. the CPU, Memory, Disk and Interface) by Collectd tool, and the actual power consumption of a machine using a TED 5000 power meter. These subsystems have been chosen because they are the components of the server that consume the most power. In addition, as the experiments in this study demonstrate, using these subsystems as the model's input is the most efficient selection across different hardware platforms. The accuracy of the models is affected by the model inputs selection. Creating the model requires several steps: (i) connect the power meter to the server and install all the required packages such as Collectd; (ii) perform workloads on the selected subsystems; (iii) collect and simplify the data (subsystems counters and actual power) that has been stored during performing the workloads; and (iv) train the data by a modelling technique in order to create the model.

40|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} for reducing the mass and concurrently increasing the strength of metal parts. One is to distribute the material according to the loading of a part. This approach was pursued in the research project "process development of hydropatchwork bonding". In the patchwork technology blanks are reinforced locally in highly stressed areas by bonded sheets (patches) and then formed together as composite. In this project the hydroforming was used as forming technology. The patchwork technology puts specific requirements to the adhesive technology {{as well as to}} the hydroforming process which were specified for the potential application field of car body panels. After selecting suitable adhesive systems, a special bonding technology was developed. This encloses in the first step the locally defined steadily application of highly viscous paste-like adhesives in thin layers, for which a new wide slot nozzle was designed and tested. With the infrared heating by focused, close infrared light, which was used for the first time for these application cases, a technology was used which makes it possible on the one hand to warm up the components partially with one-sided access. On the other hand, it enables a limited precuring of adhesives if needed by the defined input of process heat using a heating regime. During the hydroforming process the adhesive joint has to withstand high loads by shear-, peel- and tensile forces, because it has to transfer the forming stresses from the base plate into the patch. To avoid the destruction of the adhesive joint during the hydroforming process, the forming of the composite has to be limited, a fact that has to be taken into consideration in the component design. Besides, the optimization of the patch geometry by edge relaxation has benefiting effects on the forming of the patchwork-composite. With the tools, developed in this project, it is possible to study and analyse parameters of the forming process of bonded sheets in a small scale, thus saving time and costs for material and machines. Especially when using a <b>counter</b> <b>tool,</b> relevant process conditions that are to be found during the forming of real components can be modelled very easily. For the dimensioning of components the usage of simulation tools was verified exemplarily. Within the scope of the project, methods were developed and devices were created, with which the visco-elastic and visco-plastic specific values of the adhesive layer, necessary for the FE-simulation, are relatively simply determinable with adequate approximation. As a result of this project a FE-model based on a laminate composite was developed, which allows an integration of the forming simulation of bonded patch composites in larger shell structures...|$|R
