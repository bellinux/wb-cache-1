5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge {{recommended}} {{a cross between}} a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He found the crossbreed to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> carry a hare.|$|E
5|$|Over dinner, Leslie tells Dave {{that she}} will not move to San Diego with him, as her life is in Pawnee. Dave, {{although}} sad, understands her choice and the two split up amicably. At Pawnee's tree lighting ceremony, Leslie is congratulated by everyone, including Leslie's mother Marlene, who is proud that her daughter successfully fought off the media. Leslie returns to {{work the next day}} much to Ron's immense relief, as he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> handle just a portion of her daily duties. Everyone is visibly glad that Leslie is back.|$|E
5|$|The HP-35 used five chips, {{and had a}} been {{developed}} by twenty engineers {{at a cost of}} a million dollars, leading the Texas Instruments engineers to think that Sinclair's aim to build a scientific calculator around the TMS0805 chip, which <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> handle four-function arithmetic, was impossible. However, by sacrificing some speed and accuracy, Sinclair used clever algorithms to run scientific operations on a chip with room for just 320 instructions. Constants, rather than being stored in the calculator, were printed under the screen.|$|E

60|$|I <b>could</b> yet <b>barely</b> {{distinguish}} {{the forms of}} the unhappy prisoners, and, moving to and fro near them like evil things, were shadow-like figures which I knew to be Indians.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> {{be heard over}} the sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E
5|$|Jan Wiley {{was cast}} as Scott's wife, Virginia. Although Wiley had {{appeared}} in several movies throughout the 1930s and 1940s, The Brute Man marked one of her final film performances. It was also recalled {{as one of her}} most memorable film appearances along with another Universal Pictures B horror film, She-Wolf of London. However, her performance in The Brute Man proved to be a less than memorable one for her, so much so that in an interview shortly before Wiley's death in 1993, she <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> remember even having appeared in the film. Donald MacBride and Peter Whitney portray the police officers Captain M.J. Donelly and Lieutenant Gates, respectively. Their roles serve as comic relief for the film. Their characters portray the incompetence of the police force in their inability to find and arrest the Creeper and their focus on passing blame for their failures rather than diverting resources toward his arrest.|$|E
5|$|Ruth had {{two hits}} {{in the second game}} of the season, but it quickly went {{downhill}} both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all, and the Braves lost most of their games. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline.|$|E
50|$|Mancuso won {{the race}} despite ongoing pain in her right knee, which was finally traced to hip dysplasia. She would finish the 2006 season in eighth place, {{including}} podium finishes in three races, although she <b>could</b> sometimes <b>barely</b> walk by season's end.|$|R

These features include demo versions of Becker's piece End of the Beginning recorded while he <b>could</b> still <b>barely</b> play, {{as well as a}} demo of Go Off! from Cacophony and a recording of Becker [...] "noodling" [...] on guitar.|$|R

"No chance, I fear, of our ever meeting again," [...] remarked the mate, as he cast a wistful {{look at the}} {{southern}} horizon where the sail of the long-boat <b>could</b> be <b>barely</b> seen like the wing of a sea-gull.

5|$|Taft {{insisted on}} going to Cincinnati to attend the funeral of his brother Charles, who died on December 31, 1929; the strain did not improve his own health. When the court reconvened on January 6, 1930, Taft had not {{returned}} to Washington, and two opinions were delivered by Van Devanter that Taft had drafted but {{had been unable to}} complete because of his illness. Taft went to Asheville, North Carolina for a rest, {{but by the end of}} January, he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> speak and was suffering from hallucinations. Taft was afraid that Stone would be made chief justice; he did not resign until he had secured assurances from Hoover that Hughes would be the choice. Returning to Washington after his resignation on February 3, Taft had barely enough strength to sign a reply to a letter of tribute from the eight associate justices. He died at his home in Washington on March 8, 1930.|$|E
5|$|The battle exacted a heavy {{toll on the}} 1st Airborne Division {{from which}} it would never recover. Three {{quarters}} of the formation were missing when it returned to England, including {{two of the three}} brigade commanders, eight of the nine battalion commanders and 26 of the 30 infantry company commanders. Some 500 men were still in hiding north of the Rhine, and over the coming months many of these were able to escape: initially in Operation Pegasus. New recruits, escapees and repatriated POWs joined the division over the coming months, but the division was still so much weakened that the 4th Parachute Brigade had to be merged into the 1st Parachute Brigade, and the division as a whole <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> produce two brigades of infantry. Between May and August 1945, many of the men were sent to Denmark and Norway to oversee the German surrenders there but on their return the division was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Como {{was born}} in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. He was the seventh of ten {{children}} and the first American-born child of Pietro Como and Lucia Travaglini, who both emigrated to the US in 1910 from the Abruzzese town of Palena, Italy. He did not begin speaking English until he entered school, since the Comos spoke Italian at home. The family had a second-hand organ his father had bought for $3; as soon as Como was able to toddle, he would head to the instrument, pump the bellows, and play music he had heard by ear. Pietro, a mill hand and an amateur baritone, had all his children attend music lessons even if he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> afford them. In a rare 1957 interview, Como's mother, Lucia, described how her young son also took on other jobs to pay for more music lessons; Como learned to play many different instruments, but never had a voice lesson. He showed more musical talent in his teenage years as a trombone player in the town's brass band, playing guitar, singing at weddings, and as an organist at church. Como {{was a member of}} the Canonsburg Italian Band along with the father of singer Bobby Vinton, bandleader Stan Vinton, who was often a customer at his barber shop.|$|E
6000|$|... "Help, fellars!" [...] yelled Wilson, {{quick to}} leap {{down over the}} little bank, and {{in the dim light}} to grasp the halter. The three men dragged the horse out and {{securely}} tied him close to a tree. That done, they peered down into the depression. Anson's form <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> be distinguished in the gloom. He lay stretched out. Another groan escaped him.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{difficulty}} in defining one {{value for the}} real wage, in some cases a real wage {{can be said to}} have unequivocally increased. This is true if: After the change, the worker can now afford any bundle of goods and services that he <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> afford before the change, and still have money left over. In such a situation, real wage increases no matter how inflation is calculated. Specifically, inflation could be calculated based on any good or service or combination thereof, and real wage has still increased. This of course leaves many scenarios where real wage increasing, decreasing or staying the same depends upon how inflation is calculated. These are the scenarios where the worker can buy some of the bundles that he <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> afford before and still have money left, {{but at the same time}} he simply cannot afford some of the bundles that he could before. This happens because some prices change more than others, which means relative prices have changed.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, {{the company}} {{set up a}} {{short-lived}} co-venture between the directors of Siriol Animation to create Kalisto. Kalisto also developed a show called Space Baby (which eventually became Fantastic Max), along with another series called Satellite City (which was co-produced with Fairwater Films) and the animated film The Little Engine That <b>Could.</b> Kalisto <b>barely</b> lasted a year before Booker bought the rights back.|$|R
5|$|Braham flew in {{the first}} wave. As Braham's wave reached Leeuwarden in the Netherlands and while {{four of the five}} RAF fighters made no contact, Braham {{attracted}} two enemy night fighters. The Messerschmitt Bf 110s were from IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1). Five had taken off under the command of Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who finished the war as the most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories. Schnaufer led his flight out toward the echo but turned back himself after engine trouble. Using his Serrate radar detector, Braham and his radar operator picked up the emissions made by the German fighters' Lichtenstein radar. He gained on and shot down Feldwebel Georg Kraft, an Experten with 15 air victories from 4./NJG 1. Kraft was killed. Another Bf 110 had witnessed the action and attempted to engage Braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also. Its pilot, Feldwebel Heinz Vinke was the only member of his crew to survive. Braham considered shooting at one crew member, likely Vinke, who he had seen parachute out of the aircraft, but Bill Gregory persuaded him not to. Braham's Beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from the last victim. Braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and the resulting disintegration of the Messerschmitt hurled debris at the closely following Beaufighter. One reason for firing at close-range was Braham's high state of fatigue. In such a state Braham <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> keep his eyes open. Whenever he peered ahead they smarted and misted.|$|E
25|$|Without Soviet {{deliveries}} {{of these}} four major items, Germany <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> have attacked the Soviet Union, let alone come close to victory, even with more intense rationing.|$|E

50|$|Kalisto Ltd. {{is a short}} lived co-venture {{between the}} {{directors}} of Siriol Animation and Booker Group. Launched in 1986, the company has developed a show called Space Baby (which eventually became Fantastic Max), along with another series called Satellite City (co-produced with Fairwater Films) and the 1991 animated film The Little Engine That <b>Could.</b> Kalisto <b>barely</b> lasted a year before Booker bought the rights back.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} was mixed. Gene Seymour of Newsday commented, [...] "The new giant screen {{contribution to}} the stallion's legend is a 45-minute story, which, at best, plays as if it <b>could</b> have <b>barely</b> passed muster as an installment of the old 1960s Disney TV series, The Wonderful World of Color." [...] Megan Lehmann of the New York Post stated, [...] "A visual treat diminished by lifeless dialogue and self-conscious acting." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{had caught}} a Tartar. They dared {{not let her}} go, and though Jones evidently ordered it, no one made fast his rope to a tree. There was no opportunity. She {{was in the air}} three parts of the time and the fourth she was {{invisible}} for dust. The lassos were each thirty feet long, but even with that the men <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> keep out of her reach.|$|R
25|$|However, Australia {{struggled}} {{and managed}} 268 {{only after the}} last three wickets put on more than 100. India dominated {{for the rest of}} this match and Australia <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> keep up in this record-setting match.|$|E
25|$|Without Soviet {{deliveries}} {{of these}} four major items, Germany <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> have attacked the Soviet Union, let alone come close to victory, even with more intense rationing. At {{the time of the}} invasion, the Lützow was still not yet complete enough for sea travel, but four 20.3cm turrets had been installed. The Soviets used her as a floating gun battery against German invaders.|$|E
25|$|On December 4, 1957, Barker began {{hosting a}} new Ralph Edwards creation, the {{short-lived}} End of the Rainbow for NBC. On this show (similar to Barker's Truth or Consequences and Edwards' This Is Your Life), he and co-host Art Baker {{went out to}} various places in America and surprised the less-fortunate who helped others when they <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> help themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Louis {{had earlier}} been engaged to Sibylle's elder sister Sidonie, but Sidonie had died before she <b>could</b> marry, <b>barely</b> 17 years old. [...] The {{marriage}} was {{the starting point}} of the relaxation of the relations between Bavaria and the Palatinate, which were severely impacted by the Landshut War of Succession. [...] Relationships between the Palatinate and Emperor Maximilian I, who was Sibylle's uncle, also improved and Louis came closer politically to the Contra League.|$|R
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{ruled that}} Sullenberger made the correct {{decision}} in {{landing on the}} river instead of attempting return to LaGuardia because the normal procedures for engine loss are designed for cruising altitudes, not immediately after takeoff. Simulations showed that Flight 1549 <b>could</b> have <b>barely</b> {{made it back to}} LaGuardia had that maneuver begun immediately after the bird strike, but this scenario completely neglects the time needed to understand what had happened and assess the situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{there are}} {{millions}} in oil! I know that!" [...] burst out Martha. [...] "Why, I was reading in a magazine only the other day of some folks in Texas who were quite poor.

Then the oil prospectors came along and located a well or two, and now those poor farm people have so much money they don't {{know what to do with}} it." ...|$|R
25|$|Parker {{made his}} last public {{appearances}} in 1994. By this point, {{he was a}} sick man who <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> leave his own house. On January 20, 1997, Parker's wife heard a crashing sound from the living room, and when she heard no response to her calls, she went in to find him slumped over in his chair. He had suffered a stroke.|$|E
25|$|Upon her rescue Sano {{was found}} to be healthy, {{although}} extremely thin and weak due to lack of exercise: she <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> walk. She was also dehydrated. Due to the lack of exposure to sunlight, she also had a very light skin tone and suffered from jaundice. While her body was that of a 19-year-old woman, mentally she acted like a child. She also suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|Early pantomimes were {{performed}} as mimes accompanied by music, but as Music hall became popular, Grimaldi introduced the pantomime dame to the theatre and {{was responsible for}} the tradition of audience singing. By 1821 dance and clowning had taken such a physical toll on Grimaldi that he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> walk, and he retired from the theatre. By 1828, he was penniless, and Covent Garden held a benefit concert for him.|$|E
50|$|The Buffalo Bill Gun was {{the most}} popular toy the company had {{produced}} to date. Appearing in 1884, it was immediately sold out and the Company could not keep up with the re-orders. Company space was enlarged for this high demand of Buffalo Bill Guns, yet the production <b>could</b> still <b>barely</b> keep up with the demand. The expansion of the factory allowed the Company to produce other products {{that would not have been}} possible before expansion, such as the lawn game Enchantment, Pitch-a-Ring, Ring Toss, or Jackstraws.|$|R
60|$|Thomas forgot {{he was an}} elder, and {{he brought}} the ladder as quick as it was {{possible}} for a fat man to do it. After all it was too short to reach the window, but {{there was no time to}} go for another. Stephen went up to the top of it, and he reached up and Prissy reached down, and they <b>could</b> just <b>barely</b> clasp hands so. I shall never forget the look of Prissy. The window was so small she could only get her head and one arm out of it. Besides, she was almost frightened to death.|$|R

From such small causes do these valuable considerations flow! ...|$|R
