40|$|Sensitization of the {{responses}} of dorsal horn neurons to mechanical stimulation {{may play a role}} in the generation of hyperalgesia. lntradermal injection of capsaicin (CAP) provides a model of experimental hyperalgesia that possesses a component of allodynia. This hyperalgesia is produced by chemical stimulation of C-fibers, leading to sensitization of dorsal horn neurons, including spinothalamic tract (STT) cells. The changes in the physiological responses of STT neurons following intradermal <b>CAP</b> in <b>monkeys</b> parallel the acute pain and hyperalgesia produced by intradermal CAP in humans. The present study addresses the role that excitatory amino acids (EAAs) may play in the sensitization of STT neurons by intradermal CAP.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{behavior}} of the black <b>capped</b> capuchin <b>monkey,</b> Cebus apella, using tools to break seeds of Syagrus romanzoffianum in search of coleoptera larvae that live inside. The study area was the Parque Municipal Arthur Thomas (85, 47 ha) located in the city of Londrina, Paraná state. In one year of study, using the ad libitum method, the monkeys were observed using rocks pretty much {{in the same way as}} if they were hammer and anvil. Individuais of both sexes including adults, subadults and juveniles with more than two years of age, were involved in such activity. The behavior of the animais consisted of they place the seeds on a large rock in the ground, and using a smaller rock which was hold among the hands, the seeds were beaten repeatedly until breaking. Then they ate the larvae and/or endosperm. The use of tools is thought to have brought benefits to the animais by allowing the access to a source of food that would not normally be used...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Data from a 15 -month {{field study}} of the <b>capped</b> langur <b>monkey,</b> Presbytis pileata, in Bangladesh {{indicate}} that allomothering behavior is restricted to par-ticular female-infant dyads. Primary allomothers were all parous adult females; nulliparous females rarely allo-mothered, Newborn infants were transferred from the mother to other females {{within a short time}} of birth, as reported for some other colobine species, but over the first 3 months of life each neonate's contact with nonmothers was largely restricted to a single allomother in each of five study groups. Capped langur mothers with newborn infants spent more time feeding when the infant was being allomothered than when it was in the mother's care. The model of allomothering as a selfish behavior by nulliparous or pregnant females used to en-hance maternal skills at the expense of mothers is not supported by this study. Rather, allomothering may have adaptive significance as altruistic behavior among group females, in that it enables lactating females to increase feeding time. Capped langur allomothering is best interpreted as a low-cost behavior that can benefit recipients {{that may or may not}} be related...|$|R

50|$|After {{completing}} naval training, a bear cub, a monkey, a pheasant, and a puppy {{say goodbye}} to their families. While they are preoccupied, the monkey's younger brother falls into a river while chasing the <b>monkey's</b> <b>cap</b> and is carried towards a waterfall. The dog and the monkey work together to save the child just before he is swept downstream. A time skip occurs and Japanese forces are seen clearing a forest and constructing an air base in a Pacific island {{with the help of}} the jungle animals. A plane lands in the airstrip and from inside emerges Momotaro, depicted as a General, together with the bear, monkey, dog and pheasant, who by this point have become high-ranking officials. The subsequent scenes show the jungle animals being taught the alphabet via singing, washing clothes, given military training, and loading weapons in warplanes. The animal residents of the island are shown as simple primitives who are star struck by the glamorous and advanced Japanese animals.|$|R

30|$|A male {{rhesus monkey}} (Macaca mulatta, {{weighing}} 6 – 7  kg) {{was used for}} a comparative PET analysis of [11 C]TASP 0410457 and [11 C]TASP 0434988. PET scans were performed using a high-resolution SHR- 7700 animal PET camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). Following transmission scans for attenuation correction using a 68 Ge- 68 Ga point source, emission scans were performed on a conscious monkey as described previously [27], in 3 D acquisition mode (frames: 10  s[*]×[*] 12, 30  s[*]×[*] 6, 1  min[*]×[*] 5, 2  min[*]×[*] 5 and 5  min[*]×[*] 14) for 90  min after the intravenous injection of [11 C]TASP 0410457 (169 – 176  MBq) or [11 C]TASP 0434988 (173 – 188  MBq). Briefly, the monkey was immobilized by joining the acrylic <b>cap</b> on the <b>monkey</b> head with the fixation device during PET scans. To assess a homologous competition for the target binding sites, unlabeled TASP 0410457 or TASP 0434988 was injected intravenously at a dose of 1  mg/kg at 30  s before injection of the corresponding radioligand.|$|R
40|$|To {{selectively}} modulate human complement {{alternative pathway}} (CAP) activity implicated {{in a wide}} range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions and to provide local cell surface and tissue-based inhibition of complement-induced damage, we developed TT 30, a novel therapeutic fusion protein linking the human complement receptor type 2 (CR 2 /CD 21) C 3 fragment (C 3 frag = iC 3 b, C 3 dg, C 3 d) -binding domain with the CAP inhibitory domain of human factor H (fH). TT 30 efficiently blocks ex vivo CAP-dependent C 3 frag accumulation on activated surfaces, membrane attack complex (MAC) formation and hemolysis of RBCs in a CR 2 -dependent manner, and with a ∼ 150 -fold potency gain over fH, without interference of C 3 activation or MAC formation through the classic and lectin pathways. TT 30 protects RBCs from hemolysis and remains bound and detectable for at least 24 hours. TT 30 selectively inhibits <b>CAP</b> in cynomolgus <b>monkeys</b> and is bioavailable after subcutaneous injection. Using a unique combination of targeting and effector domains, TT 30 controls cell surface CAP activation and has substantial potential utility for the treatment of human CAP-mediated diseases...|$|R
40|$|High-density scalp EEG {{recordings}} {{are widely}} used to study whole-brain neuronal networks in humans non-invasively. Here, we validate EEG mapping of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) in macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) for the long-term investigation of large-scale neuronal networks and their reorganisation after lesions requiring a craniotomy. SSEPs were acquired from 33 scalp electrodes in five adult anaesthetized animals after electrical median or tibial nerve stimulation. SSEP scalp potential maps were identified by cluster analysis and identified in individual recordings. A distributed, linear inverse solution was used to estimate the intracortical sources of the scalp potentials. SSEPs were characterised by a sequence of components with unique scalp topographies. Source analysis confirmed that median nerve SSEP component maps {{were in accordance with}} the somatotopic organisation of the sensorimotor cortex. Most importantly, SSEP recordings were stable both intra- and interindividually. We aim to apply this method to the study of recovery and reorganisation of large-scale neuronal networks following a focal cortical lesion requiring a craniotomy. As a prerequisite, the present study demonstrated that a 300 -mm 2 unilateral craniotomy over the sensorimotor cortex necessary to induce a cortical lesion, followed by bone flap repositioning, suture and gap plugging with calcium phosphate cement, did not induce major distortions of the SSEPs. In conclusion, SSEPs can be successfully and reproducibly recorded from high-density EEG <b>caps</b> in macaque <b>monkeys</b> before and after a craniotomy, opening new possibilities for the long-term follow-up of the cortical reorganisation of large-scale networks in macaque monkeys after a cortical lesion...|$|R
