40|$|In recent years, {{changes in}} women's lifestyles, and {{a decline in}} {{recreation}} goods price due to technological progress have been observed in Japan. In this paper, we use Japanese household micro data and examine the effect of recreation goods price on <b>child</b> <b>birth</b> in Japan. We find that the decrease in the price of recreation goods contributes to the decline in <b>child</b> <b>birth.</b> Traditionally, research studies focused mainly on relationships between <b>child</b> <b>birth</b> and women’s wage, women’s labor supply and educational spending, but we show here that leisure is also an important factor affecting <b>child</b> <b>birth,</b> along with these factors. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: In Gujarat, India, a state led public private {{partnership}} {{scheme to}} promote facility birth named Chiranjeevi Yojana (CY) was implemented in 2005. Institutional birth is provided free of cost at accredited private health facilities to women from socially disadvantaged groups (eligible women). CY has contributed in increasing facility birth and providing substantially subsidized (but not totally free) birth care; however, {{the retention of}} mothers in this scheme in subsequent <b>child</b> <b>birth</b> is unknown. Therefore, we conducted a study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of previous utilization of the scheme and previous out of pocket expenditure on subsequent <b>child</b> <b>birth</b> among multiparous eligible women in Gujarat. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of multiparous eligible women (after excluding abortions and births at public facility). A structured questionnaire was administered by trained research assistant to those with recent delivery between Jan and Jul 2013. Outcome of interest was CY utilization in subsequent <b>child</b> <b>birth</b> (Jan–Jul 2013). Explanatory variables included socio-demographic characteristics (including category of eligibility), pregnancy related characteristics in previous <b>child</b> <b>birth,</b> before Jan 2013, (including CY utilization, out of pocket expenditure) and type of <b>child</b> <b>birth</b> in subsequent birth. A poisson regression model was used to assess the association of factors with CY utilization in subsequent <b>child</b> <b>birth.</b> Results: Of 997 multiparous eligible women, 289 (29 %) utilized and 708 (71 %) did not utilize CY in their previous <b>child</b> <b>birth.</b> Of those who utilized CY (n = 289), 182 (63 %) subsequently utilized CY and 33 (11 %) gave birth at home; whereas those who did not utilize CY (n = 708) had four times higher risk (40 % vs. 11 %) of subsequent <b>child</b> <b>birth</b> at home. In multivariable models, previous utilization of the scheme was significantly associated with subsequent utilization (adjusted Relative Risk (aRR) : 2. 7; 95 % CI: 2. 2 – 3. 3), however previous out of pocket expenditure was not found to be associated with retention in the CY scheme. Conclusion: Women with previous CY utilization were largely retained; therefore, steps to increase uptake of CY are expected to increase retention of mothers within CY in their subsequent <b>child</b> <b>birth.</b> To understand the reasons for subsequent <b>child</b> <b>birth</b> at home despite previous CY utilization and previous zero/minimal out of pocket expenditure, future research in the form of systematic qualitative enquiry is recommended...|$|R
