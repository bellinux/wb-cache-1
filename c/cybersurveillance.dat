40|$|The {{implementation}} of a universal digitalized biometric ID system risks normalizing and integrating mass <b>cybersurveillance</b> into {{the daily lives of}} ordinary citizens. ID documents such as driver’s licenses in some states and all U. S. passports are now implanted with radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. In recent proposals, Congress has considered implementing a digitalized biometric identification card—such as a biometric-based, “high-tech” Social Security Card—which may eventually lead {{to the development of a}} universal multimodal biometric database (e. g., the collection of the digital photos, fingerprints, iris scans, and/or DNA of all citizens and noncitizens). Such “hightech” IDs, once merged with GPS-RFID tracking technology, would facilitate exponentially a convergence of cybersurveillance-body tracking and data surveillance, or dataveillance-biographical tracking. Yet, the existing Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is tethered to a “reasonable expectation of privacy” test that does not appear to restrain the comprehensive, suspicionless amassing of databases that concern the biometric data, movements, activities, and other personally identifiable information of individuals. In this Article, I initiate a project to explore the constitutional and other legal consequences of big data <b>cybersurveillance</b> generally and mass biometric dataveillance in particular. This Article focuses on how biometric data is increasingly incorporated into identity management systems through bureaucratized <b>cybersurveillance</b> or the normalization of <b>cybersurveillance</b> through the daily course of business and integrated forms of governance...|$|E

Government surveillance has been magnified by <b>cybersurveillance</b> in the Digital Age to a degree unimaginable by the Founders of the United States of America...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{highlights}} some of {{the critical}} distinctions between small data surveillance and big data <b>cybersurveillance</b> as methods of intelligence gathering. Specifically, in the intelligence context, it appears that “collect-it-all” tools in a big data world can now potentially facilitate the construction, by the intelligence community, of other individuals 2 ̆ 7 digital avatars. The digital avatar {{can be understood as}} a virtual representation of our digital selves and may serve as a potential proxy for an actual person. This construction may be enabled through processes such as the data fusion of biometric and biographic data, or the digital data fusion of the 24 / 7 surveillance of the body and the 360 ° surveillance of the biography. Further, data science logic and reasoning, and big data policy rationales, appear to be driving the expansion of these emerging methods. Consequently, I suggest that an inquiry into the scientific validity of the data science that informs big data <b>cybersurveillance</b> and mass dataveillance is appropriate. As a topic of academic inquiry, thus, I argue in favor of a science-driven approach to the interrogation of rapidly evolving bulk metadata and mass data surveillance methods that increasingly rely upon data science and big data 2 ̆ 7 s algorithmic, analytic, and integrative tools. In Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Supreme Court required scientific validity determinations prior to the introduction of scientific expert testimony or evidence at trial. I conclude that to the extent that covert intelligence gathering relies upon data science, a Daubert-type inquiry is helpful in conceptualizing the proper analytical structure necessary for the assessment and oversight of these emerging mass surveillance methods...|$|E
