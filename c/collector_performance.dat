40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} thickness of glazing material {{on the performance of}} flat plate solar <b>collectors.</b> <b>Performance</b> of solar <b>collector</b> is affected by glaze transmittance, absorptance, and reflectance which results into major heat losses in the system. Four solar collector models with different glass thicknesses were designed, constructed, and experimentally tested for their <b>performances.</b> <b>Collectors</b> were both oriented to northsouth direction and tilted to an angle of 10 ° with the ground toward north direction. The area of each collector model was 0. 72 [*]m 2 with a depth of 0. 15 [*]m. Low iron (extra clear) glass of thicknesses 3 [*]mm, 4 [*]mm, 5 [*]mm, and 6 [*]mm was used as glazing materials.

40|$|Summary The {{collection}} of rainwater from roofs, its storage and subsequent use {{make a significant}} saving {{in the use of}} potable water. The capacity of the rainwater store is important because it affects both system and initial costs. This paper describes the development of a behavioural model that simulates the performance of rainwater collectors located within the United Kingdom. The input data in time series form are used to simulate mass flows through the model based on a daily time interval. Rainfall time series from 11 different UK locations are used to simulate the performance of rainwater collectors for a range of roof areas, storage capacities and demands. A set of rainwater <b>collector</b> <b>performance</b> curves for each of the geographic locations is developed. From the location-specific curves a set of average curves is determined that is shown to be sufficiently accurate for estimating rainwater collection performance within the United Kingdom.
