40|$|The {{growth and}} {{popularity}} of <b>polar</b> <b>cruise</b> tourism in the Arctic region have raised {{expectations about the}} opportunities {{in this part of}} the world. However, the existing academic literature has never ventured further than to recall these expectations and opportunities, which means that there is hardly any insight into what is actually happening in Russian Arctic cruise tourism. This paper aims to provide a practicebased perspective with a special focus on performed and integrated practices in the production of cruise tourism along the Russian Barents Sea coast. Semi-structured interviews with key actors involved in the production of cruise tourism serve as the main source of information along with observations made during fieldwork in the Arkhangelsk region. Cruise tourism practices are facing a number of challenges in their reproduction and lack both consistency and regularity. The practice-based perspective helps to reveal how groups of actors collectively produce activities and itineraries for cruise tourists despite the structural constraints. Moreover, the paper shows how local private entrepreneurs are actively trying to configure and connect the constituting cruise tourism practices...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{expanding}} {{activities in}} remote, cold environments such as resource {{development in the}} Arctic and new <b>polar</b> <b>cruise</b> routes, measurement of the thermal protection of garments and shelters is becoming critical {{to ensure the safety}} of crews and passengers in extreme conditions. Thermal manikins offer an alternative to the ethics of human subject testing; however, some manikin results have disagreed in a recent round-robin test. The source of the inconsistency between manikins could be methodological or calibration. Inconsistent measurements dilute the argument for using manikins in place of human subjects. Since manikins are not mass-produced and a variety of designs are in use, a calibration tool is needed to make manikin data credible and prove equivalence to human subject testing. Calibration by means of a standard clothing set can demonstrate consistency among manikins but not absolute accuracy. To facilitate the calibration of manikins in many locations, there is need for a portable calibration system. The objective of this work is to develop a portable air calorimeter to test thermal manikins in their native environment (i. e. local control chambers, methods and equipment) with a theoretical accuracy of close to 1...|$|R
40|$|In June 2001, {{the first}} AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop {{was held to}} {{evaluate}} results obtained from extensive N-Version testing {{of a series of}} RANS CFD codes.

The cases reported include the design <b>cruise</b> point, drag <b>polars</b> at eight Mach numbers, and drag rise at three values of lift. Although comparisons of the code-to-code medians with available experimental data were similar to those obtained in previous studies, the code-to-code scatter was more than an order-of-magnitude larger than expected and far larger than desired for design and for experimental validation. The second Drag Prediction Workshop was held in June 2003 with emphasis on the determination of installed pylon-nacelle drag increments and on grid refinement studies. The geometry used was the DLR-F 6 wing-body-pylon-nacelle combination for which the design cruise point and the cases run were similar to the first workshop except for additional runs on coarse and fine grids to complement the runs on medium grids. The code-to-code scatter was significantly reduced for the wing-body configuration compared to the first workshop, although still much larger than desired.

40|$|Many {{academics}} {{claim that}} expedition <b>cruises</b> to the <b>Polar</b> Regions are an emerging market. However, such cruises have frequently visited the Antarctic {{since the early}} 1990 ’s and even earlier in the Arctic, such as the first expedition in 1984 to the territory of Nunavut in the Canadian Arctic. This paper will examine {{some of the issues}} and implications that cruise tourism has for protected areas (particularly national parks) that are accessible to expedition cruises throughout the Canadian Arctic. Protected areas contribute to creating a sustainable industry through both their conservation of the landscape, but also in acting as a key attraction and thus economic driver for nearby communities. However, protected areas also rely on a sustainable tourism industry. This paper will utilize empirical data from two studies (2007 and 2009) that examined cruise visitors to Auyuittuq, Sirmilik and Quttinirpaaq National Parks in Nunavut and Torngat Mountains National Park in Nunatsiavut (Northern Labrador), and visitor management of such. In addition, first hand personal experience and knowledge from professional colleagues will be used to underpin survey results. Socio-economic changes, such as the downturn in the global economy effecting demand, occurring in line with environmental changes, such as climate change have significant effects on the Arctic landscape and wildlife. Thus, many levels of government management for these protected areas need to make changes in order to adapt. Cruise tourism in this region is globally connected to other regions and examination of this will also occur...|$|R
40|$|Marine glacial environments contain unique {{seafloor}} features {{resulting from}} the dynamic glacial processes. Studying these submarine geomorphological features can {{help us understand the}} glacial paleo-environments so that we can predict the likely responses of present day glaciers and ice sheets to future changes in the climate. This thesis details different approaches in understanding glacial seafloor features using acoustic systems. It focuses on the novel technique of automated mapping seafloor properties using the backscatter intensity collected by acoustic multibeam echosounder systems (MBES). The aim of this thesis is to assess the potential of this unexploited data source in characterizing different glacial landforms in the polar oceans. This is done by examining the voluminous backscatter data collected by Swedish icebreaker Oden from different <b>cruises</b> to the <b>polar</b> oceans and employing an automated backscatter processing technique, the ARA algorithm, to extract surficial sediment characteristics. The results from the sediment characterization are used together with outputs from other marine acoustical systems and sediment core data to understand formational processes of the glacial submarine features. Operational issues encountered in using this technology and its viability as a tool in characterization of glacial seafloor features are discussed and suggestions are given on the improvements needed to effectively implement the method in future studies. The final part of the manuscript is a paper, published in Geo-marine Letters, where I and my co-authors show a practical application of the acoustic systems ability to characterize geomorphological features of a mass-wasting event in the deepest part of the Arctic, the Molloy Hole. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{key element}} in the Dragon program is the {{utilization}} of remote sensing technologies for geo- and bio-scientific research. Considering the vast extent of the Polar Regions and the difficulties to access those, it is immediately clear that in particular the use of data from Earth Observing (EO) satellites is essential for monitoring ice sheets, ice shelves and sea ice. Recent studies on sea ice focus both on aspects regarding the interaction mechanisms between ocean, ice and atmosphere and their implications for weather and climate, and on information retrieval about ice mechanics and ice conditions for supporting marine traffic and offshore operations. During the Dragon- 2 and 3 phases, researchers from the First Institute of Oceanography, Qingdao, China, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the Danish Meteorological Institute, and the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany have successfully established a close information exchange with respect to sea ice classification and ice parameter retrieval. Direct collaboration projects were focused on ice thickness retrieval using polarimetric SAR data from the Bohai Sea, and the possibility to estimate ice thickness in the Arctic based on compact satellite radar polarimetry. The PIs Ji, Zhang, and Dierking {{as well as the}} other members of the Dragon sea ice team have been involved in various external collaborative projects, which have been positively influencing their work in the Dragon program. The objective of this presentation is to give an overview about important European projects and studies that were carried out during the Dragon- 3 phase and are of importance for future activities in the Dragon- 4 program. Here, we focus on sea ice classification and drift retrieval using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The separation of different ice types is needed for marine operations (mainly thin, smooth ice separated from thicker compacted ice) and for scientific process studies regarding, for example, heat exchange between ocean and atmosphere through the ice, or exchange of momentum between ice, on the one hand, and atmosphere and ocean, on the other hand. The major step in sea ice classification is to sub-divide sea ice SAR images into distinct regions based on similarities of parameters derived from the radar signal(s), and relate those regions to existing sea ice classification schemes. A special case is the separation of open water and ice for the determination of ice concentration. In this context, different research groups study different statistical models to adequately describe the distribution of radar parameter values typical for single ice types. Besides multi-polarization imagery, acquired with polarimetric SAR, multi-frequency data sets (that require combined acquisitions from SAR systems on different satellites) are in the focus of recent investigations in European groups. In order to improve the reliability of the classification and the retrieval of ice parameters, more advanced models for describing the multivariate dependencies are needed. The ultimate goal of these investigations is to make the whole classification process automatic, reliable and robust. Classification during the melting season, which is hampered by moist or wet snow layers and ice surfaces, and by melt ponds on the ice, is an important topic as well. The direct validation of sea ice maps and parameter retrievals is difficult because of the logistic difficulties to obtain the needed complementary data. The European sea ice remote sensing group hence closely collaborate with field researchers or participate themselves in field <b>cruises</b> to the <b>Polar</b> Regions. The retrieval of sea ice thickness from remote sensing data is one of the holy grails of polar research. European partners are developing and demonstrating the regional mapping of sea ice thickness based on multi-sensor satellite data (e. g. Sentinel- 1 SAR combined with AMSR 2) and parallel thickness simulations of a sea ice model (CMEMS Topaz). Thin ice (< 30 cm) areas are detected using AMSR 2 data and are excluded to reduce ice classification ambiguities in SAR images. Also areas with ice concentrations less than 70...|$|R
