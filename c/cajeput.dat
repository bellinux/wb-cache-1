It is a mangrove specialist, an adaptation that probably occurred as northern Australia became more arid and the bird populations became dependent on mangroves as other types of forest disappeared. The mangroves provide nectar and insects as well as shelter and nesting sites, and they supply the majority of the species' needs for most of the year. In Australia, mangrove vegetation forms a narrow discontinuous strip along thousands of kilometres of coastline, accommodating birds specialized for the habitat. Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia has no mangroves and no fringing Melaleuca forests, reducing its potential for successful colonization by nectarivores, and it marks the southern limit of the red-headed myzomela in Western Australia.|$|E
500|$|The brown honeyeater feeds {{mainly in}} the foliage and flowers in the canopy of trees and shrubs, though it does use {{all levels of the}} habitat {{including}} the ground. It feeds singly and in pairs, but will gather in small groups or in mixed-species feeding flocks with other honeyeaters, such as banded, yellow-tinted, black-chinned and rufous-throated. Observations of foraging birds record the brown honeyeater feeding primarily on nectar, and taking some insects. Main sources of nectar include flowering mistletoe and mangroves, bloodwood, woollybutt, [...] <b>cajeput,</b> and Banksia and Grevillea species. Nectar is primarily taken from flowers with cups of stamens, brush-shaped inflorescences, or tubular flowers. The brown honeyeater will hover above small flowers while extracting nectar, perch on a stem for large single flowers, and, in the case of Banksia flowers, perch on unopened florets {{at the top of the}} inflorescence.|$|E
60|$|About a mile {{behind and}} {{to the east of}} the village the hills commence, but they are very barren, being covered with scanty coarse grass and {{scattered}} trees of the Melaleuca cajuputi, from the leaves of which the celebrated <b>cajeput</b> oil is made. Such districts are absolutely destitute of interest for the zoologist. A few miles further on rose higher mountains, apparently well covered with forest, but they were entirely uninhabited and trackless, and practically inaccessible to a traveller with limited time and means. It became evident, therefore, that I must leave Cajeli for some better collecting ground, and finding a man who was going a few miles eastward to a village on the coast where he said there were hills and forest, I sent my boy Ali with him to explore and report on the capabilities of the district. At the same time I arranged to go myself on a little excursion up a river which flows into the bay about five miles north of the town, to a village of the Alfuros, or indigenes, where I thought I might perhaps find a good collecting ground.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cajeput</b> {{trees are}} a source of <b>cajeput</b> oil in Southeast Asia, an {{essential}} oil that is extracted from the leaves and twigs of the tree. <b>Cajeput</b> oil is primarily used in aromatherapy as an expectorant, painkiller, antifungal oil and skin mite reducer. The oil is produced by steam distillation of the Melaleuca leucadendra and Melaleuca quinquenervia species. A similar essential oil known as tea tree oil is extracted from the species Melaleuca alternifolia, a native of Australia. Melaleuca pollen can be an allergen and tea tree oil may cause allergic reactions for some people. <b>Cajeput</b> trees grown in Australia are well known for having powerful therapeutic properties. Compared to other countries, Australia's <b>cajeput</b> contains high amounts of anti-infectious properties (cineol, pinene and others), and is a favorite among health professionals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cajeput</b> tree is {{a common}} name used for certain {{classification}} of tree that has a white spongy bark that is flexible and can easily flake off the trunk. The <b>Cajeput</b> tree is of the genus Melaleuca, native to Australia and is commonly known in North America as the Tea Tree. The name [...] "Cajeput tree" [...] is primarily used for the species M. cajuputi, M. leucadendra, M. linariifolia, M. viridiflora and M. quinquenervia. Other names for these trees are the paperbark tree, punk tree, or the white bottle brush tree. Similar subtropical trees from the eucalyptus family are evergreens with pointed leaves and white, red or green flowers. Aborigines of Australia often used the <b>cajeput</b> tree bark for shields, canoes, roofing material and timber.|$|E

Melafix is a stronger concentration and Bettafix is a lower concentration that makes it harder to overdose smaller fish, especially bettas. It is most commonly used to promote fin and tissue regrowth, but is also effective in treating other conditions, such as fin rot or velvet. The remedy is used mostly on betta fish.|$|E

Overall, Panter concluded the Karajarri lands offered '40,000 acres of splendidly grassed land,' while the natives were 'quiet' and 'friendly'. The area was one the Karajarri call pajalpi or 'spring country' given the richness of its spring waters and the lush growth of local plants there.|$|E

50|$|Whole, {{unbroken}} henna leaves {{will not}} stain the skin. Henna will not stain skin until the lawsone molecules are made available (released) from the henna leaf. Dried henna leaves will stain the skin {{if they are}} mashed into a paste. The lawsone will gradually migrate from the henna paste into the outer layer of the skin and bind to the proteins in it, creating a fast stain.Since {{it is difficult to}} form intricate patterns from coarse crushed leaves, henna is commonly traded as a powder made by drying, milling and sifting the leaves. The dry powder is mixed with {{one of a number of}} liquids, including water, lemon juice, or strong tea, and other ingredients, depending on the tradition. Many artists use sugar or molasses in the paste to improve consistency and keep it stuck to the skin better. The henna mix must rest for 1 to 48 hours before use, to release the lawsone from the leaf matter. The timing depends on the crop of henna being used. Essential oils with high levels of monoterpene alcohols, such as tea tree, <b>cajeput,</b> or lavender, will improve skin stain characteristics. Other essential oils, such as eucalyptus and clove, are also useful but are too irritating and should not be used on skin.The paste can be applied with many traditional and innovative tools, starting with a basic stick or twig. In Morocco, a syringe is common. In India, a plastic cone similar to those used to pipe icing onto cakes is used. In the Western world, a cone is common, as is a Jacquard bottle, which is otherwise used to paint silk fabric. A light stain may be achieved within minutes, but the longer the paste is left on the skin, the darker and longer lasting the stain will be, so it needs to be left on as long as possible. To prevent it from drying or falling off the skin, the paste is often sealed down by dabbing a sugar/lemon mix over the dried paste, or simply adding some form of sugar to the paste. After time the dry paste is simply brushed or scraped away.|$|E
