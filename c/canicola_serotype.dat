Na população canina estudada, a infecção leptospirótica sofreu influência sazonal. Verão (24, 2 %) e outono (24, 9 %) foram as estações do ano com maior número de soros reatores, em oposição à primavera (18, 3 %) e inverno (18, 3 %). Estas diferenças foram significantes, estatisticamente. Ô sorotipo canicola é o {{principal}} causador da leptospirose na população estudada (50, 7 %), seguido do icterohaemorrhagiae (25, 5 %); grippotyphosa (7, 8 %); pomona (6, 7 %) e ballum (4, 4 %). One thousand, {{four hundred}} and twenty-eight sera from stray dogs {{from the city of}} S. Paulo were examined using agglutination microscopic testing. Of the total of 1428 sera, 308 (21. 6 %) showed positive. Seasonal influence was observed in the leptospiral infection of the canine population studied in that the largest number of the reagent sera was verified in the summer (24. 2 %) and autumn (24. 9 %). In contrast, spring (18. 3 %) and winter (18. 3 %) prevalence levels were lower. These differences were considered significant from the statistical point of view. The <b>canicola</b> <b>serotype</b> was found to be the main cause of leptospirosis in the population examined (50. 7 %), followed by icterohaemorrhagiae (25. 5 %), grippetyphosa (7. 8 %), pomona (67 %), and ballum (4. 4 %) ...|$|E

40|$|V A c c I N E s {{prepared}} against Leptospira interrogans <b>serotypes</b> <b>canicola,</b> icterohaemorrhagiae and pomona {{are widely}} used for the immunisation of domesticated animals in the USA, and vaccines against serotypes hara’jo, grQpotyphosa and szwajizak are at present under consideration. Both initial licensing and periodic potency testing of licensed leptospiral vaccines in the USA depend upon testing in hamsters. Data related to the in-vitro preservation of leptospires has been published recently (Ellinghausen, 1973 a and 6). The present paper is concerned with <b>serotype</b> <b>canicola</b> and with matters of practical importance {{in relation to the}} propagation and testing of leptospiral vaccines. The scope of the experiments encompassed (1) investigation of the growth of virulent organisms in liquid, semisolid, and solid “ polysorbate media ”, or in the same media after certain nutrient constituents had been either omitted or replaced by others, (2) assess-ment of the effect of simplified semisolid media other than “ polysorbate media ” on growth and on the preservation of virulence, (3) antigenic stability in differen...|$|R
40|$|Sequential {{disruption}} of the sheath of avirulent leptospires of the <b>serotype</b> <b>canicola</b> with antibody and complement was monitored by electron microscopy. Loosening and separation of the sheath from the protoplasmic cylinder was observed as early as 2 min after exposure to complement. Virulent leptospires of this serotype were morphologically intact after 1 hr of exposure to antibody and complement. Similarly, treatment of leptospires of the serotype patoc with normal serum and complement severely damaged the sheath structure. Removal of the sheath of both serotypes permitted lysozyme {{to act on the}} wall of the protoplasmic cylinder. Thus, morphological evidence for the location of the mucopeptide-containing structure of these leptospires was obtained. Viable leptospires with intact sheaths were resistant to lysozyme alone. Sections and negatively stained preparations of sheaths of <b>serotypes</b> <b>canicola</b> and patoc revealed three dense layers with two intermediate light zones and an overall thickness of about 110 A. A periodicity of 40 A was observed in sheath fragments produced by complement. The 70 A wallmembrane complex of leptospires of both serotypes consisted of two dense layers with an intermediate light zone. Structures apparent after removal of the outer sheath included membranous bodies or mesosomes, axial filaments attached to terminal knobs at opposite ends of the cell, and electron-dense intracellular bodies...|$|R
40|$|An IgM- and IgG-specific ELISA {{was used}} to measure the {{antibody}} response stimulated in dogs by vaccination with a leptospiral bacterin containing chemically inactivated serotype icterohaemorrhagiae and <b>serotype</b> <b>canicola</b> leptospires. All dogs produced anti-leptospiral IgM and IgG. The IgM production was of the primary response type after each vaccination (primary vaccination, booster vaccination and annual revaccination). A substantial anti-leptospiral IgG response could be demonstrated only after the first booster vaccination and the annual revaccination. Annual revaccination resulted in a higher and much longer persisting IgG response than did the first booster vaccination. A revision of the vaccination scheme is suggested...|$|R

40|$|A {{saprophytic}} Leptospira biflexa {{strain of}} equine origin was found which cross-reacts with immune rabbit antisera to 14 pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serotypes. Sera from goats experimentally inoculated with the saprophyte showed multiple low-level cross-agglutination reactions against {{a battery of}} live L. interrogans serotypes. Sonically treated and saline-extracted suspensions of the L. biflexa strain and <b>serotypes</b> <b>canicola,</b> icterohaemorrhagiae, and pomona yielded a common precipitating protein antigen that was detected by immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis {{with all of the}} antileptospiral sera examined. In cross-absorption and gel diffusion tests, the precipitinogen from each of the strains was shown to be identical. Formaldehyde treatments and heating at 100 degree C suggest that the cellular location of the common antigen is either somatic or subsurface, and Sephadex G- 200 gel filtration enabled the isolation of the active fraction of the L. biflexa antigen. Monoprecipitin sera against the common antigen of L. biflexa were produced by immunizing rabbits with specific precipitates in agar. In gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis tests the antisera with each of the soluble antigens developed a single precipitin formation, and the antisera agglutinated formolized and heated whole-cell suspensions of <b>serotypes</b> <b>canicola,</b> icterohaemorrhagiae, and pomona at low dilutions. The soluble L. biflexa antigen was evaluated as an immunogen and in passive immunity tests for protection against death and kidney infection in hamsters. No cross-protection occurred when the hamsters were challenged with virulent leptospires. In contrast, the animals vaccinated or administered hamster immune serum before challenge died earlier than the control animals...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} {{and evaluation of}} an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect specific anti-leptospiral IgM and IgG in sera of dogs experimentally infected with Leptospira interrogans <b>serotype</b> <b>canicola</b> are reported. In all dogs specific anti-leptospiral IgM was detected from {{the second half of}} the first week after infection, the maximum being attained during the second week. Subsequently the IgM titre gradually decreased. Specific anti-leptospiral IgG was detected later and increased gradually to reach almost the same level as the IgM titre after two to three months. During the initial stage of the infection, when the microscopic agglutination titre was still negative or very low, a high IgM titre was accompanied by a negative or very low IgG titre in every case. After the initial stage a substantial IgG titre was also detectable. It is suggested that the test is suitable for serodiagnostic purposes, particularly for the diagnosis of a current infection in an individual...|$|R

Fulton and Spooner (1956) reported that the phospholipid fraction of blood serum supported the respiration of Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae. Ivler (1960) found that the oxygen consumption of one saprophytic strain of leptospira was increased {{by the addition of}} lecithin to the culture medium. Johnson and Wilson (1960) showed that a crude lecithin fraction of egg yolk supported good growth of the serotype pomona and could replace rabbit serum in culture media for leptospirae, and Mifuchi, Hosoi and Yanagihara (1961) found that the <b>serotypes</b> <b>canicola</b> and australis could grow in a medium that contained phospho-lipid fractions of an alcoholic extract of egg yolk instead of rabbit serum. Very {{little is known about the}} enzymatic degradation of phospholipids by leptospirae, though some findings have been reported by Addamiano and Papa (1966). Since they contain each of the major types of phospholipids, the lipo-proteins of blood serum are very suitable substrates for rase in investigations of the degradation of the phospholipids.

40|$|The {{potential}} leptospiral {{infection hazard}} {{in the use}} of vaccines prepared from canine kidney monolayer cultures was studied. Cell cultures were prepared from kidneys of dogs experimentally infected with Leptospira <b>serotype</b> <b>canicola.</b> Viable leptospires were found in kidney cell suspensions at the time of seeding, surviving trypsinization either at room temperature for approximately 2 hr or overnight at 4 C, even in the presence of antibiotics. In tissue cultures maintained without antibiotics, leptospires were cultured up to the time of involution of cells at 25 to 34 days of incubation. Cytopathogenic effects of leptospires on cultured kidney cells were not noted; neither was growth of leptospires remarkable. Generally, the leptospire culture titer decreased to 10 - 4 or 10 - 5 at the 4 th hr or 1 st day of incubation to 10 - 1 or negative by the 30 th or 34 th day of incubation. The addition of either a combination of penicillin (100 units per ml) plus streptomycin (100 μg/ml) or polymyxin B (50 units per ml) plus dihydrostreptomycin (100 μg/ml) to seeding cell suspensions resulted in the elimination of viable leptospires by the 4 th hr of incubation. From cell cultures treated with neomycin (100 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (100 μg/ml), leptospires were recovered, respectively, after 24 and 48 hr, but not thereafter. It was apparent that antibiotics, particularly the combination of polymyxin B and dihydrostreptomycin, could be effectively used to eliminate leptospires in tissue culture. Other antibiotics with known antileptospiral activities probably would be effective also. If antibiotics are not used in canine kidney tissue culture employed for viral vaccine preparations, rigid testing for the presence of leptospires in donor dogs and tissue-culture vaccine is indicated...|$|R
