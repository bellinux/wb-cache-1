40|$|Better {{soil for}} better food {{supplements}} Cue: A low input garden {{has so many}} advantages: less work and good yields, to name just two. But what you put into the soil can determine the quality of what {{you get out of}} the soil. Nitrogen-rich crops can feed the soil with nitrogen, which help following crops to grow stronger. Adding composted manure and other organic matter will feed the soil with minerals which the fruits and vegetables can absorb. Silundika AIDS Health Council is running a training programme in Zimbabwe to teach a community in the town of Bulawayo how to set up their own low input gardens. Ivy Sibanda is the project Director, and the enthusiast behind the work. And she took Busani Bafana on a walk through the plots to see the plants and meet the people who grow them. IN:	?What is the starting point? OUT:	?vegetables that I need. ? DUR?N:	 2 ? 48 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: From Zimbabwe that was farmer Elizabeth Thebe ending that report. Try and look for a use for everything in your garden ? that is her message. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Bafana	What is the starting point in the soil preparation for this low input garden? Sibanda	They do not need a lot of work. First of all you prepare your bed by digging, level your soil, make water pits where you can hold water so that it does not run away from the soil. Bafana	How can people who live with HIV and AIDS improve the content of the minerals and the vitamins in the soil they use to grow these vegetables? Sibanda	They can improve by crop rotation. Usually when you have ploughed some legumes in one bed the next time you put spinach on the other side, you put lets say carrots so that they rotate to improve the soil. Bafana	How then I want to find out what kind of manure can be used and why? Sibanda	Natural manure can be used. Bafana	So then do you mean to say that natural manure is healthy in a way that it is absorbed through the vegetables that are grown in that particular patch of land? Sibanda	Yes they are easily absorbed. Bafana	What low foods then can people living with HIV and AIDS be advised to grow? Sibanda	They can be advised to grow foods like beans, they are easily grown, they do not need much labour. Spinach for iron as their bodies really need a lot of iron, green vegetables, cabbage, the Chinese cabbage which takes a short time to ripen, like within three months they can reap and start again, to rotate again. Bafana	There are a number of your members who are here, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> some of your members to find out how they have benefited? Sibanda	Yes you can do. Bafana	Good afternoon to you. Please could you tell us your name? Thebe	My name is Elizabeth Thebe. Bafana	How is the training that you got in low input gardening helped improve the soil content of your garden? Thebe	This really has helped me because I used to take all the weeds from my garden, the leaves from my garden I used to throw them away and burn them but for now I am really keeping those because they are really helpful. I make all the compost, the compost that I get from my garden, the leaves from my trees that I do use them for the compost. All the weeds like the blackjacks, boil the blackjack, use it in my garden. Any of the soils in your yard must not be just lying there unused, you can use them. Now I see that I am making a lot of vegetables from my yard only, I cannot buy vegetables on the streets whatever. Whatever I grow, my pumpkins, I grow my spinach, carrots in that area that I live in. I learnt that that small space of mine can give me all the vegetables that I need.
