50|$|Harnesses also vary {{according}} to the need of the pilot, and thereby come in a range of designs, mostly: Training harness for beginners,Pax harness for tandem passengers that often also doubles as a training harness,XC Harness for long distance cross country flights,All round harness for basic to intermediate pilots,Pod harness, which is for intermediate to pro pilots that focus on XC.Acro harnesses are special designs for acrobatic pilots,Kids tandem harnesses are also now available with special <b>child-proof</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1957, Ford updated the Lifeguard safety {{package with}} a new frame that bowed out to {{completely}} enclose the passengers, rear <b>child-proof</b> door <b>locks,</b> a front hinged hood {{to protect against the}} hood flying up in the wind, and recessed knobs.|$|R
5000|$|Comparisons {{between the}} Victor and the broadly similar RÃ¼sselsheim built Opel Rekord Series D were inevitable. An {{important}} {{difference from the}} back seat involved the rear doors. The Opel's door incorporated rear quarter lights and windows that wound fully down into the door whereas Vauxhall's designers preferred the [...] "cleaner uncluttered look" [...] arising from their elimination of rear quarter lights. The fact that back seat passengers could only open their windows down to approximately a third of their depth before further opening was blocked by the presence of the wheel arches was held out as a safety feature to complement the fitting of <b>child-proof</b> <b>locks,</b> given that back-seat passengers would no doubt include small children. Despite the absence of shared body panels anywhere that they could be seen, detailed investigation disclosed that minor assemblies such as the door locks and the wiper mechanisms were shared with the Opel Rekord D.|$|R
25|$|Ford {{offered the}} Lifeguard safety package from 1956, which {{included}} such innovations {{as a standard}} deep-dish steering wheel, optional front, and, {{for the first time}} in a car, rear seatbelts, and an optional padded dash. Ford introduced <b>child-proof</b> door <b>locks</b> into its products in 1957, and, in the same year, offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car.|$|R
5000|$|The DLX has a vinyl interior, a two spoke {{steering}} wheel, a two-speaker radio/tape set-up {{and steel}} wheels with center ornaments. The GL grade has steel wheels with hubcaps, a four speaker radio/tape set-up and a fabric interior. The GLX, SR and LXV has a six speaker radio/tape set-up, fog lamps, alloy wheels, a rear wiper and all power amenities. Body graphics are exclusive to the SR and LXV only. The LXV had gold-trimmed badges. The SR has the word [...] "Sport Runner" [...] {{written in a}} font set {{similar to the one}} used for the Supra. It sold very well, in 1998 it accumulated a total sales of 7,700 units. Safety features were basic such as safety belts, load sensing proportioning valve, <b>child-proof</b> door <b>locks</b> and door impact beams.|$|R
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the era, the 1959 Galaxie was a chrome and {{stainless}} steel-bedecked vehicle with optional two-tone paint. It was the very image of the ostentatious late-1950s American automobiles, [...] though somewhat tamer than its Chevrolet and Plymouth competitors. Ford advertised [...] "safety anchorage" [...] for the front seats. The parking brake was now a pedal. Seat belts, a padded dashboard, and <b>child-proof</b> rear door <b>locks</b> were optional, while a deep-dished steering wheel and double-door locks were standard.|$|R
5000|$|The {{four-cylinder engine}} was {{promoted}} for its economy, but Pontiac also saved money {{because it could}} run the engine down the same assembly line as the 389. There were three versions of the engine: an 8.6:1, low compression, single-barrel carburetor; a 10.25:1 high-compression with single barrel; and a high-compression engine with a four-barrel carburetor. While the single-barrel version produced , the four-barrel was capable of [...] (SAE gross) at 4,800 rpm and [...] of torque at 2,800 rpm. All three versions had a fuel economy ranging from 18-22 mpg, and the engine was generally reliable though it {{had a reputation as}} the [...] "Hay Baler", a derogatory label applied by dealer mechanics (ostensibly from farm states) who experienced the violent kicks it could produce when out of tune. Popular Mechanics reported 21.3mpg at 60 mph. There were quite a few options, including air conditioning, transistor radios, windshield washers, a parking brake warning light, padded safety dash, <b>child-proof</b> door <b>locks,</b> and seat belts.|$|R
25|$|The Edsel {{offers several}} {{features}} that were considered innovative for the time, including its rolling-dome speedometer; warning lights for such conditions as low oil level, parking brake engaged, and engine overheating; and its push-button Teletouch transmission shifting {{system in the}} center of the steering wheel (a conventional column-shift automatic was also available at a reduced price). Other Edsel design innovations include ergonomically designed controls for the driver and self-adjusting brakes (which Ford claimed for the Edsel as a first for the industry, even though Studebaker had pioneered them earlier in the decade). The Edsel also offers such features, advanced for the time, as seat belts (which were available at extra cost as optional equipment on many other makes) and <b>child-proof</b> rear door <b>locks</b> that could only be unlocked with the key.|$|R
