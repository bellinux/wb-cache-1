5|$|On 24 November Allenby {{ordered the}} relief of the three {{divisions}} of the EEF's XXI Corps and Desert Mounted Corps. In order to move such large formations a pause was unavoidable and so the attack was discontinued, but von Falkenhayn and his Ottoman Army took notice of the temporary <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Graz agreement, {{negotiated}} by Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats aiming to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina in early May, proclaimed <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> {{between the two}} groups, heavy fighting broke out between the HVO and the VRS in June, in eastern Herzegovina (Operation Jackal), and in the Sava River basin (Operation Corridor 92), {{in the north of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 100,000 British and German {{troops were}} {{involved}} in the unofficial <b>cessations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> along the Western Front. The first truce started on Christmas Eve 1914, when German troops decorated the area around their trenches in the region of Ypres, Belgium and particularly in Saint-Yvon (called Saint-Yves, in Plugstreet/Ploegsteert – Comines-Warneton), where Capt. Bruce Bairnsfather described the truce.|$|R

5|$|Following the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> on 15 August 1945, the {{battalion}} undertook garrison duties on Nauru and Ocean Island. In this role they helped to maintain {{law and order}} and investigate war crimes, oversaw the transfer of over 4,000 Japanese prisoners of war to Bougainville and maintained a military administration until 1 November 1945 when civil control was re-established. A short time later, the detachment on Ocean Island was withdrawn back to Nauru.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{joined the}} New Zealand Expeditionary Force in 1915, having gained {{military}} experience while serving with the Territorial Force. He {{served on the}} Western Front from September 1916 to early 1918, and ended the war as a commissioned officer in England. He remained in the military after the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities,</b> and joined the New Zealand Staff Corps. He held staff and administrative positions in New Zealand and, while on an officer exchange program, British India.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities,</b> the Australian {{government}} {{decided that it}} would not contribute to the proposed Allied occupation force in Germany and would begin the process of demobilisation of the AIF as soon as possible. Owing to the large number of soldiers deployed overseas, this process took some time, and it was decided to progressively return men from each battalion, rather than send them home as a formed unit. As numbers dwindled, units were amalgamated for administrative purposes, and as a consequence the 9th and 10th Battalions were merged on 5 February 1919; the final contingent of troops from the 10th Battalion did not return home until September 1919 when they disembarked in Adelaide from the transport Takada.|$|E

50|$|These {{projects}} were not carried out. Claims {{were made on}} the Desmond estate by the Butlers, the hereditary enemies of the Geraldines. James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormonde had married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, daughter and heiress-general of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond. On Ormonde's death she proposed to marry Gerald FitzGerald, and eventually did so {{after the death of}} her second husband, Sir Francis Bryan. The effect of this marriage was a temporary <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> between the Desmonds and her son, Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to {{the announcement of the}} United Nations Partition Plan, Arab mobs stormed Mamilla Street on December 2, 1947, ransacking and setting fire to 40 Jewish-owned stores. Jewish merchants fled the area, which then came under heavy bombardment during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. With the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities,</b> the area became a no man's land dividing the Jordanian-occupied Old City from Jewish West Jerusalem, until a truce was signed in 1952. In the 1950s, poor Sephardic immigrant families and tradesmen took up occupancy in the derelict buildings, and workshops and auto-repair garages replaced the former stores.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century several changes took place, {{with the}} Ballroom {{becoming}} a cinema, until the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings became the owners in 1931. The building was restored by A Mowbray Green in 1938, with Oliver Messel as the interior designer. During the Bath Blitz of 25/26 April 1942, {{one of the}} retaliatory raids on England by the Baedeker Blitz following the RAF's raid on Lübeck, the Assembly Rooms were bombed and burnt out inside. After the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> in Europe, they were restored by Sir Albert Richardson, with work being completed in 1963. The ballroom ceiling had to be repaired after it collapsed in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after the}} <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> he was {{temporarily}} promoted to colonel, and was appointed Director of Education for the NZEF.

During {{the course of the}} war, Stewart had been mentioned in despatches five times. In May 1919 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, and his citation noted his leadership of his battalion and temporary command of 2nd Infantry Brigade as well as his educational work for the NZEF.|$|E

40|$|The Tamil {{insurgency}} in Sri Lanka {{is one of}} the longest running ethnic conflicts in recent years. The ethnic war involving the government forces and rebels, which lasted from 1983 to 2002, claimed some 64, 000 lives - most of them civilians. With peace talks held in earnest between the disputants it appears the two-decade long conflict may finally be over. <b>Cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility,</b> <b>of</b> course, poses even greater challenges - notably in post-conflict reconstruction. What should be the preferred mode of interaction between the Tamil rebels and the Sri Lankan state in the new changed environment? Do international actors {{have a role to play}} in post-conflict reconstruction? How do we address the deep-seated animosities existing between Tamils and Sinhalese? This article contends that post-conflict reconstruction is society and context specific. By using several interlinked variables, the article suggests that the best chance of putting the war-ravaged society on the road to recovery depends on addressing the recommendations contained within these variables...|$|R
6000|$|It {{ought to}} be known to all English boys {{that there is a}} terrible and costly war in which the British nation is at all times engaged. No {{intervals}} of peace mark the course <b>of</b> this war. <b>Cessations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> there are for brief periods, but no treaties of peace. [...] "War to the knife" [...] is its character. Quarter is neither given nor sought. Our foe is unfeeling, unrelenting. He wastes no time in diplomatic preliminaries; he scorns the courtesies of national life. No ambassadors are recalled, no declarations of war made. Like the Red Savage he steals upon us unawares, and, with a roar of wrathful fury, settles down to his deadly work.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, on the Western Front, the demoralised and {{depleted}} Indian Corps fought {{its final}} European battle at Loos. With {{the exception of}} two cavalry divisions, the Indian Corps in Europe redeployed to the Middle East theatre, sailing from Marseilles on 10 December 1915 and arriving in Basra on 8 January 1916 to {{be integrated into the}} Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force. Smith returned to active duty as a sergeant, serving in Mesopotamia and Palestine until the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> with the Ottoman Empire and Germany on 30 October and 11 November respectively. He had been wounded five times.|$|E
5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} with the Taliban were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election, although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed. The first session of talks, between committees appointed by the Pakistani Government and the Taliban, was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called {{for the implementation of}} Sharia in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities,</b> insisting that talks be held {{within the framework of the}} Pakistani constitution. A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{abortive}} Ivelchester and Langport Navigation scheme {{had sought}} to avoid the Great Bow Bridge by making the Portlake Rhine navigable, rebuilding Little Bow Bridge in the centre of Langport, and making a new cut to Bicknell's Bridge. Seven locks, each with a small rise, were planned, but the scheme foundered in 1797 due to financial difficulties. After the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> with France {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century, there was renewed interest in canal building in Somerset; the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was authorised in 1824, the Glastonbury Canal in 1827, and the Chard Canal in 1834.|$|E
25|$|These {{tensions}} spurred eight civil wars, {{interrupted by}} periods of relative calm, between 1562 and 1598.

5000|$|Moroccan {{forces had}} planned a second {{offensive}} on Tindouf and occupied positions about four kilometres from the settlement.

5|$|Following the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities,</b> No.2 OTU {{was reduced}} {{to the status of}} a care and {{maintenance}} unit, and Jeffrey's commission was terminated on 6June 1946. Having been transferred to the RAAF reserve upon his demobilisation, he sought readmission to the PAF in August the same year, without success. He then took up farming, purchasing a property on the Murray River. In April 1951 he again applied to rejoin the PAF and this time was granted a commission as a wing commander. Over the next two years he held training posts in Victoria, firstly at the RAAF Staff College, Point Cook, and in 1952 at Central Flying School, East Sale. The following year he became Deputy Director of Operations at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|In October 1936, rebel {{operations}} temporarily ceased {{after the}} Arab Higher Committee (AHC), the revolt's political leadership, accepted calls by the generally pro-British royals of Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia for a <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities.</b> In return, the Arab royals would lobby the British Mandatory authorities to address Palestinian Arab concerns about Zionist activity in Palestine. That month, al-Qawuqji left Palestine. Al-Hajj Muhammad followed suit {{and headed for}} Damascus to evade arrest; the British had placed a bounty of 500 pounds on him. While in Damascus, al-Hajj Muhammad raised funds and purchased weapons for the revolt. He also began working with Syrian and Lebanese nationalists to smuggle the arms into Palestine. Al-Hajj Muhammad later left Damascus for the Lebanese mountain village of Qarnayel east of Beirut. From there, he maintained regular communications with his forces.|$|E
5|$|McClellan was {{nominated}} by the Democrats {{to run against}} Abraham Lincoln in the 1864 U.S. presidential election. Following the example of Winfield Scott, he ran as a U.S. Army general still on active duty; he did not resign his commission until election day, November 8, 1864. McClellan supported continuation {{of the war and}} restoration of the Union (but not the abolition of slavery), but the party platform, written by Copperhead leader Clement Vallandigham of Ohio, was opposed to this position. The platform called for an immediate <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities</b> and a negotiated settlement with the Confederacy. McClellan was forced to repudiate the platform, which made his campaign inconsistent and difficult. He also was not helped by the party's choice for vice president, George H. Pendleton, a peace candidate from Ohio.|$|E
50|$|After Vanier, for his efforts, {{received}} the Military Cross in 1916, he continued {{fighting in the}} trenches. In late 1918, he led an attack at Chérisy and {{was shot in the}} chest and both legs, resulting in the loss of his right leg due to a shell blast. His recovery was lengthy, though he spent it in France, refusing to be evacuated while his fellow soldiers remained fighting. With the <b>cessations</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities,</b> however, Vanier, for his bravery, was again awarded the Military Cross and given the 1914-15 Star, along with being appointed to the Distinguished Service Order. He thereafter returned to Montreal and once more found employment practicing law. On 29 September 1921, he married Pauline Archer and the couple had five children, including Thérèse Vanier and Jean Vanier.|$|R
50|$|The slaughter, {{which had}} begun {{late in the}} evening the day before, {{continued}} until dawn the next day, when Nader sent out his officers and messengers proclaiming the end of the massacre. The swiftness of the Persian army's <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> was remarkable and many contemporary commentators stated their admiration for the strict discipline of Nader's army. Although the killing lasted only a few hours, the number of dead was immense. Some 30,000 men, women and children perished {{at the hands of the}} Persian soldiers. After the conclusion of this most unfortunate episode in Delhi's history, Nader's officials began collecting taxes and some were also sent out to Delhi's environs to do the same. Not even Muhammad Shah's ministers were safe, and one in particular was tortured and his wealth seized by force of arms.|$|R
50|$|A {{meeting of}} the Ivorian {{political}} leaders, moderated by South African President Thabo Mbeki was held in Pretoria from 3 to 6 April 2005.

Rebel forces started to withdraw heavy weapons from the front line on 21 April.|$|R
5|$|After the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities,</b> the {{battalion}} {{remained in the}} Aitape–Wewak area undertaking occupation duties. Its strength was slowly reduced as personnel were repatriated to Australia for demobilisation or transferred to other units for further service. Eventually, the remaining cadre of personnel returned to Australia, and on 8 February 1946 the 2/3rd Battalion disbanded in Brisbane, {{as one of the}} most decorated battalions of the 2nd AIF. They had fought all the major Axis powers: the Italians, Germans, Vichy French and Japanese. Alongside the Australian 2/5th Battalion, they were the only Allied troops able to make this claim. During its service a total of 3,303 men served with the 2/3rd Battalion of whom 203 were killed and 432 wounded. Members of the 2/3rd received four Distinguished Service Orders, 16 Military Crosses, 12 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 30 Military Medals, two British Empire Medals and 73 Mentions in Despatches.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{the brigade}} {{comprised}} the 1st, 2nd, 17th Parachute Battalions and the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance. The 3rd Parachute Battalion {{had left to}} join the 3rd Parachute Brigade, replacing the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, who had returned to Canada at the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities.</b> The 1st Airborne Division was disbanded in November 1945, and the brigade assigned to the 6th Airborne Division in Palestine. In 1946 the 17th Parachute Battalion amalgamated with the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion retaining {{the number of the}} senior unit. The brigade formation changed again in 1948. Further amalgamations and the general reduction in the post war British Army resulted in the brigade being formed from the 1st Parachute Battalion, the amalgamated 2nd/3rd Parachute Battalion and the amalgamated 8th/9th Parachute Battalion. By July 1948 the 6th Airborne Division had been withdrawn to England and disbanded, leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade as the only regular British Army parachute formation.|$|E
5|$|Among a small {{coterie of}} wartime RAAF commanders {{earmarked}} for further senior roles, McCauley retained his rank of air commodore following the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> <b>hostilities.</b> He served again as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1946–47. Promoted to air vice marshal, he was Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General Horace Robertson at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan from June 1947 to June 1949. In this post he was preceded and succeeded by two other Duntroon graduates, Air Vice Marshals Frank Bladin and Alan Charlesworth respectively. Upon {{his return to}} Australia, McCauley was made Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area. During the Malayan Emergency, he formed RAAF aircraft assigned for deployment into No.90 (Composite) Wing, as directed by Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal George Jones, {{to ensure that they}} would operate with a degree of autonomy rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied groups. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1951 Birthday Honours.|$|E

Essentially a complete cease-fire was put into force. The armistice is however only a cease-fire between military forces, rather than an agreement between governments. No peace treaty was signed which means that the Korean War has not officially ended.|$|R
50|$|After {{this last}} attempt to capture him, German and British colonial forces {{negotiated}} a ceasefire, granting an annual allowance {{for the rest}} of his life in return for the <b>cessation</b> <b>of</b> all <b>hostilities</b> from his side.
