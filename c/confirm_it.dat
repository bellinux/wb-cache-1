Oregon detectives suspected {{that they were}} Jolly and Hollar, but were unable to obtain interview time with Bundy to <b>confirm</b> <b>it.</b> Both women remain classified as missing.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought {{of the theory of}} evolution around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to <b>confirm</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emperor Frederick persuaded six of {{the seven}} Prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire to {{proclaim}} his son Maximilian King of the Romans on 16 February 1486. The Emperor, however, had failed to invite the King of Bohemiaeither Matthias or Vladislaus Jagiellonto the assembly. In an attempt to prevail on Vladislaus to protest, Matthias invited him to a personal meeting. Although they formed an alliance in Jihlava in September, the Estates of Bohemia refused to <b>confirm</b> <b>it</b> and Vladislaus recognized Maximilian's election.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} baseball event in Australia {{took place in}} Melbourne, Victoria in 1857, between teams from Collingwood and Richmond. Accounts vary as to the details, including {{whether it was a}} single game or a series of threegames, though details in common include a score of 350–230 in favour of Collingwood, and that the rules used were some form of hybrid between cricket and baseball, with teams batting until all players were out, and runs being scored for every base crossed, rather than just for reaching home plate. Though there are no records to <b>confirm</b> <b>it,</b> the commonly held belief is that baseball in Australia originated on the Ballarat gold-fields among American miners. The Claxton Shield, the first annually recurring national tournament, commenced in 1934. Though the tournament itself has been supplanted at various points in its history, the physical Shield is still awarded to the national champions in the Australian Baseball League. From 2011, the national champions will meet other champions from Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei in the Asia Series.|$|E
5|$|Public {{sentiment}} {{was against}} Rowan {{in the matter}} of his duel with Chambers. Soon after the duel, friends of Chambers formed a posse and rode toward Rowan's house. Rowan concocted a ruse whereby he dressed a family slave in his coat and hat and sent him riding from the house on horseback. The posse was fooled into thinking the slave was Rowan and gave chase, but the slave escaped and Rowan's life was spared as well. Days later, the owner of the land where the duel had taken place swore out a warrant for Rowan's arrest for murder. Some accounts hold that, as Commonwealth's Attorney, Rowan's friend Felix Grundy would have been responsible for prosecuting the case against Rowan and that Grundy resigned the position to avoid prosecuting his friend. Grundy's biographer, John Roderick Heller, admits that this was possible, although no evidence exists to <b>confirm</b> <b>it.</b> Heller also points out that Grundy was Commonwealth's Attorney not in Nelson County (the location of Bardstown), but in neighboring Washington County at the time. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss and Colonel William Allen served as counsel for Rowan. The judge opined that there was insufficient evidence to send the case to a grand jury, and Rowan was released.|$|E

The drug was tested in 18 monkeys infected with the deadly virus, and all the primates survived according to the researchers. MIL 77 closely resembles ZMapp.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of the {{syndrome}} is clinical {{since there are}} no laboratory tests to <b>confirm</b> <b>it.</b> For diagnosis a person with documented responsiveness to medication has to increase medication intake beyond dosage needed to relieve their parkinsonian symptoms in a pathological addiction-like pattern. A current mood disorder (depression, anxiety, hypomanic state or euphoria), behavioral disorder (excessive gambling, shopping or sexual tendency, aggression, or social isolation) or an altered perception about the effect of medication also have to be present. A questionnaire on the typical symptoms of DDS has also been developed and can help in the diagnosis process.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a Maine Forest Service {{employee}} {{found an}} ejection seat from the aircraft near an overgrown logging road while hunting.

A recovery team retrieved the mostly intact ejection seat. Researchers claim that it is most likely the pilot's seat and remarkably similar to the seat at the snowmobile clubhouse in Greenville. It is the third seat recovered from the crash and preserved for public viewing. The other is in a Bangor museum.|$|E

25|$|Sullenberger {{opened the}} cockpit door and ordered evacuation. The crew began {{evacuating}} the passengers through the four overwing window exits and into an inflatable slide/raft deployed {{from the front}} right passenger door (the front left slide failed to operate, so the manual inflation handle was pulled). A panicked passenger opened a rear door, which a flight attendant was unable to reseal. Water was also entering {{a hole in the}} fuselage and through cargo doors that had come open, so as the water rose the attendant urged passengers to move forward by climbing over seats. One passenger was in a wheelchair. Finally, Sullenberger walked the cabin twice to <b>confirm</b> <b>it</b> was empty.|$|E
25|$|When the First World War {{started in}} July 1914 Murray was not {{appointed}} QuarterMaster-General of the British Expeditionary Force as was originally intended. Instead he became Chief of Staff. Murray had already earned a high {{reputation as a}} staff officer in South Africa and under French at the War Office. It is sometimes claimed that Murray was given the position largely because French's initial choice for the post, Wilson, was vetoed because of {{his role in the}} Curragh Affair. Although this claim was made after the war by Edmonds, Kirke (in his memoir of Macdonogh) and Murray, there is no contemporary evidence, even in Wilson’s diary, to <b>confirm</b> <b>it</b> (unlike January 1915, when Wilson was certainly blocked from succeeding Murray for political reasons).|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Poland's Jewish {{population}} {{was estimated to}} be approximately 20,000; most living in Warsaw, Wrocław, Kraków, and Bielsko-Biała, though there are no census figures that would give an exact number. According to the Polish Moses Schorr Centre and other Polish sources, however, this may represent an undercount of the actual number of Jews living in Poland, since many are not religious. The Centre estimates that there are approximately 100,000 Jews in Poland, of which 30,000 to 40,000 have some sort of direct connection to the Jewish community, either religiously or culturally. There are also people with Jewish roots who do not possess adequate documentation to <b>confirm</b> <b>it,</b> due to various historical and family complications. A special program of introduction to Judaism is offered to them by a progressive Jewish Community Beit Kraków.|$|E

25|$|It was {{reported}} that Abramovich tried to buy the entire Cagliari club when Zola refused to renege on his verbal contract with Cagliari, although Zola himself will not <b>confirm</b> <b>it.</b> Zola subsequently led Cagliari to promotion to the Italian Serie A. Then he renewed his contract for Cagliari Calcio for one more year. He retired in June 2005, after ending his career in appropriate style with a double against Juventus in his last ever professional game. His number 10 Cagliari jersey was withdrawn in his honour for the season after he left but was worn in the 2006–07 season by Andrea Capone. Zola retired as the fifth highest goalscorer of free-kicks in Serie A history, with 20 goals from set-pieces, and currently sits behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio (21), Alessandro Del Piero (22), Andrea Pirlo (27), and Siniša Mihajlović (28).|$|E
25|$|Flying Blue, the {{frequent}} flyer program of Air France-KLM, awards members points based on miles travelled and class of service. Membership into the program is free. The program is divided into standard (Ivory), Elite (Silver) and Elite Plus (Gold and Platinum) statuses. Ivory is the basic level which is attained upon entry into the program. Elite status is attained by accruing {{a certain number of}} miles within one calendar year. Elite Silver, Elite Plus Gold, and Elite Plus Platinum cards have added benefits. An invitation-only card called Club 2000 is attributed to some VIPs, celebrities and politicians. Officially, it provides the same benefits as Platinum status but numerous sources <b>confirm</b> <b>it</b> almost guarantees upgrade to Business or La Première. Flying Blue succeeded Air France's previous {{frequent flyer program}}, Fréquence Plus, which operated until the Air France-KLM merger in 2003.|$|E
500|$|Referred to as Epsilon Eridanib, {{this planet}} was {{announced}} in 2000, but the discovery has remained controversial.

Many astronomers believed the evidence is sufficiently compelling that they regard the discovery as confirmed. As of 2013, the discovery remains in doubt because a search program at La Silla Observatory did not <b>confirm</b> <b>it</b> exists.|$|E

[...] Most of those he spoke with believed he was acting on behalf of the federal government and intended to expand U.S. holdings in Mexico. [...] Adair believed this too, having received letters from his former commander, James Wilkinson, which appeared to <b>confirm</b> <b>it.</b> [...] In 1806, however, Burr was arrested in Frankfort on charges of treason.

500|$|McCain was {{endorsed}} by Senator John Tower, a friend and mentor from his liaison stint who in turn got McCain the endorsement of former Arizona Governor and Senator Paul Fannin. [...] Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, the state's most powerful political figure, was officially neutral in the race, but many of his aides were working for McCain's opponents. Goldwater himself was said to view McCain as a political opportunist, despite admiring his military service. [...] Late in the race, Goldwater appeared to make a public statement critical of McCain, but Tower persuaded Goldwater not to <b>confirm</b> <b>it</b> to reporters and the damage was limited. McCain benefited from the support of Duke Tully's The Arizona Republic, the state's most powerful newspaper.|$|E
500|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that Óláfr might have had a fourth son named Guðrøðr. For example, the chronicle relates how the governor of Mann, described as a kinsman of Haraldr, fled from the king [...] in 1238 and set sail for Wales, taking with him his foster-son Guðrøðr Óláfsson. When the fleeing ship reached the Welsh coast it was wrecked and, according to the chronicle, Guðrøðr perished on board. Furthermore, amongst the names of witnesses within a quitclaim between Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (d. 1282) and Ralph de Mortimer (d. 1246), thought to date to about 1241, there is a certain Guðrøðr who appears in Latin as Godredo filio regis Mannie ("Guðrøðr, son of the King of Mann"). Although the possibility has been raised that the two sources may refer to the same man, there is no further evidence to <b>confirm</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
