40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 110) The {{solution of}} unbalanced electrical circuits {{has been found}} to be most practical by the method of Symmetrical Components. It is very powerful analytical tool and is based on sound theory. This project is intended to meet the needs of the practicing engineer and the engineering student. It presupposes a knowledge of fundamental single phase and poly phase circuit theory and the operating characteristics of the more important types of alternating current apparatus. A theoretical analysis is based on the assumption of three phase abc system. The paper was undertaken to investigate the characteristics of loads, when the systems are connected in three different ways. These three connections are star <b>connected</b> <b>loads,</b> grounded star <b>connected</b> <b>loads</b> and delta <b>connected</b> <b>loads.</b> Results from these informations are then developed into the ???a??? matrix transformation in each case, The advantages of these matrix trans formations are essential to be able to look at the phase diagram and immediately write the necessary sequence components from it. This paper also deals with the three phase, two winding transformers, From the knowledge of the Symmetrical Components are then decomposed the voltages and currents into a matrix equation which lead us to the solution of the equivalent circuits of the trans formers. Three different connections of two winding transformers were created to study (Delta-Delta connection, Star-Star connection and Star-Delta connection).

50|$|In {{split-phase}} wiring, {{for example}} a duplex receptacle in a North American kitchen, devices may {{be connected with}} a cable that has three conductors, in addition to ground. The three conductors are usually coloured red, black, and white. The white serves as a common neutral, while the red and black each feed, separately, {{the top and bottom}} hot sides of the receptacle. Typically such receptacles are supplied from two circuit breakers in which the handles of two poles are tied together for a common trip. If two large appliances are used at once, current passes through both and the neutral only carries the difference in current. The advantage is that only three wires are required to serve these loads, instead of four. If one kitchen appliance overloads the circuit, {{the other side of the}} duplex receptacle will be shut off as well. This is called a multiwire branch circuit. Common trip is required when the <b>connected</b> <b>load</b> uses more than one phase simultaneously.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} dynamic {{behaviour}} and transients of a sub-system when operating in two scenarios: Grid-connected mode, and islanding mode. The sub-system {{consists of two}} distributed generators (DGs). One DG is modeled using a rotating synchronous machine fitted with a governor to represent a diesel generator, while the other is modeled using a DC voltage source and a converter to represent a photovoltaic (PV) energy source. The distribution network also consists of a grid connected source known as the main grid. During normal operation, the supply of electricity to the <b>connected</b> <b>loads</b> is shared among the three energy sources, the DGs supplying about 80 percent of the loads and the rest are supplied by the main grid. When the main grid is disconnected from the network, supply to the <b>connected</b> <b>loads</b> is shared by the two DGs. The PV energy source system is equipped with real and reactive power control mechanisms that minimize islanding transients and maintain angle stability and voltage quality of the network. The study includes examples of micro-grid transient analysis {{carried out in the}} past. This is followed by the study of how transient analysis can be carried out in PowerFactory software. The simulation studies show that the electronic power control system in a PV generator is capable of maintaining the angle stability of a micro grid in response to transient conditions. These transients may result from changes in power demands from <b>connected</b> <b>loads</b> or severe islanding events.
