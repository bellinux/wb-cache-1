5000|$|The binding of a bsMab to {{its target}} antigens {{can lead to}} a variety of effects. The most widely used {{application}} of this approach is in cancer immunotherapy, where bsMabs are engineered to simultaneously bind a <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>cell</b> and a target like a tumour cell to be destroyed. Catumaxomab, one of the first trifunctional antibodies approved for therapeutic use, binds both CD3 on cytotoxic T cells and EpCAM on human adenocarcinomas. The Fc region additionally binds to a cell that expresses Fc receptors, like a macrophage, natural killer cell or dendritic cell. Since the Fc region is still intact, this allows for the bsMab to trigger common immune responses when recognized by an Fc receptor, such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity.|$|E

40|$|Recovery of calves from {{tropical}} theileriosis {{was accompanied}} by the disappearance of macroschizonts from lymph nodes {{and the appearance of}} <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>cells</b> in the blood and lymph nodes. Acute, fatal disease was associated with incremental parasitosis and parasitaemia and, in general, an absence of detectable <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>cells</b> in the blood or lymph nodes. After recovery from infection, calves were resistant to challenge. Challenge with sporozoites was followed sometimes by an immediate reappearance or by a later peak, or sometimes by twin peaks of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>cells</b> but macroschizonts were not detected. Histocompatibility (BoLA) typing indicated that calves produced two sequential populations of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>cells</b> during recovery from primary infection with Theileria annulata. The expression of lysis by the first appeared to be BoLA restricted. In contrast, both the peaks of lysis manifest after challenge appeared to be BoLA restricted. Results suggest that BoLA restricted cells are established in the immunological memory and are probably analogous to <b>cytotoxic</b> T <b>cells,</b> while non-BoLA restricted <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>cells</b> are natural killer like cells. The results suggest a role for <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>cells</b> in recovery from primary infection, in the inhibition of proliferation of macroschizonts which evade mechanisms of acquired resistance and in the lysis of macroschizont infected cells deriving from challenge sporozoites which have evaded serum-mediated inhibition...|$|R

Most allogeneically or syngeneically mated females lacked effector cells in their spleens or paraaortic lymph nodes both during pregnancy and immediately postpartum. However, spleen, cells from 33 % of C 57 BL/ 10 females mated to CBA/Ca males exhibited low levels of paternal target cell killing (P less than 0. 05 - 0. 01). Alloimmunization of virgin mice prior to mating resulted in only allogeneically mated females producing cytotoxic cells and alloantibody. These responses were not detectable during pregnancy but appeared immediately postpartum. The ability of pregnancy to induce memory cell formation was tested by allowing females one successful pregnancy before challenging them postpartum with allogeneic spleen cells. Kinetic studies of <b>cytotoxic</b> <b>cell</b> production showed that C 57 BL/ 10 females that had borne (C 57 BL/ 10 X CBA/Ca) F 1 litters responded earlier than their syngeneically mated sisters giving a peak response at 4 days compared to 7 days after immunization.
