5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> {{is a relatively}} poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E
25|$|Behind {{the angle}} of {{bifurcation}} of the common carotid artery is a reddish-brown oval body known as the <b>carotid</b> <b>body.</b> It is similar in structure to the coccygeal body which is situated on the median sacral artery.|$|E
25|$|Reduced partial {{pressures}} of {{oxygen in the}} arteries due to intermittent hypoxia are sensed by and stimulate the <b>carotid</b> <b>body,</b> a chemoafferent receptor. The activated <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> triggers the release of serotonin that attach to serotonin receptors {{on the surface of}} motoneurons, such as the phrenic motoneuron in the case of respiratory recovery. This signal transduction pathway then uses downstream molecules such as TrkB, BDNF, and PKA to increase the synaptic output of the involved motor neuron which in turn increases the motor output of the involved muscles and, thus, decreases functional impairment. As the amount of intermittent hypoxia changes the amount of serotonin release and, as a result, the amount of LTF, this process exhibits metaplasticity. Metaplasticity occurs when the LTF is itself plastic or variable.|$|E

40|$|The weights of the <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> {{have been}} {{measured}} in an unselected group of 40 successive cases coming for routine necropsy. Although the mean {{weight of the}} <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> was higher in those subjects with emphysema or Pickwickian syndrome, this difference did not reach a level of statistical significance. Nevertheless, {{in a group of}} two patients with cor pulmonale and one with the Pickwickian syndrome the mean weight of the <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> was significantly higher than that of the rest. Such observations would be consistent with enlargement of the glomic tissue in response to chronic hypoxia. In addition to these observations there was a significant correlation between the size of the <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> and the weights of the left and right ventricles separately, while there was a substantially higher correlation between the weights of the <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> and the combined weights of the two ventricles. Should such a correlation be determined by a causative link between these two measurements, a new metabolic role of glomic tissue will have to be considered. The histology of the <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> was studied and differential cell counts were carried out in 21 cases. Enlargement of the <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> was not accompanied by any change in the differential cell count, except that in one case with `cor pulmonale' and large <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> areas of hyperplasia showed a predominance of the dark variety of type 1 (chief) cell...|$|R
50|$|The initial {{increase}} in ventilation from HVR is {{initiated by the}} <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies,</b> which are bilaterally located {{at the port of}} brain circulation. <b>Carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> contain oxygen-sensitive cells that become more active in response to hypoxia. They send input to the brainstem which is then processed by respiratory centers. Other mechanisms include hypoxia-inducible factors, particularly HIF1. Hormonal changes have also been associated with HVR, particularly those that affect the functioning of the <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{human body}} can adapt to high {{altitude}} through both immediate and long-term acclimatization. At high altitude, {{in the short}} term, the lack of oxygen is sensed by the carotid bodies, which causes {{an increase in the}} breathing depth and rate (hyperpnea). However, hyperpnea also causes the adverse effect of respiratory alkalosis, inhibiting the respiratory center from enhancing the respiratory rate as much as would be required. Inability to increase the breathing rate can be caused by inadequate <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> response or pulmonary or renal disease.|$|E
25|$|Oxytocin {{secretion}} {{in response}} to suckling or vagino-cervical stimulation is mediated by some of these pathways; vasopressin secretion {{in response to}} cardiovascular stimuli arising from chemoreceptors in the <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> and aortic arch, and from low-pressure atrial volume receptors, is mediated by others. In the rat, stimulation of the vagina also causes prolactin secretion, and this results in pseudo-pregnancy following an infertile mating. In the rabbit, coitus elicits reflex ovulation. In the sheep, cervical stimulation {{in the presence of}} high levels of estrogen can induce maternal behavior in a virgin ewe. These effects are all mediated by the hypothalamus, and the information is carried mainly by spinal pathways that relay in the brainstem. Stimulation of the nipples stimulates release of oxytocin and prolactin and suppresses the release of LH and FSH.|$|E
500|$|The {{relatively}} small quantity of unconjugated dopamine {{in the bloodstream}} may be produced by the sympathetic nervous system, the digestive system, or possibly other organs. It may act on dopamine receptors in peripheral tissues, or be metabolized, or be converted to norepinephrine by the enzyme dopamine beta hydroxylase, which is released into the bloodstream by the adrenal medulla. [...] Some dopamine receptors {{are located in the}} walls of arteries, where they act as a vasodilator and an inhibitor of norepinephrine release. [...] These responses might be activated by dopamine released from the <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> under conditions of low oxygen, but whether arterial dopamine receptors perform other biologically useful functions is not known.|$|E

500|$|Baroreceptors are stretch receptors {{located in}} the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, {{including}} pulmonary vessels and {{the right side of}} the heart itself. Baroreceptors fire at a rate determined by how much they are stretched, which is influenced by blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation [...] As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation. There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase heart rate. The opposite is also true. Chemoreceptors present in the <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> or adjacent to the aorta in an aortic body respond to the blood's oxygen, carbon dioxide levels. Low oxygen or high carbon dioxide will stimulate firing of the receptors.|$|E

2500|$|Through {{studies using}} {{mammalian}} model organisms, {{there are two}} main hypotheses for the location of oxygen sensing in chemoreceptor cells: the membrane hypothesis and the mitochondrial hypothesis. [...] The membrane hypothesis was proposed for the <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> in mice, and it predicts that oxygen sensing is an ion balance initiated process. [...] The mitochondrial hypothesis was also proposed for the <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> of mice, but it relies on the levels of oxidative phosphorylation and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as a cue for hypoxia. [...] Specifically, the oxygen sensitive K+ [...] currents are inhibited by H2O2 and NADPH oxidase activation. [...] There is evidence for both of these hypotheses depending on the species used for the study. [...] For the neuroepithelial cells in the zebrafish gills, there is strong evidence supporting the [...] "membrane hypothesis" [...] due to their capacity to respond to hypoxia after removal of the contents of the cell.

The mean age of the affected subjects was 76 years in isolated pulmonary glomitis and 79 years in chronic carotid glomitis. Chronic carotid glomitis affected seven (14 %) subjects and predominated in women (six to one). In the seven cases of isolated pulmonary glomitis women predominated five to two. Chronic glomitis seems to be a disease process which may affect at least two members of the non-chromaffin paraganglionic system, but it is not clear why focal chronic inflammation affects the glomus pulmonale of one person but not of another...|$|R

The objective {{of the present study was}} to perform a quantitative analysis of the histology of <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> collected from patients who died of ARDS. A morphometric study of <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> collected during routine autopsies was carried out on three groups: patients that died of non-respiratory diseases (controls, N = 8), patients that presented COPD and died of its complications or associated diseases (N = 7), and patients that died of ARDS (N = 7). Morphometric measurements of the volume fraction of clusters of chief cells were performed in five fields on each slide at 40 X magnification. The numerical proportion of the four main histological cell types (light, dark, progenitor and sustentacular cells) was determined analyzing 10 fields on each slide at 400 X magnification. The proportion of dark cells was 0. 22 in ARDS patients, 0. 12 in controls (P< 0. 001), and 0. 08 in the COPD group. The proportion of light cells was 0. 33 (ARDS), 0. 44 (controls) (P< 0. 001), and 0. 36 (COPD).

50|$|Respiration in {{neonates}} is very irregular, {{prone to}} periodic breathing and apnea. In utero and at birth, the carotid body’s response to hypoxia {{is not fully}} developed; it takes {{a few days to}} a few weeks to increase its sensitivity to that of an adult <b>carotid</b> <b>body.</b> During this period of development, it is proposed that neonates heavily rely on other oxygen-sensing chemoreceptors, such as the aortic body or central chemoreceptors. However, non-carotid body chemoreceptors are sometimes not enough to ensure appropriate ventilatory response; SIDS deaths occur most frequently during the days or weeks in which the <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> is still developing, and it is suggested that lack of appropriate <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> activity is implicated in this condition. SIDS victims often are reported to have displayed some of the characteristic troubles in <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> development, including periodic breathing, much sleep apnea, impaired arousal during sleep, and low sensitivity to hypoxia. The carotid bodies of SIDS victims also often display physiological abnormalities, such as hypo- and hypertrophy. Many of the findings on to carotid body’s relation to SIDS report that <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> development is impaired by environmental factors that were already known to increase the risk of SIDS, such as premature birth and exposure to smoke, substances of abuse, hyperoxia, and hypoxia, so it may seem initially as if <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> studies are only extending what we know about SIDS into another domain. However, understanding the mechanisms that impair <b>carotid</b> <b>body</b> development could help elucidate how certain aspects of neonatal, particularly premature, care might be improved. For example, oxygen therapy may be an example of a technique that exposes premature infants to such high oxygen levels that it prevents them from acquiring appropriate sensitivity to normal oxygen levels.|$|E

50|$|A glomus cell (type I) is a {{peripheral}} chemoreceptor, mainly {{located in the}} <b>carotid</b> <b>bodies</b> and aortic bodies, that helps the body regulate breathing.

The glomus cells have a high metabolic rate and good blood perfusion and thus are sensitive to changes in arterial blood gas tension. Glomus cells are very similar structurally to neurons, and they are indeed derived from the neural crest, while the glomus cells of type II are similar in function to neuroglia.|$|R
