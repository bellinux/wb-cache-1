50|$|THM400 {{transmissions}} {{are very}} popular in automotive competition due to their great strength. Much of this strength comes {{from the use of}} a cast iron <b>center</b> <b>support</b> to suspend the transmission's concentric shafts that join the clutch assemblies to the gear train. The <b>center</b> <b>support,</b> which is splined to the interior of the transmission's case, also provides a robust reaction point for first gear (the gear train's reaction carrier is restrained from counter-rotating the engine in first gear by a roller clutch whose inner race is part of the <b>center</b> <b>support).</b> Since the first gear reactive force is evenly distributed around the periphery of the case, the types of mechanical (and some times violent) failures that have plagued other competition transmissions are rare.|$|R
