5|$|The Constitution {{defines the}} Government of Singapore as the President and the <b>Cabinet</b> of Singapore. The {{executive}} authority of Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him {{or by the}} <b>Cabinet</b> of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the <b>Cabinet.</b> However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role {{in the executive branch}} of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the <b>Cabinet</b> and Parliament of Singapore, he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the <b>Cabinet</b> or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the <b>Cabinet.</b> It is the <b>Cabinet</b> that has the general direction and control of the Government. As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the <b>Cabinet.</b> At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by the <b>Cabinet</b> that outlines what the <b>Cabinet</b> intends to achieve in the session.|$|E
5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race <b>cabinet</b> {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular <b>cabinet,</b> reminiscent of the fiberglass <b>cabinet</b> for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The <b>cabinet</b> design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular <b>cabinet.</b> The final <b>cabinet</b> stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run in a reasonable amount of time. The final Space Race <b>cabinet</b> was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{set about}} {{applying}} his business principles to his <b>cabinet,</b> putting {{his experience as}} both a corporate manager and rowing coach to use in a <b>cabinet</b> system that was orderly and practical. He implemented a formal system whereby a proper agenda for <b>cabinet</b> meetings would be formulated, and the minister responsible for each item would circulate papers to bring other members {{up to speed on}} the issue. His decision-making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated in decisions or if they disagreed, gave leave for <b>cabinet</b> members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve <b>cabinet</b> solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect and approval of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate <b>cabinet</b> through his industriousness and knowledgability. <b>Cabinet</b> minister George Pearce would later conclude that Bruce was the best of the prime ministers that he served or opposed in his 38-year parliamentary career.|$|E
