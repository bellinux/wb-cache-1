50|$|The Ooldea dunnart (Sminthopsis ooldea), {{also called}} Troughtons dunnart after {{the person who}} found the species, is an Australian {{marsupial}} similar to the hairy-footed dunnart. It is greyish-yellow on its upper body and white on the underside with dark patches on its crown, forehead {{and in front of}} the eyes, and a pink thinly furred <b>carrot</b> <b>shaped</b> tail. Its total length is 115-173 mm; its average body length is 55-80 mm with a tail of 60-93 mm. Its ear length is 14-17 mm. This dunnart weighs between 10 and 18 grams.|$|R
50|$|Many {{kimberlite}} {{structures are}} emplaced as carrot-shaped, vertical intrusions termed 'pipes'. This classic <b>carrot</b> <b>shape</b> is formed {{due to a}} complex intrusive process of kimberlitic magma which inherits {{a large proportion of}} CO2 (lower amounts of H2O) in the system, which produces a deep explosive boiling stage that causes a significant amount of vertical flaring (Bergman, 1987). Kimberlite classification is based on the recognition of differing rock facies. These differing facies are associated with a particular style of magmatic activity, namely crater, diatreme and hypabyssal rocks (Clement and Skinner 1985, and Clement, 1982).|$|R

50|$|The {{morphology}} of kimberlite pipes, {{and their}} classical <b>carrot</b> <b>shape</b> {{is the result}} of explosive diatreme volcanism from very deep mantle-derived sources. These volcanic explosions produce vertical columns of rock that rise from deep magma reservoirs. The morphology of kimberlite pipes is varied but includes a sheeted dyke complex of tabular, vertically dipping feeder dykes in the root of the pipe which extends down to the mantle. Within 1.5 - 2 km of the surface, the highly pressured magma explodes upwards and expands to form a conical to cylindrical diatreme, which erupts to the surface. The surface expression is rarely preserved but is usually similar to a maar volcano. The diameter of a kimberlite pipe at the surface is typically a few hundred meters to a kilometer (up to 0.6 mile).|$|R
5000|$|The {{carpet beetle}} larvae start to feed {{as soon as}} they hatch. They are <b>carrot</b> <b>shaped</b> and heavily covered with setae, {{especially}} on their posterior end. The number of instars differ from 5-11 and in some cases reach up to 20. Larvae of the black carpet beetle Attagenus megatoma may grow up to 1/2 inch (12 mm) and be yellow to brown in color. Other types of carpet beetle are regularly 1/4 to 1 inch (6 to 25 mm) long and covered with dark setae. Certain species have distinctive tufts of setae extending from their posterior end. These beetles are attracted to soiled fabrics and crevices where dead insects may serve as a food source. The larvae of the carpet beetle are often referred to as [...] "woolly bears" [...] or [...] "buffalo moths".|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Computer-aiding of {{mathematical}} modeling of the carrot (Daucus carota L.) root shape. The developed method refers to computer aided mathematical modeling of the carrot root. The Bézier curves {{were used in}} mathematical model for description of the <b>carrot</b> root <b>shape.</b> Two smoothly connected Bézier curves described half of longitudinal contour of carrot root cross section. After rotation of these curves, the ob-tained equations were subjected to scaling. The proposed mathematical model can serve the ge-nerating the 3 D solids that are similar in respect of the shape and basic dimensions of carrot roots. In mathematical model {{it is possible to}} change the values of parameters that determine basic geome-tric dimensions (diameters and length of root) and the root shape (coordinates of nodal and check points of the Bézier curves). Key words: computer aiding, <b>carrot</b> root, <b>shape,</b> mathematical modeling...|$|R

50|$|Chape has had various {{meanings}} in English, but the predominant {{one is a}} protective fitting {{at the bottom of}} a scabbard or sheath for a sword or dagger (10 in the diagram). Historic blade weapons often had leather scabbards with metal fittings at either end, sometimes decorated. These are generally either in some sort of U shape, protecting the edges only, or a pocket <b>shape</b> <b>covering</b> the sides of the scabbard as well. The reinforced end of a single-piece metal scabbard can also be called the chape.|$|R

5000|$|A robust, {{medium-sized}} gecko, with a large, triangular head. It has a short, flattened, <b>carrot</b> <b>shaped</b> like tail, {{that ends}} in a knob. This tail can be autotomised to distract predators, however unlike other lizards they have only one cleavage point at the base, meaning it must sacrifice its whole tail in the event. It has long slender limbs with non-retractile claws on digits, of which the outer most one is opposable. The gecko has vertically slit ears at the widest part of its head and very large eyes that have vertical pupils. On the dorsal side, it is generally a pinkish-grey to purplish-brown colour, with a unique pattern of darker and lighter spots, bars or lines. [...] The underbelly is white. N. levis is speckled in pale and dark tubercles on the body and tail which often form bands. Levis means smooth, referring to the skins smoothness compared to the genotype of N. asper (asper meaning rough).|$|R

50|$|The beehive was by backcombing or teasing {{the hair}} with a comb, {{creating}} a tangled pile which was lightly combed over to make a smooth outer surface. The longer the hair, the higher the beehive. Beehive styles of the early 1960s sometimes overlapped with bouffant styles, which also employed teasing to create hair volume; but generally speaking, the beehive effect was a rounded cone piled upwards {{from the top of}} the head, while the simple bouffant was a wider, puffier <b>shape</b> <b>covering</b> the ears at the sides. Both of these can be distinguished from the pompadour style, the basic type of which is swept upwards from the forehead.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} is essentially rectangular in <b>shape,</b> <b>covering</b> {{both sides of}} Delavan Terrace and the lots at the corners on Palisade and Park Avenues. An extension at the southwest includes the now-vacant lot where the Smith-Collins House stood {{on the west side}} of Palisade. The total area is 4.2 acre. Topographically the street is on the south end of a ridge between the Hudson River a half-mile (1 km) to the west and one of its tributaries, the Saw Mill River, the same distance to the east. The terrain thus drops sharply to the south and west, and the east end of Delavan is 50 ft higher than the west.|$|R

40|$|The {{capture of}} cometary dust grains in aerogel at the well defined impact {{velocity}} of 6. 1 km/s {{resulted in the}} production of a range of impact cavity morphologies. These tracks range from the classical <b>carrot</b> <b>shaped</b> tracks (type A) seen in laboratory experiments with efractory-solid projectiles, to bulbous tracks with “turnip”-like properties and a stylus (type B), to bulbous stubby tracks (type C) [1, 2]. These morphologies must reflect the underlying variati on in the structure and strength of cometary dust grains. The cap ture of cometary dust grains also presents the possibility that the chemical content of projec- tiles, in the form of volatiles that are released during capture, also contributed to bulbous track features and analyses of the terminal particles and track residues suggest that the volatile content of the projectiles, released preferentially during capture, would have contributed to the range of morphologies seen in the Stardust cometary dust tracks. An additional contributor to track bulb production could come from par ticle fragmentation during cap-ture and here we present a quantita tive analysis of the factors that contribute to the production of bulbous impact cavities in aerogel...|$|R
