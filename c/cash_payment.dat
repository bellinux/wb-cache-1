(During the food rationing of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.)

5|$|On 10 May, Van der Sloot {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a <b>cash</b> <b>payment</b> of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogot√°, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney contended that the case had not yet been sufficiently developed.|$|E

5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 <b>cash</b> <b>payment</b> on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th {{century the}} Norman kings {{attempted}} to formalise the feudal governance system initially created after the invasion. After the invasion {{the king had}} enjoyed a combination of income from his own demesne lands, the Anglo-Saxon geld tax and fines. Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues, especially {{in order to pay}} for mercenary forces. One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system, and kings adopted the French feudal aid model, a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary; another method was to exploit the scutage system, in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a <b>cash</b> <b>payment</b> to the king. Taxation was also an option, although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to a growing number of exemptions. Instead, a succession of kings created alternative land taxes, such as the tallage and carucage taxes. These were increasingly unpopular and, along with the feudal charges, were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215. As part of the formalisation of the royal finances, HenryI created the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post which would lead to the maintenance of the Pipe rolls, a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians in tracking both royal finances and medieval prices.|$|E
5|$|The {{reform plan}} adopted in 2005 envisaged the {{formation}} of eighteen integrated brigades through the brassage process as its first of three stages. The process consists firstly of regroupment, where fighters are disarmed. Then they are sent to orientation centres, run by CONADER, where fighters take the choice of either returning to civilian society or remaining in the armed forces. Combatants who choose demobilisation receive an initial <b>cash</b> <b>payment</b> of US $110. Those who choose {{to stay within the}} FARDC are then transferred to one of six integration centres for a 45-day training course, which aims to build integrated formations out of factional fighters previously heavily divided along ethnic, political and regional lines. The centres are spread out around the country at Kitona, Kamina, Kisangani, Rumangabo and Nyaleke (within the Virunga National Park) in Nord-Kivu, and Luberizi (on the border with Burundi) in South Kivu. The process has suffered severe difficulties due to construction delays, administration errors, and the amount of travel former combatants have to do, as the three stages' centres are widely separated. Following the first 18 integrated brigades, the second goal is {{the formation of}} a ready reaction force of two to three brigades, and finally, by 2010 when MONUC is anticipated to have withdrawn, the creation of a Main Defence Force of three divisions.|$|E

40|$|Cash {{is still}} the most common means of daily payments. The large number of <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> is {{supported}} by a costly distribution system in which retailers, banks and central banks participate. Currency is issued in a range of bank note and coin denominations to facilitate efficiency in <b>cash</b> <b>payments.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to study the performance of a currency range in practice. It presents a number of empirical studies on <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> at the individual <b>payment</b> level, whereby <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> are viewed as the outcome of a choice process. This type of analysis calls for labor-intensive data collection methods {{and the development of a}} sophisticated econometric model. This thesis introduces such a model for <b>cash</b> <b>payments,</b> and it reviews its application to three unique data sets of <b>cash</b> <b>payments.</b> The data concern payments in the Netherlands before and after the transition from the guilder to the euro in 2002, and payments in an experimental setting. The estimation results allow for an assessment of the use of different bank note and coin denominations in <b>cash</b> <b>payments,</b> and of possible preferences for one of more denominations. Currency research generally approaches currency use from a macroeconomic point of view. The novelty of this thesis is that it contributes to currency research by focusing on individual <b>cash</b> <b>payments.</b> Jeanine Kippers (1973) obtained her master¬¥s degree in econometrics from the Erasmus University Rotterdam in 1997. In the same year she was employed by De Nederlandsche Bank. She participated in the preparations of the cash changeover from guilder to euro in 2002, and contributed to the development of a European cash distribution system and the restructuring of the national distribution system. During her employment at the central bank she started her research on currency use, which resulted in several papers that have been published or are currently under review. In January 2004 she joined the Pensionand Insurance Supervisory authority, as a policy advisor in the (international) field of insurance supervision...|$|R

5|$|To {{supply the}} orders and to repay debts, Densmore began to {{manufacture}} the machine in summer 1871. During this time, {{the machine was}} revised to improve durability and the platen was redesigned after feedback from Western Union, which wanted the ability to print on a continuous roll, indicated that clipping paper to the platen was impractical. The new design, however, infringed a patent granted to Charles A. Washburn in November 1870; Washburn, consequently, received royalties on future production. In 1872, to manufacture the new machine in earnest, a former wheelwright shop was secured along with several employees. Although the machines worked well, the lack of economies of scale prevented the venture from yielding a profit. In exchange for funding the ventures, Densmore had been acquiring an ever-increasing ownership interest. Sholes was eventually bought out for a <b>cash</b> <b>payment</b> of $12,000. Glidden kept his one-tenth right of the patent. Densmore consulted with George W. N. Yost, a manufacturer {{with whom he had}} been acquainted, who suggested showing the machine to E. Remington and Sons. Remington, an arms manufacturer seeking to diversify after the Civil War, possessed the machining equipment and skilled machinists necessary to further develop the complex machine. A typewritten letter was sent to Remington, where executive Henry H. Benedict was impressed by the novelty and encouraged company president Philo Remington to pursue the device.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{intractable}} problems {{in the area of}} monetary economics is the measurement of <b>cash</b> <b>payments.</b> Whereas the stock of currency in circulation [C] is well defined and readily measured, the transactions velocity of currency [Vc] (the average number of times currency turns over in any given period) is difficult to measure. This paper examines alternative methods for estimating the average velocity of currency and the denomination specific velocity of cash employing data for the Netherlands. Estimates of the volume of <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> are necessary to meaningfully measure the volume of total payments [MV] in an economy and hence, the total volume of transactions [PT]. Once the volume of <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> is known, it is possible to employ Fisher‚Äôs equation of exchange [MV=PT] as a more general conceptual and empirical alternative to Keynes‚Äô more limited income-expenditure [Y= C+I+G] identity. <b>Cash</b> <b>payments,</b> Velocity of currency, Equation of exchange, total transactions, underground economy. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{establishment}} and funding of a Swedish-style welfare state, with state provision of {{a long list of}} ‚Äúmerit goods‚Äùplus targeted <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> to those in special circumstances, has a higher priority than large <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> to all citizens, as called for in the Stakeholding and Basic Income proposals. An analysis of the Swedish budget shows that advanced countries cannot do both at once, given current levels of per capita income. Other problems with a near-term rapid introduction of large universal <b>cash</b> <b>payments</b> include the disincentive to work for pay, which would reduce per capita income and make the problem of financing such payments through taxation even more acute, the probable retrograde effects on gender equality, and a reduction in the power of parents vis-a-vis their teenage children.
