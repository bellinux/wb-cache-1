5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E

Both Liu and Zhu's close associate Li Zhen advocated slaughtering Tang officials who might oppose him. At their instigation, Zhu had Pei, Dugu, Cui, and some 30 other prominent Tang officials gathered at Baima Station (白馬驛, in modern Anyang, Henan) and ordered them to commit suicide. Their bodies were thrown into the Yellow River. It was said that Liu <b>Can</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> tens of officials on his list of executions, but fellow chancellor Zhang Wenwei persuaded him not to carry out those executions.|$|R

25|$|It is {{commonly}} stated by critics of evolution {{that there are}} no known transitional fossils. This position is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of what represents a transitional feature. A common creationist argument is that no fossils are found with partially functional features. It is plausible that a complex feature with one function can adapt a different function through evolution. The precursor to, for example, a wing, might originally have only been used for gliding, trapping flying prey, or mating display. Today, wings <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> all of these functions, but they are also used in active flight.|$|E

With different accents, articulations, and pronunciations, speech recognition technology <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> problems deciphering words. This is where the medical transcriptionist editor steps in. Medical transcription editors will compare and correct the transcribed file to the voice-recorded audio file. The job is similar to medical transcription as editing will use a foot pedal and the education and training requirements are mostly the same.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene {{can cause}} {{significant}} economic losses for florists, markets, suppliers, and growers. Researchers have developed {{several ways to}} inhibit ethylene, including inhibiting ethylene synthesis and inhibiting ethylene perception. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), Aminooxyacetic acid (AOA), and silver salts are ethylene inhibitors. Inhibiting ethylene synthesis is less effective for reducing post-harvest losses since ethylene from other sources <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> an effect. By inhibiting ethylene perception, fruits, plants and flowers don't respond to ethylene produced endogenously or from exogenous sources. Inhibitors of ethylene perception include compounds that have a similar shape to ethylene, but do not elicit the ethylene response. One example of an ethylene perception inhibitor is 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP).|$|E

It {{should be noted}} that even if the bullying was not consciously intended it <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> awful impacts. One study concluded that people had been ostracised online as a way of protecting another group of people. One woman had been listed as a political opponent on a pro-trans website due to misunderstandings and alternating views, which resulted in targeted messages and harassment. The listed person in question did not actually have any reservations against the trans community, and so they ended up being the bullied person. While the motivations {{of the authors of the}} website are unknown, it can be assumed that they did not specifically aim to target the person effected and thus the bullying was an inconsiderate result.|$|E
25|$|Before {{understanding}} Aristotle's {{views on}} dreams, first {{his idea of}} sleep must be examined. Aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in On Sleep and Wakefulness. Sleep takes place {{as a result of}} overuse of the senses or of digestion, so it is vital to the body, including the senses, so it can be revitalized. While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire, which {{is the result of a}} sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep, albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> sensory experiences. Also, not all of the senses are inactive during sleep, only the ones that are weary.|$|E

As Hubbard explained, the game's intention is [...] "to make you laugh, but not at the expense of providing a broader, more satisfying emotional experience than a spoof generally allows, so that even if you don't chuckle once, you <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> plenty of fun playing the game. At heart, NOLF is an action/adventure/espionage game with a healthy dose of levity." [...] Humor is presented mainly via visual gags, overheard conversations, textual intelligence items, and cutscenes. The humor includes [...] "situational humor, and even a dash of absurdity and bathroom humor for good measure. Some of it is subtle, some of it isn't." [...] The name of UNITY, H.A.R.M., and other fictional organizations mentioned in the game follow the spy genre formula of using contrived acronyms for organizations (see List of fictional espionage organizations). What H.A.R.M. actually stands for is never revealed, and speculation about its true meaning is used as a running gag in the game and its sequel.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below [...] This {{will cause the}} storm to lose its tropical characteristics, such as a warm core with thunderstorms near the center, and become a remnant low-pressure area. These remnant systems may persist for up to several days before losing their identity. This dissipation mechanism is most common in the eastern North Pacific. Weakening or dissipation can occur if it experiences vertical wind shear, causing the convection and heat engine {{to move away from}} the center; this normally ceases development of a {{tropical cyclone}}. In addition, its interaction with the main belt of the Westerlies, by means of merging with a nearby frontal zone, can cause tropical cyclones to evolve into extratropical cyclones. This transition can take 1–3days. Even after a tropical cyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated, it <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> tropical storm force (or occasionally hurricane/typhoon force) winds and drop several inches of rainfall. In the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, such tropical-derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and may occasionally remain at hurricane or typhoon-force wind speeds when they reach the west coast of North America. These phenomena can also affect Europe, where they are known as European windstorms; Hurricane Iris's extratropical remnants are an example of such a windstorm from 1995. A cyclone can also merge with another area of low pressure, becoming a larger area of low pressure. This can strengthen the resultant system, although it may no longer be a tropical cyclone. Studies in the 2000s have given rise to the hypothesis that large amounts of dust reduce the strength of tropical cyclones.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} polarization-mode {{dispersion}} (PMD) compensation and mitigation performance, using a single PMD compensator to compensate several channels {{at the same}} time with degree of polarization (DOP) as the feedback signal in a 2 40 /Gb s × WDM system. Particle-swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to search and track the dynamic degree of polarization (DOP) to achieve the adaptive PMD compensation. New modulation formats are used to mitigate PMD, and the dynamic combination of PMD mitigation taking CSRZDPSK and CSRZDQPSK as the advanced modulation formats have been successfully completed. The numerical results show that the differential phase-shift keyed (DPSK) and differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) modulation formats are more suitable for PMD mitigation system than the on-off keying (OOK) modulation format. Furthermore, DQPSK format can simultaneously double WDM spectrum-packing efficiency and upgrade the system capacity while it <b>can</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> the same mitigation performance as the DPSK format in the PMD compensation system.
