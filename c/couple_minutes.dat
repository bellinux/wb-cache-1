5|$|The climax {{takes place}} at the beauty pageant. After a frantic race against the clock the family arrives at the hotel, and are curtly told by a pageant {{organizer}} that they are a <b>couple</b> <b>minutes</b> past the deadline. A sympathetic hired hand instead offers to register Olive on his own time. As Olive prepares for the pageant, the family sees Olive's competition: slim, hypersexualized pre-teen girls with teased hair and capped teeth. They wear lip gloss, adult-like swimsuits, and glamorous evening wear while performing highly elaborate dance numbers with great panache. It quickly becomes apparent that Olive (plain, chubby, wearing large eyeglasses, and untrained in beauty pageant conventions) is a mere amateur by comparison.|$|E

25|$|Another {{behavior}} {{observed in}} D. media workers is gastral vibration. This is observed in workers of many Dolichovespula and Vespula species. Workers tap their gaster rapidly {{up and down}} onto the comb of the nest and this is associated with feeding of larvae. The behavior typically occurs while wasps are walking on the comb and ceases after feeding each larvae {{a small amount of}} flesh and then resumes before feeding the next larvae. A behavior that appears to be homologous to this is observed in the foundresses queen and is called tapping. Queens have been observed tapping mid or hind legs on the comb after returning with prey. These taps can last a few seconds to a <b>couple</b> <b>minutes</b> and are loud enough to be heard outside of the nest. This signal is believed to function {{in the same way as}} gastral vibration in workers and is to signal to the larvae when it is time to feed. Sometimes this tapping or vibration occurs even when there is no pellet to feed the larvae and it is speculated that this corresponds to the feeding of liquids, but this has not been confirmed. Tapping continues in the queen even after she has ceased foraging when she feeding larvae pellets that she receives from the workers. This supports the idea that it is involved in signaling larvae during feeding.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale was introduced. It {{was made}} for three {{different}} age groups. The AMAS takes into account age-related situations that affect an individual's anxiety. The divisions include one scale for adults (AMA-A), one scale for college students (AMAS-C), {{and the other for}} the elderly population (AMAS-E). Each scale is geared towards examining situations specific to that age group. For example, the AMAS-C has items pertaining specifically to college students, such as questions about anxiety of the future. The AMAS-A is geared more toward mid-life issues, and the AMAS-E has specific anxieties the older population deals with, such as fear of aging and dying. The AMAS-A contains 36 items. It has 14 questions relating to worry/oversensitivity, 9 questions about physiological anxiety, 7 questions about social concerns/stress, and 6 questions about lies. An example of an age appropriate item for this scale is, “I am worried about my job performance”. The AMAS-C contains 49 items about the same topics, but incorporates 15 items related specifically to test anxiety. Questions relating to the items on this scale include, “I worry too much about tests and exams”. This scale is similar in structure to the CMAS discussed above. The AMAS-E contains 44 items related to worry/oversensitivity, physiological anxiety, lying, and the fear of aging. Twenty- three of the questions on the AMAS-E are related to worry/oversensitivity, but The Fear of Aging category of this scale includes items such as, “I worry about becoming senile”. Similar to the TMAS, the AMAS can be given in a group or individual setting, and the person responds either yes or no to each item listed according to if it pertains to themselves or not. The more items that are answered yes, suggest a higher level of anxiety. The scale has been said to be easy to complete and practical, because it takes only about 10 minutes to complete and just a <b>couple</b> <b>minutes</b> to score.|$|E
25|$|The month {{started by}} a 5–2 victory over APOEL {{in the second}} leg of Champions League quarter-finals, giving an {{aggregate}} score 8–2 as Los Blancos advanced to the semi-finals against final hosts Bayern Munich. Real Madrid was resting some of their usual starters, but still managed to score five goals overall. Cristiano Ronaldo netted a brace and Kaká, José Callejón and Ángel Di María each scored one in the victory, while APOEL's goals were scored by Gustavo Manduca and Esteban Solari, later scoring a penalty given to the Cypriots after Hamit Altıntop's foul in the box. On 8 April, Real Madrid had a goalless draw against Valencia in La Liga, leading them only four points ahead of Barcelona. Three days later, on 11 April, Real Madrid beat Atlético Madrid in an away game 1–4. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat trick including two astonishing goals and assisted Callejón to score the fourth goal to close the game. Atlético's only goal was netted by Radamel Falcao. On 14 April, Real Madrid beat Sporting de Gijón home 3–1 with goals from Higuaín, Ronaldo and Benzema. Sporting's only goal was a penalty given to them after a handball from Sergio Ramos in the box, which was scored by Miguel de las Cuevas. On 17 April, Real Madrid lost to Bayern Munich away at the Allianz Arena 2–1 in first leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Franck Ribéry and Mario Gómez scored for Bayern, while Mesut Özil netted Madrid's only goal. On 21 April, Real Madrid beat Barcelona in El Clásico in Camp Nou 1–2, extending their lead in La Liga to seven points with only four matches left, which all but decided the domestic title. Sami Khedira opened the scoring from a corner kick in the 17th minute which broke {{the record for the}} most goals scored in a domestic league, with 107. Alexis Sánchez equalized in the second half in the 70th minute, but only <b>couple</b> <b>minutes</b> later, Özil assisted and Ronaldo scored the winning goal of the game by shooting the ball over Víctor Valdés into the net. This was the first victory for Real Madrid in La Liga against their arch rivals in Camp Nou since 2007. On 25 April, in the second leg of the Champions League against Bayern Munich, Cristiano Ronaldo initially put Madrid up 2–0, but former Madrid player Arjen Robben netted an away goal back for Bayern with a penalty. The match ended 2–1 after extra time and as both sides were tied 3–3, it went to a shootout. During penalties, Iker Casillas made two saves but Ronaldo, Kaká and Ramos failed to convert their spot kicks and Madrid lost 3–1.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March, Real Madrid {{extended}} their streak of wins in La Liga to ten games by beating Espanyol at home 5–0. Cristiano Ronaldo, Sami Khedira and Kaká all {{scored in the}} impressive win, as did Gonzalo Higuaín, who scored twice. On 10 March, Real Madrid became the first team {{in the history of}} La Liga to win ten consecutive away games after beating Real Betis 2–3 at the Estadio Benito Villamarín. The home team started well after Jorge Molina scored early, but Higuaín equalized just over ten minutes later. In the second half, Madrid took the lead with a Ronaldo goal, but Betis equalized only <b>couple</b> <b>minutes</b> later with a strike from Jefferson Montero. Ronaldo, however, scored his second of the night later on {{which turned out to be}} the winning goal and guaranteed the full three points for the whites. Real Madrid qualified to the quarter-finals of the Champions League on 14 March by beating CSKA Moscow at home by a score of 4–1, progressing 5–2 on aggregate. Ronaldo netted a brace while Higuaín and Karim Benzema both scored one in the victory, while the lone goal from CSKA was scored by Zoran Tošić.

On 21 March, Real Madrid drew again 1–1, this time against Villarreal, with Ronaldo and Marcos Senna scoring the goals. After back-to-back draws, Real Madrid was on an advantage of just six points ahead of rivals Barcelona. In the controversial game, Mourinho was expelled from the match as was fitness trainer Rui Faria for the third time in his season. The referee gave Sergio Ramos a second yellow card for a tough challenge on Nilmar and gave direct red to Özil for sarcastically applauding his decision. Pepe was also booked after the game for insulting the referee, which led to a two-game suspension for him. On 24 March, Real Madrid beat Real Sociedad 5–1, with two goals each from Ronaldo and Benzema and a single goal for Higuaín. Ronaldo averaged 1.01 goals by having 100 goals scored in La Liga that day.

Benzema scored a header from a pass from Kaká, who then scored the second one; Benzema closed the game by scoring the third goal from an Özil assist. On the last day of the month, Real Madrid beat Osasuna away, 1–5. Benzema scored a stupendous volley goal and Ronaldo equally great 36-yard long range shot at goal. It was overall Ronaldo's night, since he also scored another goal, a free kick that was deflected, and assisted two other goals. Higuaín was the third player who got his name on the scoresheet, scoring twice. His last goal was the 100th goal for Madrid in La Liga this season.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do {{you go back to the}} world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money in order to create a conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a <b>couple</b> <b>minutes</b> of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E

[...] "King of the Castle" [...] was reviewed better than the previous two mobisodes and the reviewer noted that [...] "it's a testament to ... Fox and ...

[...] While Dahl [...] "always like what Juliet brings to the table", he thought that [...] "Operation: Sleeper" [...] "serves little purpose". [...] "Room 23" [...] was called the [...] "best mobisode ever". [...] In regard to [...] "Arzt and Crafts", Dahl wrote that [...] "Lindelof wrote this mobisode ... and as a result ... it has the best dialogue of any mobisode so far". [...] He commented that [...] "Tropical Depression" [...] is [...] "not totally superfluous, though the new information isn't very enlightening". [...] Dahl [...] "liked" [...] "Jack, Meet Ethan. [...] Ethan? [...] Jack", but decided [...] "that it's not 's best work". [...] Dahl wrote that [...] "Jin Has a Temper-Tantrum on the Golf Course" [...] is [...] "a nice little scene", but the reviewer pointed out an inaccuracy in the scene's golf gameplay. [...] When reviewing [...] "The Envelope", Dahl wrote that [...] "The people over at Lost have cheated a little bit ... it's still a pretty cool deleted scene". [...] After seeing [...] "So It Begins", Dahl was [...] "not entirely sure what to think" [...] because the reviewer liked [...] "showing the moments before the pilot began" [...] and [...] "doing a mobisode from Vincent's perspective, but adding a supposed-to-be-dead Christian to the mix is confusing".|$|E
2500|$|While testifying at the Guantanamo {{military}} commission for alleged child soldier Omar Khadr, FBI agent Robert Fuller testified that Khadr had identified Maher Arar {{as among the}} al-Qaeda militants he met while in Afghanistan. On October 7, 2002, Fuller went to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and showed Canadian teenager Omar Khadr a black-and-white photograph of Arar obtained from the FBI office in Massachusetts, and demanded {{to know if he}} recognised him. Khadr initially stated that he did not recognise Arar. Upon cross-examination, Fuller clarified his testimony saying that at first Khadr could not identify Arar. Then after giving him a <b>couple</b> <b>minutes</b> Khadr [...] "stated he felt he had seen" [...] Maher Arar at a Kabul safehouse run by Abu Musab al-Suri or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The validity of Omar Khadr's possible sighting has been seriously questioned due to the time frame of the alleged sighting which was sometime during September or October 2001. Arar was known to be in North America during this time frame and under surveillance by the RCMP. Khadr's lawyer told Canadian media that Khadr, claiming to be under torture at Bagram Theater Internment Facility, simply told his captors whatever he thought they wanted to hear. Lawyers and advocates familiar with the case immediately dismissed the allegations.|$|E

I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement.

60|$|Perhaps I {{ought to}} {{remember}} that she is very young, a mere girl and make allowances. She is all interest, eagerness, vivacity, the world is to her a charm, a wonder, a mystery, a joy; she can't speak for delight when she finds a new flower, she must pet it and caress it and smell it and talk to it, and pour out endearing names upon it. And she is color-mad: brown rocks, yellow sand, gray moss, green foliage, blue sky; the pearl of the dawn, the purple shadows on the mountains, the golden islands floating in crimson seas at sunset, the pallid moon sailing through the shredded cloud-rack, the star-jewels glittering in the wastes of space--none of them is of any practical value, so far as I can see, but because they have color and majesty, that is enough for her, and she loses her mind over them. If she could quiet down and keep still a <b>couple</b> <b>minutes</b> at a time, {{it would be a}} reposeful spectacle.
