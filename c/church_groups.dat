The festival normally centres on a charity gala day in June, when various groups including Scouts, <b>church</b> <b>groups</b> and schools parade through the town, finishing with a large fête in the grounds of Swakeleys House. Fireworks mark the end of the festival in the evening. The festival Gala moved to the grounds of Vyners School in 2014 after a dispute with the owner of Swakeleys House.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} {{to requests for}} international aid was moderate. American <b>church</b> <b>groups,</b> Cuba, and Mexico collectively contributed around 2,500tons of food and medicine. The Canadian, Swedish, West German, Spanish, and Dutch Governments contributed aid amounting to 2million dollars (1988) each. No aid was sent by the United States government. The Soviet Union contributed an unknown sum. The slow {{response to}} requests for aid was contributed to by the Sandinista Government's actions, which was viewed by a few anonymous diplomats from other countries who commented to the press, as undermining the peace process championed by Óscar Arias. Those actions were the July 10 arrests of opposition activists and the closing down of independent radio stations. In addition, the government also barred foreign humanitarian groups from receiving American aid, as well as turning back a relief shipment days before the storm.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Western {{societies}} {{which in}} {{their opposition to}} slavery spawned anti-slavery movements whose numbers and enthusiasm often grew out of <b>church</b> <b>groups,</b> no such grass-roots organizations ever developed in Muslim societies. In Muslim politics the state unquestioningly accepted the teachings of Islam and applied them as law. Islam, by sanctioning slavery, also extended legitimacy to the traffic in slaves.|$|E

25|$|Bjelke-Petersen {{was opposed}} by Sir Robert Sparkes, <b>church</b> <b>groups</b> {{and the federal}} {{government}} over a 1982 push to abolish Aboriginal and Islander community reserves and to give title to the reserve lands to local councils elected by communities—titles that could be revoked by the government for unspecified reasons. Bjelke-Petersen claimed there were over-riding issues of defence and security because of fears of a communist plot to create a separate black nation in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s were {{a decade}} of loss for Parks in her {{personal}} life. Her family was plagued with illness; {{she and her husband}} had suffered stomach ulcers for years and both required hospitalization. In spite of her fame and constant speaking engagements, Parks was not a wealthy woman. She donated most of the money from speaking to civil rights causes, and lived on her staff salary and her husband's pension. Medical bills and time missed from work caused financial strain that required her to accept assistance from <b>church</b> <b>groups</b> and admirers.|$|E

25|$|Trust in {{government}} and in politicians has decreased in many nations. However, {{the first signs of}} decreasing voter turnout occurred in the early 1960s, which was before the major upheavals of the late 1960s and 1970s. Robert D. Putnam argues that the collapse in civil engagement is due to the introduction of television. In the 1950s and 1960s, television quickly became the main leisure activity in developed nations. It replaced earlier more social entertainments such as bridge clubs, <b>church</b> <b>groups,</b> and bowling leagues. Putnam argues that as people retreated within their homes and general social participation declined so too did voting.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, the Panama YMCA {{was given}} its {{first piece of}} property, a 40-acre (16 ha) piece of land for a day camping and nature centre site, {{allowing}} it to expand its programmes. The camp allowed the Panama YMCA to expand a great deal and became a major resource for various programmes. The camp also {{was used as a}} conference centre. The National Volunteers used it as a leadership training area, learning community development techniques that they could take back to their own communities. The Girl and Boy Scouts as well as <b>church</b> <b>groups</b> also used the area.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the fate}} of control of church {{buildings}} was decided by the church parishes, but as most refused to follow Filaret, paramilitaries, especially in Volyn and Rivne Oblasts where there was strong nationalist sympathy amongst the new regional authorities, carried out raids bringing property under their control. The lack of parishes in eastern and southern Ukraine prompted President Kravchuk to intervene and force the still closed buildings since the Communist times to re-open under the UOC-KP's ownership. Upon the 1994 election of Leonid Kuchma, most of the violence was promptly stopped, and the presidency adopted a de facto neutrality regime to all the four major <b>church</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
50|$|The John Howard Society {{was created}} in 1867 by a <b>church</b> <b>group</b> focused on {{providing}} spiritual care to prisoners in a Toronto prison. Later in 1874, this group became recognized as the Prisoners Aid Association of Toronto. Also around this time, they discovered more was needed by this group of prisoners than the spiritual care they had been providing. Unfortunately, World War I had immense effects on the <b>church</b> <b>group</b> and interest in their work decreased.|$|R
