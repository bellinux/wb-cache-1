Session I- 2 : Sectoral {{innovation}} systemsThis paper aims {{to discuss the}} major factors that affect the <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> of countries in different sectoral systems. The paper is organized as follows. After {{an introduction to the}} <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> of countries in general, Section 2 puts forward the claim that <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> of countries has been usually associated with the emergence and growth of some leading sectors. These sectors are characterized by sectoral systems that differ greatly in their characteristics and dynamics. The notion of sectoral system is discussed in general in Section 3, while in Section 4 some basic evidence on the factors affecting <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> of countries in different sectoral systems is discussed. Then in Section 5 differences in the <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> across countries but in the same sectoral system are discussed. The paper then concludes discussing the <b>Catch</b> <b>up</b> Project which is underway and, among other issues, aims to tackle <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> in sectoral systems...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>ups</b> by hand: When {{the actual}} {{conversion}} entails {{only a small}} amount of time, or the complexity of information that should be transferred to the new system is small, an organization can choose to transfer the <b>catch</b> <b>ups</b> manually. The advantage of this procedure {{is that there is no}} need for a system (software program) to transfer the information and the possible problems that come with such kind of a transfer-program. The trade-off is accuracy and time. It takes a considerable amount of extra time, to transfer the <b>catch</b> <b>ups</b> manually and it is more vulnerable for small human errors (Rooijmans, 2003). Moreover, the additional investment in labour hours is high already; a manual <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> system places even more pressure on the personnel.|$|R

Bart escapes and runs away with the lizards, but before he can get away, Skinner <b>catches</b> <b>up</b> to him and they both struggle on top of the building.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} demand for TV {{contents}} on online <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> platforms, {{in order to assess}} how <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> TV offers transform TV consumption. We build upon empirical data on French TV consumption in June 2011 : a daily monitoring of online audience on web <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> platforms, and live audience ratings of traditional broadcast TV. We provide three main results: 1) online consumption is more concentrated than off-line audience, contradicting the hypothesis of a long tail effect of <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> TV; 2) the temporality of replay TV consumption on the web is very close to the live broadcasting of the programs, thus softening rather than breaking the synchrony of traditional TV; 3) detailed data on online consumption of news reveals two patterns of consumption (“alternative TV ritual ” vs. “à la carte”) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{cause of}} {{narcosis}} {{is related to}} the increased solubility of gases in body tissues, {{as a result of the}} elevated pressures at depth (Henry's law). Modern theories have suggested that inert gases dissolving in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes cause narcosis. More recently, researchers have been looking at neurotransmitter receptor protein mechanisms as a possible cause of narcosis. The breathing gas mix entering the diver's lungs will have the same pressure as the surrounding water, known as the ambient pressure. After any change of depth, the pressure of gases in the blood passing through the brain <b>catches</b> <b>up</b> with ambient pressure within a minute or two, which results in a delayed narcotic effect after descending to a new depth. Rapid compression potentiates narcosis owing to carbon dioxide retention.|$|E
