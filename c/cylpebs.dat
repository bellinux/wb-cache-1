40|$|<b>Cylpebs</b> are {{slightly}} tapered cylindrical grinding media with {{a ratio of}} length to diameter of unity. The manufactures have made conflicting claims regarding the milling performance of <b>Cylpebs</b> in comparison with balls. One major point of interest is which one grinds finer at the same operating conditions. The difficulty in comparison {{is due to the}} shape difference. The two grinding media have different surface area, bulk density and contact mechanisms in grinding action. Comparative tests were conducted using the two types of grinding media in a laboratory Bond ball mill at various conditions of equality such as media mass, size distribution, surface area and input specific energy. The laboratory results indicate that at the same specific energy input level the <b>Cylpebs</b> produce a product with slightly less oversize due to their greater surface area, but essentially the same sizing at the fine end as that produced with the balls. The reason may be that the advantage of greater surface area is balanced by the line contact and area contact grinding actions with the <b>Cylpebs.</b> A new ball mill scale-up procedure [Man, Y. T., 2001. Model-based procedure for scale-up of wet, overflow ball mills, Part 1 : outline of the methodology. Minerals Engineering 14 (10), 1237 - 1246] was employed to predict grinding performance of an industrial mill from the laboratory test results. The predicted full scale operation was compared with the plant survey data. Some problems in the original scale-up procedures were identified. The scale-up procedure was therefore modified to allow the predicted ball mill performance to match the observed one. The calibrated scale-up procedure was used to predict the <b>Cylpebs</b> performance in the full scale industrial mill using the laboratory tests results. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Student number : 0318567 G School of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering Faculty of EngineeringComminution is an {{important}} process in mineral processing, power plants, cement production and pharmaceutical industries. It is costly and an inefficient process in terms of energy requirements and steel consumption related to grinding media and liners. Spherical grinding media are predominantly used in final stages of ore grinding. The spherical balls change shape through breakage and wear. Though this is universal in milling, its contribution and effect on milling kinetics, load behaviour and mill power is not fully established. One area that is usually ignored {{is the relationship between}} media shape and mill power. The objective of this dissertation was to investigate how media shape affects grinding. Ball size distribution inside an industrial mill was analysed in terms of shapes and sizes. Load behaviour, mill power and breakage as affected by media shapes were studied in a pilot laboratory mill. An inductive proximity probe, light emitting diode, phototransistor and video photographs were used to determine the load orientation in terms of toe and shoulder positions. A load beam was used to measure the torque exerted by the charge. The variation in load orientation and mill power with speed among different media shapes was observed. Higher shoulder positions were noted with <b>cylpebs</b> than with worn and spherical balls. The power increased to a maximum with increasing mill speed for all media shapes reaching its peak at different mill speeds for the three shapes studied. Variations of breakage rates with media shapes were found; higher breakage rates were noted with spherical media but the differences narrows with decreasing feed size and increasing material fractional filling U. Considering that worn balls in an industrial mill charge constitute about 15 to 40 percent and that the highest difference in breakage rate observed being nine percent for purely one shape charge; it is very doubtful whether it is worthwhile in attempting to develop techniques for removing worn balls from the mill...|$|E
