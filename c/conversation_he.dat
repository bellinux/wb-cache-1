5|$|Even before Neptune's discovery, some {{speculated that}} one planet alone {{was not enough}} to explain the discrepancy. On 17 November 1834, the British amateur {{astronomer}} the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a <b>conversation</b> <b>he</b> had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.|$|E
5|$|Syme {{argued that}} {{it was a mistake to}} regard it as a {{historical}} work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the History is primarily a literary product – an exercise in satire produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and Marius Maximus were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of Tacitus. (The History implausibly makes the Emperor Tacitus (275–276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the Quadriga tyrannorum — the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of Probus — the History itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term mythistoricis occurs nowhere else in Latin. Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of Aurelian, in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed <b>conversation</b> <b>he</b> had with the City Prefect of Rome during the festival of Hilaria in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.|$|E

25|$|Radovich {{had to take}} jobs {{outside of}} {{professional}} football. One was waiting tables at Los Angeles's Brown Derby restaurant. There he met Joseph Alioto, a former antitrust litigator with the Justice Department.

25|$|In <b>conversation</b> <b>he</b> {{once told}} the ultramontane Bishop Michael Corrigan that before his {{conversion}} {{he thought of}} becoming a Jesuit, and before his consecration a Redemptorist, but from both intentions his director dissuaded him. In addition to the volume on the Church on New York he wrote the Memoirs of Simon Gabriel Brute, First Bishop of Vincennes (New York, 1855), about Simon Bruté.|$|E
25|$|In late February 1974, Hampton and a DEA {{informant}} {{known as}} Hutton were playing {{pool at the}} Pud bar in St. Louis when Hampton noticed the needle marks on Hutton's arms.

25|$|During {{the press}} conference called by defense attorneys, one of Meinhof's lawyers, Michael Oberwinder, stated that {{it was less than}} a week before Meinhof's death that they had a very {{involved}} <b>conversation.</b> <b>He</b> claimed that there was not the least sign of depression or lack of interest on her part, and that it was an animated discussion in the context of which Meinhof explained the group's point of view.|$|E

5000|$|The {{story is}} a third-person limited narrative, with {{the point of view}} entirely that of Simon Wood—his thoughts, {{feelings}} and memories, the things he sees and experiences, <b>conversations</b> <b>he</b> has, <b>conversations</b> <b>he</b> overhears. The novel opens at Simon's boarding school in the south of England, where the poisonous atmosphere of bullying and denigration has nurtured Simon's [...] "devils", as he describes his blind rages. He first sees Joe Moreton there, when the man has given Simon's mother a lift to an event at the school. Simon loathes him at first sight and regards him as a [...] "yob", unimpressed by his fame as an artist.|$|R

25|$|In 1889, Zwemer co-founded with James Cantine at the Seminary, the American Arabian Mission. Zwemer saw {{his first}} {{milestone}} in his ministry as leaving for Arabia in 1890 to work {{directly with the}} Muslim community. At this time, his main mode of evangelism was distribution of literature and personal <b>conversation.</b> <b>He</b> combined models of confrontational and a more irenic approach of presenting the love of Christ, ‘characteristic of the student volunteers’. Stories of his spontaneous interaction with people suggest {{that he was a}} capable and creative personal evangelist.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} seven years of his {{residence}} at Leiden his reputation was at its highest point. His literary judgement was unquestioned. From his throne at Leiden he ruled the learned world; a word from him could make or mar a rising reputation, and {{he was surrounded by}} young men eager to listen to and profit from his <b>conversation.</b> <b>He</b> encouraged Grotius when only a youth of sixteen to edit Capella. At the early death of the younger Douza he wept as at that of a beloved son. Daniel Heinsius, at first his favourite pupil, became his most intimate friend.|$|E
25|$|On 17 January 2007, Rebecca Johnstone, a 19-year-old {{cancer patient}} from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, {{received}} a surprise {{phone call from}} Beckham.

On 1 July 2007, Beckham appeared as a speaker at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death.

25|$|Marlon Brando was {{the first}} to bring a natural {{approach}} to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that <b>conversation</b> <b>he</b> would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, Listen To Me Marlon, he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals. He was calling them predictable. Critics would later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860 Democratic National Convention at Charleston, South Carolina, Butler {{initially}} supported John C. Breckinridge for President, {{but then}} shifted his support to Jefferson Davis, believing {{that only a}} moderate Southerner could keep the Democratic party from dividing. A <b>conversation</b> <b>he</b> had with Davis prior to the convention convinced him that Davis might be such a man, and he gave him his support before the convention split over slavery. Butler ended up supporting Breckinridge over Douglas against state party instructions, ruining his standing with the state party apparatus. He was nominated for governor in the 1860 election by a Breckinridge splinter of the state party, but trailed far behind other candidates.|$|E
25|$|Barry disliked {{being away}} from London not liking life in the country, he {{preferred}} the bustle and society of the city. He was an early riser, usually between four and six o'clock in the morning, he only needed {{four or five hours}} sleep. Preferring to do his thinking and designing in the morning, but was happy to have company while at work, liking to be read to or join in <b>conversation.</b> <b>He</b> had a dislike of public display, considering it hollow and lacking in conviction. His general disposition was sanguine, though he had a quick temper. He preferred science to literature, he frequently attended the Friday night lectures held at the Royal Institution.|$|E
50|$|The Very Rev. Canon Mark Kowalewski, rector of St. John's, {{noted that}} the changes were the {{culmination}} of years of <b>conversations.</b> <b>He</b> noted that when the current church was first built in the 1920s, its first rector, Fr.

50|$|Marsters' {{actions as}} head of the CICC and his {{subsequent}} behaviour on Palmerston Island were the subject of severe criticism in a 1994 book in which an American journalist visited Palmerston Island and reported on <b>conversations</b> <b>he</b> had had with many of the residents of the island.|$|R
50|$|Sears argues {{furthermore}} that babywearing exercises the child’s {{sense of}} balance; since {{a child who}} is worn on the mother’s experiences more of her <b>conversations,</b> <b>he</b> believes that babywearing is also beneficial for the child’s language acquisition. However, there are not studies that confirm such effects.|$|R
25|$|The {{rift between}} Gordon and Sievers climaxed on 14 July 1721 when, at a banquet commemorating {{the battle of}} 'Hango Head,' a violent quarrel broke out {{between the two men}} in the {{presence}} of the Tsar. Gordon complained about the Dane’s behaviour towards him and pointed out that, as Seivers was responsible for the appointments of lieutenants and all inferiors, he was appointing the best officers and men to the Danish and Dutch commanders. The General-Admiral, Count Apraxin, did his best to justify the actions of Rear Admiral Sievers and maintained that Gordon had falsely accused him of partiality when dividing the officers and men. During his <b>conversation</b> <b>he</b> referred to Gordon as ‘your admiral’ to Peter the Great which was not well received. As Sievers was going to leave the Tsar’s service at the end of the campaign, it was left like that. The next day Peter called the two admirals together and made them drink a glass of wine together hoping that this would end their bickering.|$|E
25|$|In 1847, {{during a}} seven-month visit to England, he was {{appointed}} conductor at the London Drury Lane Theatre by its then-musical director, the popular French musician Louis Antoine Jullien. He was impressed with its quality when he first heard the orchestra perform at a promenade concert. In London he also learned that he knew far more English than he had supposed, although still did not understand half of what was said in <b>conversation.</b> <b>He</b> began writing his Mémoires. During his stay in England, the February Revolution broke out in France. Berlioz arrived back in France in 1848, only to be informed {{that his father had}} died shortly after his return. He went back to his birthplace to mourn his father along with his sisters. Meanwhile, Harriet's health was declining due to alcohol abuse and she suffered a series of strokes that left her an invalid. Berlioz paid for four servants to look after her on a permanent basis and visited her almost daily. He began composition of his Te Deum.|$|E
