40|$|A {{stability}} {{analysis is}} performed {{to investigate the}} process {{which leads to the}} formation of <b>bottom</b> <b>forms,</b> when a thin layer of sediment covers a rigid substratum subject to the oscillatory flow induced by a surface gravity wave. The amplitude of the bottom perturbation is assumed to be so small to linearize the hydrodynamic problem and the flow field is determined by analytical means. However, nonlinear effects are significant and play a fundamental role into the morphodynamic problem, when the rigid substratum is bared by the growth of the most unstable mode. Hence, the development of the bottom profile is evaluated by a numerical approach. The model results show that the wavelength of the morphological patterns, which are generated when the rigid substratum is bared, is longer than the wavelength of the <b>bottom</b> <b>forms</b> which appear when the rigid substratum is always covered by the sediment. The results of the theoretical model are supported by some experimental observations made in our laboratory...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} process {{which leads to the}} formation of sand waves in shallow tidal seas characterised by a heterogeneous sea bed composition. The main goal of the analysis is the evaluation of the eﬀects that a graded sediment has on the formation of the <b>bottom</b> <b>forms</b> and the investigation of the sorting process induced by the growth of the <b>bottom</b> <b>forms.</b> The analysis is based on the study of the stability of the ﬂat bed conﬁguration, i. e. small amplitude perturbations are added to the ﬂat bottom and a linear analysis of their time development is made. For an oscillatory tidal current dominated by one tidal constituent, the results show that the graded sediment can stabilise or destabilise the ﬂat bottom conﬁguration with respect to the uniform sediment case, depending on the standard deviation σ ∗ of the grain size distribution and on the ratio r between the horizontal tidal excursion and the water depth. For moderate values of r, i. e. values just larger than the critical value for which the sediment is moved and sand waves appear, the presence of a sand mixture stabilises the ﬂat bed. On the other hand, for large values of r, the mixture has a destabilising eﬀect. In both cases the eﬀect that a sand mixture has on the stability of the ﬂat bed conﬁguration is relatively small. Moreover, for moderate values of r, the ﬁne fraction of the mixture tends to pile up at the crests of the <b>bottom</b> <b>forms</b> while the coarse fraction moves towards the troughs. For large values of r, the grain size distribution depends on the value of σ ∗. The results are physically interpreted and provide a possible explanation of the apparently conﬂicting ﬁeld observations of the grain size distribution along the sand wave proﬁle, carried out in the North Sea...|$|R
40|$|The {{process which}} leads to the {{appearance}} of sand banks in shallow seas is investigated by studying the growth of small amplitude perturbations of the sea bottom, forced by oscillatory tidal currents. Since the analysis of field data carried out by Dyer & Huntley (1999) shows that sand banks are likely to occur where the tidal ellipse is circular or characterized by a low ellipticity, attention is focused on small values of sqrt 1 -e^ 2, where e is the ratio between minor and major axes of the tidal ellipse. The linear analysis, which considers perturbations of small (strictly infinitesimal) amplitude, shows the existence of a critical value r_C of the Keulegan-Carpenter number r of the tide (r=U*/(h* omega*), U* and omega* being the amplitude and angular frequency of the velocity oscillations induced by the tide propagation and h* the averaged water depth) such that for r smaller than r_C the flat bottom configuration is stable while for r larger than r_C sand banks start to appear. Close to the critical condition, the wavelength of the most unstable mode turns out to be finite. Then, a weakly nonlinear analysis is developed which allows to evaluate the equilibrium amplitude of the <b>bottom</b> <b>forms</b> when the parameter r is close to its critical value. The configuration of the sea bottom, when the <b>bottom</b> <b>forms</b> attain their equilibrium, is characterized by the presence of long ridges, almost parallel to the main axis of the tidal ellipse, with crest-to-crests distances similar to those observed during field surveys. The crests of the <b>bottom</b> <b>forms</b> turn out to be flat and the extensive shallow waters at the crests are compensated by deep troughs between the ridges...|$|R

The Mendrel is then moved one width over, the process is repeated, and a continuous PRB is made.|$|R

50|$|The {{transport}} of Weddell Sea Bottom Water {{out of the}} Weddell Sea represents the outflow of newly <b>formed</b> <b>bottom</b> water plus entrained bottom water that enters the Weddell Sea from the southeast. Carmack and Foster estimated the production rate of bottom water from the mixing ratio of newly <b>formed</b> <b>bottom</b> water to entrained bottom water. Bottom water formation models based on hydrographic observations suggested that the <b>bottom</b> water <b>formed</b> {{at the edge of}} the continental shelf has an initial temperature of -1.4 to -1.2 °C. This range also represents the coldest bottom water observed at the base of the continental slope in the northwestern corner of the Weddell Sea. The fraction of newly <b>formed</b> <b>bottom</b> water in the outflowing WSBW ranges from about 12 to 31%, so the flow of newly <b>formed</b> <b>bottom</b> water out of the Weddell Sea is about 2 to 5 Sv.
