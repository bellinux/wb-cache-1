2500|$|The main {{thoroughfare}} of Huntington Beach, Beach Boulevard, was originally a <b>cattle</b> <b>route</b> {{for the main}} industry of the Rancho. [...] Since its time as a parcel of the enormous Spanish land grant, Huntington Beach has undergone many incarnations. One time it was known as Shell Beach, the town of Smeltzer, and then Gospel Swamp for the revival meetings that were held in the marshland where the community college Golden West College can currently be found. Later it became known as Fairview and then Pacific City, as it developed into a tourist destination. In order to secure access to the Pacific Electric Red Car lines that used to criss-cross Los Angeles and ended in Long Beach, Pacific City ceded enormous power to railroad magnate Henry E.

Within the decade of the 1960s however, Pupule was transformed slowly from a hamlet to a market town visited by many travelers. A mission RCM school was opened in 1958 in Kwajji and later transferred to Pupule in 1969. An Area court was established, with a Native Police Dandoka outpost. Later a health dispensary was built and an agricultural input and extension services office was also located there. There came a Works department road maintenance camp, <b>cattle</b> <b>route</b> rest house as well placed on the outskirts of town.

This paper on local land management in Benin with special reference to pastoral groups presents some fmdings in Kemon and Kokey villages. In both villages, land is still under common law to varying degrees despite modern law No 65 - 25 of 14 * August entitled 'Régime de la propriété foncière'. Crop damage by cattle in areas where agriculture has become more widespread and the blocking of <b>cattle</b> <b>routes</b> are identified as the major causes of conflict between herders and farmers. Resolution of this tension calls for the intervention of local organisations. Conflicts are settled either through amicable settlement or compensation but unfortunately it is the herder in many cases who is still blamed for erop damage...|$|R

5000|$|... "Of the {{principal}} routes by which Texas Longhorn cattle were taken afoot to railheads to the north, the earliest and easternmost was the Shawnee Trail. Used before and {{just after the}} Civil War, the Shawnee Trail gathered cattle from east and west of its main stem, which passed through Austin, Waco, and Dallas. It crossed the Red River at Rock Bluff, near Preston, and led north along {{the eastern edge of}} what became Oklahoma, a route later followed closely by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. The drovers took over a trail long used by Indians in hunting and raiding and by southbound settlers from the Midwest; the latter called it the Texas Road. North of Fort Gibson the <b>cattle</b> <b>route</b> split into terminal branches that ended in such Missouri points as St. Louis, Sedalia, Independence, Westport, and Kansas City, and in Baxter Springs and other towns in eastern Kansas. Early drovers referred to their route as the cattle trail, the Sedalia Trail, the Kansas Trail, or simply the trail. Why some began calling it the Shawnee Trail is uncertain, but the name may have been suggested by a Shawnee village on the Texas side of the Red River just below the trail crossing or by the Shawnee Hills, which the route skirted on the eastern side before crossing the Canadian River." ...|$|E

2500|$|The real influx came in 1848, when a gold {{strike on}} the American {{set off the}} California Gold Rush. Within one year, the {{population}} of the San Joaquin Valley increased by more than 80,000. The city of Stockton, on the lower San Joaquin, quickly grew from a sleepy backwater to a thriving trading center, the stopping-off point for miners headed to the gold fields {{in the foothills of the}} Sierra. Rough ways such as the Millerton Road which later became the Stockton - Los Angeles Road quickly extended the length of the valley, some following old <b>cattle</b> <b>routes</b> and Native American trails, and were served by mule teams and covered wagons. Riverboat navigation quickly became an important transportation link on the San Joaquin River, and during the [...] "June Rise", as boat operators called the San Joaquin's annual high water levels during snowmelt, large craft could make it as far upstream as Fresno. During the peak years of the gold rush, the river in the Stockton area was reportedly crowded with hundreds of abandoned oceangoing craft, whose crew had deserted for the gold fields. The multitude of idle ships was such a blockade that at several occasions they were burned just to clear a way for riverboat traffic.|$|R

40|$|Rinderpest (RP) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{recorded}} plagues of livestock in many parts of the world. It is considered as one of the dreadful diseases that caused losses in livestock in the Sudan during the last century. In 2001 the Pan African Programme for Control of Epizootics (PACE) was started in Sudan aiming mainly for complete eradication of Rinderpest and to declare Sudan free of Rinderpest. PACE Sudan is a continuation of the Joint project which was implemented between 1962 and 1976 and the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign (PARC) that began in Sudan in 1989 and continued to 1993. During the three projects, millions of cattle were vaccinated and the number of Rinderpest outbreaks was greatly reduced due to mass vaccination of the animals. This study was carried out to investigate the prevalence rate of anti bodies to Rinderpest virus in Unity state and participatory disease search in eastern <b>cattle</b> <b>route</b> (Murhal) of west Kordofan state. The study was done following the recommended standards of the Office International Des Epizooties (OIE). Serum samples were collected from non vaccinated cattle in different locations of Unity state. A total of 280 serum samples were collected from Bentiu, Rub- Kona, Nialdiue, Thoan, Thar, Guiy, Kilo 50 and Abyemnem. Participatory Epidemiology methods were used for field data of vaccination figures, treatment figures and main problems and diseases affecting livestock in the study area, The methods used for data collection were including semi structured interviews, questionaires, seasonal calendars and the records of the veterinary authorities and non governmental organizations in the area which were used as a secondary data sources. A competitive enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (C- ELISA) test was used to study the prevalence of antibodies to Rinderpest virus in the cattle serum samples. The total percentage of prevalence of antibodies to Rinderpest virus in different locations of Unity state was found to be 15, 4 % and the prevalence rate was found to be higher in the age group 5 - 10 years, while it was very low in young calves and very old cattle. The different locations of Unity state showed different percentages of Rinderpest antibodies levels which was due to variations of vaccination coverage done by the community animal health workers (CAHWs), no antibodies found in cattle from Bentiu and Thar area which are in the middle of the state, while the highest levels of antibodies was found in the southern part of the state and other locations in the middle and northern parts of the state. The participatory epidemiological investigation revealed that the herders in Unity state and eastern <b>cattle</b> <b>route,</b> had a specific knowledge of the clinical signs of Rinderpest and they are well aware of the role of wildlife in the transmission of the disease. It was found that the community animal health workers (CAHWs) played an important role in eradicating Rinderpest from Unity state and eastern <b>cattle</b> <b>route</b> (Murhal).

30|$|Several {{mechanisms}} {{for addressing the}} growing issues of land use in northern and central Nigeria have included the mapping and demarcation of <b>cattle</b> <b>routes</b> and the ongoing promotion of grazing reserve establishment (Adebowale [2014]; Buhari [2009]; IRIN [2009]). However, despite numerous attempts by both government and international organisations to improve the land rights situation, rising tensions in northern Nigeria have resulted in `horrific internecine violence’ (HRW [2013]) over the last 20 years. Kaduna and Plateau States - the sites of this research - have been the worst affected, with over 10, 000 deaths since 2010 (HRW [2009], [2013]). Although largely attributed in the press to religious conflict between the indigene Christians and non-indigene Muslims (HRW [2001], [2009]), {{there are many who}} believe that tensions are purely economic in nature (Abbass [2010]; A. Okello, personal communication). Calls are gaining momentum for the government to `end the rhetoric’ and take concrete legislative steps to address the `policy and legal vacuum’ that is exacerbating the conflict between pastoralists and crop producers (Ibrahim [2012]; PARE [2012]; Adebayo and Olaniyi [2008]). Others believe that the current levels of `tribal, religious and political polarisation’ are overwhelming any efforts to promote peace in central Nigeria, with the view that `sadly, any hope of government intervention or fair reviews of land tenure and natural resource use laws is unlikely’ (Majekodunmi [2012]).|$|R
30|$|Grazing {{reserves}} {{are struggling to}} meet the needs of pastoralists in Nigeria today (Okeke 2014). The incidence of violent farmer-herder clashes has reached intolerable levels and is an issue of national concern. In 2012, the Fulani appealed to the federal government and a grazing reserve (National Assembly 2011) was proposed to appropriate land for grazing in all 36 states of the federation. This was met by furious opposition across Nigeria, but with particularly strong opposition from the Middle belt. The main arguments were that other Nigerian citizens can only acquire land by inheritance or purchase and pay for premises and inputs to run their businesses, and there was reluctance for Fulani to be given these assets for free. The question was raised ‘why should government appropriate land from other Nigerians to support Fulani livelihoods?’, and the feeling was that they should lease or purchase land for pasture and that the government could support them by overseeing such negotiations (Okeke 2014). This bill and two others (one duplicating and the other in direct opposition to it) were withdrawn by the senate in 2016 as they were judged unconstitutional. Instead, the House of Assembly committee recommended reclamation and development of all current grazing reserves under the 1965 Grazing Reserve Act (albeit that most were recognised as being severely encroached), clear demarcation and enforcement of <b>cattle</b> <b>routes</b> and support for cattle production within these protected areas. These recommendations are being implemented by some state governments with successful reduction of clashes (Okello et al. 2014).|$|R

No documentary evidence can be found to support either derivation; and by 1307, the name Holwey was applied to the district around the road. The main stretch of Holloway Road runs through the site of the former villages of Tollington and Stroud. The exact time of their founding is not known, but the earliest record of them dates from the Domesday Book.
