50|$|Soil compactors {{are used}} to perform test methods which cover {{laboratory}} compaction methods {{used to determine the}} relationship between molding water content and dry unit weight of soils. Soil placed as engineering fill is compacted to a dense state to obtain satisfactory engineering properties such as, shear strength, compressibility, or permeability. In addition, foundation soils are often compacted to improve their engineering properties. Laboratory compaction tests provide the basis for determining the percent compaction and molding water content needed to achieve the required engineering properties, and for controlling construction to assure that the required compaction and water contents are achieved. Test methods such as EN 13286-2, EN 13286-47, ASTM D698, ASTM D1557, AASHTO T99, AASHTO T180, AASHTO T193, BS 1377:4 provide soil <b>compaction</b> <b>testing</b> procedures.|$|E

As a result, MoDOT is investigating <b>compaction</b> <b>testing</b> alternatives to the nuclear density gauge which can provide the necessary results at a lower life cycle cost. The investigation comprised a comprehensive review of previous research into <b>compaction</b> <b>testing</b> alternative as well as key findings and gaps in research. This led to the purchase of XX pieces of alternative test equipment which were employed simultaneously alongside the nuclear density gauge on four large structural fill projects. The field testing yielded a set of comparable test results taken at the same time, in roughly the same location, and under the same environmental conditions, and arguably making this research the most comprehensive study of <b>compaction</b> <b>testing</b> technology on record. The dissertation discusses MoDOT 2 ̆ 7 s Quality Management program 2 ̆ 7 s development and links to its origin in Design-Build project best practices, which provided the motivation to seek alternatives to the nuclear density gauge.

The effects of tire shred size, tire shred–sand mixing ratio and confining pressure on the interaction between the geogrid and tire shred–sand mixtures are evaluated. Three sizes of tire shreds are considered: tire chips (with 9. 5 mm nominal size), tire shreds 50 -to- 100 mm long and tire shreds 100 -to- 200 mm in length, with mixing ratios of 0, 12, 25 and 100 % of tire shreds in the mixtures (by weight).

The pullout resistance of a geogrid embedded in tire shred–sand mixtures is significantly higher than that of the same geogrid embedded in tire shreds only. The size of the tire shreds has negligible effect on the pullout resistance of a geogrid embedded in mixtures prepared with either low (12 / 88 mix) or high (100 / 0 mix) tire shred content.

Mechanization is now widely accepted and adopted, especially for the collection and evacuation of fresh fruit bunches and the application of fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide. Soil compaction has become the major problem in the modem agriculture. Overuse of machinery and repeated passed of heavy axle load had adverse effect to the plantation soil over the years. The compaction increases soil strength as well as decreasing the soil physical fertility through shrinking of the storage and supply of water and nutrients leading to more fertiliser input required thus increasing the production cost.

Thus, there is a direct need for a simple and rapid procedure which can be used in order to assess the compaction quality of such fills and, if possible, also improves the converage of the areas to be tested. The objective of the research project was to process the following questions: Can compaction tests be used in order to assess the compaction quality of fills {{consisting of}} rock or soils with high stone and boulder proportions by means of measurement of the settlement? Which electronic measuring systems available in geodesy today are most suitable for corresponding compaction tests and where are the limits of the application by means of measurement of the settlement?

A corresponding evaluation of the data from trial compaction fields carried out confirmed the theoretically derived connections.

Urban development of the Port Hills has encountered difficulties due to loess erosion, and in some instances, contributed to erosion. Lime stabilisation is one remedial method {{that can be used}} to reduce erosion problems. This necessitates investigation of the changes to soil properties and strength gains that occur to the loess with the addition of lime. An erodible loess colluvium, from a subdivision with a history of erosion problems, was stabilised with 1 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 %, and 10 % hydrated lime, and cured under various laboratory conditions. Pinhole erodibility, uniaxial swelling strain, Atterberg limits, grainsize analysis, Proctor <b>compaction</b> <b>testing</b> and a slaking test were used to determine the improvements to soil properties with the addition of lime. Unconfined compressive strength was tested to determine strength gains of lime stabilised soil. The addition of 1 % lime to the soil produced a non-erodible, non-dispersive material. Slaking and swelling were minimised with the addition of higher percent ages of lime (5 %- 7. 5 % respectively). The effective grainsize of the soil was increased on the addition of lime, and plasticity was increased with the addition of up to 5 % lime. Optimum moisture content increases, and dry density decreases with increasing amounts of lime. Strength gains of the lime stabilised loess, varied from 3 – 14 times the strength of the untreated soil depending on the curing method. Strength gains were greatest for air dried samples, although the untreated soil cured in the same manner had a higher dry strength than the lime stabilised soil. Strength gains are optimised at and above 7. 5 % lime with significant strength losses recorded between 2 % and 5 % lime. Strain deformation is reduced with the addition of lime, and the modulus of deformation is increased significantly indicating that lime stabilised loess acts as a brittle material on deformation. The addition of lime to loess in low percentages (1 %), has the effect of producing a non-erodible, non-dispersive material that resists erosion.

40|$|The {{traditional}} methods of evaluating the compaction quality of pavement subbase and subgrade construction require considerable time and resources. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for a safe, reliable, rapid, and cost-effective field measurement technique for <b>compaction</b> <b>testing</b> of unbound pavement layers. The Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD) is one such mechanism that offers field measurement of deflections and stiffness of unbound pavement layers under a given load. The LWD is gaining increased attention for quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) during pavement construction. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) is planning on implementing the LWD in field QA/QC for unbound layers of pavements. As such, this research investigates the feasibility of developing statistical limits for the compaction of specified combinations of subbase and subgrade materials in terms of their maximum allowable LWD deflections. Statistical limits were developed for six of the most common subgrade, subbase, or subgrade-subbase combinations that are used for highway pavement construction in Indiana: lime modified, cement modified, natural subgrade and No. 53 crushed stone (53 CS) subbase overlaying these subgrades. For the subbase layers, these statistical limits are applicable only to six inches of subbase over subgrade and may not be applicable to a different layer configuration in terms of the number of lifts or thickness of lifts. The ultimate goal is for the developed statistical limits to replace the need for site-specific LWD limits derived from the onsite test sections, ultimately saving time and money. Due to variability in the data and data limitations, caution must be exercised when generalizing the findings published in this report. Compared to the data from the acceptance test sections, the data collected from test sections saw less variability between projects, for any given material type. The test section data yielded maximum allowable deflections that did not vary significantly between projects for cement- and lime-modified subgrade, non modified subgrade, and six inches of # 53 crushed stone over lime-modified subgrade. Generally, within any specific contract location (project site), the data indicates adequate confidence that the test pads generate control measurements that can be used reliably to check the adequacy of compaction at that contract location. However, across different contact locations, even for the same material type, so much variability was observed that it is not possible to guarantee that the control measurements generated from a limited number of test sections (pads) can be confidently transferred to another site of the same material type...|$|E
40|$|The prime {{objective}} of the research reported in this thesis {{was to develop a}} procedure to characterise unbound, elastic, cross-anisotropic subgrade soils. The work comprised the design and manufacture of a new form of rigid-boundary, repeated-loading, true-triaxial test equipment, the development of a laboratory procedures and techniques for analysing the experimental data. In order to verify the validity of the procedure, the selected technique was implemented on a typical, unbound, fine-grained subgrade soil. The new repeated-loading, true-triaxial equipment consisted of an advanced pneumatic loading system which was controlled through a personal computer. The system provided a versatile control of forces in three perpendicular directions, enabling a good, if incomplete, simulation of the in-situ stress conditions in pavements. The test specimens consisted of an A- 6 silty clay, and were prepared using a cubical compaction mould. Two compaction methods were used. The first was the floating mould static compaction method and the second was a dynamic compaction method similar to the standard and modified <b>compaction</b> <b>testing</b> procedures. Two mathematical techniques were considered. The first was the simplified method proposed by Graham and Houlsby (1983) and the second was a least square solution introduced by Yang and Shackel (1995). For comparison, a least square solution for isotropic soils was proposed. The experiment embraced a study of the effects of stress conditions and the physical state conditions on the cross-anisotropic elastic behaviour. The stress factors consisted of the number of stress applications, the octahedral shear stress, the octahedral shear-to- normal stress ratio and the intermediate principal stress. The physical conditions consisted of the density, the degree of saturation and the method of compaction. The main conclusions drawn from this experiment were as follows. Firstly, the new repeated-loading cubical true-triaxial equipment enabled the measurement of the principal stresses and strains required to determine the elastic cross-anisotropic parameters with reasonably accuracy. Secondly, the experiment verified that, of the solutions considered, the use of Graham and Houlsby approach provided a better solution in interpreting the results of the cubical true-triaxial tests. This solution enabled the determination of the elastic parameters required to describe cross-anisotropic materials. Thirdly, the experiment justified the assumption of material anisotropy. Finally, the procedure introduced in this experiment has been proven to facilitate the study of material cross-anisotropy in material subjected to repeated loading similar to those commonly encountered in pavements...|$|E

The sample were set up by mixing soil samples with various content of fly ash at different water content in <b>compaction</b> <b>test</b> to obtain optimum dry unit weight and optimum water content. The optimum water content were used in CBR tests of mixture of soil sample-fly ash. The performance analysis of fly ash stabilized soil should be based on laboratory test such as engineering properties of soil, <b>compaction</b> <b>test</b> and CBR test. The strength gain in stabilization is depend on two factors which is fly ash content and water content. The variation content of fly ash were 3 %, 6 %, and 9 % by total weight. From the test, the fly as stabilization increased the CBR values for the mixture tested and has the potential to offer an alternative for clay soil subgrades improvement of highway construction...|$|R

The Compaction Forecasting Expert Database (CFED) is being developed by Caterpillar Inc. and the Center for Earthworks Engineering Research (CEER) to predict the compaction behavior of geomaterials and provide recommendations for earthwork construction. However, in {{the current version of}} CFED, the Proctor test is the only laboratory method used to evaluate compaction behavior of geomaterials, and it does not provide shear strength and stiffness properties of compacted geomaterials. The goal of this research was to improve the CFED by linking moisture-density-compaction energy relationships with shear strength and stiffness properties to predict and evaluate the compaction performance of geomaterials. The objectives of this study were to expand the CFED with more lab testing data; evaluate two laboratory tests, the Iowa K and gyration <b>compaction</b> <b>tests,</b> to quickly determine compaction behavior; and evaluate relationships between moisture content, density, compaction energy, shear strength, and stiffness parameters of geomaterials. A range of non-granular and granular geomaterials were tested to evaluate the performance of the Iowa K test and a gyratory <b>compaction</b> <b>test</b> equipped with a pressure distribution analyzer (PDA). The important outcomes of this research are that (1) the Iowa K <b>test</b> and gyratory <b>compaction</b> <b>test</b> with a PDA can simply, quickly, and inexpensively simulate field conditions, determine <b>compaction</b> behaviors, and <b>test</b> the shear strength and stiffness of compacted geomaterials; (2) moisture content and dry unit weight can significantly influence shear strength and stiffness properties of non-granular compacted geomaterials; and (3) gyratory <b>compaction</b> <b>tests</b> with a PDA results showed that the maximum aggregate size can significantly influence the shear resistance of granular geomaterials. Owners, contractors, and taxpayers will benefit from this research because the improved CFED will be a more cost-effective tool for predicting and monitoring the compaction performance of geomaterials...|$|R
