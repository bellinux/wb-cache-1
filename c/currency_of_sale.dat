40|$|This paper {{develops}} a general equilibrium exchange rate model {{consistent with the}} weak empirical evidence supporting the law of one price. Some firms segment markets by country, and set prices in local <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> a practice we refer to as pricing-to-market (PTM). The presence of PTM increases exchange rate volatility, relative to {{a situation where the}} law of one price holds. PTM also affects the international transmission of monetary and fiscal policy. The higher is the degree of PTM, the lower is the comovement in consumption across countries, but the higher is the comovement in output. In terms of welfare, monetary policy is a ‘‘beggar-thy-neighbor’ ’ instrument {{in the presence of a}} hig...|$|E

50|$|Mathematical {{approaches}} to modeling financial crises have emphasized {{that there is}} often positive feedback between market participants' decisions (see strategic complementarity). Positive feedback implies {{that there may be}} dramatic changes in asset values in response to small changes in economic fundamentals. For example, some models <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> crises (including that of Paul Krugman) imply that a fixed exchange rate may be stable {{for a long period of}} time, but will collapse suddenly in an avalanche <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>sales</b> in response to a sufficient deterioration of government finances or underlying economic conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The Act was a {{reaction}} to the growing concerns about excessive speculations of land after the Indian removal, which was mostly done with soft <b>currency.</b> The <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> public lands increased five times between 1834 and 1836. Speculators paid for these purchases with depreciating paper money. [...] While government law already demanded that land purchases be completed with specie or paper notes from specie-backed banks, a large portion of buyers used paper money from state banks not backed by hard money.|$|R

40|$|Local {{currency}} {{bond markets}} in emerging Asian economies have expanded dramatically since governments {{took steps to}} end the currency and maturity mismatches that savaged borrowers in the region's financial crisis nearly 20 years ago. Encouraged in part by regional cooperation {{programs such as the}} Asian Bond Markets Initiative, the value <b>of</b> local <b>currency</b> government and corporate bond sales has grown fourfold in the past decade, helping to fund much-needed infrastructure development and protect businesses from global financial shocks. However, much {{more needs to be done}} to strengthen market infrastructure and institutions, address inconsistent policies and regulations, and enhance corporate governance. This paper presents evidence that better macroeconomic performance and stronger institutions help develop larger local currency bond markets and also create conditions for the growth in local <b>currency</b> <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> corporate debt and bonds with longer maturities. Regional integration can be stepped up to support the key determinants for developing efficient local currency bond markets in emerging Asia...|$|R

Consequently, if during the <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> the lease the lessor alienated the leased property in terms of, say, a contract <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> the purchaser (and new owner) was not bound to recognise the lessees rights of occupation under the lease, unless he had undertaken to do so.|$|R
