25|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>tie,</b> {{also known}} as a zip tie or tie-wrap, is a type of fastener, {{especially}} for binding several electronic cables or wires together and to organize cables and wires. They have also been commonly used as makeshift handcuffs, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and in Panama. The <b>cable</b> <b>tie,</b> originally known as the Ty-Rap, was invented in 1958 by Maurus C. Logan, who worked for many years at Thomas & Betts. Logan filed U.S. patent #3,022,557 on June 24, 1958 which was issued to him on February 27, 1962.|$|E
2500|$|The {{police and}} {{prosecution}} maintained that he cable tied her hands {{behind her back}} in the bedroom in preparation for rape, and then used a <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> as a ligature to murder her when her blindfold slipped and she saw his face. When asked why he had abducted Tiernan, he replied: [...] "I have no idea". When police challenged his version of taking the body to Lindley Woods soon after the murder, he claimed that he had first kept the body hidden underneath pallets in his back garden, and then stored her inside his sofa.|$|E
2500|$|As police {{began to}} conduct {{thorough}} inquiries into Taylor's background, {{they discovered that}} he was a frequent user of lonely hearts advertisements. Through his telephone records they identified the women he had contacted in this way and began to interview them. One woman who had dated Taylor disclosed that Taylor told her he liked tying women up and locking them in a cupboard. Another said that Taylor had told her that he had a fetish for [...] "bondage, whips and ties", and [...] said that he wanted to tie her daughter up with cable ties and have sexual intercourse with her. A former girlfriend, who had briefly lived with Taylor, told police that she had often visited Lindley Woods with him while they were dating, and that she had eventually broke off the relationship with him because of his bondage fetish and the feeling [...] "that she was being raped". When asked by police to describe how Taylor would tie her, she described his practice of securing a plastic <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> around each of her wrists, then tying her hands behind her back by using a third <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> to link them. This was exactly how Tiernan had been found. She also said that Taylor kept a bundle of the cable ties in a drawer next to his bed. Two other women also said that Taylor enjoyed bondage during sex, and had bound their breasts and hands with cable ties.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} resistance to ultraviolet light in outdoor applications nylon containing a minimum of 2% carbon black is used to protect the polymer chains and extend the <b>cable</b> <b>tie's</b> service life. Blue <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> are supplied to the food industry and contain a metal additive {{so they can be}} detected by industrial metal detectors. <b>Cable</b> <b>ties</b> made of ETFE (Tefzel) are used in radiation-rich environments. Red <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> made of ECTFE (Halar) are used for plenum cabling.|$|R
50|$|Cables can be {{securely}} fastened and organized, such as by using trunking, <b>cable</b> trays, <b>cable</b> <b>ties</b> or <b>cable</b> lacing.

2500|$|In late September 2013, the San Diego County Medical Examiner's office {{released}} {{results of}} the autopsies of Christina and Ethan Anderson. [...] The autopsy of Christina Anderson found that a plastic <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> {{had been used to}} bind her ankles, and that duct tape was wrapped around her neck and mouth. Her right arm and both legs were fractured, and there was a cut on her neck. She had been struck at least twelve times in the head. The autopsy of Ethan Anderson determined that the boy died because of the fire, though he also had skeletal fractures that could have been caused by events the day of the murders.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> {{tensioning}} device or tool {{may be used}} to apply a <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> with a specific degree of tension. The tool may cut off the extra tail flush with the head in order to avoid a sharp edge which might otherwise cause injury.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>cable</b> <b>tie,</b> {{normally}} made of nylon, has {{a flexible}} tape section with teeth that engage with a pawl {{in the head}} to form a ratchet so that as the free end of the tape section is pulled the <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> tightens and does not come undone. Some ties include a tab that can be depressed to release the ratchet so that the tie can be loosened or removed, and possibly reused.|$|E

50|$|Rapstrap is {{a system}} of {{securing}} and bundling together cables, ropes, plants, etc. It is a reusable plastic strap that is wrapped around the cables, plants, or supports and then cut to size, similarly to <b>cable</b> <b>ties.</b> However, unlike <b>cable</b> <b>ties,</b> the excess that is cut off can be used again.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> {{consists}} of a flexible nylon tape with an integrated gear rack, and on one end a ratchet within a small open case. Once the pointed tip of the <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> has been pulled through the case and past the ratchet, it {{is prevented from being}} pulled back; the resulting loop may only be pulled tighter. This allows several cables to be bound together into a cable bundle and/or to form a cable tree.|$|E

50|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> (also {{known as}} a hose tie, steggel tie, zap strap or zip tie, and by the brand names Ty-Rap and Panduit strap) {{is a type of}} fastener, for holding items together, {{primarily}} electrical cables or wires. Because of their low cost and ease of use, cable ties are ubiquitous, finding use {{in a wide range of}} other applications. Stainless steel versions, either naked or coated with a rugged plastic, cater for exterior applications and hazardous environments.|$|E

50|$|A {{traditional}} form {{of plastic}} handcuffs are cable ties, with either two interlocking straps, {{or a single}} <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> around both wrists. More recently, plastics-manufacturing companies have started to produce special devices comprising two interconnected straps as one item. These are generally injection moulded nylon items, selling for tens of cents each. Various innovations on the plastic handcuff theme have been developed, including models which can be released using a regular handcuff key, and extremely lightweight restraints made from nylon cord, using a plastic device to hold the cord tight.|$|E
50|$|Cable {{ties are}} {{generally}} viewed as single-use devices; they are typically cut off rather than loosened and reused. However, if a closed loop {{needs to be}} opened again, rather than destroying the <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> by cutting, {{it may be possible}} to release the ratchet from the rack. While some cable ties are designed for reuse with a tab that releases the ratchet, in most cases a sewing needle or similar object (for example a small screwdriver) will need to be interposed between the ratchet and the rack. Ties reused in this way will be weaker than new ones.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea of the}} <b>cable</b> <b>tie</b> came to Logan while touring a Boeing {{aircraft}} {{manufacturing facility}} in 1956. Aircraft wiring was a cumbersome and detailed undertaking, involving thousands of feet of wire organized on sheets of 50-foot long plywood and held in place with knotted, waxcoated, braided nylon cord. Each knot had {{to be pulled tight}} by wrapping the cord around one's finger which sometimes cut the operator's fingers until they developed thick calluses or [...] "hamburger hands." [...] Logan was convinced there had to be an easier, more forgiving, way to accomplish this critical task.|$|E
