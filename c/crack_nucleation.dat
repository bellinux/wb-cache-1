50|$|In normal fatigue-testing {{of smooth}} specimens, about 90 percent {{is spent in}} <b>crack</b> <b>nucleation</b> and only the {{remaining}} 10 percent in crack propagation. However, in corrosion fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>nucleation</b> is facilitated by corrosion; typically, about 10 percent of life is sufficient for this stage. The rest (90 percent) of life is spent in crack propagation. Thus, it is more useful to evaluate crack-propagation behavior during corrosion fatigue. Fracture mechanics uses pre-cracked specimens, effectively measuring crack-propagation behavior. For this reason, emphasis is given to crack-propagation velocity measurements (using fracture mechanics) to study corrosion fatigue. Since fatigue crack grows in a stable fashion below the critical stress-intensity factor for fracture (fracture toughness), the process is called sub-critical crack growth. The diagram on the right shows typical fatigue-crack-growth behavior. In this log-log plot, the crack-propagation velocity is plotted against the applied stress-intensity range. Generally there is a threshold stress-intensity range, below which crack-propagation velocity is insignificant. Three stages may be visualized in this plot. Near the threshold, crack-propagation velocity increases with increasing stress-intensity range. In the second region, the curve is nearly linear and follows Paris' law(6); in the third region crack-propagation velocity increases rapidly, with the stress-intensity range leading to fracture at the fracture-toughness value. Crack propagation under corrosion fatigue may be classified as a) true corrosion fatigue, b) stress corrosion fatigue or c) a combination of true, stress and corrosion fatigue.|$|E

They typically follow linear elastic behavior, and under compressive forces experiences a plateau and recovery reminiscent of cellular solids {{as well as}} trabecular bone. The elastic modulus of natural bone ranges from 10 to 20 GPa; it requires a high stiffness to withstand constant mechanical load. Bone scaffolds must therefore be as stiff as natural bone, or the scaffold will fail through <b>crack</b> <b>nucleation</b> and propagation before the host tissue can regenerate. However, if the scaffold is significantly stiffer than the surrounding tissue, the elastic mismatch and continuity at the scaffold boundary with cause strain in the natural bone and could create unwanted defects.|$|E

Considering ferritic DCIs, ferritic matrix – graphite nodule debonding is only seldom observed and the main ferritic DCI damaging micromechanism consists in <b>cracks</b> <b>nucleation</b> and propagation in the graphite external shell coming from the reduced carbon solubility in γ phase during cooling process (“onion-like” mechanism). A second damaging micromechanism is sometimes observed together with the “onion-like” mechanism and consists in <b>cracks</b> <b>nucleation</b> and propagation corresponding to the graphite nodule center (“disgregation” mechanism). The importance of this damaging mechanism is dependent on the loading conditions and is probably influenced by the graphite nodule nucleation mechanism during solidification.

The essence of the method is the modelling of material damage development both by micromechanical and phenomenological approach.

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{deals with}} damage {{mechanisms}} in soda-lime glass subjected to particle impacts. Sandblasting experiments on glass using small-sized particles were performed and resulting damaged sites {{were analyzed by}} means of a 3 D optical profilometer. A particular attention is paid to determine the different morphologies of imprints and cracks with regard to particle size and impact velocity. The impacted sites show that damage patterns fairly coincide with those caused by static indentation; localized deformation and <b>cracks</b> <b>nucleation</b> are generated close to the impact zone. According to our previous work concerning the damage due to static indentation in glass (Ismail et al., Computational Materials Science 42 (2008) 407 - 415 [18]), the current paper takes advantage of the continuum damage mechanics (CDM) approach to simulate, via finite element analysis, the erosion behavior of soda-lime glass impacted with small-sized particles. Experimental data obtained by means of split Hopkinson pressure bar and drop ball tests are used to identify the parameters of the anisotropic stress-based damage evolution law. It is shown that the implemented anisotropic stress-based CDM model is able to predict the impact damage patterns experimentally observed. It is further shown that the removed volume in one impact site measured by 3 D profilometry is well captured by the anisotropic CDM model coupled with a vanishing element technique.

40|$|Using non-renewable {{fossil fuel}} energy {{resources}} {{has become a}} major concern in modern day society. Major efforts have been made to decrease the effect of such hazardous materials. Ethanol (CH 3 CH 2 OH, or EtOH) has been proven to be a promising alternative option to fuel. Approximately 10 - 15 % of the commercial fuel used nowadays is composed of fuel-grade ethanol (FGE). However, field failures due to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of carbon steel pipelines and storage tanks used in FGE transportation have been reported. Leaks are found at stress concentration points, such as heat affected zones and geometric discontinuities. Prior research on the effect of EtOH chemistry and electrochemical conditions on crack initiation, growth and propagation behavior has shown that contaminants and/or additives are important factors in causing SCC in FGE pipelines. The role of low frequency stress fluctuations on SCC initiation and propagation on the inner surface in FGE pipelines was not understood. The main objective of this research is to evaluate low frequency cyclic effects on SCC behavior under simulated conditions, and thus use the obtained information to optimize productivity and prevent catastrophe. A four-point bend test on a pipeline section immersed in an ethanol solution will be used to simulate the service conditions experienced during operation. It has been conjectured that SCC is not experienced with a static applied load below or above yield stress levels, therefore indicating that dynamic or cycling loading is required for SCC to occur. A smoother surface finish results in significantly less SCC than a rougher surface, emphasizing the importance of surface roughness in SCC behavior. A smaller R-ratio results in lower <b>crack</b> density, <b>nucleation</b> rate and <b>crack</b> velocity than larger R-ratios, hence indicating the importance of fluctuating stresses in SCC behavior. A higher cyclic frequency results in increasing <b>crack</b> density, <b>nucleation</b> rate, velocity and crack length, with a possible threshold leading to crack propagation.

30|$|The <b>cracks</b> <b>nucleation</b> and {{extension}} {{are the consequences}} of both the existence of tensile stress and exceeding the critical thickness during the growth process. We should explain {{the origin of the}} tensile stress. Many authors observed intrinsic tensile stress using in situ measurements of wafer bending curvature [20 – 22]. They found that the compressive stress appeared first, and then the compressive stress switched to steady tensile stress. This tensile stress was attributed to islands coalescence. This phenomenon was independent of the substrate. Hoffman [23] proposed that adjacent islands with vertical surface grew closer to one another and then elastically snapped together when the gap between the islands reached some critical size. The decrease of the solid-vapor interfacial energy balances the increase of the stress-related mechanical energy and grain boundary-related surface energy. Cracks will occur once the stressed films reach the critical thickness. Once the cracks have been introduced, an opening channel would be left. However, it is difficult to explain that the cracks do not extend to the surface and many cracks are buried in the consequence growth. Etzkom and Clarke [4] proposed several possibilities for the cracks that get closed up and buried: film lateral growth at the crack opening; concurrent diffusion transport by surface diffusion, driven by capillarity; and cracks face touch in cooling process. However, only at high temperature the atom have high diffusing rate. In our system, the temperature dropping from 1050 to 600 °C only needs 3 min. Some authors had calculated the Ga atom surface diffuse length and the value was less than 13 nm min- 1 at 1050 °C [24]. A large number of Ga and N atoms concurrent diffusion along the cracks surface are very difficult. If the healed part originates from the face touch in cooling, the crystal quality would be inferior to the uncracked part. In order to compare crystal quality of the cracks edge with that of healed part, the cross was etched for 2 min at 200 °C in mixed solution of H 2 SO 4 :H 3 PO 3 (3 : 1). Only crack edges were etched faster than those of the healed part, as shown in the Figure 6 b. It would be concluded that the lateral growth predominates in the healing process. The tensile stress was mainly relaxed by the cracks, but residual tensile stress also was present in the uncracked region [25]. The cracking will be reproduced in the uncracked region.|$|R

The effect of the microstructure of the A 1 Si 7 Mg cast alloys on damage <b>nucleation,</b> <b>crack</b> formation and compliance reduction is analysed. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
