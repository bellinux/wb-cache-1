40|$|The <b>Communication</b> Protocol <b>Software</b> was {{developed}} at the NASA Lewis Research Center to support the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite High Burst Rate Link Evaluation Terminal (ACTS HBR-LET). The HBR-LET is an experimenters terminal {{to communicate with the}} ACTS for various experiments by government, university, and industry agencies. The <b>Communication</b> Protocol <b>Software</b> is one segment of the Control and Performance Monitor (C&PM) Software system of the HBR-LET. The <b>Communication</b> Protocol <b>Software</b> allows users to control and configure the Intermediate Frequency Switch Matrix (IFSM) on board the ACTS to yield a desired path through the spacecraft payload. Besides IFSM control, the C&PM Software System is also responsible for instrument control during HBR-LET experiments, uplink power control of the HBR-LET to demonstrate power augmentation during signal fade events, and data display. The <b>Communication</b> Protocol <b>Software</b> User's Guide, Version 1. 0 (NASA CR- 189162) outlines the commands and procedures to install and operate the <b>Communication</b> Protocol <b>Software.</b> Configuration files used to control the IFSM, operator commands, and error recovery procedures are discussed. The <b>Communication</b> Protocol <b>Software</b> Maintenance Manual, Version 1. 0 (NASA CR- 189163, to be published) is a programmer's guide to the <b>Communication</b> Protocol <b>Software.</b> This manual details the current implementation of the software from a technical perspective.

The deal was first announced on July 6 of that year, with shareholders from both firms approving the merger on November 20. The merger was completed on November 22, 1995 and Delrina officially became part of Symantec. The deal made the merged company the fifth largest American software firm at the time.

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of {{semantics}} for an agent communication language. In particular, the semantics of Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML) is investigated. KQML is a language and protocol to support <b>communication</b> between (intelligent) <b>software</b> agents. Based on ideas from speech act theory, we present a semantic description for KQML that associates "cognitive" states of the agent {{with the use of the}} language's primitives (performatives). We have used this approach to describe the semantics for the whole set of reserved KQML performatives. Our research offers a method for a speech act theory-based semantic description of a language of communication acts. Languages of communication acts {{address the issue}} of <b>communication</b> between <b>software</b> applications at a level of abstraction that could prove particularly useful to the emerging software agents paradigm of software design and development. 1 Introduction This research is concerned with <b>communication</b> between <b>software</b> agents [13] [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} question we pursue {{is how to}} go beyond existing communication media to nurture <b>communication</b> in <b>software</b> development. Nurturing <b>communication</b> in <b>software</b> development is not about {{increasing the amount of}} communication but about increasing the quality of the communication experience in the context of software development. Existing studies have shown that different motives and needs are inherent when developers communicate with one another. Identifying coordination communication (c-comm for short) and expertise communication (e-comm) as two distinct types of communication, we characterize {{the difference between the two}} and discuss important factors to take into account in designing mechanisms to support each type of communication...|$|R
