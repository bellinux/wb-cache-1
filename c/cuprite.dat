Many high-quality mineral specimens have come from Bisbee area mines and {{are to be found}} in museum collections worldwide. Some of these minerals include <b>cuprite,</b> aragonite, wulfenite, malachite, azurite, and galena.|$|E
500|$|Copper is {{produced}} in massive stars and {{is present in the}} Earth's crust in a proportion of about 50 parts per million (ppm). It occurs as native copper, in the copper sulfides chalcopyrite and chalcocite, in the copper carbonates azurite and malachite, and in the copper(I) oxide mineral <b>cuprite.</b> [...] The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, US. Native copper is a polycrystal, with the largest single crystal ever described measuring 4.4×3.2×3.2cm.|$|E
2500|$|Oxide {{minerals}} {{are divided}} into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides. Simple oxides are characterized by O2− as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding. They can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations. The periclase group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio. Oxides with a 2:1 ratio include <b>cuprite</b> (Cu2O) and water ice. Corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as corundum (Al2O3), and hematite (Fe2O3). Rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2; the eponymous species, rutile (TiO2) is the chief ore of titanium; other examples include cassiterite (SnO2; ore of tin), and pyrolusite (MnO2; ore of manganese). [...] In hydroxides, the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion, OH−. Bauxites are the chief aluminium ore, and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals diaspore, gibbsite, and bohmite; they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions). [...] Finally, multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen. A major group within this class are the spinels, with a general formula of X2+Y3+2O4. Examples of species include spinel (MgAl2O4), chromite (FeCr2O4), and magnetite (Fe3O4). The latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism, which occurs as it has iron in two oxidation states (Fe2+Fe3+2O4), {{which makes it a}} multiple oxide instead of a single oxide.|$|E

50|$|Paramelaconite is a {{very rare}} mineral; many {{specimens}} purported as such are in fact mixtures of <b>cuprite</b> and tenorite. Paramelaconite forms as a secondary mineral in hydrothermal deposits of copper. It occurs in association with atacamite, chrysocolla, connellite, <b>cuprite,</b> dioptase, goethite, malachite, plancheite, and tenorite. The mineral {{has been found in}} Cyprus, the United Kingdom, and the United States.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cuprite</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1845 {{and the name}} derives from the Latin cuprum for its copper content.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral in copper deposits {{in association with}} olivenite, chalcophyllite, clinoclase, cornwallite, strashimirite, malachite, <b>cuprite</b> and limonite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cuprite</b> {{is found}} in the Ural Mountains, Altai Mountains, and Sardinia, and in more {{isolated}} locations in Cornwall, France, Arizona, Chile, Bolivia, and Namibia.|$|E
50|$|It is of {{secondary}} origin and {{forms in the}} oxidation zones of copper ore bodies. Associated minerals are quartz, limonite, azurite, malachite, <b>cuprite,</b> and other secondary copper minerals.|$|E
50|$|Submetallic {{minerals}} {{have similar}} lustre to metal, but are duller and less reflective. A submetallic lustre often occurs in near-opaque minerals with very high refractive indices, such as sphalerite, cinnabar and <b>cuprite.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the 1750s, colonists {{tried to}} mine copper at the Pahaquarry Copper Mine in Warren County. [...] The copper occurs as chalcocite, bornite, covellite, <b>cuprite,</b> and malachite, in {{quartzite}} of the Silurian High Falls Formation.|$|E
50|$|Condurrite {{is a name}} {{given to}} a mixture of <b>cuprite,</b> domeykite and tenorite. It {{takes its name from}} the Great Condurrow Mine at Troon, Cornwall in the United Kingdom, which is {{regarded}} as the type locality.|$|E
50|$|Copper {{occurs in}} its native form in Chile, China, Mexico, Russia and the USA. Various natural ores of copper are: copper pyrites (CuFeS2), <b>cuprite</b> or ruby copper (Cu2O), copper glance (Cu2S), malachite, (Cu(OH)2CuCO3), and azurite (Cu(OH)22CuCO3).|$|E
50|$|Supergene {{profiles}} can {{be developed}} above weathered examples of IOCG deposits, as exemplified by the Sossego deposit, Para State, Brazil, where typical oxidised copper minerals are present, e.g.; malachite, <b>cuprite,</b> native copper and minor amounts of digenite and chalcocite.|$|E

Many high-quality mineral specimens have come from Bisbee area mines and {{are to be found}} in museum collections worldwide. Some of these minerals include: <b>Cuprite,</b> aragonite, wulfenite, malachite, azurite, and galena.|$|E
50|$|The mine {{is located}} in the shales and {{sandstones}} of the Passaic Formation where a Triassic diabase sill has intruded.The primary copper minerals found here were the grayish chalcocite and the bright blue-green chrysocolla.In addition, lesser amounts of malachite, azurite, <b>cuprite,</b> and native copper were present.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, {{the last}} stamps of South West Africa were {{a set of}} 15 {{depicting}} minerals and mining. Following independence, most of the designs were kept with only the name changed (<b>cuprite</b> was dropped and willemite added for the Namibian issue) {{and the removal of}} Afrikaans names.|$|E
50|$|Though {{almost all}} {{crystals}} of <b>cuprite</b> {{are far too}} small to yield faceted gemstones, one unique deposit from Onganja in Seeis, Namibia, which was discovered in the 1970s, has produced crystals which were both large and gem quality. Virtually every faceted stone over one carat (0.2 gm) in weight is from this single deposit, which has long been mined out. The number of faceted gems over two carats (0.4 gm) is difficult to estimate, but according to Joel Arem, one-time curator for the Smithsonian National Gem and Mineral Collection in Washington DC, faceted <b>cuprite</b> of any size {{is considered one of}} the most collectible and spectacular gems in existence, with its deep garnet coloring and higher brilliance than a diamond. Only the gem's soft nature prevents it from being among the most valuable jewelry stones.|$|E
50|$|On {{exposure}} to air, chalcopyrite oxidises {{to a variety}} of oxides, hydroxides and sulfates. Associated copper minerals include the sulfides bornite (Cu5FeS4), chalcocite (Cu2S), covellite (CuS), digenite (Cu9S5); carbonates such as malachite and azurite, and rarely oxides such as <b>cuprite</b> (Cu2O). Chalcopyrite is rarely found in association with native copper.|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{secondary}} mineral {{found in the}} oxidised zones of copper ore deposits. Associated with libethenite at several localities in New South Wales, Australia, and at the Chino Mine, New Mexico, US. [...] Other associated minerals are apatite, azurite, chalcedony, chrysocolla, cornetite, <b>cuprite,</b> malachite, pyromorphite, tenorite, and iron oxyhydroxides.|$|E
50|$|Tenorite {{occurs in}} the {{weathered}} or oxidized zone associated with deeper primary copper sulfide orebodies. Tenorite commonly occurs with chrysocolla and the copper carbonates, azurite and malachite. The dull grey-black color of tenorite contrasts sharply with the often intergrown blue chrysocolla. <b>Cuprite,</b> native copper and Fe-Mn oxides also occur in this environment.|$|E
50|$|Besides placer deposits, copper {{is found}} as polymetallic {{replacement}} deposits in the fault planes, fractures and joints of the Triassic Nikolai greenstone, {{which consists of}} basaltic lava flows, and {{in the base of}} the Upper Triassic Chitistone limestone. Minerals include chalcocite, bornite and chalcopyrite, with associated malachite, azurite and <b>cuprite.</b> Native copper can also be found in the greestone.|$|E
50|$|If certain {{conditions}} were not met, the Egyptian blue {{would not be}} satisfactorily produced. For example, if the temperatures were above 1050 °C, it would become unstable. If too much lime was added, wollastonite (CaSiO3) forms and gives the pigment a green color. Too much of the copper ingredients results in excesses of copper oxides like <b>cuprite</b> and tenorite.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, {{the last}} stamps of South West Africa were {{a set of}} 15 {{depicting}} minerals and mining. Shortly before their issue in 1990, the territory gained independence as Namibia. As the stamps were new, most of the designs were kept with only the name changed (<b>cuprite</b> was dropped and willemite added for the Namibian issue).|$|E
50|$|Copper(I) oxide or {{cuprous oxide}} is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula Cu2O. It {{is one of}} the principal oxides of copper, the other being CuO or cupric oxide. This red-coloured solid is a component of some antifouling paints. The compound can appear either yellow or red, {{depending on the size of}} the particles. Copper(I) oxide is found as the reddish mineral <b>cuprite.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Chalcophyllite is an {{uncommon}} secondary mineral {{occurring in the}} oxidized zones of some arsenic-bearing hydrothermal copper deposits. Associated minerals include azurite, malachite, brochantite, chrysocolla, spangolite, connellite, <b>cuprite,</b> cyanotrichite, strashimirite, parnauite, lavendulan, cornubite, langite, clinoclase, pharmacosiderite and mansfieldite. [...] The type material is conserved at the Mining Academy, Freiberg, Germany. [...] Notable occurrences include the Majuba Hill Mine, Antelope District, Nevada, US and Cornwall, including Wheal Gorland, UK.|$|E
50|$|Copper {{also can}} be found in the Watchungs. Near Belleville, ore {{containing}} 8% copper was discovered, and a copper mine once operated in the area. Other copper bearing ores have been noted near Paterson. These ores typically contain <b>cuprite</b> (red copper oxide) and/or copper carbonate in a matrix of red or gray sandstone. Pyritous copper, also known as chalcopyrite, is not known to exist in ores found in the Watchungs.|$|E
50|$|Atacamite is polymorphous with botallackite, clinoatacamite, and paratacamite. Atacamite is a {{comparatively}} rare mineral, formed from primary copper minerals in the oxidation or weathering zone of arid climates. It {{has also been}} reported as a volcanic sublimate from fumarole deposits, as sulfide alteration products in black smokers and as alteration of ancient bronze and copper artefacts. It occurs in association with <b>cuprite,</b> brochantite, linarite, caledonite, malachite, chrysocolla and its polymorphs.|$|E
