Found in sclerophyll forest in Queensland and New South Wales, adult double drummers {{generally}} perch high in the branches of large eucalypts. They emerge from the ground where they have spent several years as nymphs from November until March, and live for another four to five weeks. They appear in great numbers in some years, yet are absent in others.|$|E

They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating.
