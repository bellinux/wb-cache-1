40|$|In this research, a rapid {{tool for}} low volume {{production}} {{plastic injection moulding}} is designed, developed, and tested on an injection moulding machine. The tool is designed as a <b>cavity</b> <b>insert</b> of injection mould for plastic parts by an indirect rapid tooling approach. The plastic part is modelled in a CAD system and then built using a Perfactory rapid prototyping (RP) technique. Then a layer of nickel-phosphorous alloy is deposited on the prototype by electroless plating. This nickel plated RP model is then used as a casting pattern. A <b>cavity</b> <b>insert,</b> which is produced by using aluminium filled epoxy resin with the nickel plated casting pattern, is fabricated in a mould	base for injection moulding. Experimental testing on the <b>cavity</b> <b>insert</b> using an injection moulding machine show that the tool is producing quality parts without any noticeable deterioration of the surface. The number of shots completed using the <b>cavity</b> <b>insert</b> is more than 600. Applying electroless nickel plating on the casting pattern made of rapid prototyping material was successful. It was found that pre-treatment processes are crucial. In addition, the rapid prototyping material cannot be plated with nickel without palladium activation and stannous sensitising. Results show that the deposited layer is uniform and composed of both nickel and phosphorous. The surface properties of the nickel and phosphorous deposit enhance the plated layer performance due to their low surface roughness and high lubrication characteristics. Moreover, the nickel-phosphorous layer also improves the surface hardness of the <b>cavity</b> <b>insert</b> since it is left on the cavity after {{the removal of the}} casting pattern. The <b>cavity</b> <b>insert</b> was installed on an industrial injection moulding machine for trials. Results show that the <b>cavity</b> <b>insert</b> performs well with Polyethylene at 170 ˚C at an injection pressure in the range of 80 ~ 100 bar. There are no signs of wear and tear on the <b>cavity</b> <b>insert</b> up to 620 shots. However, when the injection pressure is over 120 bar, cracks start developing in the <b>cavity</b> <b>insert</b> followed by catastrophic fracture. This research has shown that manufacturing an indirect rapid tooling using electroless nickel plating for low volume production of plastic injection mouldings is feasible for Perfactory produced RP models. The <b>cavity</b> <b>insert</b> can be fabricated using commonly available low cost materials within 48 hours...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of MEMS and Microsystems needs a reliable mass production process to fabricate micro components with micro/nano scale features. In our study, {{we used the}} micro injection molding process to replicate micro/nano scale channels and ridges from a Bulk Metallic Glass (BMG) <b>cavity</b> <b>insert.</b> High density polyethylene (HDPE) {{was used as the}} molding material and Design of Experiment (DOE) was adopted to systematically and statistically investigate the relationship between machine parameters, real process conditions and replication quality. The peak cavity pressure and temperature were selected as process characteristic values to describe the real process conditions that material experienced during the filling process. The experiments revealed that the replication of ridges, including feature edge, profile and filling height, was sensitive to the flow direction; cavity pressure and temperature both increased with holding pressure and mold temperature; replication quality can be improved by increasing cavity pressure and temperature within a certain range. The replication quality of micro/nano features is tightly related to the thermomechanical history of material experienced during the molding process.

40|$|Die casting {{is a very}} {{cost-efficient}} {{method of}} forming thin-walled and complex near net-shaped products with close geometric tolerances and good surface finish. A permanent die tool is used to make large quantities of identical products. The performance and tool life are limited by several mechanisms, e. g. thermal fatigue cracking, erosion, and corrosion. To develop new and more resistant tool materials for die casting detailed knowledge of the actual casting conditions and the tool failure mechanisms are essential. This thesis contributes to an increased knowledge of tool failure in die casting by investigating and simulating actual casting conditions and tool failure mechanisms. A method to record the temperature fluctuations in a <b>cavity</b> <b>insert</b> during actual brass die casting was developed, and details of the temperature conditions were obtained. Also, a test method based on cyclic induction heating and internal cooling of hollow cylindrical test rods was developed, where the surface strain during thermal cycling could be measured. This method reproduced the characteristic type of surface cracking observed on die casting tools, and proved to give information of the strains and stresses behind the fatigue failure. In actual die casting, the dominant tool failure mechanism is thermal fatigue cracking. The formation of the cracks is associated to accumulation of the local plastic strain that occurs during each casting cycle. Initial crack growth is facilitated by oxidation of the crack surfaces, and proceeded growth is facilitated by this oxidation in combination with crack filling of cast material, and by softening of the tool material. In addition, local enrichment of Pb at the crack front from the cast alloy melt was also observed to promote the crack growth in die casting of brass. In an investigation of thermal fatigue of two hot work tool steels, quenched and tempered to different conditions, {{it was found that}} low-cycle fatigue occurs, although the estimated tensile stress never exceed the initial yield strength of the steel. The reason is a gradual softening of the steel during the thermal cycling, and the presence of stress raising defects. The resistance against thermal cracking improves with initial tool steel hardness, because any initial ranking in hardness among the steels is unaffected by the thermal cycling. Another investigation on a selection of surface engineered tool steels, including common diffusion treatments, PVD coatings and combinations of these, showed that surface engineering generally reduce the resistance against thermal cracking as compared to untreated references, since the engineering processes influence negatively on the mechanical properties of the hot work tool steels. Finally, corrosion tests of CrN PVD-coated tool steels by exposing them to molten aluminium revealed the mechanisms of initiation and progress of liquid metal corrosion of this material combination, and that the corrosion resistance improves with the CrN coating thickness...|$|E

40|$|In the {{injection}} molding process, the cooling step {{is the most}} inefficient and time consuming phase. Moreover, the cooling of the product often leads to defects such as unexpected warp due to unevenly distributed cooling in the mold. These conditions {{can be attributed to}} the classical manufacturing techniques for injection molds as drilling, milling and EDM. The major drawback of these techniques is their inability to produces 3 D curved cooling channels, preferably parallel to the product wall. In the present study the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) 3 D printing technique is used to overcome these limitations. Via numerical simulations and experimental measurements on existing molds, the original situation is characterized. Important parameters as average mold surface temperature, temperature gradients, cycle time, time to reach steady state condition, etc [...] are determined. Conformal cooling and SLM printing, both have important constraints which are described in literature. In this study, different than in most other studies, constraints of both techniques as shape, max diameter, overhangs, … are taken into account to develop mold inserts in order to obtain conformal cooled core and <b>cavity</b> <b>inserts.</b> Thermal and Moldflow simulations are combined to optimize the design of the conformal cooling channels in the core and <b>cavity</b> <b>inserts.</b> Also CFD simulations were used to optimize the flow distribution and pressure drop in the cooling channel itself.

40|$|Modular tooling {{provides}} an approach for molders to manufacture multiple different plastic parts during one molding cycle, and to quickly exchange mold cavities according to dynamic production needs. However, {{the capability of}} modular and family tooling to mold parts of very different geometries to tight specifications has been limited by the inability to individually control the flow rate and pressure of the melt {{in each of the}} cavities. Axiomatic design principles were applied to the injection molding process to add control parameters that enable the spatial and dynamic decoupling of multiple quality attributes in the molded part. The developed system, Dynamic Feed, enables the direct controllability of the melt at different locations in a mold. An experimental investigation of the inter-cavity dependencies of a modular tool using Dynamic Feed control is presented.

Phoxonic structures hold promises for the simultaneous confinement and tailoring of sound and light waves with potential applications to acousto-optical devices and highly controllable photon-phonon interactions. The aim of this presentation is to investigate both the photonic and photonic band structures, and in particular dual photonic-photonic band gaps, in a model of silicon strip waveguide in which each unit cell contains one hole in the middle and two symmetric stubs {{on the side of the}} waveguide. We use the finite-element (FE) methods to calculate the dispersion curves and the finite difference time domain (FDTD) to obtain the transmission spectra. Appropriate choices of the geometrical parameters allows us to obtain a complete phononic gap together with a photonic band gap of a given polarization and symmetry.

40|$|Abstract — Using the {{knowledge}} {{gained from the}} wave chaos theory, we present simple shapes of resonant <b>cavities</b> obtained by <b>inserting</b> metallic hemispheres or caps {{on the walls of}} a parallelelipedic cavity. The presented simulation results show a significant improvement of the field statistical properties when the number of hemispheres or caps increases, and the comparison with a classical reverberation chamber geometry shows a better homogeneity and isotropy can be attained using these new proposed shapes. Index Terms — Chaotic cavity, field homogeneity, fiel...|$|R
