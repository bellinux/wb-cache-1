5|$|After time expires, the <b>chaser</b> {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the <b>chaser</b> answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the <b>chaser</b> back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the <b>chaser</b> at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the <b>chaser</b> continues to answer questions. If the <b>chaser</b> runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the <b>chaser</b> catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and <b>chaser</b> are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the <b>chaser</b> moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the <b>chaser</b> catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the <b>chaser</b> if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E

He subsequently undertook a ten-day anti-submarine warfare training course at the Fleet Sound School in Key West and on January 17, 1943 he was posted to the Albina Engine & Machine Works in Portland, Oregon, where he was to take command of the subchaser USS PC-815 when she was commissioned.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Chaser</b> APEC pranks were {{a series}} of comic stunts that {{targeted}} the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Summit (2–9 September 2007), in Sydney, Australia. They were coordinated and performed by the Australian satire group The <b>Chaser</b> for the television series The Chaser's War on Everything. The most prominent prank was the breach of an APEC restricted zone {{in the heart of}} Sydney central business district on 6 September. Julian Morrow directed a fake Canadian motorcade, which was allowed through the restricted zone by police and not detected until Chas Licciardello alighted, dressed as Osama bin Laden.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Chaser</b> group's {{founding}} members were Charles Firth, Dominic Knight, Craig Reucassel, and Julian Morrow. In 1999 they started The <b>Chaser,</b> a fortnightly satirical newspaper. Chas Licciardello, Andrew Hansen, and Chris Taylor later joined the group; and in 2006, after various ventures in radio, stage, and television, this line-up created The Chaser's War on Everything, its most successful program, which screened on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) station ABC1. By its second season in 2007, the show had forged {{a reputation for}} ambush-style stunts and deliberate controversy.|$|E
5|$|The DPP {{argued that}} it was never the {{intention}} of The <b>Chaser</b> to breach security and that they were allowed into the restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The <b>Chaser</b> through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E

2500|$|A {{growing number}} of {{experienced}} storm <b>chasers</b> advocate {{the adoption of a}} code of ethics in storm chasing featuring safety, courtesy, and objectivity as the backbone. Storm chasing is a highly visible recreational activity (which is also associated with science) that is vulnerable to sensationalist media promotion. Veteran storm <b>chasers</b> Chuck Doswell and Roger Edwards have deemed reckless storm <b>chasers</b> as [...] "yahoos". Doswell and Edwards believe poor chasing ethics at TV news stations add to the growth of [...] "yahoo" [...] storm chasing. Edwards and Rich Thompson, among others, also expressed concern about pernicious effects of media profiteering with Matt Crowther, among others, agreeing in principle but viewing sales as not inherently corrupting. Self-policing is seen as the means to mold the hobby. There is occasional discussion among <b>chasers</b> that at some point government regulation may be imposed due to increasing numbers of <b>chasers</b> and because of poor behavior by some individuals; however, many <b>chasers</b> do not expect this eventuality and almost all oppose regulations -—as do some formal studies of dangerous leisure activities which advocate deliberative self-policing.|$|R

5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub <b>Chaser</b> Base 25, located in Corfu, Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard submarine <b>chaser</b> SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E

5|$|An SOS was broadcast, {{which was}} {{answered}} by the Brazilian Navy, which sent three submarine chasers and three destroyers to the scene. The passengers {{were ordered to}} take to the lifeboats. Tenders and tugs also assisted in the rescue of all passengers from Magdalena without loss of life. The sea conditions at the time were smooth. At 19:00, the steam turbines had to be shut down, and power was then provided by her auxiliary diesel engines. At about 20:00, the submarine <b>chaser</b> Guaporé arrived and started to rescue the passengers. Other ships which assisted in the rescue were the tugs Comandante Triunfo, Dorat, Saturno and Trovão, and also the cargo ship Goiaz.|$|E

After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The <b>Chaser</b> and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E

50|$|Headline <b>Chasers</b> is a {{syndicated}} game show that ran daily from September 9, 1985 to September 5, 1986.

The show was a co-production of Wink Martindale Enterprises and Merv Griffin Enterprises with King World Productions, Griffin's partner for his other syndicated game show offerings, as distributor. Headline <b>Chasers</b> was recorded at TAV Celebrity Theater in Hollywood, the same studio which housed The Merv Griffin Show (which, at the time Headline <b>Chasers</b> premiered, was still in production).|$|R

Every team in the game has a unique Team Special Move that triggers a short cinematic of spectacular teamwork between the team <b>Chasers</b> (and sometimes Beaters) and has a possibility of scoring multiple goals. For example, The Ravenclaw Team Special Move scores three times for 30 points total. Although the original Quidditch rule disallows having more than 2 <b>chasers</b> in the scoring area {{at the same time}} (known as Stooging, as stated in Quidditch Through the Ages), doing such behaviour in this game will not result in penalty.|$|R
