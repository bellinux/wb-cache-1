The wage premium for a graduate degree is considerably higher than the undergraduate degree. <b>College</b> <b>costs</b> have risen much faster than income, resulting {{in an increase in}} student loan debt from $260 billion in 2004 to $1.1 trillion in 2014. From 1995 to 2013, outstanding education debt grew from 26% of average yearly income to 58%, for households with net worth below the 50th percentile. The unemployment rate is also considerably lower for those with higher educational attainment. A college education is nearly free in many European countries, often funded by higher taxes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2011, colleges were {{required}} by federal law to post a net price calculator on their websites to give prospective students and families a rough estimate of likely <b>college</b> <b>costs</b> for their particular institution, and to [...] "demystify pricing." [...] A student or family could go online, find the calculator at a college's website, and enter the required financial and academic information, and the calculator should tell them {{an estimate of the}} likely cost of attending that college. The first online calculators were started by Williams College. The online calculators look at financial need and academic merit to try to estimate the likely discounted price offered to a particular student from a particular college, using information including details from tax returns, household income, grade point averages and test scores. Schools vary in terms of their pricing formulas; some consider home equity as a factor while others disregard it. Lynn O'Shaughnessy recommends that families shopping for colleges go to a college's website and use the net price calculator to get a personalized estimate of cost.|$|E

Samuelson made of 'anti-intellectualism' [...] 'Intellectual' to me means thoughtful. The problem with the U.S. News rankings is that they are not 'intellectual.' They are, as some higher education experts label them, lame science. Mr. Samuelson also missed the point in suggesting nonparticipating colleges are trying to censor U.S. News. The magazine is of course free to continue its rankings, as are others.

2500|$|While {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that chances for admission are higher {{for students who are}} prepared to pay the full price, there are indications that this has been even more prevalent {{in the past few years}} given economic uncertainty and rising <b>college</b> <b>costs,</b> particularly at schools without large endowments. Half of admissions officers at both public universities and a third of officers at four-year colleges were actively seeking students who could [...] "pay full price" [...] and did not need financial aid, according to one survey of 462 admissions directors and managers in 2011. The report suggested that full-pay students tended to have lower high school grades and test scores than other students, compared to other applicants, on average. Two other reports confirmed that public university admissions officers were actively seeking out-of-state and international students since they paid higher rates for tuition. Another report found that one in ten admissions officers had said that their college admitted full-pay students despite their having lower average grades and test scores. Reports vary about whether the financial neediness of applicants impacts admissions chances; one suggested that applicants with strong academic credentials or talents are more likely to get financial aid, but that depending on the college, [...] "borderline admits" [...] needing money were most vulnerable; a second report was that [...] "colleges like rich students". George Washington University, despite claiming to have need blind admissions, was more likely to waitlist financially needy applicants, according to one report. One view was that financial aid depends on how a specific student compares with other students: ...|$|E
