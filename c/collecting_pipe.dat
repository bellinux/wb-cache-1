40|$|Abstract: The {{landfill}} {{construction has}} caused many negative {{impacts on the}} surrounding environment, particularly groundwater problems. Evaluation of {{the function of the}} <b>collecting</b> <b>pipe</b> at the landfill site is indispensable for managing the landfill operation. 3 D groundwater flow simulation may be applicable but it requires much capacity of computer and time consumption comparing with 2 D groundwater flow simulation due to the huge calculations. Therefore, the 2 D horizontal groundwater flow simulation (2 Dh) was carried out. However, the most difficulty is the assignment of the groundwater head at the <b>collecting</b> <b>pipe</b> buried for leachate drainage. This paper paid attention to examine the validation of the assignment of the <b>collecting</b> <b>pipe</b> boundary by applying the results of the 2 D vertical groundwater flow model (2 Dv) to the 2 Dh. As such an example, the landfill in Japan was selected as the case study. The 2 Dv of a cross section simulated the rise of groundwater table above the <b>collecting</b> <b>pipe</b> and calculated its drainage rate. The relationship between groundwater table above the pipe and drainage rate was obtained. The 2 Dh was coupled with the recharge model to solve the partial differential equation of groundwater flow. Finite difference method and iterative successive over relaxation were applied to the models. The drainage volume of leachate collection was summed up in the whole landfill site and compared with the annual average volume of treated waste water. The study demonstrated that the groundwater level at the vicinity of the drainage pipe in the 2 Dv analysis is reasonably assigned for the 2 Dh...|$|E

The mechanical-biological sewage treatment plant is situated in the northern part of Dąbrowa Tarnowska town (Malopolskie voivodship). The treated sewage is disposed of by means of a <b>collecting</b> <b>pipe</b> to the Breń river, which abiotically is a lowland sandy stream, type 17. The hydrochemical analyses were conducted monthly, from May 2014 to April 2015 in three measurement points. The first and the third were situated on the Breń river, 30 m above and 400 m below the treated sewage outlet respectively, whereas the second one was on the outflow <b>collecting</b> <b>pipe</b> from the sewage treatment plant. In the analysed water, 17 physicochemical water quality indices were determined by means of reference methods. On the basis of the data analysis it was found that pollutant concentrations in the treated sewage discharged into the Bren river did not exceed the values stated in the water permit and only sporadically did not meet the requirements stated in the Regulation of the Minister of Environment regarding ammonium nitrogen concentrations in the winter-spring period. Slight dynamics of seasonal changes of physicochemical indices values in the treated sewage evidences a high proficiency of the sewage treatment plant operation, irrespective of the air or water temperature. The treated sewage affected the increase in 12 from among 17 analysed physicochemical indices in the Breń river, of which the dependencies were statistically significant in 8 cases. BOD 5 and ammonium nitrate caused a change of water quality class from I to II, and in case of phosphates a decline of ecological state from very good to below good. Despite a negative effect of the sewage treatment plant, the water quality state in the Breń river would be much worse if untreated municipal waste flowed into the receiving water...|$|E

Walp.) foi avaliada, em escala real neste projeto de pesquisa, utilizando-se a disposiÃÃo de esgoto domÃstico no solo atravÃs da infiltraÃÃo subsuperficial. A pesquisa foi realizada em dois perÃodos. O primeiro, na estaÃÃo chuvosa, durante os meses {{de janeiro}} a abril e o segundo, no perÃodo de estiagem, durante os meses de agosto a novembro de 2004. A estrutura fÃsica da estaÃÃo {{experimental}} foi construÃda nas dependÃncias da horticultura do Centro de CiÃncias AgrÃrias, no Campus do Pici da Universidade Federal do CearÃ, Fortaleza-CE, sendo constituÃda por seis canteiros de alvenaria de tijolos cerÃmicos nas dimensÃes: 11 m de comprimento, 1 m de largura, 0, 60 m de profundidade e inclinaÃÃo de 1 %. Os canteiros foram impermeabilizados com manta plÃstica preta de 250 &# 956;. O material de solo utilizado para o preenchimento dos canteiros foi retirado de uma Ãrea de emprÃstimo existente nas proximidades do local do experimento. Para anÃlise comparativa, os seis canteiros foram divididos em dois grupos de trÃs. O primeiro foi irrigado com Ãgua subterrÃnea bombeada de um poÃo amazonas, existente no local do experimento e o segundo irrigado com esgoto domÃstico bombeado da rede coletora de esgotos que passa pelo Campus do Pici. A taxa de aplicaÃÃo das Ãguas de irrigaÃÃo foi de 0, 70 m 3 /dia, satisfazendo Ãs necessidades hÃdricas das plantas. Os canteiros foram divididos, ainda, em seÃÃes de 2 metros para melhor avaliar a produÃÃo ao longo dos canteiros. A produÃÃo foi avaliada atravÃs da contagem do nÃmero de sementes e vagens e a produtividade pelo peso de sementes por Ãrea Ãtil de 10 m 2 existente em cada canteiro. Os canteiros irrigados com esgoto domÃstico, no perÃodo chuvoso, apresentaram dados de produÃÃo de sementes de 248, 52 Kg. hÃ- 1 e 1. 377, 52 Kg. hÃ- 1, respectivamente, em relaÃÃo aos irrigados com Ãgua. A produtividade de grÃos, no perÃodo de estiagem foi de 767, 08 Kg. hÃ- 1 nos canteiros irrigados com esgoto domÃstico e nos irrigados com Ãgua de 757, 43 Kg. hÃ- 1. O esgoto domÃstico, mesmo sendo uma fonte alternativa de Ãgua e nutrientes para as plantas, cuidados referentes ao manejo agrÃcola devem ser considerados para evitar riscos ao meio ambiente e Ã saÃde da populaÃÃo. Concluiu-se, portanto, que a disposiÃÃo de esgoto domÃstico no solo atravÃs da infiltraÃÃo subsuperficial, colaborou para melhor produÃÃo de feijÃo caupi, o que torna recomendÃvel estÃ prÃtica em pequenas comunidades rurais, principalmente no semi-Ãrido do nordeste brasileiro. The production of cowpea beans (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) was evaluated {{in a real}} scale in this research project, by using the disposal of domestic sewage into the soil through the sub-superficial infiltration. The research was carried out during two periods. The first one was in the rainy season from January to April, and the second one in the dry season from August to November, 2004. The physical structure of the experimental station was built at the Horticulture Sector of the Agrarian Sciences Center, on the Pici Campus of the Federal University of CearÃ, Fortaleza â CE, and was composed of six masonry seedbeds made of ceramic bricks with the following dimensions: 11 m long, 1 m wide, 0, 60 m deep, and 1 % slant. The seedbeds were waterproofed with a black plastic blanket of 250 &# 956;. The soil material used for the filling of the seedbeds was removed from a nearby area located by {{the place of the}} experiment. For comparative analysis, the six seedbeds were divided into two groups of three each. The first one was irrigated with underground water pumped from a deep well located in the place of the experiment, and the second one was irrigated with domestic sewage pumped from the sewage <b>collecting</b> <b>pipe,</b> which goes through the Pici Campus. The water volume used in the irrigation of the seedbeds was of 0, 70 mÂ/day. The seedbeds were still divided into 2 m sectors in order to better to evaluate the production along the seedbeds. The production was evaluated through the counting of the number of seeds and pods, and the productivity was assessed by the weight of seeds per useful area of 10, 00 mÂ located in each seedbed. In the rainy season, the seedbeds irrigated with domestic sewage presented average seed production data of 248, 52 Kg ha- 1, and the ones irrigated with raw water showed an average production of 1. 377, 52 Kg ha- 1. The average productivity of grains in the dry season was of 767, 08 Kg. ha- 1 in the seedbeds irrigated with domestic sewage, and 757, 43 Kg. ha- 1 in the ones irrigated with water. The domestic sewage, despite being an alternative source of water and nutrients for the plants, cares regarding the agricultural handling should be considered to avoid risks to the environment and the health of the population. It was concluded, therefore, that the disposal of domestic sewage into the soil through the sub-superficial infiltration contributed to a larger production of cowpea beans, which makes this practice advisable in small rural communities, mainly in the semi-arid region of the Brazilian northeast...|$|E

However, this assumption results in a resolution limit of around 2 wavelengths (roughly 8 times wall thickness at a typical operating point), which is often too low for tomography to be a practical solution.

To prognosticate the potentiality of carbonate calcium sedimentation and the corrosion in the irrigation equipments, Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) and Ryzner Stability Index (RSL) were used, respectively. The results showed that, based on Wilcox diagram, the water of this river enjoys appropriate quality for agricultural purposes in most cases (with the exception of droughts). The results also showed that the LSI w as positive in all stations and it is possible that droppers clog due to carbonate calcium deposition. While, RSL was in most cases below 6. 8 and there is little possibility of metal parts corrosion in trickle irrigation system. It can be recommended that, regarding limited water sources, downstream lands of this river can be irrigated through trickle irrigation systems with droppers that are less sensitive to clogging in order to prevent from chemically clogging of droppers. Finally, acid washing by <b>collecting</b> watering <b>pipes</b> and droppers in one place and injection of acid after is recommendable...|$|R

Three sites were in Selangor, one each in Perak, Melaka, Kelantan, Terengganu and the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and one in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. A total of 689 households were chosen from which a total of 2067 water samples were collected. They were obtained from two sources – treated piped water from water treatment plants (WTPs) and groundwater extensively used for cooking and drinking purposes. Samples were <b>collected</b> from <b>pipes</b> at homes or water buckets from wells. They were then stored in pre-cleaned HDPE bottles and were analysed within the next 72 hours using a direct reading spectrophotometer model DR/ 2010 HACH Brand. Results showed that the mean concentration of fluoride in Sri Serdang, Selangor was the highest, at 0. 71 + s. d 0. 12 mg/L, while the concentration of fluoride in the samples from Kota Kinabalu had the lowest mean concentration of fluoride, at 0. 08 + s. d 0. 06 mg/L. Kelantan, Terengganu and Sabah states have ceased fluoridation of treated water {{in the wake of}} higher cases of dental fluorosis amongst the population, which explained the lowest mean concentration of fluoride from sites in these states. The mean concentrations of fluoride in the majority of samples were lower than the concentration recommended by the health authorities i. e. 0. 5 – 0. 7 mg/L, hence insufficient for eradicating dental caries. This was the main reason why fluoride has been added into treated water. However, higher concentrations of fluoride i. e. 1 mg/L or more may alleviate th...|$|R
