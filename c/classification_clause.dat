40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{classifying}} Croatian sentences by structure and detecting independent and dependent clauses within these sentences and provide its evaluation. A prototype system applying the method was implemented by using the NooJ linguistic development environment, both {{for purposes of this}} experiment and for further utilization in a prototype rule-based chunking and shallow parsing system for Croatian. With regards to pre-processing, we implemented and evaluated three different approaches to designing the system: (1) no pre-processing of input sentences, (2) automatic morphosyntactic tagging of sentences by using the CroTag stochastic tagger and (3) manual morphosyntactic annotation of input sentences. All three approaches were evaluated for sentence <b>classification</b> and <b>clause</b> detection accuracy in terms of precision and recall. The highest scoring system was the one using sentences with manually assigned morphosyntactic tags as input and it scored an overall F 1 -measure of 0. 861 (P: 0. 928, R: 0. 813). In the paper, a more detailed discussion of system design and experiment setup is provided, followed by a discussion of the obtained results and future research directions...|$|R

30|$|Wang and Xu (2013) {{provides}} a complementary account {{by focusing on}} the experiential metafunction. Specifically, they give a cross-linguistic account of existential and relational clauses (possessive and circumstantial types). While acknowledging that Michael Halliday's IFG is meant to be a description of English, Wang and Xu (2013) problematises the universal applicability of dividing clauses that construe location into two different process types, relational and existential. Based on their cross-linguistic data (examples are given from about 21 languages), they argue for a universal <b>classification</b> of existential <b>clauses</b> as a sub-type of relational processes. We interpret their account as highlighting the competing interest in describing individual languages in their own right and describing languages as a manifestation of the one human semiotic system called language.|$|R

Firstly a <b>clause</b> identification and <b>classification</b> system marks <b>clause</b> boundaries and classifies them as principle clause and subordinate clauses. A rule-based sentence classification system has been developed to categorize sentences as simple, complex and compound. The final syntactic sentence fusion system makes use of the sentence class and the clause types and finally fuses two textually entailed sentences using verb paradigm information and noun morphological information. The system outputs are compared with a gold standard data set using manual evaluation and BLEU techniques. The evaluation results yield good accuracy scores. The syntactic sentence fusion technique developed in the present work may be applied for other Indian languages...|$|R
40|$|Robust spoken {{language}} understanding in large-scale conversational dialog applications is usually performed by classification {{of the user}} utterances into one or many semantic classes. The features used for classification are sensitive to variations caused by artifacts of {{spoken language}}, such as edits, repairs and other dysfluencies. Furthermore, the performance of these classifiers typically degrades when the user’s utterance contains multiple semantic classes. In this paper, we present a semantic classification technique that first automatically removes dysfluencies and segments the user’s utterance into clauses and then classifies the utterance based on the <b>classification</b> of the <b>clauses.</b> We show that this preprocessing improves the semantic classification accuracy for utterances and significantly decreases the amount of training data needed for a given classification accuracy level. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of equality and non-discrimination is firmly recognized in the Inter-American Human Rights System (IAS) and has been invoked repeatedly by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. However, there is an application and interpretation somewhat confusing of the clauses enshrining this principle. The lack of clarity brings difficulties to assess the scope and meaning {{of each of the}} non-discrimination clauses, which in turn makes problematic the litigation of victims and States before the Court. This article aims to shed some light on this complex picture, suggesting a <b>classification</b> of non-discrimination <b>clauses</b> in three groups: autonomous, subordinate and incorporated. Additionally, this work indicates that while the categories of discrimination listed in the IAS instruments are not exhaustive, the inclusion of new categories does not rest solely on the discretion of the Court, but the regional consensus reached among States must have an important weight...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{information}} security management systems (ISMS) of 5 hospitals {{with more than}} 500 beds were evaluated {{with regards to the}} level of {{information security}}, management, and physical and technical aspects so that we might make recommendations on information security and security countermeasures which meet both international standards and the needs of individual hospitals. Methods: The ISMS check-list derived from international/domestic standards was distributed to each hospital to complete and the staff of each hospital was interviewed. Information Security Indicator and Information Security Values were used to estimate the present security levels and evaluate the application of each hospital’s current system. Results: With regard to the moderate clause of the ISMS, the hospitals were determined to be in compliance. The most vulnerable clause was asset management, in particular, information asset <b>classification</b> guidelines. The <b>clauses</b> of information security incident management and business continuity management were deemed necessary for the establishment of successful ISMS. Conclusions: The level of current ISMS in the hospitals evaluated was determined to be insufficient. Establishment of adequate ISMS is necessary to ensure patient privacy and the safe use of medical records for various purposes. Implementation of ISMS which meet international standards with a long-term and comprehensive perspective is of prime importance. To reflect the requirements of the varied interests of medical staff, consumers, and institutions, the establishment of political support is essential to create suitable hospital ISMS...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a new <b>classification</b> of consequence <b>clauses</b> that is based on a category of degree. Based on that parameter, consequence clauses are classified into the ones that have a meaning of degree and the ones that don’t have that meaning. Furthemore, consequence clauses with a meaning of degree can be divided into the clauses with a meaning of measure (Napolju je toliko hladno da smo se odmah vratili iz šetnje. /It is so cold outside that we had to return immediately back; On je takav prevarant, da će te sigurno preći/ He is such a chouse - he will cheat for sure.) and into excessive clauses (Previše je debela da uđe u tu haljinu/ She is too fat to fit in this dress; Devojčica je premalena da ostane sama kod kuće/ The girl is too small to stay at home alone; Buka je bila dovoljna da natera dete u plač/The noise was loud enough to cause the baby cry). The article provides the arguments that the category of degree in this sentences is grammaticalized with the help of certain modifiers and a conjunction of result da. The author applies the onomasiological method in the analysis and uses the theory of semantic locations. An existence of certain meanings is confirmed by the transformational test.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will {{take issue with}} the {{traditional}} <b>classification</b> of relative <b>clauses</b> into restrictive and non-restrictive ones. I will argue that, besides these two, a third type has to be distinguished, viz. cleft relative clauses, which are found in, but not confined to, constructions traditionally viewed as clefts. The basis for this threefold division lies in the three distinct types of antecedents the three kinds of relative clauses have, as outlined in this abstract. I will systematically describe these differences {{on the basis of}} attested examples, investigating differences in determiner structure, noun types and grammatical rank of the antecedent, and in the type of anaphoric relation between antecedent and relative anaphor (including whether the latter is realized as wh-pronoun, that or zero). Restrictive relative clauses (RRCs) are generally assumed to have the determiner + head noun as their antecedent (e. g. Huddleston 1984 : 394) and their function is often described as providing information necessary to identify the NP’s referent, which leaves RRCs used in indefinite NPs bereft of functional explanation, e. g. (1). (1) 	She was wearing a dress I’d never seen before. (Huddleston 1984 : 398) (2) 	No person who knows her would consider her a threat. (ibid). As recognized by Huddleston (1984 : 394), the relative pronoun in (2) does not point to no person as this would entail that no one knows her. This leads him to posit a lack of semantic equivalence between relative anaphor and antecedent. I hold, with amongst others Langacker (1991 : 430 ff) and Lehmann (2002 : 213 ff), that the antecedent of RRCs is in fact the nominal head, or the ‘type specifications’ it conveys, minus determiners. The RRC is first structurally assembled with the nominal head, creating more specific type specifications, which are then integrated with the determiner. In indefinite NPs the RRC merely elaborates the type specifications of which a non-identified instance is evoked, while in definite NPs the more specific type specifications are judged pragmatically necessary to identification of their referents. Cleft relative clauses (CRCs), by contrast, have the whole NP, including identifiers and quantifiers, as their antecedent. This is why the antecedents can also be proper names (3) and pronouns (5), and why (4) entails that all twelve apostles were sent out. (3) 	it's Hollande and Mélenchon who are poised to take the French election (Google) (4) 	it was the twelve that Jesus sent out and Judas was among the twelve according to Mt. 10 : 4. (Google) (5) 	There's only me and a few others who could tell you if I was telling the truth or not. (Google) (6) 	I know two people who can help drive the ambulance from the airport to the hospital. Their names are Claude and Jeremy. (Google) (7) 	I have friends in Laos who I can fall back on. (Google) A CRC and its antecedent express a variable – value relation (cf. Declerck 1984), i. e. for the variable defined by the CRC a value is specified, which, as proposed in Davidse (2000), may involve not only specifying particular referents (3), but also quantifying the instances corresponding to the variable (4) or enumerating some instances that correspond to it (5). Importantly, as illustrated by (6) and (7), CRCs and their antecedents expressing variable-value relations are also found in sentences that are not considered to be cleft in any traditional sense. The antecedent of non-restrictive relative clauses (NRRCs) can be just about any type of phrase, NP, AdjP, AdvP, PrepP (8), or a whole clause (9). (8) 	Don Mattrick surprised everyone on Monday when he announced that he would be leaving (Google) (9) 	We are considering renting a car, which we have never done (Google) Purely in terms of class of antecedents, they might appear to resemble CRCs, which can also have PrepPs and clauses as antecedents: (10) 	It was in 2012 that/*when young Indians learnt to vent their feelings. (Google) (11) 	it's because I love you that/*why I can't be selfish with you (Google) However, whereas the adjunct and clausal antecedents of NRRCs function congruently in clause and sentence structure, the adjunct and clausal antecedents of CRCs are reclassified as NPs (McGregor 1997 : 127, Davidse 2000 : 1115), as reflected by the use of relative anaphor that in (10) and (11).
