50|$|It {{permanently}} anchors {{itself to}} the sheet metal <b>by</b> <b>swaging</b> the surrounding material. Generally, the swage nut is made of a hard metal such as stainless steel, which is inserted into a pre-drilled hole in a softer ductile material such as aluminum. The inserted shank has three diameters: a main shaft which fits the hole closely, a thin smaller-diameter undercut, and a larger-diameter serrated clinching ring. Forcing the clinching ring into softer material, with an arbor press or by tightening a screw through the hole, causes it to plastically deform (swage) into the annular recess in the shank. This locks the nut into the hole. The knurling on the clinching ring is not necessary for this step, but prevents the nut from rotating after installation.|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{formability}} of a composite {{made of a}} pure aluminium matrix reinforced with an Inconel fibre network. Composites were formed into wires <b>by</b> <b>swaging,</b> to a true strain epsilon(true) = 2. 7. Thermal expansion, Young's modulus and tensile properties of these wires were measured. Young's modulus of the wires is slightly larger {{than that of the}} as-cast composites, indicating that no significant porosity is present in the composite after deformation. Tensile strength and ductility are found to decrease with increasing reduction of diameter. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations show that fibres align during swaging and that fibre fragmentation occurs beyond a certain strain. Fibre fragments reach a critical aspect ratio of about 7 after a swaging true strain of 1. 5. Qualitatively, the evolution of the properties is explained by a combination of fibre fragmentation and fibre alignment effects. Properties of the wires are discussed using the Clyne model and the Nardone and Prewo model (modified shear lag models). (C) 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R
