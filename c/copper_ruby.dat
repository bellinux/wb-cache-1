5000|$|Copper-based [...] "red goldstone" [...] {{aventurine}} glass {{exists on}} a structural continuum with transparent red <b>copper</b> <b>ruby</b> glass and opaque [...] "sealing wax" [...] purpurin glass, {{all of which}} are striking glasses, the reddish colors of which are created by colloidal copper. The key variable is controlling the colloid size: goldstone has macroscopic reflective crystals; purpurin glass has microscopic opaque particles; <b>copper</b> <b>ruby</b> glass has submicroscopic transparent nanoparticles.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, Sneath Glass made {{kerosene}} lantern globes and the founts {{that held}} the lantern's fuel. Ruby, green, and blue globes were a specialty. [...] At one time, Sneath Glass {{was one of only}} three factories in the United States that made <b>copper</b> <b>ruby</b> globes. Major customers of lantern globes were railroads and ships. [...] Sneath globes were also used during the construction of the Panama Canal.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the red colour in <b>copper</b> <b>ruby</b> alkali silicate glasses has been studied by means of ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy, TEM and EXAFS. The results show that in both red and slightly overstruck, brownish glasses the colour is due to clusters of metallic copper. Before striking non-coloured glasses contain mainly cuprous ions, Cu+. Tin acts as a reducing agent but also has an accelerating effect on colour development...|$|E
50|$|Copper {{occurs in}} its native form in Chile, China, Mexico, Russia and the USA. Various natural ores of copper are: copper pyrites (CuFeS2), cuprite or <b>ruby</b> <b>copper</b> (Cu2O), copper glance (Cu2S), malachite, (Cu(OH)2CuCO3), and azurite (Cu(OH)22CuCO3).|$|R
40|$|Sliding {{friction}} {{experiments were}} conducted in air with polycrystalline <b>copper</b> and <b>ruby</b> riders sliding against a copper bicrystal. Friction coefficient was measured across the bicrystal surface, and the initiation of adhesive wear was examined with scanning electron microscopy. Results indicate a marked increase in friction coefficient as the copper rider crossed the grain boundary from the (111) plane to the (210) plane of the bicrystal. Adhesion, friction, and initiation of adhesive wear was notably different in the adjacent grains of differing orientation. A slip-band adhesion-generated fracture mechanism for wear particle formation is proposed...|$|R
60|$|The scene which {{presented}} itself to our hero {{when he stood}} in the entrance passage was such as neither pen nor pencil can adequately depict. The tide was full, or nearly so, and had the night been calm the water would have stood about twelve or fourteen feet {{on the sides of the}} tower, leaving a space of about the same height between its surface and the spot at the top of the <b>copper</b> ladder where <b>Ruby</b> stood; but such was the wild commotion of the sea that this space was at one moment reduced to a few feet, as the waves sprang up towards the doorway, or nearly doubled, as they sank hissing down to the very rock.|$|R
40|$|Rescue archaeological {{excavations}} at {{an urban}} glass workshop of the 12 th century AD {{in the city}} of Murcia (Spain) have provided one of the few evidences of glass production in the ancient Islamic territory of Al-Andalus. This paper reports the results derived from a chemical–physical characterisation study carried out on a representative sample set of glass fragments and industrial debris from that workshop. The main objectives of the research were to contribute to the knowledge of the type of glasses produced and provide some insights into the technology developed to obtain different colours in glasses. The resulting data indicated that both high-magnesia plant ash (HMG) soda-lime-silicate and soda-lime lead-silicate glasses were produced. They also indicated a deep knowledge of glass colouring techniques, which suggests that a careful control over the glass melting processes was achieved. Among others, the occurrence of bulk-coloured silver yellow and <b>copper</b> <b>ruby</b> red transparent glasses prove the skills reached by Murcian glassmakers. These results shed new light on the Islamic glass technology of a geographical area in which, up to now, little compositional and technological data from glass workshops were available.

5000|$|Cuprite is an oxide mineral {{composed}} of copper(I) oxide Cu2O, {{and is a}} minor ore of copper.Its dark crystals with red internal reflections are in the isometric system hexoctahedral class, appearing as cubic, octahedral, or dodecahedral forms, or in combinations. Penetration twins frequently occur. In spite of its nice color it is rarely used for jewelry because of its low Mohs hardness of 3.5 to 4. It has a relatively high specific gravity of 6.1, imperfect cleavage and a brittle to conchoidal fracture. The luster is sub-metallic to brilliant adamantine. The [...] "chalcotrichite" [...] variety typically shows greatly elongated (parallel to 001) capillary or needle like crystals forms.It is a secondary mineral which forms in the oxidized zone of copper sulfide deposits. It frequently occurs in association with native copper, azurite, chrysocolla, malachite, tenorite {{and a variety of}} iron oxide minerals. It is known as <b>ruby</b> <b>copper</b> due to its distinctive red color.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time, 18 th-century glass mosaics from the Capela de São João Baptista (Chapel of St. John the Baptist, Lisbon) were {{analysed}} by Raman microscopy (RM). This masterpiece in baroque mosaic art {{had one of}} its major contributors the most famous glassmaker in Rome, Alessio Mattioli. Mattioli was celebrated because of the opacity of his mosaics and the astonishing number of hues {{he was able to}} produce for mosaic decorating Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. This study had two goals in mind: (1) characterising the materials involved in the manufacture of these glass mosaics and (2) lengthening the understanding of what was left of Mattioli's glassmaking records. As expected the mosaics presented a high ratio of crystalline phases, making RM the ideal technique for non-destructive analysis. The mosaics contained a white ‘background’ or opacifier added identified as Ca 2 Sb 2 O 7. The yellow tesserae are opacified with lead antimonate (Pb 2 Sb 2 O 7) and ternary oxides, structures related to lead antimonate but with other ions entering the position of Sb 4 + (namely Sn 4 +). Those ternary oxides are pervasive in most colours, admixed with other colorants. The red, orange, pink and brown colours were accomplished with cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) and admixed with a ternary oxide to create the latter three colours. The red copper-based colours were made according to the procedure to make a <b>ruby</b> <b>copper</b> glass and {{with the exception of the}} red colour; all mosaics exhibited a dark layer on each side of the mosaic, named scorzetta. This layer is the outcome of an oxidation reaction because of a quick cooling process and is composed of CuO. Finally the blue and green colours are accomplished with cobalt oxide and copper oxide, respectively, and the purple/black colour with manganese oxide...|$|R
