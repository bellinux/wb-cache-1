40|$|<b>Canine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> is a {{significant}} disease in dogs caused by Babesia and Theileria parasites. The clinical manifestations range from mild illness to serious disease depending on the parasite species and the physical condition of the infected dog. <b>Canine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> {{has been reported to}} be prevalent in China. However, no molecular evidence of the disease has been reported in pet dogs from Wuhan. In this study, 118 blood samples were randomly collected from pet dogs in veterinary clinics. The blood samples were subjected to both microscopic examination and reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assays to detect piroplasm infection. Parasites were observed in 10 blood samples via microscopic examination, whereas there were 14 Babesia gibsoni-positive RLB tests. Phylogenetic analysis was performed after the 18 S rRNA and ITS gene sequences from the 14 positive samples were cloned and sequenced. The results confirmed the existence of B. gibsoni in this area. This is the first molecular report of canine babesiosis in pet dogs from Wuhan, China. Pet dogs are companion animals, and the prevalence of babesiosis will be of concern in daily life. This study will help veterinarians better understand the prevalence of canine babesiosis and provide a guide for disease control in pet dogs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Canine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> is an {{emerging}} disease worldwide, with multiple species of piroplasm now recognised to infect dogs. A nested polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay {{was developed for}} the detection and differentiation {{of each of the}} piroplasm species currently known to infect dogs {{on the basis of the}} 18 S ribosomal RNA gene. The assay can potentially amplify and discriminate between Theileria annae, Theileria equi, Babesia conradae, Babesia gibsoni, Babesia sp. (Coco) and each of the Babesia canis subspecies. Non-canine piroplasm species can also potentially be detected using the described assay, however amplification of Neospora caninum was also observed. The PCR was found to have a high detection limit, capable of detecting a 2. 7 × 10 - 7 % parasitaemia or the equivalent of 1. 2 molecules of target DNA when using DNA extracted from whole EDTA blood and detected a parasitaemia of 2. 7 × 10 - 5 % using blood applied to both Flinders Technology Associates (FTA®) cards and IsoCode™ Stix. The application of blood samples to filter paper may greatly assist in piroplasm identification in regions of the world where local technologies for molecular characterisation are limited. The assay reported here has the potential to be standardised for routine screening of dogs for piroplasmosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Canine</b> {{babesiosis}} (or <b>piroplasmosis)</b> is endemic {{in northern}} Portugal, but molecularly confirmed cases of infection with small piroplasms {{have not been}} reported in the country. Three German shepherd dogs - a bitch and its 2 -month old pup and an unrelated male - clinically suspected of piroplasmosis were assessed for babesial infection. Results Parasitemia with small piroplasms was detected by microscopy in two dogs. All three dogs were positive by PCR and the Babesia microti -like small piroplasm (syn. Theileria annae) was identified by DNA sequencing. These are the first confirmed cases of babesiosis caused by the B. microti -like piroplasm both in dogs from Portugal and in dogs suspected of clinical piroplasmosis outside of Spain. Conclusions Although the bitch and the male had visited neighboring Galicia (northwestern Spain), where the disease is endemic, incursion of this piroplasm into northern Portugal is evident and infection of the non-traveled pup was due to either vertical transmission or autochthonous tick infection. </p...|$|R

In 2005 and 2006, vertebrate and invertebrate hosts were investigated in Central and Northern Regions of the Country. Microscopy on blood smears, molecular tools and serological tests were applied to 420 blood samples collected from dogs, in order to evaluate the presence of these protozoa and to identify possible risk factors. Moreover, ticks were analyzed by molecular techniques. Microscopy identified as positive 2. 8 % of the animals, all from Central Italy, and PCR detected ‘piroplasm’ DNA in 6. 0 %. Serology evidenced a mean prevalence of 34. 0 % with a decreasing trend from Central to Northern areas. The 507 collected ticks were identified as belonging to 8 species, mostly represented by Rhipicephalus sanguineus (n = 376) and Ixodes ricinus (n = 58). Molecular analyses evidenced the presence of babesial parasites (Babesia canis canis, B. canis vogeli, B. microti-like) in 25 (4. 9 %) of them; in Rh. sanguineus there was also demonstration of the vertical transmission of B. canis canis. Statistical analysis identified ‘kennel’ as risk factor for Babesia infection. Our findings evidenced that different species of piroplasms potentially infectious for dogs are circulating in Italy, and that epidemiological aspects of these infections are more complex than expected. Vector importance of both Rh. sanguineus and I. ricinus is hypothesized, but further investigation is needed...|$|E
40|$|Babesiosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tick-borne hemoproto-zoan diseases that affects dogs worldwide. In the last years, there has been a sharp increase in positive cases of Babesia canis infection in the Falcon State, Venezuela. Although recent studies conducted in South America suggest that B. canis vo-geli might be the species present in Venezuela, no data on the pathogenesis and molecular characteristics of Venezuelan pi-roplasms are available at this moment. By this reason the pres-ent work was undertaken to describe the evolution of an ex-perimental infection induced in dogs, as well as the first mo-lecular characterization of the 18 S rRNA gene of the Venezue-lan B. canis isolate used for inoculating the experimental ani-mals. Experimental infection was carried out in four dogs, two of them splenectomized. The animals were inoculated with 1 x 10 B. canis infected-red blood cells. Parasitemia, packed cell volume and body temperature were measured daily. Prepatent period of the infection oscillated between 2 - 6 days. All of the inoculated dogs developed a mild-type disease. Symptoms of <b>canine</b> <b>piroplasmosis</b> were moderate, and main clinical findings consisted in low parasitemia, short febrile period and slight anaemia. Imidocarb dipropionate showed to be the treatment of choice, since it cleared parasites from blood, as demon-strated by PCR assays. The partial sequence of the ssu rRNA gene of the Venezuelan piroplasm showed 100 % identity with a Brazilian isolate of Babesia canis vogeli, which is in full con-cordance with the clinical signs caused by this subspecies in the experimental animals, as well as those reported previously by other authors...|$|E
40|$|Background: Classification of Babesia parasites has {{traditionally}} relied on morphological differentiation based on piroplasm size and shape. Molecular typing has subsequently revealed {{a more complex}} taxonomy for these piroplasms than previously thought. To evaluate {{the factors that influence}} the morphology of Babesia species upon microscopic examination and hence, their taxonomic classification, we performed detailed characterizations of piroplasms from archival and prospective collections of cytological samples of dogs with piroplasmosis before and after death. Merozoite morphology and time of parasite disappearance following imidocarb dipropionate was also investigated. Methods: The study was divided into a (i) review of archived cytological slides from confirmed cases of <b>canine</b> <b>piroplasmosis,</b> and (ii) a prospective study of smears and tissue imprints from 15 recently necropsied dogs. The latter group could be further sub-divided into a non-treated group and an imidocarb dipropionate-treated group. Exact times of treatment before death were reviewed. Additional blood smears prepared from the live dogs and taken before therapy were also evaluated in the latter group. Parasite burden per each slide was determined in both studies. The shape and size of merozoites were described from blood smears taken while the dogs were alive and from different organs during necropsy. The results of all measurements were statistically analyzed. Results: The morphology and size of merozoites from live dogs corresponded to that of previously described 'large' Babesia. The morphology and size of merozoites were significantly different (P < 0. 001) in postmortem samples, however, and more consistent in shape and size with piroplasm cells previously referred to as 'small' Babesia. PCR and sequencing confirmed B. canis as the causative agent of disease in all investigated dogs, including in postmortem negative tissue imprints from dogs treated at least 24 h before death. Conclusions: Changes in the morphology of 'large' B. canis to 'small'-like Babesia observed by light microscopy appear to represent a common postmortem change. Classification of Babesia parasites into 'large' and 'small' Babesia using only microscopy of postmortem slides should be treated with caution. PCR-based methodologies for detection and molecular typing of Babesia spp. may prove valuable for investigating suspected cases of babesiosis following necropsy. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|E
40|$|De Kock and Quinlan {{published}} {{the results of}} their first series of experiments on splenectomised horses, cattle, sheep, and goats in 1926. Since then observations have been continued and extended to other species of domesticated animals as well as to wild antelopes. The results of the later splenectomies have been published mostly as isolated papers in various subsequent Reports of the Director of Veterinary Services. (De Kock and Quinlan, 1927; de Kock, 1929; du Toit, 1931; Neitz and du Toit, 1932.) HORSES. Of the four horses splenectomised three were immune ''carriers'' of Nuttallia equi and all three showed fatal relapses of Nuttalliosis in from 3 to 8 days after the operation. The fourth animal was a young foal, not a carrier of Nuttalliosis. It was kept under tick-free conditions for four months following the operation when it was killed by injections of haemolytic serum. CATTLE. Five animals were observed by de Kock and Quinlan (1926 report) and their findings may be summarised briefly as follows: (1) Relapses of Theileriosis (Theileria mutans), anaplasmosis, and piroplasmosis (P. bigeminum) occurred in immune "carriers" of these parasites. Piroplasmosis relapses were in these cases particularly severe. (2) These diseases in splenectomised animals assumed a chronic course particularly with regard to the blood changes. A total of 23 bovines were splenectomised of which 20 recovered from the operation. One animal died three days afterwards, and on post mortem no apparent cause of death could be established; one {{died as a result of}} haemorrhage and one from surgical shock. Some of the animals were used in East Coast fever transmission experiments and two animals which had recovered from East Coast fever were splenectomised in order to try and break down their immunity (du Toit, 1931). Removal of the spleen was found to have no effect on the course of this disease or on the immunity. Two bovines were splenectomised for further study of the blood changes in anaplasmosis. One animal, No. 4627, infected with the mild A. centrale strain, reacted so severely after splenectomy that it died as the result of the extensive blood changes. Two calves, Nos. 4658 and 4676, susceptible to anaplasmosis and piroplasmosis, were injected with blood from sheep showing Anaplasma ovis and then splenectomised to see whether the Anaplasma ovis would appear in the calves' blood, or whether the calves could become "carriers" of the disease. After the operation, however, both animals became accidentally infected with bovine piroplasmosis and anaplasmosis and sheep sub-inoculated from them showed no reaction. SHEEP. Fifty-four sheep have been splenectomised of which seven died as the direct result of the operation. In one of the latter, namely No. 8462, the attachments of the spleen were loosened and the splenic vessels ligated, but the organ itself left in situ. The most striking result of de Rock and Quinlan's observations on sheep was the discovery of the hitherto unsuspected presence of an anaplasma, A. ovis, and a Theileria, T. recondita (called Gonderia ovis by them) present in the blood of some South African sheep. Anaplasmosis of Sheep. The result of their observations can be briefly summarised as follows: (1) Non-splenectomised susceptible sheep can be infected by means of blood inoculation. The disease then runs a mild course with distinct anaemic changes and the appearance of parasites in the blood in large numbers, but no mortality. (2) In splenectomised "carriers" and splenectomised susceptible sheep the course is much more severe and protracted and there is a fairly high mortality. (3) The disease could not be transmitted to splenectomised or non-splenectomised bovines nor did these animals become carriers of the parasites. (4) Non-splenectomised goats could not be infected but in splenectomised goats parasites appeared in the blood with very slight anaemic changes, and such animals became carriers of the disease. Sheep, splenectomised and non-splenectomised, did not react to bovine anaplasmosis nor did they become carriers of the parasites. Theileriosis of Sheep. De Rock and Quinlan (1927) reported on the occurrence of Theileria (T. recondita, Gonderia ovis) in the blood of some splenectomised sheep. Transmission to non-splenectomised sheep and to bovines failed. The parasites did not produce any symptoms and appeared to be quite harmless. Histological Changes. De Rock (1929) reported on the appearance of haemo-lymphoid-like nodules in the liver of sheep, bovines and a goat killed three years after splenectomy. The nodules varied in size from ¼ in. to 1 ½ in. in diameter, were dark red in colour, and circumscribed. In some instances a distinct capsule could be recognised, and in others there was no demarcation between this foreign tissue and the liver substance. Lymphoid nodules could be recognised in some of these structures. The haemo-lymphoid-like nodules were not seen in the animals which died or were killed within the first two years following splenectomy. The first indications being found in a sheep which died 33 months after the spleen was removed. From the microscopic appearances de Kock concludes that this newly formed tissue resembles most closely that of haemolymph glands. GOATS. Before splenectomy the two animals were injected with blood from sheep showing anaplasma but no reaction followed nor could anaplasma be demonstrated. Splenectomy failed to produce a relapse as in the case of immune carriers. Subsequent to the operation, however, when reinjected the blood showed the presence of anaplasma with practically no anaemic changes. The histological changes which were found at autopsy on the one goat which died 8 ½ years later have been mentioned above. CANINES. Seven dogs were successfully splenectomised. One animal showed the presence of microfilaria in the blood three days later and continued to show these parasites until it died from other causes. In no case did piroplasma appear in the blood as the result of removal of the spleen. However, it was only assumed that the animals were carriers of Piroplasma canis as they had been exposed to tick infestation, but there can be no certainty with regard to this. Subsequently three of these dogs were injected with blood from a known carrier of the disease. One of them died from piroplasmosis and two recovered after treatment, but continued to show parasites for several weeks afterwards. Owing to the uncertainty with regard to the previous immunity it is not possible to draw definite conclusions on the effect of the removal of the spleen on <b>canine</b> <b>piroplasmosis.</b> The disease, however, appeared to affect the splenectomised dogs more severely than is experienced in clinical cases of the disease in normal dogs. One of the animals showed a severe haemoglobinuria. Miessner (1931) reports on a few cases of relapses of piroplasmosis following splenectomy in dogs. The experiment will be repeated with known carriers of Piroplasma canis. Four dogs were injected with the virus of African horsesickness after splenectomy but did not show any reaction to the disease. PORCINES. Four pigs were splenectomised and all made uneventful recoveries. No parasites appeared in the blood following the operation. Attempts were made to infect the splenectomised pigs with African horsesickness (two cases) and with ovine blue tongue (two cases) without success. ANTELOPES. Neitz and du Toit (1932) reported on a method of obtaining pure strains of Anaplasma marginale and centrale by transmission through antelopes. The antelopes were injected with blood from bovine carriers of Piroplasma bigeminum, Theileria mutans, and either Anaplasma marginale or A. centrale. In each case only the anaplasma appeared in the blood. These antelopes were then splenectomised in order to exclude the possibility of the other parasites from the donor's blood being present in a latent form. In the cases of the two that survived the operation only the anaplasma reappeared in the blood after splenectomy. Three blesbuck (Damaliscus albifrons) and one grey duiker (Sylvicapra grimmi grimmi L.) were operated on. One blesbuck died soon after the operation and the other two recovered. The duiker seemed to recover completely but interfered with the wound on the eighth day and died as a result. One of the blesbuck, No. 33606, was later injected with the virus of ovine blue tongue and although it showed no reaction it was found to be a carrier on subinoculation of susceptible sheep. Spirochaeta theileri could also be transmitted to the blesbuck. Heartwater. Finally the animal was injected with heartwater from a sheep and died 23 days later of this disease. Rickettsia could be demonstrated and susceptible sheep were infected from it.
