30|$|To have a {{sufficiently}} secure start, in this work, we aimed at currents {{in the range}} of nanoamperes for the binary-weighted current-steering DAC: from 10 nA for the least significant bit (LSB) leading to 20.48 μA for the most significant bit (MSB; 12 bits) while the supply voltage is also reduced to 1 V. The output impedance of the <b>current</b> <b>cells</b> needs to have an acceptable minimum value to reduce distortion in the system. To avoid the effect of the output impedance of <b>current</b> <b>cells</b> on the <b>current</b> delivered to the load impedance, we selected the latter which is much smaller than the former. It is worth noting that the greatest (worst) effect of the output impedance of <b>current</b> <b>cells</b> is when the digital code includes many 1 's (11 … 11). In this condition, many <b>current</b> <b>cells,</b> which lie parallel to each other minimizing equivalent output impedance, are used to produce the desirable output current [9]. As a result, load impedance must be selected small enough [2, 10, 11, 12, 13]. On the other hand, taking impedance matching into consideration in video applications, we selected a load impedance of 75 Ω.|$|R
50|$|These {{features}} are required because the negative electrode produces heat during use, while the positive electrode may produce oxygen. However, these additional devices occupy space inside the cells, add points of failure, and may irreversibly disable the cell when activated. Further, these features increase costs compared to {{nickel metal hydride}} batteries, which require only a hydrogen/oxygen recombination device and a back-up pressure valve. Contaminants inside the cells can defeat these safety devices. Also, these features can not be applied {{to all kinds of}} cells, e.g. prismatic high <b>current</b> <b>cells</b> cannot be equipped with a vent or thermal interrupt. High <b>current</b> <b>cells</b> must not produce excessive heat or oxygen, lest there be a failure, possibly violent. Instead, they must be equipped with internal thermal fuses which act before the anode and cathode reach their thermal limits.|$|R

30|$|Although current {{commercial}} silicon {{solar cells}} can reach 10 – 20 % {{power conversion efficiency}} (PCE), <b>current</b> solar <b>cell</b> manufacturing processes require high temperatures, vacuum technologies, and high-grade materials, all of which increase cost. As a result, <b>current</b> commercial solar <b>cells</b> remain expensive compared to fossil fuels, around 25 – 50 cents per kilowatt hour in the USA [1]. Organic solar cells, which are made from carbon-containing compounds, are usually made in solution {{so that they can}} be produced with low-cost printing or coating techniques. Liquid-phase coating processing can bring down manufacturing costs by avoiding high temperature and high vacuum methods. However, stability and carrier transport are challenges for organic solar <b>cells.</b> <b>Current</b> solar <b>cells</b> are expected to last for 20 – 30 years at temperatures between − 20 and 90 °C, which organic solar cells may not be able to achieve [2].
