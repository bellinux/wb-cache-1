5|$|The Venetians {{were indeed}} {{fooled by the}} Ottoman subterfuge and were taken by {{surprise}} at {{the arrival of the}} Ottoman fleet at Crete on 23 June 1645. Despite the efforts of the recently appointed provveditore generale, Andrea Corner, the Venetian defenses were still in a bad state. The island's fortifications were substantial, but they had been long neglected, and much effort was put into repairing them. Anxious about Ottoman preparations, the Republic reinforced Crete in late 1644 with 2,500 troops and provisions, and began arming its fleet, while assistance was promised in the event of war by the Pope and Tuscany. However, the local Greek population was not well-disposed towards the Venetians, something that would prove to be of <b>critical</b> <b>importance.</b> Not only were the Ottomans thus able to quickly establish control over the countryside, but in later years, when the Ottoman forces in the island were practically cut off from seaborne supplies, only the local produce, provided by the Greek population, sustained them.|$|E
5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of <b>critical</b> <b>importance</b> to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the user manual for the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E

Then {{in this paper we}} apply Fault Tree Analysis which is one of safety analy-sis, to drought event.

5|$|Under the {{provisional}} treaties between the Portuguese and the Bednore rulers, and the Padroado, the Christians {{were allowed to}} build churches and help foster the growth of Christianity in South Canara. The arrival of the British and the Dutch halted {{the activity of the}} Portuguese, and they were gradually unable to send the required number of missionaries to Mangalore. Shivappa Nayaka had previously expelled the Portuguese from their forts a little before 1660, which brought about considerable changes in the ecclesiastical situation. The appointment of the Vicar Apostolic of Mangalore was felt by the Holy See to be of <b>critical</b> <b>importance.</b> Nayaka pressured the church authorities to appoint a native priest as the Vicar Apostolic, which resulted in the appointment of Fr. Andrew Gomez to the post; however, he died before the nomination papers could reach Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|Soil is {{the living}} {{top layer of}} mineral and organic dirt that covers {{the surface of the}} planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of <b>critical</b> <b>importance</b> in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E
