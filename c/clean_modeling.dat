40|$|Growing {{availability}} of long-term satellite imagery enables change modeling with advanced spatio-temporal statistical methods. Multidimensional arrays naturally match {{the structure of}} spatio-temporal satellite data and can provide a <b>clean</b> <b>modeling</b> process for complex spatio-temporal analysis over large datasets. Our study case illustrates the detection of breakpoints in MODIS imagery time series for land cover change in the Brazilian Amazon using the BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend) change detection framework. BFAST includes an Empirical Fluctuation Process (EFP) to alarm the change and a change point time locating process. We extend the EFP {{to account for the}} spatial autocorrelation between spatial neighbors and assess the effects of spatial correlation when applying BFAST on satellite image time series. In addition, we evaluate how sensitive EFP is to the assumption that its time series residuals are temporally uncorrelated, by modeling it as an autoregressive process. We use arrays as a unified data structure for the modeling process, R to execute the analysis, and an array database management system to scale computation. Our results point to BFAST as a robust approach against mild temporal and spatial correlation, to the use of arrays to ease the modeling process of spatio-temporal change, and towards communicable and scalable analysis. </p...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} ultralow temperature {{studies of}} helium quantum crystals. Owing {{to the surrounding}} superfluid, small {{latent heat of crystallization}} and correspondingly short relaxation times, which are unreachable in ordinary crystals, helium crystals offer a unique and <b>clean</b> <b>modeling</b> system to study surface phenomena in a solid. The measurements of the crystal shape and growth rates are essential in providing the microscopic understanding of crystal growth. Optical observations are probably the most direct way to quantify the surface of crystals. The results presented in this Thesis were obtained with the help of two very powerful experimental techniques that were successfully adopted for ultralow temperature applications: optical interferometry and high-precision pressure measurements. The optical investigations on 3 He crystals revealed altogether eleven types of facets at temperatures well below 1 mK, while previously only three facet types have been seen. The growth rates of rough and smooth surface states were explored and show significant anisotropy. The measured growth velocities of different facet types indicate that the main growth mechanism is spiral growth in the regime of suppressed mobility. Important thermodynamic parameters of an interface such as the width of an elementary step and the step free energy were directly deduced from the observed growth kinetics. Results suggest that coupling of the interface to the underlying crystal lattice is relatively "strong" in 3 He crystals. Measurements of the spiral growth of the c-facet on 4 He crystals {{in the presence of a}} small number of 3 He atoms were also conducted. They show suppression of the crystal growth velocity with the increase of the 3 He atom concentration and indicate "weak" coupling of the interface to the crystal lattice in 4 He. reviewe...|$|E
30|$|There are {{two major}} {{approaches}} to reduce the mismatch between the <b>clean</b> <b>model</b> and distorted test features. One is through the model adaptation approaches, which adapt the <b>clean</b> <b>model</b> towards the distorted speech features. Some examples of the model adaptation method include the (constrained) maximum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR/MLLR) [30], maximum a posteriori (MAP) [37], and vector Taylor series (VTS) [38 – 40] based adaptation methods. Another approach to reduce train/test mismatch is to adapt the distorted features towards the <b>clean</b> <b>model.</b> Examples include the feature space maximum-likelihood linear regression (fMLLR, equivalent to global CMLLR), SPLICE feature compensation [17], etc. In this paper, for the clean-condition training scheme of the ASR task, we apply a new feature adaptation method called cross transform that we proposed in [31]. For each test utterance, speaker, or condition, a linear transform is estimated to adapt the test features towards the <b>clean</b> acoustic <b>model.</b> For completeness, we briefly describe the cross transform in the following section.|$|R
