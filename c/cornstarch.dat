5|$|Sahlab is a {{drinkable}} pudding {{once made}} of the powdered bulb of the orchid plant but today usually made with <b>cornstarch.</b> It is usually sold in markets or by street vendors, especially in the winter. It is topped with cinnamon and chopped pistachios.|$|E
5|$|Malabi is {{a creamy}} pudding {{originating}} from Turkey prepared with milk or almond milk (for a kosher version) and <b>cornstarch.</b> It is {{sold as a}} street food from carts or stalls, in disposable cups with thick sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving richer and more sophisticated versions using various toppings and garnishes such as berries and fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.|$|E

25|$|The roots contain starch, {{which has}} {{traditionally}} {{been used as a}} food ingredient in East Asia. In Vietnam, the starch called bột sắn dây is flavoured with pomelo oil and then used as a drink in the summer. In Japan, the plant is known as kuzu and the starch named kuzuko. Kuzuko is used in dishes including kuzumochi, mizu manjū, and kuzuyu. It also serves as a thickener for sauces, and can substitute for <b>cornstarch.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kissel or kisel is a viscous fruit dish, {{popular as}} a dessert {{and as a}} drink. It {{consists}} of the sweetened juice of berries, like mors, but it is thickened with <b>cornstarch,</b> potato starch or arrowroot; sometimes red wine or fresh or dried fruits are added. It {{is similar to the}} Danish rødgrød and German Rote Grütze. Swedish blåbärssoppa is a similarly prepared bilberry dessert, although only fresh or frozen bilberries, not dried berries are used to prepare it.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major factor}} in {{petroleum}} demand is {{the widespread use of}} petroleum products such as plastic. These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, <b>cornstarch,</b> pea starch, or microbiota. They are used either as a direct replacement for traditional plastics or as blends with traditional plastics. The most common end use market is for packaging materials. Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles.|$|E
25|$|In Puerto Rico, they {{underwent}} creolization, {{lost their}} almond and gained ground cassava. They can take varying amounts {{of sugar and}} spices. It's possible that Puerto Rico's most common version of this dessert (South American version with dulce de leche) reached Puerto Rico from Venezuela, but the opposite is also possible. Depending on region some add <b>cornstarch,</b> citrus zest, ginger and honey, filled with chocolate, vanilla cream, dulce de leche, fruit paste, or coconut. The filling can be mixed with almonds, sesame seeds, coconut flakes, or sprinkles.|$|E
25|$|Medical gloves are {{disposable}} gloves used during medical examinations and procedures that help prevent contamination between caregivers and patients. Medical gloves {{are made of}} different polymers including latex, nitrile rubber, vinyl and neoprene; they come unpowdered, or powdered with <b>cornstarch</b> to lubricate the gloves, making them easier {{to put on the}} hands. In 1894, William Stewart Halsted, the Surgeon-in-Chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital, invented the medical glove {{in an effort to make}} medical care safer and more sterile for patients and health care workers.|$|E
25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of starch. <b>Cornstarch</b> (maize flour) {{is a major}} {{ingredient}} in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also {{a major source of}} cooking oil (corn oil) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.|$|E

2500|$|Cyberskin is a {{synthetic}} material that {{feels more like}} human skin. It is a porous material and cannot be sterilized. It often gets sticky after washing (which can be remedied by a dusting of <b>cornstarch)</b> and is more delicate and more prone to rips and tears than silicone dildos. [...] "Packing dildos", which are not designed for penetration, are often made of this material.|$|E
2500|$|The {{broadest}} {{definition of}} natural product is {{anything that is}} produced by life, and includes the likes of biotic materials (e.g. wood, silk), bio-based materials (e.g. bioplastics, <b>cornstarch),</b> bodily fluids (e.g. milk, plant exudates), and other natural materials (e.g. soil, coal). [...] A more restrictive definition of a natural product is an organic compound that is synthesized by a living organism. The remainder of this article restricts itself to this more narrow definition.|$|E
2500|$|Candy {{pumpkins}} {{are made}} using {{a similar process}} to make candy corn. The candy corn process and product were created by Géorge Renninger of the Wunderlee Candy Co. in the 1880s and became popular as a treat in the 1920s. Candy pumpkins first were produced in mid 20th century using a process {{similar to that of}} candy corn. Corn syrup, food coloring, honey, and sugar are beaten and heated in large kettles to produce an ultra-sweet syrup. This syrupy mix generically is called [...] "mellowcreme" [...] by confectioners, since the resulting candy has a mellow, creamy texture. The mellowcreme slurry then was divided into two uneven amounts, with the large amount receiving orange food coloring and the smaller receiving green food coloring. A mogul machine brings the two colored mixtures together into a mold made of <b>cornstarch,</b> and the assembly is sent to a separate drying room to dry for 24 to 36 hours. Once dry, the candy is shaken violently to remove excess <b>cornstarch</b> and a final glaze is added to give the candy pumpkin a sheen. Candy pumpkins, acorns and other shapes that are derived from the mellowcreme mixture are often sold with candy corn under the name [...] "harvest mix." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with most}} other fatty acid {{oxidation}} disorders, individuals with MCADD {{need to avoid}} fasting for prolonged periods of time. [...] During illnesses, they require careful management to stave off metabolic decompensation, which can result in death. [...] Supplementation of simple carbohydrates or glucose during illness is key to prevent catabolism. [...] The duration of fasting for individuals with MCADD varies with age, infants typically require frequent feedings or a slow release source of carbohydrates, such as uncooked <b>cornstarch.</b> Illnesses and other stresses can significantly reduce the fasting tolerance of affected individuals.|$|E
2500|$|First the wok {{is heated}} {{to a high}} temperature, and just as or before it smokes, {{a small amount of}} cooking oil is added {{down the side of the}} wok (a {{traditional}} expression is [...] "hot wok, cold oil"), followed by dry seasonings such as ginger, garlic, scallions, or shallots. The seasonings are tossed with a spatula until they are fragrant, then other ingredients are added, beginning with the ones taking the longest to cook, such as meat or tofu. When the meat and vegetables are nearly cooked, combinations of soy sauce, vinegar, wine, salt, or sugar may be added, along with thickeners such as <b>cornstarch,</b> water chestnut flour, or arrowroot.|$|E
2500|$|Paintballs (pellets): Paintballs, the {{ammunition}} {{used in the}} marker, are spherical gelatin capsules containing primarily polyethylene glycol, other non-toxic and water-soluble substances, and dye. The quality of paintballs {{is dependent on the}} brittleness of the ball's shell, the roundness of the sphere, and the thickness of the fill; higher-quality balls are almost perfectly spherical, with a very thin shell to guarantee breaking upon impact, and a thick, brightly colored fill that is difficult to hide or wipe off during the game. The highest-grade paintballs incorporate <b>cornstarch</b> and metallic flake into the fill to leave a thick glittery [...] "splat" [...] that is very obvious against any background color, and hard to wipe off. Almost all paintballs in use today are biodegradeable. All ingredients used in the making of a paintball are food-grade quality and are harmless to the participants and environment. Manufacturers and distributors have been making the effort {{to move away from the}} traditional oil-based paints and compressed CO2 gas propellant, to a more friendly water-based formula and compressed air in an effort to become more [...] "eco-friendly". Paintballs come in a variety of sizes, including of 0.50" [...] (.50 Caliber) an [...] 0.68" [...] (.68 Caliber).|$|E
2500|$|Commercial venues {{may provide}} {{amenities}} such as bathrooms, picnic areas, lockers, equipment rentals, air refills and food service. Countries may have paintball sports guidelines, with rules on specific safety and insurance standards, and paid staff (including referees) who must ensure players are instructed in proper play to ensure participants' safety. Some fields are [...] "BYOP" [...] (Bring Your Own Paint), allowing players to buy paint at unrelated retail stores or online {{and use it}} at their field. However, most fields are FPO (Field Paint Only,) meaning players must buy paint at the venue or at a pro shop affiliated with the park. This is largely for revenue reasons; field and rental fees generally do not cover expenses of a paintball park. However, other reasons relating to player safety are generally cited and have some merit, as poor quality or poorly stored paint can cause gun failures or personal injury to targeted players. Other times, FPO policies are in keeping with municipal laws for wastewater and runoff; paintballs contain food dyes, and some formulations have metallic flakes and/or <b>cornstarch</b> {{to make them more}} visible, all of which can pose problems in water reservoirs and treatment plants. So, fields that must wash paintball paint into municipal wastewater facilities, or that have substantial rain runoff into bodies of water that are used as sources of drinking water, are generally required by the municipality to restrict players to only certain paint formulations; the easiest way to achieve this is to sell only approved paint and require that field paint be used.|$|E

Thompson, rented {{their old}} {{house in the}} Bellevue {{district}} {{and moved to the}} Hotel Hatton, that glorified boarding-house filled with widows, red-plush furniture, and the sound of ice-water pitchers. They were lonely there, and every other Sunday evening the Babbitts had to dine with them, on fricasseed chicken, discouraged celery, and <b>cornstarch</b> ice cream, and afterward sit, polite and restrained, in the hotel lounge, while a young woman violinist played songs from the German via Broadway.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cornstarch</b> is {{a common}} {{thickening}} agent used in cooking. It {{is also a very}} good example of a shear thickening system. When a force is applied to a 1:1.25 mixture of water and <b>cornstarch,</b> the <b>cornstarch</b> acts as a solid and resists the force.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cornstarch</b> has {{properties}} that {{allow it to}} slowly releases a type of glucose over time. Thus, <b>cornstarch</b> {{has been used to}} supply glucose and maintain blood sugar levels to humans who have glycogen storage disease (GSD). <b>Cornstarch</b> can be used starting at age 6-12 months which allows feeds to be spaced and glucose fluctuations to be minimized.|$|E
50|$|On September 24, 2008, Edlich and 11 health {{professionals}} submitted a Citizen’s Petition to the FDA to ban <b>cornstarch</b> on medical gloves (FDA-2008-P-0531).

50|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, two {{methods have been}} used to achieve this goal in young children: (1) {{continuous}} nocturnal gastric infusion of glucose or starch; and (2) night-time feedings of uncooked <b>cornstarch.</b> An elemental formula, glucose polymer, and/or <b>cornstarch</b> can be infused continuously through the night at a rate supplying 0.5-0.6 g/kg/h of glucose for an infant, or 0.3-0.4 for an older child. This method requires a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube and pump. Sudden death from hypoglycemia has occurred due to malfunction or disconnection, and periodic <b>cornstarch</b> feedings are now preferred to continuous infusion.|$|E
