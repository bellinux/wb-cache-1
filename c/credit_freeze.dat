50|$|A <b>credit</b> <b>freeze,</b> {{also known}} as a credit report freeze, a credit report lock down, a credit lock down, a credit lock or a {{security}} freeze, allows an individual to control how a U.S. consumer reporting agency ({{also known as}} credit bureau: Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, Innovis) is able to sell his or her data. The <b>credit</b> <b>freeze</b> locks the data at the consumer reporting agency until an individual gives permission for the release of the data. Today, credit freezes are made possible by state laws as well as industry-initiated rules. Laws have been passed by nearly all the US states (see partial list below). The first state to pass a <b>credit</b> <b>freeze</b> law was California, with SB 1386 sponsored by Debra Bowen in 2003. In late 2007, all three of the major credit bureaus (following TransUnion's lead) announced that they would let consumers freeze their credit reports, regardless of the state of residency. State laws still apply, however, in instances where the cost or other details of the freeze are more favorable than they are under the industry-sponsored alternative.|$|E

50|$|October 21: The US Federal Reserve {{announces that}} it will spend $540 billion to {{purchase}} short-term debt from money market mutual funds.

The associated fees also differ from state to state. In states where laws do not dictate more favorable pricing, the cost of freezing a credit report is $10.00 and unfreezing is similarly $10.00.

During a one-week period in September 2008, $170 billion were withdrawn from US money funds, causing the Federal Reserve to announce that it would guarantee these funds up to a point. The money market had been a key source of credit for banks (CDs) and nonfinancial firms (commercial paper). The TED spread (see graph above), a measure of the risk of interbank lending, quadrupled shortly after the Lehman failure.

5000|$|Credit freezes are {{frequently}} {{viewed as the}} most effective way to prevent financial identity theft. Each year in the United States, approximately 15 percent of all cases of identity theft are cases of new account origination identity theft, according to the Federal Trade Commission. [...] This form of identity theft occurs when a criminal opens credit in another individual's name. In the credit origination process, access to a credit report is critical for a lender to make a risk assessment. Because a <b>credit</b> <b>freeze</b> effectively stops any access to the credit report, it places a block in the process of issuing credit. Individuals who freeze their credit reports must therefore unfreeze their reports before they wish to apply for credit themselves.|$|E

50|$|The CPFF began {{operations}} on October 27, 2008 following {{the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and government bailout of AIG and the global <b>credit</b> <b>freeze</b> that ensued. The CPFF method of short-term funding provided liquidity to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle, aka SPV, which bought unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper for 3-month period from eligible issuers with funds made available by the NY Fed. The commercial paper remained {{in the custody of}} the SPV till the CP matured. On maturity, the proceeds from commercial paper and other assets were used to repay the loan that was originally taken from the NY Fed. All purchases of the Commercial Papers by the SPV was done through the New York Fed’s primary dealers. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. 45 out 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.|$|E
40|$|The {{breakdown}} of short-term funding markets {{was a key}} feature of the global financial crisis of 2007 / 8. Combining insights from the literature on global games and network growth, we develop a simple model that sheds light on how network topology interacts with the funding structure of financial institutions to determine system-wide crises. We show how the arrival of bad news about a financial institution leads others to lose confidence in it and how this, in turn, spreads across the entire interbank network. The rate of system-wide bank failure is rendered endogenous, depending crucially on both {{the rate at which}} bad news arrives and on the maturity of debt contracts. The conditions under which the financial system makes a sharp transition from a dense network of credit relations to a sparse network where <b>credit</b> <b>freezes</b> readily occur are characterized. Our results also emphasize the role of hysteresis – once broken, credit relations {{take a long time to}} re-establish as a result of common knowledge of the equilibrium.

50|$|Astute {{consumers}} and criminal minded {{people have been}} able to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the credit scoring systems to obtain credit. For example, previous ownership of a credit card may significantly increase an individual's ability to obtain further credit, while privacy issues may prevent a fraud from being exposed. Certain telecommunication companies and their relationship with credit reporting bureaus have enabled fabricated credit files to be created by the exploit of privacy blocks, which deny any third party entity to actual information held by the government. While the credit reporting system is designed to protect both lenders and borrowers, there are loopholes which can allow opportunistic individuals to abuse the system. A few of the motivations and techniques for credit abuse include churning, rapidfire credit applications, repetitive credit checks, selective <b>credit</b> <b>freezes,</b> applications for small business rather than personal credit, and piggybacking.|$|R
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Lehman’s failure and the simultaneous purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, already fragile <b>credit</b> markets <b>froze,</b> so that companies {{having nothing to do}} with banking but needed financing (e.g. General Electric) could not get daily funding requirements which had the effect of sending the US equity/bond markets into turmoil between September 15, 2008, and September 19, 2008.|$|R
50|$|This <b>credit</b> <b>freeze</b> {{brought the}} global {{financial}} system {{to the brink of}} collapse. The response of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and other central banks was immediate and dramatic. During the last quarter of 2008, these central banks purchased US$2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks. This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action, in world history. Following a model initiated by the United Kingdom bank rescue package, the governments of European nations and the US guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems, ultimately purchasing $1.5 trillion newly issued preferred stock in their major banks. In October 2010, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz explained how the US Federal Reserve was implementing another monetary policy —creating currency— as a method to combat the liquidity trap. By creating $600 billion and inserting this directly into banks, the Federal Reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages. However, banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets. Banks were also investing in foreign currencies, which Stiglitz and others point out may lead to currency wars while China redirects its currency holdings away from the United States.|$|E

40|$|We {{study how}} a bank’s {{willingness}} to lend to a previously exclusive firm changes once the firm obtains a loan from another bank (“outside loan”) and breaks an exclusive relationship. Using a difference-in-difference analysis and a setting where outside loans are observable, we document that an outside loan triggers {{a decrease in}} the initial bank’s willingness to lend to the firm i. e., outside loans are strategic substitutes. Consistent with concerns about co-ordination problems and higher indebtedness, we find that this reaction is more pronounced the larger the outside loan and it is muted if the initial bank’s existing and future loans retain seniority and are protected with valuable collateral. Our results give a benevolent role to transparency enabling banks to mitigate adverse effects from outside loans. The resulting substitute behavior may also act as a stabilizing force in credit markets limiting positive co-movements between lenders, decreasing the possibility of <b>credit</b> <b>freezes</b> and financial crises...|$|R

40|$|There is {{consensus}} that the recent financial crisis revolved around a crash of the short-term credit market. Yet {{there is no agreement}} around the necessary policies to prevent another <b>credit</b> <b>freeze.</b> In this experiment we test the effects that contract length (i. e. maturity mismatch) has on the market-wide supply of short-term credit. Our main result is that, while credit markets with shorter maturities are less prone to freezes, the optimal policy should be state-dependent, favoring long contracts and lower maturity mismatch when the economy is in good shape, and allowing for short-term contracts when the economy is in a recession. We also report the possibility of credit runs on firms with strong fundamentals, something that cannot be observed in the canonical static models of financial panics. Finally, we show that our experimental design produces rich learning dynamics, with a text-book bubble and crash pattern in the market for short-term credit...|$|E
