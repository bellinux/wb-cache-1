5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly <b>cold</b> <b>tolerant</b> whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E

40|$|A cryoselection {{protocol}} {{has been}} developed that provides freezing-tolerant callus that, in turn, can regenerate plants with enhanced <b>cold</b> hardiness. <b>Tolerant</b> calli were selected from spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) callus by immersion in liquid nitrogen without addition of cryoprotectants. Less than 15 % of the calli survived the initial challenge, whereas 30 to 40 % of previously selected calli survived subsequent exposure. Seed progeny from five of 11 regenerant (R 2) lines tested exhibited significantly enhanced tolerance to freezing at − 12 °C. Thus, cryoselection appears to involve at least in part, selection for genetic rather than epigenetic variants. Analysis of one callus line indicated that cryoselection did not induce significant alterations in lipid composition, adenylate energy charge, or freezing point. An increase in the soluble sugar component was detected. Changes were also detected in the protein complement of microsomal membrane and soluble protein extracts of cryoselected callus. In all, seven unique proteins ranging from 79 to 149 kilodaltons were identified. The results demonstrate that freezing tolerant callus can be isolated from a heterogeneous population by cryoselection, and {{factors that contribute to}} hardiness at the callus level are biologically stable and can contribute to tolerance at the whole plant level...|$|R

The lipoxygenase activity was induced efficiently only in Sel 11439 plants treated with TiO 2 NPs during CS, probably indicating its role in stress response (which was confirmed by measuring allen oxide synthase activity). TiO 2 NPs caused stability of chlorophyll and carotenoid contents during CS.

2500|$|Females begin ovipositing the {{day after}} {{copulation}} and do so in one batch during a single oviposition event. Shorter and longer oviposition durations are associated with smaller and larger egg masses, which {{are directly related to}} female size. Just before beginning to oviposit, females exhibit dispersal behavior. They position themselves on a branch, spread their wings, and extend their abdominal tip around the branch to prepare for oviposition. As they oviposit, they move around the branch aligning the eggs, forming a ring-like structure around the branch. [...] They then cover their eggs with a foamy substance known as spumaline. It has been hypothesized that the spumaline cover protects eggs from predation and parasitism. [...] Offspring pass the winter inside their eggs.

40|$|The {{modern and}} fossil pollen data {{obtained}} under {{the framework of}} the multi-disciplinary international "El'gygytgyn Drilling Project" represent a unique archive that allows the testing of a range of pollen-based reconstruction approaches and the deciphering of changes in the regional vegetation and climate since ~ 3. 58 Ma. In the current study we provide details of the biome reconstruction method applied to the late Pliocene and Quaternary pollen records from Lake El'gygytgyn. All terrestrial pollen taxa identified in the spectra from Lake El'gygytgyn were assigned to major vegetation types (biomes), which today occur near the lake and in the broader region of eastern and northern Asia and, thus, could potentially have been present in this region during the past. When applied to the modern surface pollen spectra from the lake, the method shows a dominance of the tundra biome that currently characterizes the Lake El'gygytgyn area. When applied to the pollen spectra from the middle Pleistocene to present, the method suggests (1) a predominance of tundra during the Holocene, (2) a short interval during the marine isotope stage (MIS) 5. 5 interglacial distinguished by cold deciduous forest, and (3) a long phase of taiga dominance during MIS 31 and, particularly, MIS 11. 3. These two latter interglacials seem to be some of the longest and warmest intervals within the past million years. During the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene interval (i. e., ~ 3. 562 – 2. 200 Ma), there is good correspondence between the millennial-scale vegetation changes documented in the Lake El'gygytgyn record and the alternation of cold and warm marine isotope stages, which reflect changes in the global ice volume and sea level. The biome reconstruction demonstrates changes in the regional vegetation which suggest a step-like transition from generally warmer/wetter environments of the earlier (i. e., Pliocene) interval towards colder/drier environments of the Pleistocene. The reconstruction of most of the species-rich cool mixed and cool conifer forest biomes is particularly noticeable prior to MIS G 16, whereas tundra becomes a prominent feature after MIS G 6. These results consistently indicate that the study region supported significant tree populations during most of the interval prior to ~ 2. 730 Ma. The biomization results also suggest that the transition from mostly forested to mostly open landscape was not gradual, but rather occurred in step-like fashion. Thus, the <b>cold</b> and drought <b>tolerant</b> steppe biome first appears in the reconstruction ca. 3. 298 Ma during the tundra dominated MIS M 2, whereas the tundra biome initially occurs between ~ 3. 379 and ~ 3. 378 Ma within MIS MG 4. Prior to ~ 2. 800 Ma, several other cold stages during this generally warm Pliocene interval experienced a dominance of tundra and a great reduction of tree populations in the regional vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 At {{the time}} of the eruptions of Lassen Peak in 1914 - 1915, an area of {{vegetation}} along the east slope of the mountain approximately 1 1 / 4 miles wide and four miles long was destroyed. Except for a few surviving trees, all vegetation was destroyed. A study of the revegetation of this rather unique area has been made to determine, if possible, how vegetation re-enters such a sterile area. Since this site is probably the only area in western North America, outside of Alaska and Mexico, to have been devastated by volcanic action in modern times, the results should bear significance. Two principal data-collecting methods were used. First, 29 regions (or stands) were selected throughout the present Devastated Area for observation and description. Such information as presence of species, density, size, edaphic factors and successional stage was recorded for each. To interrelate these regions for showing gradients in relation to each other or in relation to the undisturbed marginal vegetations, a number of belt transects was laid out. Woody vegetation was recorded along these six-foot wide belts. Results of the study show that the predisturbance meadows are being taken over by trees and shrubs, largely because of mud-flow influence. Successional stages occur in most locations where Lodgepole Pine has become established. White Fir and White Pine or Jeffrey Pine appear to be replacing it. Island vegetations are established and appear to be serving as radiation centers for new growth. "Stump sprout" survivor Mountain Hemlock and Red Fir trees comprise part of the high elevation vegetation from which stands may extend. Pits or craterlets caused by hot rocks in the mudflow still exist and now provide protected sites for revegetation on harsh, exposed slopes, A definite zonation pattern now exists along the elevational gradient of {{the central part of the}} Devastated Area starting with Lodgepole Pine at an elevation of 6250 feet and terminating with Red Fir and Lodgepole Pine at between 7500 - 8000 feet. New growth along the north and south margins is variable. At upper levels, invasion by old species is very slow. The greatest width of vigorous marginal growth occurs at an elevation of 7500 - 7700 feet along the south boundary where White Fir, Red Fir, White Pine and Mountain Hemlock have all penetrated the new area to a width of 400 yards. Downslope "shift" is noted in regard to Mountain Hemlock and Red Fir at higher elevations at the margins. Establishment of montane species by upslope "shift" in the central regions appears to provide necessary cover for establishment of the <b>cold</b> and shade <b>tolerant</b> subalpine species in these central locations. Several zones of soil instability still exist. One is a new mudflow caused by stream action where vegetation penetrates this zone marginally. Pioneer herbaceous forms are appearing rapidly here. Large dark-colored volcanic rocks carried by the mudflow encourage revegetation by (1) absorbing heat from the sun in early spring before the snow is melted and (2) protecting plants from extreme winds and temperatures. Vegetation appears also to be related to the snow-melt pattern along higher slopes. Transitional gradients are common at the margins and in some cases extend across the area. A young Jeffrey Pine climax vegetation is now established across the Devastated Area at the Hot Rock and Log Pile Region adjacent to the lower Lost Creek. Photographs were used for relating former vegetation to that of the present. A total of 121 species of plants was collected and determined from the Devastated Area...|$|R
40|$|Radiant frost {{during spring}} is a {{significant}} problem for field pea (Pisum sativum L.) grown in Mediterranean environments as plants are at the vulnerable reproductive stage when frost occurs. In such environments, radiant frost events after the commencement of flowering of field pea may lead to severe frost injuries on plants, and can adversely affect the grain yield. Despite {{the importance of the}} impact of frost on grain yield, no dedicated study has been conducted on reproductive frost tolerance (RFT) in field pea. One aim of this research was to develop a simple and reliable screening method to evaluate frost tolerance of eight reproductive organs (from immature buds to mature pods) which are often present at the same time on a single plant. A controlled environment screening method that exposed plants to a defined temperature regime, including a minimum temperature of - 4. 8 °C for 4 hr, was developed. A scoring key was devised to record frost symptoms on each reproductive organ, and five categories were defined to evaluate frost damage on seeds. Using this screening method, a diverse collection of germplasm was screened, including 83 accessions sourced from high altitude and frost prone areas in 39 countries. A locally adapted variety, Kaspa, the most widely cultivated field pea variety in southern Australia, was included in the screening. The flowering stage was found to be more susceptible to frost than the pod development stage. Buds and set pods were found to be the most frost-susceptible reproductive organs, and mature pods were the most frost-tolerant reproductive organs. Genetic variation was found among field pea genotypes for frost tolerance at the flowering stage. Eight accessions, ATC 104, ATC 377, ATC 947, ATC 968, ATC 1564, ATC 3489, ATC 3992 and ATC 4204, each from a different country, were identified with more than 20 % frost survival of flowering stage organs. Kaspa was highly susceptible to frost at reproductive stages, with no buds, flowers or pods surviving the frost treatment. A BC 1 F 1 population was derived from frost- tolerant ATC 1564 and frost-sensitive Kaspa, and segregation of the frost survival trait and SSR markers was studied. Little marker polymorphism was observed between the two genotypes, with only 41 (12. 3 %) of the 332 primer pairs assayed on DNA samples of the parental lines, exhibiting polymorphic products in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unfortunately, most of these markers were not linked with any other loci, and only two linkage groups were developed: one with three markers, and the other with only two. No strong marker-trait associations were observed for frost tolerance. Responses of reproductive-stage plants to low positive temperature (10 / 5 °C day/night, and 150 – 250 μmole m⁻² s⁻¹ PPFD) for 7, 14 and 21 days were studiedas were the effects of these cold treatments on survival of vegetative and reproductive tissues after frost, for frost-tolerant (ATC 968 and ATC 1564) and frost-sensitive (ATC 1040 and Kaspa) genotypes. Under long exposures (21 days), all genotypes exhibited an ability to maintain the photosynthetic rate. All genotypes were found to be adversely affected by chilling at the reproductive stage, however frost-sensitive genotypes were more responsive to low positive temperatures (<b>cold)</b> than frost <b>tolerant</b> genotypes. Evidence of symptoms of chilling injuries was found in the frost-sensitive genotype: distortion in the ultrastructure of chloroplasts was observed in parenchyma cells of stipules in Kaspa. A decrease and/or non-accumulation of soluble sugar in vegetative and reproductive tissues found in all genotypes under cold conditions reflected the inability in reproductive stage plants to acclimate. In contrast to what has previously been observed for pea seedlings, cold treatment of reproductive-stage pea plants did not result in acclimation, did not improve reproductive frost tolerance, and in fact reduced frost tolerance. In conclusion, a drop in temperature under radiant frost conditions is lethal for reproductive stage pea plants. Reproductive organs are inherently sensitive to frost, and severe frost damage may lead to abortion of buds, flowers and set pods, and significantly reduce the seed weight. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. The {{sugarcane}} borer, Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is {{the most}} limiting factor in the South African sugar industry with losses to this insect pest estimated {{to be at least}} ZAR 60 million per annum. Because of its cryptic nature as well as the fact that E. saccharina is both indigenous to Africa and occurs on several host plants, attempts to control or eradicate it using several available methods have not been very successful. However, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is one of the newer control methods that can be incorporated into an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programme to achieve better control or eradication. The implementation of the SIT program needs to go through a series of well-researched phases in order to be successful. In the first of this multi-phase project, it was determined that E. saccharina is susceptible to ionizing radiation, and is thus a suitable candidate for the SIT development against it and that a sub-sterilizing dose of 200 Gy is sufficient to induce F 1 (inherited) sterility in male and complete sterility in female moths respectively. The results presented here are discussed in the context of further development of the SIT as an addition to the arsenal of tactics in an AW-IPM programme against E. saccharina. Based on these initial findings, the study examined the lek and mating behavior of male moths subjected to three radiation doses (150, 200, 250 Gy) against normal non-irradiated/fertile moths. Both mass-rearing and irradiation of E. saccharina led to a quantitative departure of male mating behavior away from that exhibited by their wild counterparts. However, treated males are still able to form leks and mate with wild females. Male E. saccharina irradiated at all three doses tested were found to be as active and competitive as wild males, but in some of the traits measured, performance diminished significantly with an increase in the radiation dosage. In general, the performance of moths treated at 200 Gy did not differ significantly from that of moths treated at 150 Gy and therefore the former dose is ideal for SIT development since it results in a lower residual F 1 fertility than the latter. The level of mating competitiveness and compatibility was assessed under both laboratory and semi-field conditions in pairwise comparisons consisting of laboratory reared vs. wild (L-W), 200 Gy irradiated vs. wild (S-W) and laboratory reared vs. irradiated moths (L-S). Based on the results from the more robust field cage assays, the mating indices generated indicated that the mass-reared E. saccharina strain produced in South Africa has not yet evolved sexual behaviours suggestive of incipient pre-mating isolation barriers with local wild strains. Wild moths did not discriminate against either the partially sterile or laboratory reared moths and most importantly, the irradiated males mated significantly more than their wild counterparts regardless of the type of female. The irradiated insects could therefore achieve the purpose for which they are intended upon release into the field. Third, the critical thermal limits (CTLs) to activity at high and low temperatures (i. e. critical thermal maxima “CTmax” and minima “CTmin”) of different E. saccharina strains/treatments were investigated under standard experimental conditions. The effect of laboratory rearing and increasing radiation dosage on thermal tolerance of the adult stage of E. saccharina was explored. There were highly significant differences between the laboratory-reared and wild strain and also between non-irradiated and irradiated strains in both CTmax and CTmin. Laboratory reared E. saccharina moths were more heat tolerant compared to wild moths for both genders while in the case of CTmin, the reverse was true. Irradiation had a negative effect on both CTmax and CTmin. Moths treated at the lowest radiation dose were more <b>cold</b> and heat <b>tolerant</b> than those treated at higher dosages thereby reinforcing the importance of lower dosages rather than those that induce full sterility against E. saccharina. In general, gender effects on the CTLs were non-significant. Pilot sterile male releases in shade house trials to measure the impact of sustained releases of partially sterile adult males at an over-flooding moth ratio of 10 T: 1 U (treated to untreated),were conducted to measure their efficacy to stop E. saccharina incursions and suppress populations prior to testing in pilot studies under true season-long and area wide conditions. Results from the current study demonstrated that releasing partially irradiated (200 Gy) adult male moths at the afore mentioned release rate significantly reduced sugarcane stalk damage as well as lowered the number of fertile progeny from F 1 to succeeding generations in a stable E. saccharina population initiated in a cage house. There were more damaged internodes per stalk in the control than in the sugarcane receiving regular releases of partially sterile male moths. Overall, there were significantly more undamaged stalks in the treated sugarcane than the untreated control. Furthermore, there were significantly more larvae per stalk retrieved from the control compared to the treated sugarcane suggesting that the sustained release of steriles was efficacious in reducing emergence of fertile larvae in the succeeding generations.

50|$|Maggots develop at a {{rate that}} is {{depended}} entirely upon environmental factors, which makes temperature {{one of the most important}} things throughout the morgue evaluation process. Insects that are <b>cold</b> <b>tolerant</b> or warm tolerant, will have different temperatures in the body bag. Both cold and warm tolerant maggots survive by maggot mass feeding. However, <b>cold</b> <b>tolerant</b> maggots can develop in smaller masses while warm tolerant maggots require larger masses. The maggots produce metabolic heat from bacterial digestion of the flesh, which enables them to develop while stored in a cold location. Maggot masses tend to move to thicker parts of the body that decrease in temperature more slowly. This is sufficient to continue maggot development.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{a rugged}} plant {{resistant}} to root rot, {{and easy to}} grow in a well drained soil. It is dark green when grown in filtered light or shade. An established plant is <b>cold</b> <b>tolerant</b> to the mid to low twenty degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
50|$|Blue Java bananas {{can grow}} to {{a height of}} 15 feet to 20 feet. They are <b>cold</b> <b>tolerant</b> and like tall bananas of the ABB Group, are wind {{resistant}} because of their strong pseudostems and root systems. The leaves are silvery green in color.|$|E
50|$|The Blue Java (also {{known as}} Ice Cream banana, Hawaiian banana, Ney Mannan, Krie, or Cenizo) is a hardy, <b>cold</b> <b>tolerant</b> banana {{cultivar}} {{known for its}} sweet aromatic fruit which {{is said to have}} an ice cream like consistency and flavor reminiscent of vanilla.|$|E
50|$|The glacial {{survival}} {{hypothesis is}} the idea that <b>cold</b> <b>tolerant</b> plant and animal species (e.g. Norway spruce and Norwegian lemmings) survived in ice-free northern microrefugia during the last ice age. The alternative hypothesis of postglacial immigration of plant and animals is called the tabula rasa hypothesis.|$|E
