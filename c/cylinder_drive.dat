40|$|This paper {{describes}} the full- and reduced-order models of an actuated hydraulic cylinder suitable for system dynamics analysis and motion control design. The full-order model incorporates the valve spool dynamics with combined dead-zone and saturation nonlinearities - inherent for the orifice flow. It includes the continuity equations of hydraulic circuits {{coupled with the}} dynamics of mechanical part of <b>cylinder</b> <b>drive.</b> The resulted model is the fifth-order and nonlinear in states. The reduced model neglects the fast valve spool dynamics, simplifies both the orifice and continuity equations through an aggregation, and considers the cylinder rod velocity as output of interest. The reduced model is second-order that facilitates studying the system behavior and allows for direct phase plane analysis. Dynamics properties are addressed in details, for both models, with focus on the frequency response, system damping, and state trajectories related to the load pressure and relative velocity.

40|$|In {{preparation}} for an {{experimental study of}} magnetorotational instability (MRI) in liquid metal, we explore Couette flows having height comparable to the gap between cylinders, centrifugally stable rotation, and high Reynolds number. Experiments in water are com-pared with numerical simulations. Simulations show that endcaps corotating with the outer <b>cylinder</b> <b>drive</b> a strong poloidal circulation that redistributes angular momentum. Predicted azimuthal flow profiles agree well with experimental measurements. Spin-down times scale with Reynolds number as expected for laminar Ekman circulation; extrapolation from two-dimensional simulations at Re ≤ 3200 agrees remarkably well with experiment at Re ∼ 10 6. This suggests that turbulence does not dominate the effective viscosity. Further detailed numerical studies reveal a strong radially inward flow near both endcaps. After turning ver-tically along the inner cylinder, these flows converge at the midplane and depart the boundary in a radial jet. To minimize this circulation in the MRI experiment, endcaps consisting of multiple, differentially rotating rings are proposed. Simulations predict that an adequate approximation to the ideal Couette profile can be obtained with a few rings...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work reported in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} application of digital control techniques to position control. The major emphasis is devoted to the use of modular multi-microcomputers as real-time controllers. Minicomputers and microcomputers do not always meet the technical requirements of modern system design; the modular multi-microcomputer controller is the most appropriate choice in many high performance systems. The specification, design and construction of a modular multimicrocomputer controller is described. The controller has been applied to an electro-hydraulic cylinder position control system, where emphasis has been given to the control of load damping. The control system design is based on the use of state-space methods. Optimal control and observers are used. Experimental tests are reported for open and closed loop. The open-loop results show the particular characteristics of an asymmetric <b>cylinder</b> <b>drive.</b> The closed-loop results show the behaviour of the drive under a simple digital proportional controller and a state-variable controller. variables such as position, velocity, cylinder pressures and piston thrust are displayed for several test conditions...|$|E

40|$|Chopping {{biomaterials}} is {{an energy}} consuming process where considerable losses occur because of friction and the compaction of the material. The {{objective of the}} paper reported here is to show an energy saving chopping <b>cylinder</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism and to analyze the variations in the drive torque of the chopping cylinder. The chopping mechanism consists of a flexible drive mechanism. Field experiments were performed with a chopper fitted with such a mechanism and {{the components of the}} drive torque were determined from the results. The random excitation of the flexible drive mechanism (“multikator”) is caused by the variations in the transport of the material to the chopping cylinder. Consequently there are variations in the angular speed of the chopping cylinder. These variations cause the edgewise vibration of the cutting knives and therefore the energy saving effect. The analysis of random components of cutting torque as a function of time could give an advanced method for designing machine parts operated under dynamic load. Therefore, the critical load, or stress can be calculated by the method developed. Furthermore, the lifetime and the breakdown of the machine parts can be predicted...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} an Adaptive Robust Observer (ARO) to the detection of some common faults that occur in hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>drive</b> units such as the lack of sufficient supply pressure, reduced hydraulic compliance and excessive leakage of the hydraulic fluid. All of these faults could contribute to the reduced performance {{of the system and}} eventual complete failure. The inherent nonlinear system dynamics, severe parametric uncertainties and model uncertainties make fault detection in hydraulic systems difficult to implement in practice. To tackle these problems, the Adaptive Robust Observer presented in this paper is designed using the nonlinear system dynamics and robust filter structures which attenuate the effect of model uncertainties to give robust estimates of the states. By using online parameter adaptation the accuracy of the state-estimate is improved. Also, by estimating the parameters only when certain persistence of excitation conditions are satisfied, bounds on parameter estimation errors can be computed which would help in setting better threshold limits on the residual signals which improves the robustness of the fault detection scheme. Simulation and experimental results on the swing-arm of a three-degree of freedom hydraulic robot arm are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection scheme. ∗ Address all correspondence to this author...|$|E
40|$|Modern flight {{training}} simulators must {{be equipped with}} long stroke six degree-of-freedom motion systems that have high dynamic response. For many years electro-hydraulic actuators in a Stewart platform configuration {{have been found to}} best meet the performance requirements. However, valve-controlled actuators are very inefficient leading to a large power consumption, and also the need for a substantial cooling system to remove waste energy (heat) from the hydraulic oil. This paper describes a new design of motion system that uses a controlled brushless motor for each actuator, with power transmission via directly driven pumps to conventional simulator hydraulic cylinders. Accumulators are used to store and later recycle high pressure oil when actuators retract. In this way, power consumption has been dramatically reduced (for example from 45 kW to 5 kW during one representative motion waveform), while retaining the proven characteristics of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>drive.</b> Power consumption is lower, by a factor of between 2 and 4, than an equivalent all-electric solution. The motion system will be supplied {{for the first time with}} Boeing 787 simulators to be delivered in 2008.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} of electrohydraulic drives is relatively low dynamic load stiffness due to compressibility of oil. Sudden load variations can cause significant deviations {{of the position of}} the drive and, consequently, a reduced precision of the controlled process. This has led to a partial substitution of electrohydraulic drives by electromechanical drives in a low power range recently. One of the approaches to increase dynamic stiffness of a cylinder is to raise valve dynamics. Thus, the system can react to a control deviation and provide the cylinder with a compensating flow faster. The objective {{of this paper is to}} show the development of a stiff <b>cylinder</b> <b>drive</b> using a new high-response servovalve-the hybrid valve. In contrast to a conventional servovalve with an unmovable sleeve, the idea of the hybrid valve is to actuate both the spool and the sleeve simultaneously in opposite directions. Using a piezo-actuator as sleeve drive provides the hybrid valve with very high dynamics in the range of small valve opening, which should be sufficient to increase the disturbance rejection of the cylinder. The performance of the valve prototype and of the cylinder will be shown, and application fields will be discussed in this work...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{complete}} dynamic calculation method, the layout, force, {{and strength of}} harvester boom cylinders were designed and calculated. Closed simulations for {{the determination of the}} dynamic responses of the harvester boom during luffing motion considering the <b>cylinder</b> <b>drive</b> system and luffing angle position control have been realized. Using the ADAMS mechanical system dynamics analysis software, six different arm poses were selected and simulated based on the cylinder as the analysis object. A flexible model of the harvester boom luffing motion has been established. The movement of the oil cylinder under different conditions were analyzed, and the main operation dimensions of the harvester boom and the force condition of the oil cylinder were obtained. The calculation results show that the dynamic responses of the boom are more sensitive to the luffing acceleration, in comparison with the luffing velocity. It is seen that this method is very effective and convenient for boom luffing simulation. It is also reasonable to see that the extension of the distance of the bottom of the boom is shortened by adjusting the initial state of the boom in the working process, which can also effectively reduce the workload of the boom—thus improving the mechanical efficiency...|$|E
40|$|This book {{deals with}} the {{development}} and testing of high-response piezo-servovalves for improved performance of electrohydraulic cylinder drives. Performance improvement means {{in the context of}} this work an enhancement of reference and disturbance response of the drive in a closed-loop pressure and position control. Reference and disturbance responses determine the precision of the drive which influences product quality and motion accuracy in stationary and mobile applications. This thesis shows by means of linearised mathematical models that the drive performance can be significantly improved by high dynamics of the control valve. The increase in valve dynamics can be achieved by the use of piezoelectric actuators, which outmatch the response of common electromechanical valve actuators. Within the scope of this work two different novel high-response piezo-servovalves are prototyped. These are four-way directional flow control valves with linear spools. The book presents different steps of the design and development process of the valves such as conceptual design, calculation, dimensioning, manufacturing, design of internal valve control, testing according to the internationally standardized procedures and comparison to the performance of common servovalves. The achieved dynamics of the piezo-servovalves surpasses the response of the conventional valves. Exemplary investigations of an electrohydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>drive</b> show an improved reference response of pressure control by 50 % and an enhanced disturbance response of position control by 40 % due to the use of the piezo-servovalve at the drive. This work demonstrates that the commercially available piezo-actuators can be successfully implemented in industrial hydraulic valves, bringing advantages for the overall drive performance. The high reliability and endurance of the piezo-actuators have already been proven by the use in common rail fuel injectors in the automobile industry since 2002. Taking into account falling costs of the actuators due to the mass production for the automobile industry they can become a very attractive alternative or supplement for hydraulic valve technology...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{deals with}} the {{practical}} use of electrorheological fluids (ERFs). At the Institute for Fluid Power Drives and Control (IFAS), a test rig has already been in use {{for several years and}} different applications have been investigated with it.

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of design rules and design aids for applications based on ERFs till today.
