50|$|Alicyclic musks, {{otherwise}} known as <b>cycloalkyl</b> ester or linear musks, are a relatively novel class of musk compounds. The first compound of this class was introduced 1975 with Cyclomusk, though similar structures were noted earlier in citronellyl oxalate and Rosamusk. Alicyclic musks are dramatically different in structure than previous musks (aromatic, polycyclic, macrocyclic) {{in that they are}} modified alkyl esters. Although they were discovered prior to 1980, it was only in 1990 with the discovery and introduction of Helvetolide at Firmenich that a compound of this class was produced at a commercial scale. Romandolide, a more ambrette and less fruity alicyclic musk compared to Helvetolide, was introduced ten years later.|$|E
5000|$|Magic acid has low nucleophilicity, {{allowing}} for increased stability of carbocations in solution. The [...] "classical" [...] trivalent carbocation {{can be observed}} in the acid medium, and {{has been found to be}} planar and sp2-hybridized. Because the carbon has only six valence electrons, it is highly electron deficient and electrophilic. It is easily described by Lewis dot structures because it contains only two-electron, two-carbon bonds. Many tertiary <b>cycloalkyl</b> cations can also be formed in superacidic solutions. One such example is the 1-methyl-1-cyclopentyl cation, which is formed from both the cyclopentane and cyclohexane precursor. In the case of the cyclohexane, the cyclopentyl cation is formed from isomerization of the secondary carbocation to the tertiary, more stable carbocation. Cyclopropylcarbenium ions, alkenyl cations, and arenium cations have also been observed.|$|E
50|$|For linear alkanes, {{molecular}} ion peaks are often observed. However, for long chain compounds, {{the intensity of}} the {{molecular ion}} peaks are often weak. Linear fragments often differ by 14 Da (CH2 = 14). For example, hexane fragmentation patterns. The m/z=57 butyl cation is the base peak, and other most abudant peaks in the spectrum are alkyl carbocations at m/z=15, 29, 43 Da.Branched alkanes have somewhat weaker molecular ion peaks in the spectra.They tend to fragment at the branched point. For the 2,3-dimethylbutane, an isopropyl cation peak (m/z=43) is very strong.Cycloalkanes have relatively intense molecular ion peaks (two bonds have to break). Alkene fragmentation peaks are often most significant mode. Loss of “CH2CH2“ (= 28) is common, if present.

40|$|AbstractBy {{using the}} method of Fourier {{transform}} ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, substituent stabilization energies of homologous series of <b>cycloalkyl</b> carbanions, X-c-CnH 2 n− 2 − (n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) with π-accepting substituents (X = Ph, CN, COOMe, NO 2) have been determined experimentally in the gas phase as {{the difference between the}} proton affinity of the substituted and corresponding unsubstituted (X = H) <b>cycloalkyl</b> carbanions. The stabilization energy data have been analyzed in terms of Taft's parametrization of polarizability, field/inductive, and resonance effects. The linear regression analyses show excellent correlations within the XCH− 2, X-c-CnH 2 n− 2 − (n = 4, 5, 6, 7), and X-c-C 3 H− 4 carbanion series, from which it appears that the contributions of polarizability effects are independent of the above type of carbanions and only depend {{on the nature of the}} substitutuent. Further, it follows that inductive stabilization is more effective in the substituted methyl, XCH− 2, than in the substituted <b>cycloalkyl,</b> X-c-CnH 2 n− 2 − (n = 4, 5, 6, 7) carbanions. This result suggests that inductive stabilization is counteracted by the electron releasing effect of alkyl groups. Resonance stabilization is significantly more effective in the substituted <b>cycloalkyl,</b> X-c-CnH 2 n− 2 − (n = 4, 5, 6, 7), than in the substituted methyl, XCH 2 −, carbanions, which suggests that in contrast to inductive stabilization, resonance stabilization is assisted by the electron releasing effect of alkyl groups. Finally, it appears that substituent stabilization in the geometrically restricted substituted cyclopropyl carbanions, X-c-C 3 H 4 −, is dramatically less effective than in the corresponding geometrically unrestricted larger substituted <b>cycloalkyl</b> carbanions, X-c-CnH 2 n− 2 − (n = 4, 5, 6, 7). The linear regression analyses of the substituted <b>cycloalkyl</b> carbanions indicate that reduction of the stabilization energy is caused not exclusively by a geometrically hindered resonance stabilization, but also to a smaller extent by a less efficient inductive stabilization in the substituted cyclopropyl carbanions...|$|E
