Utilizing strain energy at the interface of Si and graphite via {{the use of a}} tribometer, a reaction between nanometer sized graphite particles with a reducing agent (hydrazine) was initiated. This simple method demonstrated the synthesis of lamellar platelets (lamellae of ~ 2 nm) with diameters greater than 100 micrometers and thicknesses less than 30 nm directly on the surface of a substrate under rubbing conditions. Spectroscopic evaluation of the particles verified them to be graphene-based platelets, with functionalized molecules including <b>C-N</b> <b>and</b> C-Si bonding. Furthermore, the size of the particles was shown to be highly correlated to the applied pressure at the point of contact, such that three-body friction (with intermediate particles) was shown to enhance the size effect, though with greater variation in size among a single test sample. A chemical rate equation model was developed to help explain the formation of the chemically modified graphene platelets, wherein the pressure applied at the surface can be used to explain the net energy supplied in terms of local flash temperature and strain energy.

Similarly, the FT-IR data of piroxicam (treated) showed increased intensity of vibrational peaks at 1628 (amide C=O stretching), 1576 - 1560 cm- 1 (C=C stretching) with respect to control peaks. Furthermore, vibrational peak of C=N stretching (1467 cm- 1) was observed in biofield treated piroxicam. This peak was not observed in control sample, possibly due to its low intensity. Based on FT-IR data, it is speculated that bond length and dipole moment of some bonds like N-H (amide), <b>C-O,</b> <b>and</b> <b>C-N</b> in paracetamol and C=O (amide), C=N, and C=C in piroxicam might be changed due to biofield treatment. The UV spectrum of biofield treated paracetamol showed the shifting in wavelength of UV absorption as 243 → 248. 2 nm and 200 → 203. 4 nm as compared to control. Likely, the lambda max (λmax) of treated piroxicam was also shifted as 328 → 345. 6 nm, 241 → 252. 2 nm, and 205. 2 → 203. 2 nm as compared to control. Overall results showed an impact of biofield treatment on the spectral properties of paracetamol and piroxicam.

40|$|Rhodium-catalyzed {{asymmetric}} hydroboration {{in conjunction}} with directing groups can be used control relative and absolute stereochemistry. Hydroboration {{has the potential to}} create new C–C, <b>C–O,</b> <b>and</b> <b>C–N</b> bonds from an intermediate C–B bond with retention of stereochemistry. Desymmetrization resulting in the loss of one or more symmetry elements can give rise to molecular chirality, i. e., the conversion of a prochiral molecule to one that is chiral. Unsaturated amides and esters hold the potential for two-point binding to the rhodium catalyst and have been shown to direct the regiochemistry and impact stereochemistry in asymmetric hydroborations of acyclic β,γ-unsaturated substrates. In the present study, the pendant amide functionality directs the hydroboration cis in the cyclic substrates studied; the corresponding ester substrates do so to a lesser extent. The enantioselectivity is determined by regioselective addition to the re or si site of the rhodium-complexed alkene. The effect of catalyst, ligand and borane on the observed diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity for a variety of cyclopentenyl ester and amide substrates is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new class of multideterminantal Jastrow–Slater wave {{functions}} constructed with localized orbitals and designed to describe complex potential energy surfaces of molecular systems for use in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Inspired by the generalized valence bond formalism, we elaborate a coupling scheme between electron pairs which progressively includes new classes of excitations in the determinantal component of the wave function. In this scheme, we exploit the local nature of the orbitals to construct wave functions which have increasing complexity but scale linearly. The resulting wave functions are compact, can correlate all valence electrons, and are size extensive. We assess the performance of our wave functions in QMC calculations of the homolytic fragmentation of N–N, N–O, <b>C–O,</b> <b>and</b> <b>C–N</b> bonds, very common in molecules of biological interest. We find excellent agreement with experiments, and, even with the simplest forms of our wave functions, we satisfy chemical accuracy and obtain dissociation energies of equivalent quality to the CCSD(T) results computed with the large cc-pV 5 Z basis se...|$|E

40|$|The lipids of the {{stratum corneum}} {{comprise}} {{the most important}} components of the skin barrier. In patients with ichthyoses or atopic dermatitis, {{the composition of the}} skin barrier lipids is disturbed resulting in dry, scaly, itching erythematous skin. Using the latest X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) technology, we investigated the physiological skin lipid composition of human skin and the effects of cold atmospheric plasma treatment on the lipid composition. Skin lipids were stripped off forearms of six healthy volunteers using the cyanoacrylate glue technique, plasma treated or not and then subjected to detailed XPS analysis. We found that the human lipid skin barrier consisted of 84. 4 % carbon (+ 1. 3 SEM%), 10. 8 % oxygen (+ 1. 0 SEM%) and 4. 8 % nitrogen (+ 0. 3 SEM%). The composition of physiological skin lipids was not different in males and females. Plasma treatment resulted in significant changes in skin barrier lipid stoichiometry. The total carbon amount was reduced to 76. 7 %, and the oxygen amount increased to 16. 5 %. There was also a slight increase in nitrogen to 6. 8 %. These changes could be attributed to reduced C-C bonds <b>and</b> increased <b>C-O,</b> C=O, <b>C-N</b> <b>and</b> N-C-O bonds. The moderate increase in nitrogen was caused by an increase in <b>C-N</b> <b>and</b> N-C-O bonds. Our results show {{for the first time that}} plasma treatment leads to considerable changes in the human skin lipid barrier. Our proof of principle investigations established the technical means to analyse, if plasma-induced skin lipid barrier changes may be beneficial in the treatment of ichthyotic or eczematous skin...|$|R
