40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} used in cryogenic applications need to {{have very}} high effectiveness to preserve the refrigerating effect produced. Normally the heat exchangers used in <b>cryogenic</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and liquefiers have effectiveness {{of the order of}} 0. 95 or higher. If the effectiveness of the heat exchangers falls below the design value, there may not be any liquid yield. Plate fin heat exchangers, because of their compactness, low weight and high effectiveness, are widely used in aerospace and cryogenic applications. Such heat exchangers have closely spaced fins and offer narrow and intricate passages for the fluid flow which often leads to significant pressure drop. The stringent requirement of high effectiveness in <b>cryogenic</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and liquefiers and high pressure drop occurring in plate fin heat exchangers make it necessary to test the heat exchanger before putting into operation in a liquefier. Plate fin heat exchanger (PFHE) is a type of compact exchanger that consists of a stack of alternate flat plates called parting sheets and corrugated fins, both being brazed together as a block. Streams exchange heat by flowing along the passages made by the fins between the parting sheets. Separating plates act as the primary heat transfer surfaces and the appendages known as fins act as the secondary heat transfer surfaces intimately bonded to the primary surface. Aluminum is the most commonly used material and stainless steel is employed in high pressure and high temperature applications...|$|R

Attention is given to a novel hydride compressor unit which has operated through 35, 000 cycles and exhibits negligible degradation of check valves, hydride particle size, and expansion valves. The power requirement for liquid hydrogen cooling can be halved through the use of recuperative hot water heating methods, making this system comparable in power use to liquid hydrogen refrigeration systems operating on electricity.

40|$|<b>Cryogenic</b> <b>refrigerators</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly popular particularly {{in the areas of}} superconducting magnet applications, particle accelerators and medical imaging systems, etc. It has also got wide applications in preservation of live biological materials as well as in scientific equipment. In spite of nearly half a century of R & D experience, our country is still dependent on imports for most of its needs in <b>cryogenic</b> <b>refrigerators</b> and liquefiers. These components are enormously expensive to buy and to maintain. The customers are often forced to buy equipment due to non-availability of proprietary spares. It is imperative that our country develops an indigenous nitrogen liquefier of capacity in the range 10 to 50 litre/hour. With the support from the Department of Atomic Energy, our institute has initiated a programme on development and study of a turboexpander based nitrogen liquefier of intermediate capacity (20 l/h). The focus of this project is to build a turbine based liquid nitrogen generator of capacity 20 l/h using indigenous technology. This technology and expertise will be extended for the liquefaction of helium in future. The development of the turboexpander based nitrogen liquefier begins with the process design of the cycle. The simulation of the cycles has been done using the software Aspen HYSYS. All the state points are fixed and each equipment specifications are determined. While designing the process, equipment availability, constraints and cost is to be kept in mind. Process design also includes the setting the parameters up to the optimum condition so that maximum amount of liquid will be obtained. After process design the thermodynamics parameters of all the components are available. As per process the nitrogen gas is compressed in the compressor upto 8 bar. The compressed gas passes through the first heat exchanger. Some amount of the gas is diverted through the turboexpander and remaining gas flow through the second heat exchanger. A JT valve is used to expand the liquid which is collected in the phase separator at a pressure just above ambient (1. 2 bar). The vapour comes out of phase separator mixes with the cold gas from the turboexpander and the resultant stream meets at the suction side of the compressor, after passing through the second and first heat exchanger as the reversed stream...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} losses in Stirling-Type <b>Cryogenic</b> <b>Refrigerators</b> (STCRs) is due to heat {{transfer}} and fluid flow irreversibility in the regenerative heat exchanger. Accurate numerical modeling of these losses requires extensive numerical simulation of coupled mass, energy and momentum conservation equations. In this study, a first order model is presented relating the mass flow rate and pressure at the hot and cold sides of the regenerator. Heat transfer and pressure drop in the regenerator are obtained assuming reasonable correlations for fluid friction and heat transfer in the regenerator. Therefore, exergy analysis of the regenerator can be performed and the exergy at the cold and hot sides of the regenerator can be related. A performance criteria based on exergetic efficiency of the regenerator is defined and evaluated.

40|$|A {{new type}} of rotary coolers based on the {{temperature}} change (ΔTrot) of an anisotropic superconductor when rotated in a constant magnetic field is proposed. We show that at low temperature the Sommerfeld coefficient γ(B,Θ) of a single crystalline superconductor, such as MgB 2 and NbS 2, sensitively depends on the applied magnetic field (B) and {{the orientation of the}} crystal axis (Θ), which is related to the electronic entropy (SE) and temperature (T) via the expression: SE=γT. A simple rotation of the crystal from one axis to one another in a constant magnetic field results in a change in γ and hence SE: ΔSE=ΔγT. A temperature change −ΔTrot ∼ 0. 94 K from a bath temperature of 2. 5 K is achieved by simply rotating the single crystal MgB 2 by 90 ° with respect to the c-axis direction in a fixed field of 2 T.
