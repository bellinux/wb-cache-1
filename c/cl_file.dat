The current post-processor architecture is able to translate the <b>CL</b> <b>file</b> in only one NC code. This constrain implies, on the one hand, the presence, in a manufacturing system, of as many post-processors as different machine tool control units, with high costs of programming and management, and on the other, the impossibility of interchange a NC part program on different CNC system, raising inefficiencies and higher costs of production system.

The real-time approach calculates new commands {{for the control}} loops during {{a short period of}} one sampling time. This makes the real-time interpolator capable of generating accurate references for the axes and eliminates unneeded in-segment accelerations and decelerations. Consequently, it produces smoother part surfaces and requires less machining time compared with conventional off-line approaches. With the new type of real-time interpolator, cutting a curve or surface requires only one NC g-eode instruction.

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{focuses on the}} process of machining complex and varying contour aerofoil parts used in aerospace industry like wings, blades of turbine and diffusers, etc. The main theme is to enhance productivity {{and on the other hand}} achieving accurate machining results for complex profile parts. The research consists of three main parts viz. Accurate and optimized tool path generation of complex profile, understanding and conversion of a 5 -axes machine kinematics into mathematical relationships and developing a post processor which converts cutter location file into machine readable file, and finally a time and accuracy study has been made and compared with techniques used previously for machining of such components. Tool path is generated on CAM software from where CL (Cutter Location) file is generated, then by use of mathematical calculations post processor is developed and used for the conversion of that <b>CL</b> <b>file</b> into machine readable file. Time and accuracy analysis has been made in the end on an impeller blade machining. Tool paths generated in CAM software requires to be very closely analyzed in order to ensure collision free tool paths as movement in all 5 -axes increases the chances of collision of head to work piece or with the table. For the study of 5 -axes machine kinematics and calculations, a general 5 -axes machine having 3 linear axes and two axes in rotary/tilting table has been used. By applying mathematical relationships using rotational matrix theorem and dot product of two vector quantities, equations were derived for rotary and tilting axes and then written in programming language (Visual C++) for line to line conversion of <b>CL</b> <b>file</b> into machine readable file. For the generation of <b>CL</b> <b>file</b> three different tool paths were generated. First process was the roughing of the area between every two adjacent blades then the next step was to finish the surface of the blades and the leading/trailing edge and the last process was to finish the hub surface of the impeller. The cutting parameters like feed, speed, axial depth of cut, radial depth of cut are dependent on the spindle power of the machine and the type of the material of part to be machined and that of the cutter itself. The selection of the size of the cutting tool used for the machining of each process is also dependant on the minimum area between two adjacent surfaces of the blades of impeller and maximum curvature of the blade from shroud surface to hub surface in order to avoid collision of the cutting tool with the blade surfaces. In the end, how the new approach has benefited is analyzed. The need for research on new approach was very demanding as to manufacture complex profile parts mostly used in aerospace industry with traditional machining approaches causes unpredictable delays due to manual calculations, inaccurate machining results like poor surface finish, tool breakage, etc, as well as requirement of various jigs/fixtures and skilled workers for accomplishing the task all the time. Now by adopting the approach as explored in this research gives a lot of advantages over traditional manufacturing approach. Some important features compared are presented in the tabular form...|$|E

40|$|The APT code {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{software}} tools for complex numerically controlled (N/C) machining. APT is an acronym for Automatically Programmed Tools and is used to denote both a language and the computer software that processes that language. Development of the APT language and software system was begun over twenty years ago as a U. S. government sponsored industry and university research effort. APT is a "problem oriented" language that was developed for the explicit purpose of aiding the N/C machine tools. Machine-tool instructions and geometry definitions are written in the APT language to constitute a "part program. " The APT part program is processed by the APT software to produce a cutter location (<b>CL)</b> <b>file.</b> This <b>CL</b> <b>file</b> may then be processed by user supplied post processors to convert the CL data into a form suitable for a particular N/C machine tool. This June, 1989 offering of the APT system represents an adaptation, with enhancements, of the public domain version of APT IV/SSX 8 to the DEC VAX- 11 / 780 for use by the Engineering Services Division of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Enhancements include the super pocket feature which allows concave and convex polygon shapes of up to 40 points including shapes that overlap, that leave islands of material within the pocket, and that have one or more arcs as part of the pocket boundary. Recent modifications to APT include a rework of the POCKET subroutine and correction of an error that prevented the use within a macro of a macro variable cutter move statement combined with macro variable double check surfaces. Former modifications included the expansion of array and buffer sizes to accommodate larger part programs, and the insertion of a few user friendly error messages. The APT system software on the DEC VAX- 11 / 780 is organized into two separate programs: the load complex and the APT processor. The load complex handles the table initiation phase and is usually only run when changes to the APT processor capabilities are made. This phase initializes character recognition and syntax tables for the APT processor by creating FORTRAN block data programs. The APT processor consists of four components: the translator, the execution complex, the subroutine library, and the CL editor. The translator examines each APT statement in the part program for recognizable structure and generates a new statement, or series of statements, in an intermediate language. The execution complex processes all of the definition, motion, and related statements to generate cutter location coordinates. The subroutine library contains routines defining the algorithms required to process the sequenced list of intermediate language commands generated by the translator. The CL editor re-processes the cutter location coordinates according to user supplied commands to generate a final <b>CL</b> <b>file.</b> A sample post processor is also included which translates a <b>CL</b> <b>file</b> into a form for use with a Wales Strippit Fabramatic Model 30 / 30 sheet metal punch. The user should be able to readily develop post processors for other N/C machine tools. The APT language is a statement oriented, sequence dependent language. With the exception of such programming techniques as looping and macros, statements in an APT program are executed in a strict first-to-last sequence. In order to provide programming capability for the broadest possible range of parts and of machine tools, APT input (and output) is generalized, as represented by 3 -dimensional geometry and tools, and arbitrarily uniform, as represented by the moving tool concept and output data in absolute coordinates. A command procedure allows the user to select the desired part program, ask for a graphics file of cutter motions in IGES format, and submit the procedure as a batch job, if desired. The APT system software is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch and interactive execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer under VMS 4. 4. The enhancements for this version of APT were last updated in June, 1989. The NASA adaptation, with enhancements, of the public domain version of the APT IV/SSX 8 software to the DEC VAX- 11 / 780 is available by license for a period of ten (10) years to approved licensees.

APT is an acronym for Automatically Programmed Tool and is used to denote the programming language. Development of the APT language and software system was begun in the late 1950 's as a U. S. government sponsored industry and university research effort. APT is a "problem oriented" language that was developed for the explicit purpose of aiding the N/C machine tools. The original APT program contained undocumented nonstandard FORTRAN, thus making porting of the processor to different operating systems difficult. P-APT (Portable APT) is a revised version of APT that was written to conform to the FORTRAN 77 standard. All machine-dependent code has either been replaced or isolated and documented. Machine-tool instructions and geometry definitions are written in the APT language to constitute a "part program". The APT part program is processed by the P-APT software to produce a cutter location (<b>CL)</b> <b>file.</b> This <b>CL</b> <b>file</b> may then be processed by user supplied post processors to convert the CL data into a form suitable for a particular N/C machine tool.

Although P-APT is written in standard FORTRAN 77 and was designed to be readily portable code, it has only been fully tested on a Sun 4 series computer running SunOs. By making documented modifications to the source code, it may also be ported to a DEC VAX series computer running VMS. P-APT required 3. 1 Mb of RAM for execution. A minimum of 16 Mb of RAM and 32 Mb of disk space used for swap space is recommended.

40|$|Most CAM {{packages}} {{available today}} provide NC simulation systems that generally use inexact solid representation {{as they are}} computationally intensive. Popular inexact volumetric NC simulation packages use either a voxel based 2. 5 D approach (particularly Image-space modeling) or Polyhedral approximations of 3 D objects. The former does not degenerate with time but has limited resolution whereas the latter has a selectable resolution but degenerates rapidly with time. As against these, the authors' use octree solid representation in their volumetric NC simulation system. This hierarchical space decomposition (HSD) technique combines the benefits of both the earlier approaches, i. e., it has a selectable resolution and does not degenerate with time. The basic input to the octree-based NC simulation system is the NC cutter path either in cutter location (CL) format or G/M-code format. After the CL data are interpreted, the swept volume of the cutter is intersected with the blank at every small sampling interval along the tool path and the intersection is considered as the undeformed chip. The chip parameters necessary for predicting the milling force are extracted and using the material removal rate (MRR) model and cutting force is predicted.

40|$|NEXUS, the NASA Engineering Extendible Unified Software system, is a {{research}} set of computer programs designed to support the full sequence of activities encountered in NASA engineering projects. This sequence spans preliminary design, design analysis, detailed design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing. NEXUS primarily addresses the process of prototype engineering, the task of getting a single or small number of copies of a product to work. Prototype engineering is a critical element of large scale industrial production. The time and cost needed to introduce a new product are heavily dependent on two factors: 1) how efficiently required product prototypes can be developed, and 2) how efficiently required production facilities, also a prototype engineering development, can be completed. NEXUS extendibility and unification are achieved by organizing the system as an arbitrarily large set of computer programs accessed in a common manner through a standard user interface. The NEXUS interface is a multipurpose interactive graphics interface called NASCAD (NASA Computer Aided Design). NASCAD {{can be used to}} build and display two and three-dimensional geometries, to annotate models with dimension lines, text strings, etc., and to store and retrieve design related information such as names, masses, and power requirements of components used in the design. From the user's standpoint, NASCAD allows the construction, viewing, modification, and other processing of data structures that represent the design. Four basic types of data structures are supported by NASCAD: 1) three-dimensional geometric models of the object being designed, 2) alphanumeric arrays to hold data ranging from numeric scalars to multidimensional arrays of numbers or characters, 3) tabular data sets that provide a relational data base capability, and 4) procedure definitions to combine groups of system commands or other user procedures to create more powerful functions. NASCAD has extensive abilities to handle IGES format data, including proposed solid geometry formats. This facilitates interfacing with other CAD systems. NEXUS/NASCAD supports the activities encountered in various engineering projects as follows: 1) Preliminary Design - Geometric models can be built from points, lines, arcs, splines, polygons, drive surfaces, ruled surfaces, and bicubic spline surfaces. Geometric models can be displayed in any view (including hidden line and hidden surface removal) to check design features, 2) Design Analysis - Geometric models and related data structures can be used to build a NASTRAN data deck. Calculated stress data can be added to model data structures and displayed as color variations on the geometric model, 3) Detailed Design - This phase consists of dimensioning and annotating the geometric model and generating manufacturing and assembly drawings, 4) Manufacturing - NASCAD developed geometric model and related data structures can be used to build input for the APT program which generates a cutter location (<b>CL)</b> <b>file</b> describing required tool motions, 5) Assembly - Generation of a robot plan for putting together or taking apart (repair) of a mechanical assembly based on an IGES solid geometry description, and 6) Testing - Correlation of test data can be made with predictions made during the design analysis phase. NEXUS/NASCAD is available by license for a period of ten (10) years to approved licensees. The licensed program product includes the source, executable code, command streams, and one set of documentation. Additional documentation may be purchased separately at any time. The NASTRAN and APT programs are distributed separately from the NEXUS/NASCAD system (contact COSMIC for details). The NEXUS/NASCAD system is written in FORTRAN 77 and PROLOG, with command streams in DEC Control Language (DCL), for interactive execution under VMS on a DEC VAX series computer. All of the PROLOG code deals with the robot strategy planner feature. A minimum recommended configuration is a DEC VAX with 1 megabyte of real memory, 100 megabytes of disk storage, and a floating point accelerator. For interactive graphics, NEXUS/NASCAD currently supports Tektronix 4114, 4016, 4115, & 4095 terminal, Lexidata Solidview terminals, and Ramtek 9400 terminals.

We have obtained flux densities, sizes, spectral indices and mass loss rates for each of the targets. These parameters allow us to analyze possible asymmetries, inhomogeneities and time variations in the flux densities. These features confirm the nonclassical behaviour of these winds.

These aspects carry over into our quantum scheme, but interference amongst the players' strategies can arise, leading to game equilibria different from the classical case.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of BVRI {{photometry}} of two galaxies with active star formation: NGC 834 and NGC 1134. Combined color index Q_{BVI} was used to investigate the photometrical structure of the galaxies. Index Q_{BVI} is not affected by internal extinction and is sensitive {{to the presence of}} blue stars. Ring-like region with active star formation at 15 " from the center reveals itself in the Q_{BVI} map of NGC 834. Three-arm spiral structure is well-seen on the Q_{BVI} map of NGC 1134. We propose to use the combined indexes Q_{BVI} and similarly defined indices as a tracers of Star Formation activity and structure of dusty galaxies.

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} give a broad {{overview}} of the present knowledge about neutron star magnetic fields, their origin and evolution. An up-to-date overview of the rich phenomenology (encompassing "classical" and millisecond radio pulsars, X-ray binaries, "magnetars", and "thermal emitters") suggests that magnetic fields on neutron stars span at least the range 10 ^ 8 - 15 G, corresponding {{to a range of}} magnetic fluxes similar to that found in white dwarfs and upper main sequence stars. The limitations of the observational determinations of the field strength and evidence for its evolution are discussed. Speculative ideas about the possible main-sequence origin of the field ("magnetic strip-tease") are presented. Attention is also given to physical processes potentially leading to magnetic field evolution.

40|$|We study s-process element {{abundance}} ratios in stars {{by carrying}} out stellar population synthesis, using a rapid synthetic stellar evolution code which includes an up-to-date treatment of AGB nucleosynthesis and evolution. In contrast to other studies, {{we find that}} a large spread in the 13 C efficiency parameter (13 C_eff) is not needed to explain the observed spread in the ratios of heavy s-process to light s-process elements ([hs/ls]), but this comes naturally from the range of different initial stellar masses and their time evolution. As a result, the 13 C efficiency needed for fitting most stars in the galactic disk is constrained to 1 < 13 C_eff < 2. 5. In the same fashion we also study the [Pb/Ce] ratios of lead stars and find out that for low metallicities 13 C_eff is approximately 0. 5.
