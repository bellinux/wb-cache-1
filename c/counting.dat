5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to construct and identify the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. <b>Counting</b> symmetry is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack).

Lastly note, <b>counting</b> symmetry is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same <b>counting</b> symmetry equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E
