5|$|The Ordinances were {{published}} widely on 11 October, {{with the intention}} of obtaining maximum popular support. The decade following their publication saw a constant struggle over their repeal or <b>continued</b> <b>existence.</b> Although they were not finally repealed until May 1322, the vigour with which they were enforced depended on who was in control of government.|$|E
5|$|The Vandals {{were also}} {{weakened}} by the hostility of their Roman subjects, the <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> among the Vandals of a faction loyal to Hilderic, and by the ambivalent position of the Moorish tribes, who watched the oncoming conflict from the sidelines, ready to join the victor and seize the spoils.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{conflict}} {{date back to the}} 7th century, when the Bulgars under Khan Asparukh established a state along the Danube in one of the provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire. As a result, the Bulgarian state was forced to fight a series of wars with Byzantium in order to secure its <b>continued</b> <b>existence.</b>|$|E

5|$|There were unfounded rumours of its <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> {{until the}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway stated that an extremely small population might still survive on small offshore islets, since this is often the last refuge of endangered birds. Hume countered that these islets were probably too small to sustain a population.|$|E
5|$|An {{indication}} of the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is that {{they appear to have}} been preferentially recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies. In the auxilia palatina infantry regiments, the proportion of barbarians in the ranks appears to have numbered anywhere between a third and a half of effectives (compared to a quarter in the army as a whole). From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's <b>continued</b> <b>existence,</b> by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that foreign}} support would be {{necessary}} for the <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> of the United Belgian States, the Statists tried {{to make contact with}} foreign powers they believed to be sympathetic. Despite numerous attempts, however, the revolution failed to gain foreign support. The Dutch were not interested and, although the Prussian king, Frederick William II, was sympathetic and did send some troops to aid the revolutionaries in July, Prussia was also forced to withdraw its forces under combined Austrian and British pressure.|$|E

5|$|Scots law has a basis {{derived from}} Roman law, {{combining}} features of both uncodified civil law, {{dating back to}} the Corpus Juris Civilis, and common law with medieval sources. The terms of the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 guaranteed the <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> of a separate legal system in Scotland from that of England and Wales. Prior to 1611, there were several regional law systems in Scotland, most notably Udal law in Orkney and Shetland, based on old Norse law. Various other systems derived from common Celtic or Brehon laws survived in the Highlands until the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|Within Scotland, {{the monarchy}} of the United Kingdom has {{continued}} to {{use a variety of}} styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland. The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law. The <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> of legal, educational, religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England.|$|E
5|$|As CAS, Williams had {{to contend}} with serious {{challenges}} to the RAAF's <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932, arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression. According to Williams, only after 1932 was the independence of the Air Force assured. Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London, resuming his position in June 1934. His promotion to air vice marshal on 1January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army and Navy. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June that year.|$|E

5|$|Athens is {{near the}} Blue Ridge Mountains area of North Georgia; this is an {{important}} region in the development of several varieties of folk music, including the Appalachian bluegrass style and the Piedmont blues. North Georgia's bluegrass heritage {{can be traced back to}} the 19th century, when bluegrass was a nascent style throughout Appalachia and North Georgia was home to major fiddling contests, beginning in the 1880s. A 1983 recording expedition by Art and Margo Rosenbaum documented the <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> of many forms of folk music, including work songs, string bands, African American hymns and spirituals, banjo tunes and unaccompanied ballads; the collection includes a chapter devoted to Doc and Lucy Barnes of Athens. Athens' modern contributions to the field of bluegrass include the Packway Handle Band and BlueBilly Grit.|$|E
5|$|Avatar, {{marketed as}} James Cameron's Avatar, is a 2009 American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced, and co-edited by James Cameron, and {{starring}} Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver. The film {{is set in}} the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> of a local tribe of Na'vi– a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with the mind of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.|$|E
5|$|Fraternity {{growth was}} {{interrupted}} by the Civil War, as men from many Southern colleges halted their studies to join the Confederate army. Many fraternity chapters ceased to exist during this time, but some students made efforts to preserve their fraternities as the war continued. Harry St. John Dixon, a member of Sigma Chi from the University of Virginia, joined with four other Sigma Chi brothers from other universities to form the Constantine Chapter of the fraternity. Created in 1864, this chapter was meant to preserve the bonds of the fraternity during the war, promote ties between the North and South, and ensure the fraternity's <b>continued</b> <b>existence.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1951, the Conservative Party {{returned}} {{to power in}} Britain, {{under the leadership of}} Winston Churchill. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> of the empire, with the base at the Suez Canal allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. However, Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser's new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in 1952, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow. Sudan was granted independence on 1 January 1956.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. Little is known about its behavior due to the paucity of sightings. Searches of Tawi-Tawi in 1971 and 1991 did not discover any evidence of the species' <b>continued</b> <b>existence.</b> Most of the bird's habitat was logged on Tawi-Tawi by 1994. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 revealed that the bleeding-heart was common until the 1970s and still survives on small islets near Tawi-Tawi. While another survey in 2009 failed to find the species, there is some hope that it may still persist. For this reason, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting.|$|E
5|$|Revenue {{remained}} a continual problem for Scottish government, {{even after the}} introduction of regular taxation from the 1580s, with receipts insufficient for the business of government and, after 1603, much of the costs being paid out of English revenues. In local government, attempts were made increase its effectiveness, {{with the creation of}} Justices of Peace and Commissioners of Supply. The <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> of courts baron and introduction of kirk sessions helped consolidate the power of local lairds. In law there was an expansion of central institutions and professionalisation of lawyers as a group. Scottish law was maintained as a separate system after the union in 1707 and from 1747 the central courts gained a clear authority over local institutions.|$|E

5|$|Sa'd al-Dawla was {{succeeded by}} his son, Sa'id Abu 'l-Fada'il Sa'id al-Dawla, but real power rested {{in the hands}} of Sa'd al-Dawla's former chamberlain, Lu'lu'. Several of the Hamdanid ghilman, resenting the {{influence}} of Lu'lu', went over to the Fatimids, who now launched a sustained offensive against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin. Only the personal intervention of Basil II in 995 and again in 999 would save the emirate from Fatimid conquest. Warfare lasted until 1000, when a peace treaty was concluded guaranteeing Aleppo's <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> as a buffer state between the two powers. Finally, in 1002, Lu'lu' assassinated Sa'id al-Dawla and assumed control of Aleppo in his own name.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} relocations along {{what is now}} K-383 {{occurred}} in Norton. US-36 and US-83 originally entered the city along Washington Street, turned north onto First Avenue, and turned east onto Main Street. The highway followed Main Street {{out of town and}} along a road paralleling the railroad to the present highway. The first realignment was authorized in 1936 to eliminate several right-angle turns and several at-grade railroad crossings. East of the intersection of First and Main, US-36 and US-83 turned north onto State Street and followed the highway to Holme Street, where the highways joined the present course. By 1941, this change was deemed unsatisfactory due to the <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> of right-angle turns and grade crossings. Shortly thereafter, the highways were moved to their present course bypassing downtown Norton.|$|E
5|$|The fledgling RAAF faced several {{challenges}} to its <b>continued</b> <b>existence</b> in the 1920s and early 1930s, and Williams received {{much of the}} credit for maintaining its independence. However an adverse report on flying safety standards saw him dismissed from the position of CAS and seconded to the RAF prior to World WarII. Despite support in various quarters for his reinstatement as Air Force chief, and promotion to air marshal in 1940, he never again commanded the RAAF. After the war he was forcibly retired along with other World War I veteran officers. He took up the position of Director-General of Civil Aviation in Australia, and was knighted the year before his retirement in 1955.|$|E
