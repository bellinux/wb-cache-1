50|$|Iloperidone {{performed}} well against a prepulse inhibition (PPI) experiment, {{which was designed}} to gauge the extent of sensory gating in rats, a process disrupted in schizophrenia. Prepulse inhibition is the reduction in the amount of startle the subject gives when presented with a non-startling stimulus. Those exhibiting high levels of psychosis present a deficit in PPI. Psychosis induced using PCP, apomorphine, and <b>cirazoline,</b> were all prevented with the concurrent administration of iloperidone. The PPI deficit normally incurred by each psychotic drug was significantly diminished by the co administration of iloperidone. The results of this experiment provided strong evidence for iloperidone’s merit as an effective treatment for psychotic disorders. Iloperidone has also been shown to reduce the effects of apomorphine induced climbing behavior in mice as well as the effects of head twitching induced by 5-HT in rats.|$|E
40|$|The alpha-i and alpha- 2 {{adrenergic}} {{effects of}} <b>cirazoline</b> were evaluated in guinea-pig aorta and field-stimulated guinea-pig ileum, respectively. <b>Cirazoline</b> {{was found to}} be a full agonist at alpha-i receptors having an ED 50, dissociation constant (KA) and relative efficacy similar to that of (-) -norepinephrine. In contrast, <b>cirazoline</b> does not possess agonist activity at pre-synaptic alpha- 2 receptors in the guinea-pig ileum. Thus, whereas norepinephrine and <b>cirazoline</b> both inhibited the twitch response of the field-stimulated ileum, only the response to norepinephrine was blocked by the selective alpha- 2 antago-nist, yohimbine. The nonadrenergic inhibition of the twitch response observed in the ileum with <b>cirazoline</b> resulted from weak anticholinergic activity (antimuscarinic) {{at the level of the}} postsynaptic effector organ and was observed only at high concentrations. At concentrations far below the level required to inhibit the twitch response, <b>cirazoline</b> was found to compet-itively antagonize the a/pha- 2 -mediated inhibition of the twitch response elicited by norepinephrine. A Schild plot analysis indicated that <b>cirazoline</b> is a potent competitive alpha- 2 recep-tor antagonist characterized by a pA 2 value (i. e.,-log KB) of 7. 56. These results indicate that <b>cirazoline</b> is unique among imidazolines in that it is a potent alpha-i adrenergic receptor agonist and an even more potent alpha- 2 receptor antagonist. This unusual combination of activities could make <b>cirazoline</b> a particularly effective vasoconstricting agent. <b>Cirazoline</b> (fig. 1) is an imidazoline with potent agonist activ-ity at postsynaptic atpha adrenergic receptors in vivo and in vitro (Lef#{ 232 }vre et at., 1975, 1976, 1977) and having little or no agonist activity at presynaptic atpha adrenergic receptors (Cay-O-CH 2 J Fig. I.

Both <b>cirazoline</b> and B-HT 933 produced dose-dependent vasoconstrictor responses in canine saphenous vein, with the maximum vasoconstnctor response elicited by B-HT 933 being only 75 % of that produced by <b>cirazoline.</b> Dissocia-tion constants {{were obtained for}} <b>cirazoline</b> (0. 61 zM) and B-HT 933 (4. 99 M) for interation with postsynaptic vascular alpha-i and alpha- 2 adrenoceptors, respectively, by the method of frac-tional irreversible receptor inactivation using phenoxybenzamine.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} proved that during a {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) challenge, norepinephrine (NE) {{levels in the}} preoptic area of the mammalian hypothalamus (PO/AH) rise and are correlated {{with an increase in}} core body temperature. Whole animal studies have revealed that selective activation of the ? 1 - and ? 2 -adrenergic receptors (ARs) can, respectively, induce a hyperthermic or hypothermic thermoregulatory response. Therefore, we hypothesize that in accordance with established models of neural thermoregulation, firing rate responses to the ? 1 -AR agonist <b>Cirazoline</b> and the ? 2 -AR agonist Clonidine should differ with respect to thermosensitivity of the neuron. To characterize these responses, single-unit recordings of neurons in rat hypothalamic tissue preparation were made. Neurons were classified as either warm sensitive or temperature insensitive through manipulations in local temperature. This was followed by treatment of the neuron with either <b>Cirazoline</b> or Clonidine. As hypothesized, the majority of insensitive neurons increased their firing rate when exposed to <b>Cirazoline</b> and decreased their activity when introduced to Clonidine. When warm sensitive neurons were treated with <b>Cirazoline,</b> all responded with a decrease in activity, while most increased their firing rate during treatment with Clonidine. These AR responses, in accordance with current neural thermoregulatory models, would produce the same hypothermic or hyperthermic effects on core body temperature as seen with in vivo studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} calmodulin antagonists was studied on the alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated {{increase}} in {{diastolic blood pressure}} in pithed rats and on the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated reduction of flow in the perfused hindquarters of the rat. B-HT 920 {{was used as a}} selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist in the pithed rat experiments, whereas <b>cirazoline</b> was used as a selective agonist for alpha 1 -adrenoceptors. The latter was used after pretreatment with nifedipine (1 mg/kg) or phenoxybenzamine (30 micrograms/kg), revealing calcium influx-insensitive and -sensitive mechanisms of vasoconstriction, respectively. Papaverine, calmidazolium and W- 7 did not influence the dose-response curves for the agonists in the pithed rat experiments. The modest effects of high doses of flunarizine and bepridil on the dose-response curve for B-HT 920 and of trifluoperazine on the dose-response curve for <b>cirazoline</b> {{can be explained by the}} well-known calcium entry (flunarizine) and alpha 1 -adrenoceptor-blocking (bepridil) effects of these drugs. Bepridil and calmidazolium caused an elevation of the <b>cirazoline</b> dose-response curves in the perfused rat hindquarters; flunarizine and trifluoperazine showed a parallel and dose-dependent displacement of the <b>cirazoline</b> dose-response curve to the right, whereas W- 7 was inactive.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of alpha 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated contraction {{was investigated in}} helical strips of the rat-tail artery. Muscle strips with the endothelium removed contracted {{in response to the}} alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist <b>cirazoline,</b> with half-maximal contraction at 0. 23 microM. The contractile response to a submaximal concentration of <b>cirazoline</b> (0. 3 microM) was biphasic, with a rapid phasic component peaking at approx. 30 s, followed by sustained tonic contraction. Phosphorylation of the 20 kDa light chain of myosin (LC 20) in response to 0. 3 microM <b>cirazoline</b> was also biphasic and closely matched the time-course of contraction. Resting LC 20 phosphorylation levels were 0. 22 +/- 0. 06 mol of Pi/mol of LC 20 (n= 3) and reached a maximum of 0. 58 +/- 0. 08 mol of Pi/mol of LC 20 (n= 3). Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that LC 20 phosphorylation occurred exclusively at serine- 19. The sustained phase of contraction was eliminated by removal of extracellular Ca 2 + and the phasic response was eliminated by depletion of endogenous Ca 2 + stores. Both phases of the contractile response were restored by re-addition of Ca 2 + to the bathing medium. LC 20 phosphorylation and both phases of the contractile response to 0. 3 microM <b>cirazoline</b> were inhibited by the myosin light-chain kinase inhibitor ML- 9 (30 microM). Resting LC 20 phosphorylation, however, was unaffected by ML- 9. Finally, both phasic and tonic responses to 0. 3 microM <b>cirazoline</b> were partially inhibited by chloroethylclonidine (50 microM), suggesting the involvement of both alpha 1 A and alpha 1 B adrenoceptors in these contractile responses...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac output, its {{distribution}} and tissue blood flows were determined with tracer microspheres in pithed rats during pressor responses elicited by either alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists (<b>cirazoline,</b> phenylephrine) or alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists (xylaxine, B-HT 933). Two doses {{were used for}} each of <b>cirazoline</b> and B-HT 933 and phenylephrine was investigated {{in the presence of}} propranolol (3 mg kg- 1). The rats were pithed under halothane anaesthesia. Cardiac output was increased by xylazine, the higher dose of B-HT 933 and phenylephrine. Heart rate was increased by phenylephrine and the higher doses of both <b>cirazoline</b> and B-HT 933. Stroke volume was greater in those groups given xylazine, phenylephrine and the higher dose of B-HT 933 but was decreased in those animals given the higher dose of <b>cirazoline.</b> Both alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists increased the number of microspheres trapped in the lungs and the proportion of the cardiac output passing through the hepatic artery but decreased that flowing through the spleen and gastrointestinal tract. The higher dose of B-HT 933 also decreased the fraction of cardiac output flowing to the kidneys but kidney blood flow was maintained {{as a result of the}} increased cardiac output. Also, this treatment reduced blood flow in the epididimal fat pads. Both alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists increased the fraction of cardiac output received by the coronary vasculature but the only other effect on distribution common to these agents was an increase in the percentage of the cardiac output passing to the hepatic artery. <b>Cirazoline</b> decreased the proportion of cardiac output distributed to the gastrointestinal tract and spleen but the total fraction of cardiac output passing to the hepatosplanchnic region was maintained as a result of the increase to the hepatic artery. <b>Cirazoline</b> markedly reduced the proportion of the cardiac output received by the kidneys and absolute flow in these organs was only 1. 4 % of control after the higher dose of this agonist but flow at the lower dose was maintained by the higher cardiac output. It is concluded that there is a significant contribution to the pressor responses elicited by alpha-agonists resulting from an alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in cardiac output that may result from greater heart rates or stroke volumes. Also, there is a differential distribution of alpha-receptor subtypes throughout the vasculature which is especially noticeable in the kidneys...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to define the postjunctional alpha adrenoceptor subtype(s) in large canine coronary arteries and to determine the dependency of contractions due to their activation upon the entry of extracellular calcium. Rings of left circumflex coronary artery were mounted at their optimal length for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with physiological salt solution. Phenylephrine and <b>cirazoline</b> were full agonists relative to norepinephrine. Methoxamine was a partial agonist relative to norepinephrine whereas clonidine, xylazine, B-HT 920 and B-HT 933 produced minimal contractions. Prazosin competitively inhibited the contractile response to phenylephrine (pA 2 = 8. 6), whereas rauwolscine caused a noncompetitive inhibition and was more than 100 times less potent than prazosin at inhibiting the response to phenylephrine. Similar results were obtained using norepinephrine (in the presence of propranolol) as the agonist. The calcium-entry blockers nimodipine, verapamil and diltiazem inhibited contractions caused by norepinephrine, phenylephrine and <b>cirazoline.</b> Removal of extracellular calcium abolished the response to <b>cirazoline.</b> These results suggest that in large canine coronary arteries: 1) only alpha- 1 adrenoceptors are present postjunctionally and 2) responses due to alpha- 1 adrenoceptor activation are dependent upon extracellular calcium. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that imidazoline I 2 binding sites (I 2 BSs) are present on monoamine oxidase (MAO) and on soluble (plasma) semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase enzymes. The binding site on MAO {{has been described}} as a modulatory site, although no effects on activity are thought to have been observed as a result of ligands binding to these sites. We examined the effects in vitro of several imidazoline binding site ligands on activities of bovine plasma amine oxidase (BPAO) and porcine kidney diamine oxidase (PKDAO) in a spectrophotometric protocol. While both enzymes were inhibited at high concentrations of all ligands, clonidine, <b>cirazoline</b> and oxymetazoline were seen, at lower concentrations, to increase activity of BPAO versus benzylamine, but not of PKDAO versus putrescine. This effect was substrate dependent, with mixed or biphasic inhibition of spermidine, methylamine, p-tyramine and β-phenylethylamine oxidation observed at <b>cirazoline</b> concentrations that increased benzylamine oxidation. With benzylamine as substrate, clonidine decreased KM (EC 50 8. 82 μM, Emax 75. 1 % of control) and increased Vmax (EC 50 164. 6 μM, Emax 154. 1 % of control). <b>Cirazoline</b> decreased Vmax (EC 50 2. 15 μM, Emax 91. 4 % of control), then decreased KM (EC 50 5. 63 μM, Emax 42. 6 % of control) and increased Vmax (EC 50 49. 0 μM, Emax 114. 4 % of decreased Vmax value). Data for clonidine fitted a mathematical model for two-site nonessential activation plus linear intersecting noncompetitive inhibition. Data for <b>cirazoline</b> were consistent with involvement of a fourth site. These results reveal an ability of imidazoline ligands to modulate BPAO kinetics allosterically. The derived mechanism may have functional significance with respect to modulation of MAO by I 2 BS ligands...|$|E

40|$|To {{characterize}} the structure-activity relationship between alpha 1 -adrenergic receptors {{and the family}} of imidazoline/guanidinium receptive sites (IGRS), we synthesized and characterized a series of analogues of <b>cirazoline,</b> an imidazoline with high affinity for alpha 1 -adrenergic receptors and IGRS. Analysis of potency, affinity and efficacy of the synthesized molecules indicate different structure-activity relationships for IGRS and alpha-adrenergic receptors. <b>Cirazoline</b> exhibits a 25 -fold higher affinity for IGRS (pKi 7. 9) than for alpha 1 -adrenergic receptors. Replacement of the cyclopropyl ring with an isopropoxy group resulted in a molecule that was 20 -fold more selective for alpha 1 -adrenergic receptors than for IGRS, i. e. a 500 -fold increase in selectivity relative to <b>cirazoline.</b> The unsubstituted derivative 3 and the methyl and allyl substituted analogues 4 and 12 are of particular interest: compounds 3 and 4 recognize IGRS with high affinity (pKi 7. 83 and 8. 17) and high selectivity (398 and 123) {{with respect to the}} alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor; compound 12 also recognizes IGRS with high affinity (pKi 8. 08) and high selectivity (228 and 138) with respect to the alpha 2 B and alpha 2 c-adrenergic receptor subtypes.

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that {{noradrenaline}} may regulate serotonergic (5 -HT) neurotransmission at the serotonin cell body and noradrenaline nerve terminal. Using microdialysis coupled to HPLC, we investigated the effects of alpha 1 -adrenoceptor manipulation on extracellular serotonin levels in the ventral hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and raphe nuclei in {{the presence or absence}} of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram. Extracellular 5 -HT levels from prefrontal cortex, ventral hippocampus and raphe nuclei were markedly increased following citalopram administration (3. 0 mg/kg s. c.). In the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus, local blockade of the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor (3. 0 mu M prazosin infusion) significantly decreased this citalopram-induced increase in serotonin, while <b>cirazoline</b> (alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist) and reboxetine (noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) further increased extracellular serotonin levels when administered systemically (0. 02 mg/kg i. p. and 5. 0 mg/kg s. c. respectively) or locally infused (10. 0 mu M and 1. 0 mu M respectively). Moreover, prazosin pre-infusion into terminal areas prevented the increase in citalopram-induced increase in serotonin levels with systemic <b>cirazoline</b> or reboxetine administration. Prazosin also decreased the citalopram-induced increase in serotonin levels in the raphe nuclei; however no enhancement of the SSRI response was observed with systemic or local administration of <b>cirazoline</b> or reboxetine, suggesting that alpha 1 -adrenoceptors may already be maximally activated under these conditions. These data provide strong evidence that after acute citalopram administration, the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor exerts a modulatory role on serotonin levels. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Pyramidal neurons of {{the medial}} prefrontal cortex (mPFC) project to {{midbrain}} serotonergic neurons and control their activity. The stimulation of prefrontal 5 -HT 2 A and AMPA receptors increases pyramidal and serotonergic cell firing, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) release in mPFC. As the mPFC contains abundant α 1 -adrenoceptors whose activation increases the excitability of pyramidal neurons, {{we examined the}} effects of their stimulation on local 5 -HT release, using microdialysis. The application of the α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist <b>cirazoline</b> by reverse dialysis increased the prefrontal 5 -HT release in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect antagonized by coperfusion of TTX, prazosin (α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist), BAY × 3702 (5 -HT 1 A agonist), NBQX (AMPA/KA antagonist) and 1 S, 3 S-ACPD (mGluR II/III agonist), but not by MK- 801 (NMDA antagonist). <b>Cirazoline</b> also enhanced the increase in 5 -HT release induced by DOI (5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C agonist) and AMPA. In addition, M 100907 (5 -HT 2 A antagonist) but not SB- 242084 (5 -HT 2 C antagonist) reversed the cirazoline- and AMPA-induced 5 -HT release. These results suggest that the stimulation of prefrontal α 1 -adrenoceptors activates pyramidal afferents to ascending serotonergic neurons. The effect of <b>cirazoline</b> was also reversed by coperfusion of classical (chlorpromazine, haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine, olanzapine) antipsychotics, which suggests that a functional antagonism of the α 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated activation of prefrontal neurons may partly underlie their therapeutic action.

Experiments {{were designed to}} elucidate the relationship between alpha adrenoceptor subtypes and sensitivity to calcium entry blockade. Rings of canine saphenous vein were mounted at optimal length for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with physiological salt solution. Nimodipine inhibited potassium-induced contractions and depressed contractions to norepinephrine {{in the presence of}} prazosin, an alpha- 1 adrenoceptor antagonist, but not under control conditions or {{in the presence of the}} alpha- 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine. Nimodipine depressed the maximal response to B-HT 920, an alpha- 2 adrenergic agonist and St- 587, a partial alpha- 1 adrenergic agonist, but did not affect that to <b>cirazoline,</b> a full alpha- 1 adrenergic agonist. However, after treatment with phenoxybenzamine, nimodipine depressed the response to <b>cirazoline.</b> Nimodipine inhibited contractions to tyramine under control or after prazosin but not after rauwolscine. Incubation in calcium-free solution depressed responses to St- 587 and B-HT 920 more than those to <b>cirazoline.</b> Incubation in calcium-free solution plus ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether) -N,N-tetraacetic acid abolished responses to all alpha adrenergic agonists. These results suggest that the sensitivity to calcium entry blockade of alpha adrenergic responses is not determined by the subtype of alpha adrenoceptor.

40|$|Several analogues of <b>cirazoline</b> (2), a {{selective}} alpha 1 -adrenoreceptor agonist, were prepared and their pharmacological profiles studied. Although at the alpha 1 -adrenoreceptor all the compounds displayed a significant agonist activity, at the alpha 2 -adrenoreceptor they showed either agonist or antagonist activity {{depending on the}} nature of the phenyl substituent. The qualitative structure-activity relationship led us to the conclusion that the oxygen atom in the side-chain is essential for alpha 1 -agonist activity, while the cyclopropyl ring is not, and may be replaced by several groups. Of the groups studied, isopropoxy appears to be the best. Instead, the same substitution (i. e., isopropoxy for the cyclopropyl ring) at alpha 2 -adrenoreceptors causes a reversal of activity.

Because of these discrepancies we have compared the effect of calcium entry blockade by nitrendipine on systemic and local (autoperfused hindquarters) pressor responses to selective adrenergic agonists: <b>cirazoline</b> for alpha- 1 and B-HT 920 for alpha- 2. Pithed, vagotomized, normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Confirming previous results, nitrendipine (3. 0 and 30. 0 micrograms/kg/min X 15 min) selectively antagonized the systemic pressor responses to B-HT 920 without affecting significant responses to the alpha- 1 agonist. However, in the isolated, autoperfused hindquarters of pithed rats, these same doses of nitrendipine depressed by 36 and 45 % the maximum vasoconstrictor response to <b>cirazoline.</b> Because no significant vasoconstrictor response to B-HT 920 could be demonstrated in this same preparation, we induced supersensitivity to the alpha- 2 agonist by reserpine pretreatment (0. 3 mg/kg X 3 days). Reserpine increased vascular responsiveness to B-HT 920, without modifying its selective alpha- 2 agonistic properties, as assessed {{by the use of}} selective alpha- 1 (prazosin, 0. 5 mg/kg i. v.) and alpha- 2 (rauwolscine, 0. 5 mg/kg i. v.) antagonists and of phentolamine (5 mg/kg i. v.), a nonspecific alpha adrenergic antagonist.

Exposure to nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) of tissues from normotensive but not hypertensive rats augmented contractions to <b>cirazoline.</b> While chloride removal did not alter cirazoline-induced contractions, it completely abolished the augmentation by L-NAME in normotensive rats. However, in hypertensive rats, removal of chloride ions significantly attenuated contractions elicited by <b>cirazoline,</b> and L-NAME effectively reversed this inhibition. Methacholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations of the same magnitude were evident in both normotensive and hypertensive rats. However, basal cyclic GMP levels {{were found to be}} significantly higher (7. 8 -fold) in blood vessels of normotensive rats compared to hypertensive rats. The resting membrane potential in pulmonary arteries of hypertensive rats (− 52. 1 ± 1. 04 mV) revealed a significant hyperpolarisation when compared with that of normotensive rats (− 46. 4 ± 1. 58 mV). <b>Cirazoline</b> did not produce a significant depolarisation in blood vessels of either normotensive or hypertensive rats. Perfusion with chloride-free solution resulted in a modest but significant hyperpolarisation (− 8. 0 mV) in the blood vessels of hypertensive but not in normotensive rats. We conclude that salt-dependent hypertension in Dahl rats is accompanied by functional and biochemical changes in low-pressure blood vessels.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze alpha- 1 and alpha- 2 {{adrenoceptor}} response coupling in isolated canine blood vessels. Rings of saphenous and femoral veins and of femoral arteries were suspended for isometric tension recording in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution, gassed with 95 % O 2 - 5 % CO 2 and maintained at 37 °C. Dissociation constants for the alpha- 1 adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine and <b>cirazoline,</b> and the alpha- 2 adrenergic agonist, UK 14, 304, were determined by analysis of concentration-effect curves to the agonists under control conditions and after partial inactivation of alpha adrenoceptors by phenoxybenzamine. The dissociation constant of phenylephrine for alpha- 1 adrenoceptors in saphenous veins was approximately 10 -fold higher than that obtained for the agonist in femoral arteries or femoral veins. Similarly the dissociation constant for <b>cirazoline</b> in the saphenous vein was higher than that obtained in other alpha- 1 adrenergic systems. Dissociation constants were used to determine alpha adrenoceptor occupancy-response relationships. The alpha- 1 adrenergic responses evoked by intrinsic-efficacy agonists (<b>cirazoline</b> and phenylephrine) were associated with a very large receptor-reserve in the saphenous vein, but no, or only a limited receptor-reserve in the femoral vein. The dissociation constant for UK 14, 304 in saphenous veins was significantly lower than that obtained for alpha- 2 adrenergic stimulation by norepinephrine. There was no alpha- 2 adrenoceptor reserve in the saphenous vein for these putative high intrinsic-efficacy agonists. The differences in receptor-reserve between alpha- 1 adrenoceptors in canine saphenous and femoral veins and between alpha- 1 and alpha- 2 adrenoceptors in saphenous veins may help to explain the differential modulation of adrenergic responses in these blood vessels. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The pressor {{responses}} to selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists (<b>cirazoline</b> and methoxamine) and to alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists (UK- 14, 304 and B-HT 933) were investigated in pithed, streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and age-matched control animals. Three months after induction of diabetes, the basal values of {{diastolic blood pressure}} (DBP) were the same in pithed diabetic and control rats (34. 3 +/- 4. 4 vs. 32. 8 +/- 4. 4 mm Hg, p greater than 0. 05, n = 30). In pithed diabetic rats, dose-response curves for the vasoconstrictor effects of <b>cirazoline</b> and methoxamine were shifted to the right with a slight decrease in the maximum response as compared with those in control animals. In contrast, no shift in dose-response curves for the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor effects was observed, as reflected by similar pD 2 values. A pronounced decrease in the maximum pressor response to the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists could be demonstrated. This reduction was significantly {{greater than that of}} the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists. In conclusion, the functional role of alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the peripheral resistance vessels appears to be differentially influenced by the diabetic stat...|$|E

40|$|The hypothyroid state {{accompanying}} {{diabetes mellitus}} {{has been suggested}} to be {{partly responsible for the}} diabetes-induced metabolic, hemodynamic, and pharmacological cardiovascular changes. We assessed the effectivity of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes mellitus and a hypothyroid state. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of diabetes and hypothyrodism on cardiac function and the inotropic responsiveness to the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist <b>cirazoline</b> in isolated perfused hearts. Fasted or nonfasted Wistar rats were made diabetic with STZ 20, 40 or 60 mg/kg intravenously (i. v.). Another group was made hypothyroid by addition of 6 -n-propyl- 2 -thiouracil (PTU) to their drinking water. Rats receiving PTU became hypothyroid, whereas rats receiving STZ became simultaneously diabetic and hypothyroid. Basal functional parameters obtained in isolated perfused hearts were not influenced by diabetes, whereas maximal contractility was reduced in hearts obtained from hypothyroid animals. Cardiac inotropic responses to <b>cirazoline</b> were increased in diabetic rats, whereas responses in hypothyroid rats were not different from those in hearts obtained from control animals. Although diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism are associated with various similar metabolic and haemodynamic parameters, the increased inotropic response to alpha 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation as observed in isolated perfused hearts of diabetic rats cannot be explained by the decrease in serum thyroxine level...|$|E
40|$|In {{segments}} of human right atrial appendages and pulmonary arteries preincubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline and superfused with physiological salt solution containing desipramine and corticosterone, {{the involvement of}} imidazoline receptors in the modulation of [3 H]-noradrenaline release was investigated. In human atrial appendages, the guanidines aganodine and DTG (1, 3 -di(2 -tolyl) guanidine) which activate presynaptic imidazoline receptors, inhibited electrically-evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release. The inhibition was not affected by blockade of α 2 -adrenoceptors with 1 [*]μM rauwolscine, but antagonized by extremely high concentrations of this drug (10 and/or 30 [*]μM; apparent pA 2 against aganodine and DTG: 5. 55 and 5. 21, respectively). In the presence of 1 [*]μM rauwolscine, [3 H]-noradrenaline release in human atrial appendages was also inhibited by the imidazolines idazoxan and <b>cirazoline,</b> but not by agmatine and noradrenaline. The inhibitory effects of 100 [*]μM idazoxan and 30 [*]μM <b>cirazoline</b> were abolished by 30 [*]μM rauwolscine. In the atrial appendages, the rank order of potency of all guanidines and imidazolines for their inhibitory effect on electrically-evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release {{in the presence of}} 1 [*]μM rauwolscine was: aganodine⩾BDF[*] 6143 [4 -chloro- 2 -(2 -imidazolin- 2 -yl-amino) -isoindoline]>DTG⩾clonidine>cirazoline>idazoxan (BDF[*] 6143 and clonidine were previously studied under identical conditions). This potency order corresponded to that previously determined at the presynaptic imidazoline receptors in the rabbit aorta. When, in the experiments in the human pulmonary artery, rauwolscine was absent from the superfusion fluid, the concentration-response curve for BDF[*] 6143 (a mixed α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist/imidazoline receptor agonist) for its facilitatory effect on electrically-evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release was bell-shaped. In the presence of 1 [*]μM rauwolscine, BDF[*] 6143 and <b>cirazoline</b> concentration-dependently inhibited the evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release. In human atrial appendages, non-adrenoceptor [3 H]-idazoxan binding sites were identified and characterized. The binding of [3 H]-idazoxan was specific, reversible, saturable and of high affinity (KD: 25. 5 [*]nM). The specific binding of [3 H]-idazoxan (defined by <b>cirazoline</b> 0. 1 [*]mM) to membranes of human atrial appendages was concentration-dependently inhibited by several imidazolines and guanidines, but not by rauwolscine and agmatine. In most cases, the competition curves were best fitted to a two-site model. The rank order of affinity for the high affinity site (in a few cases for the only detectable site; cirazoline=idazoxan>BDF[*] 6143 >DTG⩾clonidine) is compatible with the pharmacological properties of I 2 -imidazoline binding sites, but is clearly different from the rank order of potency for inhibiting evoked noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves in the same tissue. It is concluded that noradrenaline release in the human atrium and, less well established, in the pulmonary artery is inhibited via presynaptic imidazoline receptors. These presynaptic imidazoline receptors appear to be related to those previously characterized in rabbit aorta and pulmonary artery, but differ clearly from I 1 and I 2 imidazoline binding sites...|$|E
40|$|Both {{intracellular}} and extracellular {{sources of}} calcium {{are involved in}} the activation of contraction in vascular smooth muscle. In the diabetic or hypertensive state, or both, changes induced in calcium handling by various types of agonists may vary considerably. We investigated in which manner L-type calcium-channel blockade with nifedipine influences the pressor effects of the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists <b>cirazoline</b> and ST 587, the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist UK 14. 304 and angiotensin II, all exerting a differential influence on calcium homeostasis, in pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats rendered diabetic by an injection of 55 mg/kg streptozotocin. In diabetic WKY rats and SHR, the maximal pressor response was impaired for all agonists. The hypertensive state enhanced the maximal pressor response to all agonists. No difference was found in the nifedipine-induced depression of the pressor response to <b>cirazoline</b> and angiotensin II in the four groups of rats. The maximal pressor responses to ST 587 and UK 14. 304 were more effectively depressed by administration of 0. 3 mg/kg nifedipine both in diabetic WKY rats and in diabetic SHR than they were in their non-diabetic controls. Hypertension was associated with enhanced pressor response, whereas the diabetic state counteracted this effect. The pressor responses in pithed diabetic and diabetic hypertensive rats were clearly more dependent on the nifedipine-sensitive calcium influx than were those in their non-diabetic control...|$|E
40|$|Hypertension {{in humans}} and {{experimental}} animals {{is known to}} be associated with an increase in left ventricular myocardial mass. The development of cardiac hypertrophy is not caused by increased blood pressure alone; the autonomic nervous system may also play an important role. The functional responses to the beta-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline, dobutamine, salbutamol and terbutaline, and the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists methoxamine, <b>cirazoline</b> and phenylephrine were studied in isolated (Langendorff) hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. The results were compared with data from radioligand binding experiments. There {{was no significant difference in}} the increase of left ventricular pressure induced by all beta-adrenoceptor agonists studied in SHR and WKY rat hearts. Although there was no significant difference in the response to phenylephrine, the inotropic responses to <b>cirazoline</b> and methoxamine proved to be significantly weaker in hearts from SHR than in those from WKY rats. Binding experiments with 3 H-prazosin revealed no differences in density or affinity for cardiac tissues from SHR and WKY rats. Long-standing hypertension leads to an impaired response of the isolated heart to alpha 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation, without changes in alpha 1 -receptor density or affinity. It seems likely that changes in postreceptor events are responsible for the impaired inotropic response to alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists in hearts from SH...|$|E

As an extension to previous studies that showed {{an increase in}} ligand binding of cortical alpha- 1 adrenergic receptors (AR) and a dysfunction in alpha- 1 AR regulation of mesolimbic dopamine functions in post-pubertal nVH lesioned rats, we investigated the subcellular expression and activity of protein kinase C (PKC) [...] -a second messenger in alpha- 1 AR signaling [...] -in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of post-pubertal nVH lesioned rats. Western blot analysis of membrane and cytosolic fractions showed complex changes in lesioned animals in the expression of different PKC subtypes following saline or alpha- 1 AR agonist (<b>cirazoline</b> i. p.) injection. Among these changes, nVH lesioned animals showed {{a significant increase in}} membrane bound PKC alpha and phospho-PKC, and a decrease in cytosolic PKC gamma and PKC betaII in the PFC in comparison to sham-lesioned controls following saline. <b>Cirazoline</b> increased membrane bound PKC alpha in controls but decreased it in lesioned animals. In the NAcc, lesioned animals showed an increase in membrane bound and cytosolic PKC epsilon and PKC lambda levels following saline. Following <b>cirazoline,</b> lesioned animals showed a decrease in membrane bound PKC epsilon and PKC lambda, while controls showed an increase in cytosolic and membrane fractions of PKC epsilon with no change in PKC lambda. In vitro PKC activity assays showed increased basal activity in PFC slices of lesioned animals compared to controls, with no difference in NAcc slices. alpha- 1 AR stimulation by the agonist phenylephrine (PE) increased PKC activity in PFC of controls while decreasing activity substantially in lesioned animals. In the NAcc, high concentrations of PE increased activity in controls, but decreased activity in lesioned animals. This abnormal expression and activity of PKC in the PFC and NAcc of nVH lesioned animals may be related to abnormal alpha- 1 AR functions and may modulate some of the abnormal neuronal functions in these animals, such as working memory deficits and hyper neuronal excitability of the PFC and the NAcc...|$|E
40|$|Interactions {{between the}} {{putative}} calcium entry promotor Bay k 8644 and both α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor mediated increases in diastolic pressure were {{studied in the}} pithed normotensive rat. The α 2 -adrenoceptor mediated pressor responses elicited by B-HT 920, TL- 99, DP- 6, 7 -ADTN, and B-HT 958 were potentiated by Bay k 8644, reflected by a leftward shift {{and an increase in}} the maximum of the log dose-pressor response curves. The α 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated effects elicited by <b>cirazoline,</b> methoxamine, (-) -amidephrine, St 587, (-) -phenylephrine and Sgd 101 / 75 were less enhanced by Bay k 8644. Only a leftward shift of the dose-response curves was observed, which was most pronounced for (-) -phenylephrine and Sgd 101 / 75. The α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated pressor components of (-) -noradrenaline were similarly distinguished by Bay k 8644 as observed for the selective α 1 - or α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists. Effects of Bay k 8644 on the increase in diastolic pressure mediated by B-HT 920, St 587 and <b>cirazoline</b> were also studied after pretreatment with the calcium entry blocker nifedipine. After additional pretreatment with nifedipine the potentiation by Bay k 8644 observed for B-HT 920 and St 587 was more pronounced. The presence of nifedipine had no effect on the interaction between Bay k 8644 and <b>cirazoline.</b> It is concluded that Bay k 8644 behaves as a mirror image of nifedipine. The observation that Bay k 8644 enhances α 2 -adrenoceptor mediated pressor effects more effectively than - α 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated increases in diastolic pressure is in accordance with the hypothesis of the more pronounced calcium dependency of α 2 -adrenoceptor mediated pressor responses. The data obtained for St 587 and (-) -phenylephrine are in apparent contradiction to the finding that the pressor responses to the former drug are more markedly inhibited by calcium entry blockade than those of the latter. It is suggested that St 587 employs calcium channels which are already maximally modulated and that (-) -phenylephrine makes use of calcium channels which are in a rather inactive state. The hypothesis is put forward that the intrinsic activity of α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists reflects their ability to bring calcium channels in an active state...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate and compare the properties of noradrenaline release in the locus coeruleus (LC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). For that aim the dual-probe microdialysis technique was applied for simultaneous detection of noradrenaline levels in the LC and PFC in conscious rats. Calcium omission in the LC decreased noradrenaline levels in the LC, but increased its levels in the PFC. Novelty increased noradrenaline levels in both structures. Infusion of the az-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine decreased extracellular noradrenaline in the LC {{as well as in}} the PFC. Infusion of the alpha (2 A) -adrenoceptor antagonist BRL 44408, or the alpha (1) -adrenoceptor agonist <b>cirazoline</b> into the LC or PFC caused a similar dose-dependent increase in both structures. When BRL 44408 or <b>cirazoline</b> were infused into the LC. few effects were seen in the PFC. Infusion of the 5 -HT 1 A-receptor agonist flesinoxan into the LC or the PFC decreased the release of noradrenaline in both structures. When flesinoxan was infused into the LC. no effects were seen in the PFC. When the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline was applied to the LC, noradrenaline increased in the LC {{as well as in the}} PFC. It is concluded that the release of noradrenaline from somatodendritic sites and nerve terminals responded in a similar manner to presynaptic receptor modulation.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Intracellular {{signaling}} cascades can {{no longer}} be viewed as linear pathways that relay and amplify information. Often, components of different pathways interact, resulting in signaling networks. The interactions of different pathways and the dynamic modulation of the activities of the components within signaling pathways can create a multitude of biological outputs. The cell appears to use these pathways as a way of integrating multiple inputs to shape a uniquely defined output. These outputs allow the cell to respond to and adapt to an ever-changing environment. Understanding how biological systems receive, process and respond to complex data inputs has important implications for the design and utilization of sensors for a variety of applications, including toxicology, pharmacology, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring. This study uses the elicitor sets method, which is an experimental framework designed to monitor information flows through signal transduction pathways. The elicitor set approach has been used to derive mechanistic interpretations from the action of Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride (PMSF), a serine protease inhibitor and nerve agent analog. The elicitor panel comprises of signal transduction network effectors namely forskolin, clonidine, <b>cirazoline</b> and H 89, each of which targets the signaling pathway at known specific points. The elicitor set experiments enable compartmentalization of the cAMP signaling pathway, examining the role played by each segment and identifying possible cross-talk mechanisms. Our experiments substantiate that selection of adenyl cyclase as the reference node and 10 [mu]M forskolin as the primary elicitor, segments the upper portion of the G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) pathway associated with the G[sub q] and G[sub i] proteins. Application of the secondary elicitors, 100 nM clonidine (a 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist), 1 pM and 100 pM <b>cirazoline</b> (al-adrenergic receptor agonists), and 1 [mu]M and 100 [mu]M H- 89 (PKA inhibitor) fortifies the decoupling, as the system is unresponsive to clonidine and <b>cirazoline</b> in the presence of forskolin, while continuing to respond to H- 89. Exposure of the cells to 1 mM PMSF subsequent to forskolin addition restricted the quantifiable impact of PMSF to regions of the signaling pathways below adenyl cyclase. Triggering the system by use of secondary elicitors augmented the information resolution which is reinforced by the increased sensitivity of cells to 100 [mu]M H- 89 that acts at an important checkpoint below adenyl cyclase...|$|E
40|$|With {{respect to}} the heart, the {{prolonged}} existence of hypertension, both in man and in experimental animals is predominantly characterized {{by an increase in}} left ventricular myocardial mass. In this process, the autonomic nervous system plays an important role. Although endogenous catecholamine stimulation of the heart is mainly exerted via the beta-adrenoceptors, in several mammalian species, the stimulation of cardiac alpha 1 -adrenoceptors also mediates positive inotropic actions. We investigated the functional responses of isolated hypertrophied hearts taken from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and rats with an induced aortic stenosis (ASR) to various alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists and compared them with those from age matched Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and "sham" operated controls. Accordingly, we studied the functional response to: methoxamine (alpha 1), <b>cirazoline</b> (alpha 1) and phenylephrine (alpha 1 > beta 1). The inotropic response to the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists <b>cirazoline</b> and methoxamine proved to be significantly weaker in hypertrophied hearts from SHR and ASR than in non-hypertrophied hearts from WHY and "sham" operated controls (p < 0. 05). The inotropic response to phenylephrine remained intact in hypertrophied myocardial tissue. However, it was significantly reduced when the hearts were pre-treated with the intracellular Ca(2 +) -antagonists ryanodine and TMB- 8. These findings show that the mechanism of sarcolemmal Ca 2 + release, activated by phenylephrine, is still intact in the hypertrophied myocardial cell. In conclusion, these data show that cardiac hypertrophy, be it of genetical or mechanical origin, leads to a reduced response of the isolated heart to alpha 1 -adrenoceptor stimulatio...|$|E
