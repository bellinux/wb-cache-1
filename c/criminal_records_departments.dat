An axiom of these policies is that individuals with criminal records- even old criminal records- exhibit significantly higher risk of future criminal conduct than individuals without <b>criminal</b> <b>records.</b> In this paper, we use police contact data from the 1942 Racine birth cohort study to determine whether individuals whose last <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> occurred many years ago exhibit a higher risk of acquiring future <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> than individuals with no <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> at all.

40|$|This article uses unique {{data from}} over 300 {{criminal}} trials in four large counties {{to study the}} relations between the existence of a prior <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> and defendants testifying at trial, between testifying at trial and juries 2 ̆ 7 learning about a <b>criminal</b> <b>record,</b> and between juries 2 ̆ 7 learning about a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> and their decisions to convict or acquit. Sixty percent of defendants without <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> testified compared to 45 percent with <b>criminal</b> <b>records.</b> For testifying defendants with <b>criminal</b> <b>records,</b> juries learned of those records in about half the cases. Juries rarely learned about <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> unless defendants testified. After controlling for evidentiary strength and other factors, statistically significant associations exist (1) between the existence of a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> and the decision to testify at trial, (2) between the defendant testifying at trial and the jury learning about the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s prior record, and (3) in cases with weak evidence, between the jury learning of a <b>criminal</b> <b>record</b> and conviction. For cases with strong evidence against defendants, learning of <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> is not strongly associated with conviction rates. Juries appear to rely on <b>criminal</b> <b>records</b> to convict when other evidence in the case normally would not support conviction. Use of prior record evidence may therefore lead to erroneous convictions.
