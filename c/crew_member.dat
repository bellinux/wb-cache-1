5|$|In {{the early}} days of the service, {{lifeboat}} launch and recovery was usually undertaken by women. There were deeply-held views about women actually crewing the boats themselves – it was considered extremely bad luck. Along all parts part of the coastline, women supported their men on the lifeboat crews by working together to get the lifeboat afloat and then later recovering it from the water in readiness for when the next call came. While lifeboat crew are still predominantly male (92%), the first female (inshore) <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> was Elizabeth Hostvedt in 1969, and Frances Glody was the first woman <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> on an all-weather lifeboat, at Dunmore East Lifeboat Station, in 1981.

If necessary, the additional <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> can travel on the upper deck of the vehicle, but those <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> must remain outside the vehicle and thus exposed to fragmentationen effects and small arms fire.The onboard ammunitions storage was much smaller than in self-propelled guns following the M109 pattern.|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science experiments on board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E

After the Alien hatches from Gilbert Kane's chest and murders Samuel Brett, Dallas enters the ship's air ducts to lure it to the airlock and eject it into space. He is attacked by the Alien and disappears – presumed dead – leaving only his flamethrower.|$|E

40|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{success of}} the Patriot Air Defense weapon system during Operation Desert Storm has become a double edge sword for the system's enlisted <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> and their families.

The people and the governments of Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States praised the Patriot <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> as true heroes. Unfortunately for the Patriot <b>crew</b> <b>members,</b> their success also meant that every country wanted the protection that the system offered. A battalion is now permanently stationed in Korea. Another battalion rotates every six months to Saudi Arabia.
