5000|$|One of the {{important}} features built {{on top of the}} Netfilter framework is <b>connection</b> <b>tracking.</b> <b>Connection</b> <b>tracking</b> allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this information to translate all related packets in the same way, and [...] can use this information to act as a stateful firewall.|$|E
50|$|At its {{southeast}} end, the CN&L {{connects to}} the Hamlet Subdivision, Eastover Subdivision, and Columbia Subdivision. It has a gap near Clinton, where it uses the Monroe Subdivision, and ends at the Spartanburg Subdivision north of Laurens. The CN&L <b>connection</b> <b>track</b> north of Laurens opened in late July 1996, allowing CSX to easily route Florida-bound trains around downtown Laurens and onto the CN&L.|$|R
50|$|Beginning at Odéon {{the route}} of line 10 becomes complixed as it must pass an {{intersection}} with line 4. The two tracks part in order to yield passage to the <b>connection</b> <b>tracks</b> that arrive {{in the middle of}} the circulation tracks and level off at the station Cluny - La Sorbonne. The <b>connection</b> <b>tracks</b> rejoin the other tracks of line 10 before the station Maubert - Mutualité. The same principle is in effect with the connection to line 7 but these double tracks pass under the tracks of line 10 before the station Cardinal Lemoine. When the route reaches the station Jussieu, lines 7 and 10 follow parallel routes which allows for the platforms of the two lines to be side-by-side. Finally, the line follows bends in both direction under the Jardin des plantes to arrive at the terminus, Gare d'Austerlitz. The arrival is situated under the arrivals hall of the train station, and the turn-around loop is under the railroad tracks. This cul-de-sac is peculiar in the sense that it is configured to receive an underwater passing coming from the gare de Paris-Lyon.|$|R
50|$|Cameron is {{the site}} of a 1996 <b>connection</b> <b>track</b> that was built between the former Burlington Northern line and the former Santa Fe's Chilicothe Subdivision, when the two merged to form the BNSF. This track allows both freight trains, along with Amtrak's Southwest Chief to use the Chicago and Mendota subdivisions between Chicago and Galesburg(already used by the California Zephyr), by way of Naperville, Princetonand Mendota. Prior to 1996, the Southwest Chief, and its predecessor, the Santa Fe's famed Super Chief, {{traveled}} to Galesburg on the Chilicothe subdivision by way of Joliet, Streator, and Chillicothe.|$|R

50|$|Health network {{surveillance}} {{also has a}} proactive impact by providing business intelligence and network monitoring that can improve a health organization’s efficiency and effectiveness through real time information that can support decision making about network architecture, business processes and resource allocation.

The use of <b>connection</b> <b>tracking</b> works to record every connection between devices in a monitored network. There may be advantages in <b>connection</b> <b>tracking</b> techniques as they avoid sampling, produce more data in real time and put less load on the functioning of networks.|$|E

The annual amounts varied, with the express cargo following to 20 tonnes and regular cargo 878 tonnes by 1911. Then traffic rose, reaching 140 and 5,600 tonnes, respectively, in 1920.
