5|$|On January 27, 1967, {{the date}} of the Apollo 1 fire, Armstrong was in Washington, D.C., with Gordon Cooper, Dick Gordon, Jim Lovell and Scott Carpenter for the signing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty. The astronauts <b>chatted</b> <b>with</b> the {{assembled}} dignitaries until 6:45p.m. when Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where they each found messages to phone the Manned Spacecraft Center. During these telephone calls, they learned of the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee. Armstrong and the group {{spent the rest of the}} night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened.|$|E

25|$|He had a {{far more}} {{successful}} Nationwide Series season than Sprint Cup Series season, including a win at the NAPA 200 at Montreal. In the race Edwards had a top-ten position until a final green-white-checker finish put him in third spot on the restart. Edwards passed Andrew Ranger for second and recovered from spinning his tires on the restart {{to catch up with}} dominant leader Marcos Ambrose. Edwards was unable to pass the Australian champion until the final turn of the final lap when Ambrose jumped over the curb too high. Edwards passed him and won the race in a big shock to the racing world; a finish considered {{to be one of the}} greatest of the sport. Edwards was elated about getting his first road course win at one of the most famous tracks in the world; has said that the Montreal race is his favorite winning performance, and that Marcos had <b>chatted</b> <b>with</b> him that week and taught him about the track during meetings which he credited for his success.|$|E

25|$|Much of hippie style {{had been}} {{integrated}} into mainstream American society {{by the early}} 1970s. Large rock concerts that originated with the 1967 KFRC Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival and Monterey Pop Festival and the 1968 Isle of Wight Festival became the norm, evolving into stadium rock in the process. The anti-war movement reached its peak at the 1971 May Day Protests as over 12,000 protesters were arrested in Washington DC. President Nixon himself actually ventured out of the White House and <b>chatted</b> <b>with</b> a group of the 'hippie' protesters. The draft was ended soon thereafter, in 1973. During the mid 1970s, {{with the end of}} the draft and the Vietnam War, a renewal of patriotic sentiment associated with the approach of the United States Bicentennial and the emergence of punk in London, Manchester, New York and Los Angeles, the mainstream media lost interest in the hippie counterculture. At the same time there was a revival of the Mod subculture, skinheads, teddy boys and the emergence of new youth cultures, like the goths (an arty offshoot of punk) and football casuals. Acid rock gave way to prog rock, heavy metal, disco, and punk rock.|$|E

500|$|In 1934, Brownlee was {{embroiled in}} a sex scandal, with major {{consequences}} to his political career. [...] Those involved with the scandal gave widely disparate accounts of the surrounding facts; on {{only a minority of}} details did the parties agree. [...] In 1930, Brownlee visited Edson while campaigning in the 1930 provincial election. [...] While there, Allan MacMillan—the mayor of Edson and a political ally of Brownlee's—took him to a farmers' picnic. [...] On the way to the event, Brownlee <b>chatted</b> <b>with</b> MacMillan's daughter, Vivian, then seventeen years old and unsure as to her future.

500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2005; the crew filmed for ten {{hours a day}} for thirty-one days. The eleven-year-old Palmer had to follow the United States' child labor laws, which necessitated {{spending}} at least three hours a day at school, one on recreation, and one at lunch. Nevertheless, Palmer appeared in almost every scene, about which Ganis commented, [...] "I honestly don't know how we figured it out, but we did". To get the filming done on time, Atchison storyboarded the scenes ahead of time and <b>chatted</b> <b>with</b> cinematographer David Mullen, the production designer Warren Young, and Glenn Farr to compile a list of scenes. This way, the filming team began each day knowing what shots they would take, their order, and the performances scheduled for each day. Most of the filming took place in South Los Angeles, which Atchison picked as the filming location due to their low budget. Scenes were also filmed at the University of Southern California, Hollywood Palladium—which stood in for the Grand Ballroom of the Washington, D.C. Hyatt Hotel—and Venice High School.|$|E

[...] "Eyes Wide Shut" [...] represented a new style for Entwistle. Featuring Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton, Entwistle's style had evolved from simple line drawings and caricatures to a more lifelike representation of his subjects. He was more confident and relaxed with his art and ready to share that with his collectors.|$|E

2500|$|Guan Yu {{was once}} {{injured in the}} left arm by a stray arrow, which pierced through his arm. Although the wound had healed, he would {{experience}} pain in the bone whenever there was a heavy downpour. A physician told him, [...] "The arrowhead had poison on it and the poison had seeped into the bone. The {{way to get rid}} of this problem is to cut open your arm and scrape away the poison in your bone." [...] Guan Yu then stretched out his arm and asked the physician to heal him.

On August 18, his doctors were optimistic about his prognosis. The media was told that unless Valentino's condition deteriorated, no updates would be given. However, his condition worsened on August 21. He was stricken with a severe relapse of pleuritis, which developed rapidly in his left lung due to his weakened condition. The doctors realized that Valentino was going to die, but as was common at the time, chose to withhold this information. Valentino reportedly believed that he would recover. During the early hours of Monday, August 23, Valentino was briefly conscious and <b>chatted</b> <b>with</b> his doctors about his future, but soon lapsed into a coma.

2500|$|In the 1949 federal {{election}} that followed his ascension to the Liberal leadership, many wondered, including Liberal party insiders, if St-Laurent {{would appeal to}} the post-war populace of Canada. On the campaign trail, St-Laurent's image was developed into somewhat of a 'character' and what {{is considered to be}} the first 'media image' to be used in Canadian politics. St-Laurent <b>chatted</b> <b>with</b> children, gave speeches in his shirt sleeves, and had a 'common touch' {{that turned out to be}} appealing to voters. At one event during the 1949 election campaign, he disembarked his train and instead of approaching the assembled crowd of adults and reporters, gravitated to, and began chatting with, a group of children on the platform. A reporter submitted an article entitled [...] "'Uncle Louis' can't lose!" [...] which earned him the nickname [...] "Uncle Louis" [...] in the media (Papa Louis in Quebec). With this common touch and broad appeal, he subsequently led the party to victory in the election against the Progressive Conservative Party led by George Drew. The Liberals won 190 seats—the most in Canadian history at the time, and still a record for the party.|$|E
2500|$|The {{official}} poster featured D'Arcy carrying Riseborough on {{his back}} in a romantic pose. David Wharton from Cinema Blend was not impressed with the poster, saying that although he felt it was [...] "artfully" [...] done, [...] "It's the sort of thing the movie industry does all the time on their posters, just like the 'floating heads' trope or the 'looking through somebody's legs' pose. ut I'm a sucker for a well-done movie poster, and this just seems lazy." [...] A second poster was also released, which again featured Riseborough and D'Arcy as Wallis and Edward, about to kiss on a beach. Written on the top left of the poster is the following line: [...] "One of the greatest love stories of all time, the king who gave up his throne for the woman he loved." [...] Throughout January 2012, Madonna appeared on two different television shows and talked about the film. She first appeared on the ABC show called Nightline, where she <b>chatted</b> <b>with</b> the host Cynthia McFadden about W.E.

[...] The guard on duty, Officer Cox, turned to retrieve them as another guard opened the door to let a third guard out. [...] As soon as the door opened, Myles rushed through, brandishing a meat cleaver he had acquired from the kitchens. [...] Toms threatened the other guards with a knife, and they allowed themselves to be herded into a nearby lavatory. [...] Myles burst into Deputy Warden Rothe's office and attacked Rothe with the cleaver. [...] Rothe deflected the blow with a plywood letterbox.|$|E
