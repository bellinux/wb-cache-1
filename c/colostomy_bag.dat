She publicly displayed her wounds in photographs published in an issue of Contacto Ciudadano magazine, and repeated her statement that she would continue her work.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 Zaharias was {{diagnosed}} with colon cancer. After undergoing surgery, she made a comeback in 1954. She took the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average, her only win of that trophy, and her 10th and final major with a U.S. Women's Open championship, {{one month after the}} surgery and while wearing a <b>colostomy</b> <b>bag.</b> With this win, she became the second-oldest woman to win a major LPGA championship tournament (behind Fay Crocker).

50|$|Full-body {{scanning}} technology allows screeners {{to see the}} nude surface of the skin under clothing, prosthetics including breast prostheses and prosthetic testicles, which may require a potentially embarrassing, hands-on physical inspection once detected. The scanners can also detect other medical equipment normally hidden, such as <b>colostomy</b> <b>bags</b> and catheters. Other privacy concerns come from the transgender community, who may feel that the routine full-body scans are embarrassing and could potentially lead to harassment.|$|R
40|$|Children {{with complex}} needs being cared for {{in their own}} homes are a small but {{increasing}} proportion of those receiving community services. Diagnoses common to children with special health care needs are numerous and include preterm birth, congenital genetic and metabolic disorders, neurological disorders, sequelae of severe infections, or trauma and malignancies. These can include one or more chronic conditions, functional limitations often associated with technology assistance, and health care use. Technology dependency refers to the use of medical devices without which—if they were to fail or be discontinued—adverse health consequences and hospitalization would likely follow. Examples include mechanical ventilators, intravenous catheters, tracheostomy tubes, enteral feeding devices, <b>colostomy</b> <b>bags,</b> and urinary catheters...|$|R

5000|$|Historically, privacy advocates were {{concerned}} about the use of full body scanning technology because it used to display a detailed image of the surface of the skin under clothing, prosthetics including breast prostheses, and other medical equipment normally hidden, such as <b>colostomy</b> <b>bags.</b> [...] These privacy advocates called the images [...] "virtual strip searches". [...] However, in 2013 the U.S. Congress prohibited the display of detailed images and required the display of metal and other objects on a generic body outline instead of the person's actual skin. Such generic body outlines can be made by Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) software. As of June 1, 2013, all full body scanners in use at U.S. airports have used ATR.|$|R
5000|$|Tank Girl: Her {{real name}} in the strip is Rebecca Buck, but this is very rarely {{mentioned}} throughout. In the kickstarter edition of 21st Century Tank Girl it is discovered that she was actually born under the name Fonzie Rebecca Buckler. According to her own history included as a preface {{to one of the}} books, her first words were [...] "cauliflower penis". When she was 7, she started a collection of novelty pencil sharpeners (the collection is now housed in the National Museum of Modern Pencil Sharpeners, Sydney). She later became a tank pilot and worked as a bounty hunter before shooting a heavily decorated officer, having mistaken him for her father, and failing to deliver <b>colostomy</b> <b>bags</b> to President Hogan, the incontinent Head of State in Australia, resulting in him publicly embarrassing himself at a large international trade conference. These events resulted in Tank Girl becoming an outlaw with a multi-million dollar bounty on her head. She is prone to random acts of sex and violence, hair dyeing, flatulence, nose-picking, vomiting, spitting, and more than occasional drunkenness. She also has the ability to outrun any ice cream van - even Mr. Whippy.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{describe}} the response of broiler breeder hens to dietary amino acids and to develop an effective model for the precise feeding of these birds after sexual maturity, accurate estimates of the amounts of each amino acid required for maintenance and egg production are needed. The maintenance requirement for threonine and lysine were estimated in two different experiments by measuring the nitrogen balance of adult male cockerels. Measured amounts of a diet first-limiting in threonine or lysine were fed by intubation each day for 4 d to give a range of intakes (unbalanced series) of from 0 to 239 mg threonine/kg or 0 to 40 mg lysine/kg body weight. To confirm that threonine or lysine was first-limiting and that the response obtained was to threonine or lysine and not to protein, a second series of diets was used (balanced series) in which synthetic threonine or lysine was added to each diet in the unbalanced series. A nitrogen-free diet containing energy, vitamins and minerals was made available ad libitum during the balance period, {{to ensure that the}} birds remained in positive energy balance. The balance period was three days and excreta were collected in <b>colostomy</b> <b>bags</b> (threonine) or in trays (lysine) during that time. The nitrogen content of the excreta was determined on dried homogenised samples. The resultant linear regression equations describing the effect of threonine or lysine intakes on nitrogen retention were: N retention =- 230. 4 (± 27. 6) + 4. 13...|$|R

50|$|A bag {{may or may}} not be {{disposable}}; however, even {{a disposable}} bag can often be used many times, for economic and environmental reasons. On the other hand, there may be logistic or hygienic reasons to use a bag only once. For example, a garbage bag is often disposed of with its content. A bag for packaging a disposable product is often disposed of when it is empty. Similarly, bags used as receptacles in medical procedures, such as the <b>colostomy</b> <b>bag</b> used to collect waste from a surgically diverted biological system, are typically disposed of as medical waste. Many snack foods, such as pretzels, cookies, and potato chips, are available in disposable single-use sealed bags.|$|E

50|$|The airline {{has come}} under heavy {{criticism}} for its poor treatment of disabled passengers. In 2002, it refused to provide wheelchairs for disabled passengers at London Stansted Airport, greatly angering disabled rights groups. The airline argued that this provision was {{the responsibility of the}} airport authority, stating that wheelchairs were provided by 80 of the 84 Ryanair destination airports, at that time. A court ruling in 2004 judged that the responsibility should be shared by the airline and the airport owners; Ryanair responded by adding a surcharge of £0.50 to all its flight prices. In July 2012, a 69-year-old woman, Frances Duff, who has a colostomy, was refused permission to bring her medical kit on board, despite having a letter from her doctor explaining the need for her to carry this with her, and was asked by Ryanair boarding staff to lift up her shirt in front of fellow passengers, to prove that she had a <b>colostomy</b> <b>bag.</b> Duff had previously attempted to contact Ryanair on three occasions to inquire about their policy on travellers colostomy bags, but each time no one had answered the phone after half an hour. On 4 April 2011, Ryanair began adding a surcharge of €2 to its flights to cover the costs arising from compliance with EC Regulation 261/2004, which requires it to pay for meals and accommodation for passengers on delayed and cancelled flights.|$|E
5000|$|After a mini-tour {{in early}} 1992, Peter Lee was hired, at the {{recommendation}} of Ministry guitarist Mike Scaccia, as the new guitarist (Scaccia had turned them down to continue working with Ministry - Scaccia and Lee were both in a band together, along with future Gwar bassist Casey Orr; it was Lee who enlisted Orr in 1994). He first played on This Toilet Earth. In 1993, Lee was shot in an attempted carjacking, {{and was unable to}} film much of [...] "Skulhedface" [...] due to injuries to his stomach. He did manage to film a commercial segment with Dave Brockie, where Lee first suggested the idea of police officers (both were dressed as policemen) playing rock music.

One music video from that period, [...] "Jack The World," [...] features Lee as Flattus, and he is seen wearing a <b>colostomy</b> <b>bag,</b> which he also wore during a brief tour in October 1993.
