40|$|Abstract: A use-or-lose {{provision}} {{requires that}} firms employ a certain minimum fraction of their productive capacity. Variants {{have been used}} by regulators in the airline and wireless communications industries, among others. A typical stated objective is to limit <b>capacity</b> <b>hoarding,</b> thereby increasing aggregate output and welfare. When the dominant firm is more efficient than fringe firms, we find that imposing a use-or-lose provision induces the dominant firm to acquire capacity from the fringe, which causes aggregate output to fall. When the dominant firm is less efficient than the fringe, aggregate output rises. In both cases, total surplus may rise or fall. (JEL D 42, L 12, L 51. ...|$|E
40|$|During the Soviet era, {{directors}} and workers derived mutual benefits from concealing true <b>capacity,</b> <b>hoarding</b> labour and just fulfilling an enterprise's plan. In {{an environment of}} labour shortages and guaranteed markets, managers used informal mechanisms to reward and retain good workers given the absence of unemployment and meaningful wage differentials as mechanisms to discipline workers. This cultivated a paternalistic set of relations between enterprise managers and workers that, it is argued, are being hollowed out in the post-communist era. This is explored in {{a case study of}} evolving labour relations in Moldova. Casualisation of the workforce {{has been used as a}} buffer against greater instability in both the supply of raw materials and demand. Such a strategy has become feasible as enterprises, such as the case study firm, now have a large pool of external surplus labour on which they can draw. However paternalism has not been hollowed out fully but rather a split-level realignment is documented...|$|E
40|$|Many mobile {{devices have}} {{reached the point where}} the users' (active) working set is smaller than the amount of storage {{available}} and that trend is likely to continue. Currently these resources are made available for recording new data, but we think that we could make better use of this <b>capacity.</b> <b>Hoarding</b> previously not accessed data could give better data coverage in cases of disconnected operation, when wireless networks are not available or access to them is expensive. We gathered a trace from a university file system used by more than 5000 people over a period of 16 months. This trace is used to drive a simulation model of distributed file systems. This paper studies a novel hoarding scheme that uses the access profile of other users to predict what files a user would need in the future. This hoarding scheme is shown to avoid between 30 % and 75 % of remote file accesses to files that are accessed for the first time. Furthermore, hoarded but not used data can be expired, because we note experimentally that the population shifts focus each month...|$|E
60|$|She {{wished he}} would go on for ever talking of plants, and showing her how science felt not quite blindly for the law that ruled their endless variations. A law that might be inscrutable but was {{certainly}} omnipotent appealed {{to her at the}} moment, because she could find nothing like it in possession of human lives. Circumstances had long forced her, as they force most women in the flower of youth, to consider, painfully and minutely, all that part of life which is conspicuously without order; she had had to consider moods and wishes, degrees of liking or disliking, and their effect upon the destiny of people dear to her; she had been forced to deny herself any contemplation of that other part of life where thought constructs a destiny which is independent of human beings. As Denham spoke, she followed his words and considered their bearing with an easy vigor which spoke of a <b>capacity</b> long <b>hoarded</b> and unspent. The very trees and the green merging into the blue distance became symbols of the vast external world which recks so little of the happiness, of the marriages or deaths of individuals. In order to give her examples of what he was saying, Denham led the way, first to the Rock Garden, and then to the Orchid House.|$|R
