40|$|The {{influence}} of aspect ratio (i. e. width to height ratio) of test specimens on the flow and fracture behaviour of fiber reinforced composites is herein examined. The composite material was prepared by isostatic pressing of a Mar-M 200 nickel-base superallov matrix reinforced with 40 % tungsten wires. I. niaxial <b>compression</b> <b>forging</b> was performed {{at a constant}} true strain rate of 3 x 10 ^ S, with temperature as parameter. The aspect ratio (wo/ho) of test blanks was made to vary between 0. 3 and 3, loading being always normal to the direction of wire alignment. It is herein established that peak flow stress values of composite material increase significantly with rising aspect ratio while severity of damage is shown to decrease. Furthermore, {{it is found that}} the fracture pattern is also influenced by specimen geometry. This may he attributed to some favourable effect of a hydrostatic compressive stress component which seeks to retard void formation and growth. Relevant practical implications are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{influences}} of various processing routes including cold forging, suction casting, cold rolling, hot <b>compression</b> and hot <b>forging</b> on the microstructure, mechanical properties and superelasticity of Ti- 7. 5 Nb- 4 Mo- 2 Sn alloy were investigated. It {{has been found}} that, the alloy processed by cold rolling, hot forging, cold forging and suction casting contained a single feta phase, but the alloy after hot compression consisted of a duplex structure of alpha and beta phases. The alloy exhibited an average grain size of about 4 mu-m after suction casting processing, indicating excellent grain refining effect. A strong recrystallization texture { 111 } was well developed in the cold rolled and hot forged alloys; while cold forged and hot compressed alloys exhibited strong multiple textures in different directions associated with their deformation. Superelastic behavior was observed in the cold rolled, suction casted, hot forged and hot compressed alloys, in which the casted alloy exhibited the highest strain recovery rate which reached nearly 75 %, and the hot compressed alloy showed higher stress for inducing martensitic transformation but lower recovery rate due to the complex multiple textures formed during hot compressing processing among the alloys after different processing routes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In the {{industrial}} process, the moisture of the clay sheet obtained by extrusion and pressed {{to form a}} tile varies in time. It depends on the nature and the mixing of the raw materials during the production. In order to model and understand {{the influence of the}} moisture on the pressing step, it is necessary to determine the parameters of the rheological and tribological laws. A study of the rheological behaviour, based on free compression tests on cylinder samples, allowed to use an elasto-visco-plastic behaviour for the extruded clay paste. The different constitutive parameters were estimated by an inverse analysis based on the experimental force/displacement curves. The identification was performed with the optimisation algorithm implemented in the commercial software Forge ® 2009. The influence of the water content in the paste on the rheological parameters was identified and fitted using linear models. To understand the influence of the moisture, we simulated a <b>compression</b> test, using <b>Forge</b> ® involving the shaping of a tile lug. This geometry is representative of the state of stress during the pressing of the tile, in an area currently subjected to defects. The numerical model shows that an increase of eighteen percent of the moisture, allows to decrease by half the pressing force...|$|R
40|$|The rotary {{compressor}} (crimping machine) is a machine designed for making hollow forgings. The {{rotary compressor}} is a prototype device {{designed and built}} at the Technical University of Lublin. The compressor is dedicated to perform laboratory tests related to the hollow forgings of various shapes using different materials. Since the rotary compressor is an experimental device, there is no control and acquisition data system available. The article presents the concept and {{the capabilities of the}} computer control and data acquisition system supporting rotary compressing process. The main task of software system is acquisition of force and kinetic parameters related to the analysed process of the rotary <b>forging</b> <b>compression.</b> The software allows the user to declare the course of the forming forgings. This system allows current recording and analysis of four physical values: feed rate (speed of working head movement), hydraulic oil pressure at inlet and outlet of hydraulic cylinder and the torque of engine. Application functions can be divided into three groups: the configuration of the pressing process, the acquisition and analysis of data from the pressing process and the recording and presentation of stored results.

40|$|Heat treatable {{aluminium}} alloy aerospace products undergo a rapid quench from the {{solution heat treatment}} temperature into water/organic quenchant/spray quenching system during processing. As {{a result of this}} rapid quenching operation, residual stresses of yield strength magnitude can develop, leaving the material in an unsuitable condition for further machining operations and for service. Rectilinear, open-die forgings are generally cold compressed after quenching to relieve residual stresses. The effect of friction during cold <b>compression</b> between the <b>forging</b> and the steel compression platens, increasing/decreasing the amount of cold compression plastic deformation, natural ageing prior to cold compression, cold compression direction (LT v L v ST) and applying cold compression in 2 ̆ 7 bites 2 ̆ 7 on residual stress magnitudes is not generally available. Residual stress development during quenching is modelled using the finite element technique and the effect on the final residual stress magnitude of varying these process parameters is evaluated. The effect of stretching to relieve residual stresses and the effect on residual stress magnitudes of sectioning samples of the material is also analysed using the finite element technique. The models of each of the stress relieving techniques are compared both by observing stress magnitudes and by using the FE model to predict the results from a layer removal technique.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to review the {{research}} works carried out at the national research laboratory for computer-aided materials processing at the department of mechanical engineering at KAIST. Design/Methodology/approach: The research papers published so far from the laboratory were carefully reviewed and highlights for developing simulation tools for mesh generation, 2 D or 3 D finite element analyses for forging, shape rolling, solidification, semi-solid <b>forging,</b> <b>compression</b> molding of thermoset composites, injection molding without or with short fibers, and expert system for multi-stage axi-symmetric cold forging, extrusion, and multi-pass shape rolling are recaptured. Findings: According to this survey, the important issues involved with program developments and their industrial applications were revisited. Research limitations/implications: Understanding of material behaviour at various processing conditions and characterization of proper boundary conditions in terms of friction and temperature should be carefully made. Handling of complex geometry and computational efficiency for such geometry should be improved as well. Further development of three dimensional design systems should be necessary. Practical implications: Proper usage of the simulation tools and interface such tools with the automatic design system with the help of artificial intelligence will be very useful at the design stage of new manufacturing products and processes. In addition, proper understanding of deformation mechanics is of importance to properly utilize such numerical tools.
