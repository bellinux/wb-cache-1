5|$|While Wally goes to {{a funeral}} home to attend {{the wake of a}} former estate client, the client's son claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, a <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> <b>drug</b> {{developed}} by the (fictional) pharmaceutical company Varrick Labs. Ecstatic at the possible monetary returns on the case, the firm finds several former clients who appear to have valid claims about Krayoxx. Oscar and Wally generate publicity in the Chicago Tribune with a picture of their filing; this induces an avalanche of communications and leads them to several additional claimants. However, Wally and his fellows are far out of their depth. None of the three Finley & Figg lawyers has ever argued in a United States federal court, and they have only a vague idea of what is involved in confronting a major corporation which is able to hire the best legal talent around - which turns out to be Zinc's old firm.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2003, {{several months}} after its {{introduction}} in Europe, Richard Horton, {{the editor of the}} medical journal The Lancet, criticized the way Crestor had been introduced. [...] "AstraZeneca's tactics in marketing its <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> <b>drug,</b> rosuvastatin, raise disturbing questions about how drugs enter clinical practice and what measures exist to protect patients from inadequately investigated medicines," [...] according to his editorial. The Lancet's editorial position is that the data for Crestor’s superiority rely too much on extrapolation from the lipid profile data (surrogate end-points) and too little on hard clinical end-points, which are available for other statins that had been on the market longer. The manufacturer responded by stating that few drugs had been tested so successfully on so many patients. In correspondence published in The Lancet, AstraZeneca's CEO Sir Tom McKillop called the editorial [...] "flawed and incorrect" [...] and slammed the journal for making [...] "such an outrageous critique of a serious, well-studied medicine." ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Open-angle {{glaucoma}} (OAG) is {{a progressive}} neurodegenerative disease {{that may lead}} to blindness. An elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is its major risk factor. OAG treatment is currently exclusively directed towards the lowering of the IOP. IOP lowering does not prevent disease progression in all patients and thus other treatment modalities are needed. Earlier studies reported <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> <b>drugs</b> to have neuroprotective properties. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the associations between the use of <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> <b>drugs</b> and incident OAG. Methodology/Principal Findings: Participants in a prospective population-based cohort study underwent ophthalmic examinations, including IOP measurements and perimetry, at baseline and follow-up. The use of statins and non-statin <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> <b>drugs</b> was monitored continuously during the study. Associations between the use of <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> <b>drugs</b> and incident OAG were analyzed with Cox regression; associations between <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> <b>drugs</b> and IOP at follow-up were analyzed with multiple linear regression. During a mean follow-up of 9. 8 years, 108 of 3939 eligible participants (2. 7 %) developed OAG. The hazard ratio for statin use was 0. 54 (95 % confidence interval 0. 31 – 0. 96; P = 0. 034) and for non-statin <b>cholesterol-lowering</b> <b>drugs</b> 2. 07 (0. 81 – 5. 33; P = 0. 13). The effect of statins was more pronounced with prolonged use (hazard ratio 0. 89 [0. 41 – 1. 94; P = 0. 77] for use two years or less; 0. 46 [0. 23 – 0. 94; P = 0. 033] for use more tha...|$|R

Taking atorvastatin for 3.3 years, therefore, would lead to an ARR of only 1.02% (2.67% minus 1.65%).
