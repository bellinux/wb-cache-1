40|$|I[EN] n {{the last}} two decades, {{fluctuating}} asymmetry (FA) has been used commonly {{as an indicator of}} the stress experienced by individual organisms during development, although the technique has not been without controversy. In general, estimates of FA in populations have been positively correlated with measures of stress but, in the few studies in which it has been investigated, the correlations between estimates of FA and stress in individuals have been inconsistent. This study compared the FA in the opposite spines of stems and flowers to other bio-indicators of physiological stress in plants, such as annual <b>crown</b> growth <b>ratio,</b> annual flower production, annual <b>crown</b> death <b>ratio,</b> and branch fractal dimension. The position of an individual Echinospartum horridum within a patch influenced the stress conditions, and influenced its colonization strategy. Plants in the interior of patches are under high intraspecific competition due to negative density feedback (low flower production and branch biomass, and high annual <b>crown</b> death <b>ratio),</b> showed larger flower FA and spines FA repeatability (within-individual variation in FA) than plants at the periphery. Plant growth rates and the FA of spines were negatively correlated, but flower asymmetry and flower production was not significantly correlated, which reflects the capacity of E. horridum to adjust flower production to its developing conditions. We concluded that because organisms respond differently to different conditions, enhanced by the plasticity of plants in the development of morphological structures in response to changes in the environment, it is advisable to use multiple parameters to assess physiological stress in plants. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The following hypotheses were tested with these data: 1) stand density regime {{has a significant}} effect on stem form; and 2) crown size controls the response of stand density regime to stem form. The five stand density regimes corresponded to five different growing-stock levels (GSLs) defined by bole surface area. A variable exponent taper model was fit to the data from each individual tree and the resulting parameters were treated as indices of stem form for comparisons among density regimes. MANOVA performed on these parameters estimates confirmed statistically significant differences in stem form both between the two lowest levels-of-growing stock and between these two treatments and all three regimes with higher levels of growing stock.

40|$|Environmental Science and EngineeringDuring {{the past}} decade, the {{procedure}} for quantification of forest parameters using LiDAR data has been rapidly improved. Among various forest parameters, biomass is the paramount in understanding the potentials productivity of forests. Various methods {{have been developed to}} estimate biomass at both plot and individual tree levels. In order to quantify biomass at the individual tree level, tree crown delineation must be conducted, which is sometimes challenging especially for multi-layer dense forests in rugged mountainous areas. In this study, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were used to delineate tree crowns and estimate biomass in a mountainous forest. Firstly, a novel algorithm was proposed to identify individual tree crowns using the concept of live <b>crown</b> <b>ratios</b> based solely on LiDAR data. Then, above ground biomass (AGB) was estimated using machine learning approaches based on tree crowns delineated in the previous step. LiDAR-derived metrics related to forest parameters such as tree height and crown areas as well as topographic characteristics extracted based on the delineated tree crowns were used to estimate AGB.

40|$|Objectives: Reduced bone height, {{elevated}} masticatory {{force and}} increased <b>crown</b> height-implant length <b>ratio</b> are all associated with dental implants of short length {{placed in the}} posterior mandible or maxilla. Consequently, dental practitioners generally aim to increase the bone to implant surface area contact by choosing wider diameters for short implants. With implant designs being driven at times by market demands rather than basic scientific research, the influence of different designs on the stress characteristics in the surrounding bone becomes an important issue. This research uses the Finite Element Method to evaluate the stress characteristics within the posterior maxilla for four distinctly different short implant designs (Bicon, Neodent, Nobel Biocare and Straumann) subject to unfavourable <b>crown</b> height-implant length <b>ratio</b> and masticatory forces. Material and Methods: The four bone-implant systems are modelled using three-dimensional hexahedral and wedge shaped brick elements. Assumptions made in the analyses are: temperature sensitive elements are used to replicate the torque within the abutment screw; <b>crown</b> height-implant length <b>ratio</b> is 2 : 1; 50 % osseointegration between bone and implant; and, linear elastic material properties of bone. Results and Conclusion: Bicon's thread design causes larger stress variances from minimum to maximum when compared to all other systems. The combination of a decreased diameter and increased taperage of the Neodent design increases the stress level {{when compared to the}} Bicon implant. Nobel Biocare's rounded implant thread crest design and reduced thread pitch produces a preferred smoothed out stress profile. Straumann's increased thread pitch gives elevated stress in cancellous bone. Generally, stresses are concentrated in the crestal bone region next to the implant neck, attributable to the combination of <b>crown</b> height-implant length <b>ratio</b> and the inclined nature of the masticatory force.

The magnitude of the mixing effect was variable among the crown characteristics evaluated, but overall our findings provide evidence that for a given species combination and density, the effect of mixture increased in the two most productive sites.

Modified versions of Logistics, Richards, Weibull and Exponential functions were used to predict CR for tree species in the Oban Division of the Cross River National Park. Systematic sampling technique was adopted in the three study sites (Aking; Ekang and Old-Netim) for plot locations. Two transects of 2 km long with a distance of 600 m apart were cut in each of the study sites. Four sample plots of 50 m× 50 m were then laid alternately along each transect at 500 m intervals. This procedure was repeated in the close-canopy and secondary forests in the three study sites. Forty-eight sample plots were used for the study. Tree variables (Dbh; diameter at the middle and merchantable top; crown diameter; total height; merchantable height; stem quality and crown length were measured on all the trees with Dbh> 10 cm.

This study analyzed the 10 -year postthinning response of stands and individual trees in thinned white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) plantations in northern Minnesota, USA, with light to moderate defoliation from eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens). Using the Forest Vegetation Simulator, model results suggested overprediction of stand basal area growth and tree diameter increment in these stands. Growth modifiers indicated that trees growing in unthinned stands and with greater defoliation levels (i. e., 20 ‐ 32 %) would need the largest adjustment for diameter increment. Modifiers for height were similarly specified to compensate for the underprediction of height increment in these stands.

Eighty-five periodontally healthy subjects were evaluated. A negative correlation was found between incisor <b>crown</b> width/crown length <b>ratio</b> and bleeding score (p = 0. 045). From the 85 subjects, two groups of subjects with either 'long-narrow' or 'short-wide' incisor form were identified. The 'long-narrow' group had a significantly higher bleeding score than the 'short-wide' group (p = 0. 014). No {{significant differences were found}} in the incisor <b>crown</b> width/crown length <b>ratio</b> between previously identified 'high responder' and 'low responder' subjects (Trombelli et al., 2004 a). In conclusion, incisor crown form appears to affect the bleeding response of inflamed gingival tissues, while it exerts no influence on explaining differences in individuals' susceptibility to plaque-induced gingivitis...|$|R
