40|$|The {{functional}} state of mitochondria {{is vital to}} cellular and organismal aging in eukaryotes across phyla. Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided evidence that age-related changes in some aspects of mitochondrial functionality can create certain molecular signals. These signals can then define the rate of cellular aging by altering unidirectional and bidirectional communications between mitochondria and other organelles. Several aspects of mitochondrial functionality are known to impact the replicative and/or chronological modes of yeast aging. They include mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, and protein synthesis and proteostasis, as well as mitochondrial synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, amino acids, and NADPH. Our recent findings have revealed that the composition of mitochondrial membrane lipids {{is one of the}} key aspects of mitochondrial functionality affecting yeast <b>chronological</b> <b>aging.</b> We demonstrated that exogenously added lithocholic bile acid can delay <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> in yeast because it elicits specific changes in mitochondrial membrane lipids. These changes allow mitochondria to operate as signaling platforms that delay yeast <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> by orchestrating an institution and maintenance of a distinct cellular pattern.

40|$|Studies {{employing}} the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{as a model}} organism have provided deep insights into molecular mechanisms of cellular and organismal aging in multicellular eukaryotes and have demonstrated that the main features of biological aging are evolutionarily conserved. Aging in S. cerevisiae is studied by measuring replicative or chronological lifespan. Yeast replicative aging is likely to model aging of mitotically competent human cell types, while yeast <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> is believed to mimic aging of post-mitotic human cell types. Emergent evidence implies that various organelle-organelle and organelle-cytosol communications play essential roles in <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> of S. cerevisiae. The molecular mechanisms underlying the vital roles of intercompartmental communications in yeast <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> have begun to emerge. The scope of this review is to critically analyze recent progress in understanding such mechanisms. Our analysis suggests a model for how temporally and spatially coordinated movements of certain metabolites between various cellular compartments impact yeast <b>chronological</b> <b>aging.</b> In our model, diverse changes in these key metabolites are restricted to critical longevity-defining periods of chronological lifespan. In each of these periods, a limited set of proteins responds to such changes of the metabolites by altering the rate and efficiency of a certain cellular process essential for longevity regulation.

40|$|Background: Skin is {{a window}} to aging changes, a {{biological}} reality. There is a dearth of studies regarding the various <b>chronological</b> (intrinsic) <b>aging</b> and photoaging (extrinsic) changes seen in Asians. This study was undertaken to detect the clinical pattern of aging skin changes and dermatoses seen in the elderly. Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive study conducted on 500 consecutive elderly individuals attending the Dermatology out-patient department. The severity of photoaging was graded using Glogau scale. Results: Most of the population had skin type IV and V. Majority (415, 83 %) of our cases had <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> without photoaging and the remaining 85 (17 %) individuals had photoaging along with <b>chronological</b> <b>aging.</b> The common skin changes due to <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> were thin skin, fine wrinkles, xerosis, and loss of elasticity. Photoaging changes such as dyspigmentation, freckles, thick skin, deep wrinkles, melasma, citrine skin, senile purpura, pseudostellate scar, acrokeratoelastoidosis marginalis, and lentigines were less frequent in our study. Smoking and prolonged sun exposure was the risk factors aggravating photoaging. The most common dermatosis was pruritus in 248 (49. 6 %) individuals, of which 149 (29. 8 %) had pruritus associated with xerosis. Contact dermatitis was more common in males. Fungal infections were frequently seen in females. Seborrhoeic keratosis (253, 50. 6 %) {{was the most common}} benign neoplasm more commonly seen in males.

40|$|<b>Chronological</b> <b>aging</b> {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} in laboratory yeast by culturing cells into stationary phase in synthetic complete medium with 2 % glucose as the carbon source.

40|$|Ageing {{involves}} a time-dependent decline {{in a variety}} of intracellular mechanisms and is associated with cellular senescence. This can be exacerbated by prion diseases which can occur in a sporadic manner, predominantly during the later stages of life.

We show here that the frequency of formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion, which is the altered form of the Sup 35 translation termination factor, is increased during <b>chronological</b> <b>ageing.</b> This increase is exacerbated in an atg 1 mutant suggesting that autophagy normally acts to suppress age-related prion formation. We further show that cells which have switched to [PSI+] have improved viability during <b>chronological</b> <b>ageing</b> which requires active autophagy. [PSI+] stains show increased autophagic flux which correlates with increased viability and decreased levels of cellular protein aggregation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cellular {{mechanisms}} {{leading to}} aging and therefore increasing susceptibility to age-related diseases are a central topic of research since aging is the ultimate, yet not understood {{mechanism of the}} fate of a cell. Studies with model organisms have been conducted to ellucidate these mechanisms, and <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> of yeast has been extensively used as a model for oxidative stress and aging of postmitotic tissues in higher eukaryotes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> network of yeast was reconstructed by integrating protein-protein interaction data with gene ontology terms. The reconstructed network was then statistically "tuned" based on the betweenness centrality values of the nodes to compensate for the computer automated method. Both the originally reconstructed and tuned networks were subjected to topological and modular analyses. Finally, an ultimate "heart" network was obtained via pooling the step specific key proteins, which resulted from the decomposition of the linear paths depicting several signaling routes in the tuned network. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The reconstructed networks are of scale-free and hierarchical nature, following a power law model with γ  =  1. 49. The results of modular and topological analyses verified that the tuning method was successful. The significantly enriched gene ontology terms of the modular analysis confirmed also that the multifactorial nature of <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> was captured by the tuned network. The interplay between various signaling pathways such as TOR, Akt/PKB and cAMP/Protein kinase A was summarized in the "heart" network originated from linear path analysis. The deletion of four genes, TCB 3, SNA 3, PST 2 and YGR 130 C, was found to increase the chronological life span of yeast. The reconstructed networks can also give insight about the effect of other cellular machineries on <b>chronological</b> <b>aging</b> by targeting different signaling pathways in the linear path analysis, along with unraveling of novel proteins playing part in these pathways...|$|R
