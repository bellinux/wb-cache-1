40|$|Some {{entrepreneurial}} ventures {{grow into}} large organizations within {{a relatively short}} duration. These startups rapidly increase their scale and scope to turn into matured organizations. Though the literature is replete with such examples, there is no explanation for such a phenomenon. Also, nothing {{has been said about}} the role of the environment in metamorphosis of such ventures. We look at two global organizations and explain their metamorphosis. We arrive at four dynamic stages through which an entrepreneurial venture grows: prime pillar formation stage, scale <b>catapult</b> <b>stage,</b> scope enlargement stage, and maturity stage. We also explain the different roles played by the firm and the environment during each stage, the interactions between each of these roles, and the dominant strategic process underlying in each stage. ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike many {{previous}} years, Jackson was {{the only}} performer in the entire Super Bowl XXVII halftime show. The show started with Jackson dancing on certain jumbotrons, followed by impersonators that posed {{on top of the}} screen, which gave the illusion of Jackson moving {{from one side of the}} stadium to the other. Then Jackson himself <b>catapulted</b> on <b>stage</b> and simply stood frozen in front of the audience.|$|R
5|$|In-game {{features}} include large battlefields, {{a large number}} of enemies and officers to defeat, and multiple outcomes for each stage. Certain levels make use of the siege engine (A new feature to the series) and introduce specialized siege equipment such as bridge layers, battering rams and <b>catapults</b> to the <b>stage.</b> Although it is not essential for the completion of stages, having a siege weapon will increase morale for the player's forces, and help the player succeed.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} violent {{movements}} {{in the name of}} Islam have been <b>catapulted</b> to center <b>stage</b> in U. S. foreign policy concerns. However, before concrete strategies can be formulated to deal with this phenomenon, the nature and dynamics of Islamist mobilization itself must be understood·' What motivates an individual to join an lslamist group and possibly engage in violence? Under what conditions will these groups moderate their stances, and when will they radicalize? While our policy choices dealing with the Muslim world and international terrorism inevitably hinge on our answers to these questions, a serious application of theory has been lacking...|$|R
500|$|In January 1993, Jackson {{performed}} at the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show in Pasadena, California. Because of a dwindling interest during halftime in the preceding years — a special live episode of In Living Color eroded the previous halftime show's audience by 10 ratings points — the NFL decided to seek big-name talent that would keep ratings high, with Jackson selected for his universal appeal. It was the first Super Bowl whose half-time performance drew greater audience figures than the game itself. The performance began with Jackson <b>catapulting</b> onto the <b>stage</b> as fireworks went off behind him, followed by four songs: [...] "Jam", [...] "Billie Jean", [...] "Black or White", and [...] "Heal the World". Jackson's Dangerous album rose 90 places in the album chart after the performance.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Musou Mode,' {{the main}} {{campaign}} mode, has separate campaigns for each kingdom {{rather than a}} separate 'Musou Mode' for each character, as was featured in Dynasty Warriors 3, which made it more frustrating for the player to unlock their favorite characters. So, Dynasty Warriors 4 Mosou Modes are easier for the player to unlock their favorite characters. While the storyline is still linear, 'Musou Mode' is rather open-ended {{in the sense that}} depending on the user’s actions, different events will occur, such as unlocking new characters for use or new kingdoms. The unlockable kingdoms in the game include the Wu, Shu, and Wei Kingdoms, and unlockable characters include warlords who were defeated in the book that the game series is based on, Romance of the Three Kingdoms.In-game features include large battlefields, a large number of enemies and officers to defeat, and multiple outcomes for each stage. Certain levels make use of the siege engine (A new feature to the series) and introduce specialized siege equipment such as bridge layers, battering rams and <b>catapults</b> to the <b>stage.</b> Although it is not essential for the completion of stages, having a siege weapon will increase morale for the player's forces, and help the player succeed.|$|R
