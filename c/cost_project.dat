50|$|Project cost {{management}} is traditionally a weak area of IT projects. IT project managers must acknowledge {{the importance of}} {{cost management}} and take responsibility for understanding basic cost concepts, cost estimating, budgeting, and cost control.Project managers must understand several basic principles of cost management {{to be effective in}} managing project cost. Important concepts include profits and profit margins, life cycle costing, cash flow analysis, sunk cost, and learning curve theory.Planning cost management involves determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost. The main output of this process is a cost management plan.Estimating costs is {{a very important part of}} project cost management. There are several types of cost estimates, including rough order of magnitude (ROM), budgetary, and definitive. Each type of estimate is done during different stages of the project life cycle, and each has a different level of accuracy. Several tool and techniques can help you develop cost estimates, including analogous estimating, bottom-up estimating, parametric estimating, and computerized tools.Determining the budget involves allocating costs to individual work items over time. It is important to understand how particular organizations prepare budgets so estimates are made accordingly.Controlling cost includes monitoring cost performance, reviewing changes, and notifying project stakeholders of changes related to cost. Many basic accounting and finance principles relate to <b>cost</b> <b>project</b> management. Earned value management is an important method used for measuring project performance. Earned value management integrates scope, cost, and schedule information. Project portfolio management allows organization to collect and control an entire suite of projects or investments as one set of interrelated activities.Several software products can assists with project cost management. Enterprise project management software and portfolio management software can help managers evaluate data on multiple projects.|$|E

Mark Galanty recruited canal resident architects to create a design board with the Loffel Block material, and Galanty publicly presented the Loffel design Plan at a public meeting with Councilwoman Galanter in attendance. Galanter stated she would be open to the Venice Canals Association design material. Mark Galanty got the Loffel Block distributor in Orange County to install a test site across from the Armorflex test site at the distributors cost. The test was successful with plants growing in the blocks, wildlife and ducks able to climb up the material, and the majority of the property owners supporting this design. Galanter agreed to have city engineers design an official city plan using the Loffel Block. Luis Ganajas revised the plans to include the material Loffel Block at 55 degree slop. VCA members Robert Trask and Mark Galanty took the city design, an actual Loffel Block, and the community support poll showing overwhelming support to different Venice groups, city government agencies, state agencies, environmental groups, historical groups, and each property owner on the canals getting support for what was termed [...] "The Compromise Plan". Eventually, letters of support for the Loffel plan were presented to the city from the Sierra Club, Heal the Bay, the local state senator and state assemblyman, both U.S. senators, and the local county supervisor. Based on the support of the Loffel Block design over the Armorflex design, Councilwoman Galanter had Public Works drop the Armorflex plan and focusd on the Loffel Block plan.|$|E

Improving the crop output of peasant smallholdings has been made a priority in Gabon, in conjunction with promoting small and medium-size enterprises, and with diversifying mining. The pilot project united all three aims by evaluating and demonstrating the working of deposits of lime and phosphate locally. Three sites were chosen near agricultural areas, and a private contract was drawn up with a firm of Irish contractors. Pitting and drilling techniques {{were used for the}} geological study and evaluation of the deposits, and rock samples were analyzed for their phosphorous and carbonate content both in Gabon and Ireland.
