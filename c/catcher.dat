5|$|Case: <b>Catcher</b> Technologies.|$|E
5|$|Posey was {{selected}} by Fan Voting to start at <b>catcher</b> in the 2016 MLB All Star Game, Posey's fourth career MLB All-Star Game, the most all-time by a Giants <b>catcher</b> in franchise history. He was the <b>catcher</b> for battery mate Johnny Cueto, the second battery mate he started and caught for in the Midsummer Classic after teammate Matt Cain in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Sandoval {{made the}} Giants' Opening Day roster out of spring {{training}} in 2009 as the Giants' starting third baseman and backup <b>catcher.</b> He served as a personal <b>catcher</b> for Zito {{at the beginning of}} the year. On May 12, Sandoval hit his first walk-off home run against Joe Beimel to beat the Washington Nationals 97. Following an elbow injury to Sandoval in May, the Giants called up Eli Whiteside to serve as the backup <b>catcher</b> on May 24; since then, Sandoval has not been used at all as a <b>catcher.</b> After 73 games played, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler wrote that Sandoval had made the most impressive transition from the Giants farm system since 1986 when Will Clark and Robby Thompson were rookies.|$|E
25|$|Under {{high school}} (NFHS) rules only, <b>catcher's</b> {{interference}} is instead called <b>catcher's</b> obstruction.|$|R
2500|$|The rising {{velocity}} of pitches {{in conjunction with}} <b>catchers</b> moving closer to home plate significantly increased the risk of injuries for <b>catchers,</b> especially face and hand injuries. By the late 1870s, <b>catchers</b> began to use padded, fingerless gloves to protect their hands, and in [...] the first protective <b>catcher's</b> mask was used. The first <b>catchers</b> to use protective masks sometimes had their courage called into question, but {{the effectiveness of the}} masks in preventing injuries meant that they became widely accepted. In the 1880s, the first padded chest protectors came into use, and in [...] specialized <b>catcher's</b> mitts used on the non-throwing hand began to be used.|$|R
50|$|Scioscia's {{technique}} for blocking {{the plate and}} making a tag varied slightly from the traditional manner employed by most <b>catchers.</b> When applying the tag, most <b>catchers</b> hold the baseball in their bare hand, with that hand then being inside their <b>catcher's</b> mitt to apply the tag with both hands. Scioscia preferred to hold the ball in his <b>catcher's</b> mitt without making use of his bare hand. Also, Scioscia felt he was less prone to injury in a collision if positioned his body {{so that he was}} kneeling on both knees and turned to the side, whereas most <b>catchers</b> make their tag either standing or on one knee. Scioscia used the same <b>catcher's</b> mitt for most of his playing career.|$|R
5|$|After the 1997 season, the Tigers traded Nevin and <b>catcher</b> Matt Walbeck to the Anaheim Angels, where Collins was manager, {{for minor}} league player Nick Skuse. After {{an injury to}} {{starting}} <b>catcher</b> Todd Greene, Collins gave Nevin the opportunity {{to compete for the}} starting job with Walbeck. Nevin, by then well known for his volatile temper, tore off his jersey while arguing balls and strike calls with the home plate umpire in a 1998 game.|$|E
5|$|By 1883, Gilligan {{had become}} the Grays {{starting}} <b>catcher.</b> Despite breaking his finger and missing two weeks in May, Gilligan led the National League in assists as a <b>catcher,</b> while his team {{finished third in the}} NL. He continued his tenure with the Grays the following season. Gilligan played in a career-high 82 games, while also recording career highs in RBI (38), strikeouts (41), and on-base percentage (.325) and leading MLB in defensive games as a <b>catcher</b> (81). After finishing {{at the top of the}} NL, the Grays played in the 1884 World Series against the New York Metropolitans of the American Association. Gilligan went 4–for–9 over the three-game series, with the Grays defeating the Metropolitans three games to none.|$|E
5|$|<b>Catcher</b> Carlos Ruiz – Re-signed {{with the}} Phillies on November 18, 2013.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan Woodward of CTV's W5 {{documented}} {{his investigation}} of Creep <b>Catchers,</b> across Canada, {{looking into the}} unseen side of the organization. The 3-part episode aired February 18, 2017 and featured Justin Payne, Creep <b>Catchers</b> founder Dawson Raymond, Surrey Creep <b>Catchers</b> President Ryan LaForge and Red Deer Creep <b>Catchers</b> President Karl Young (aka Carl Murphy). The episode explored the criminal records of some Creep <b>Catchers</b> members, looked at the possible unreported revenue generation and interviewed an Edmonton Police Service member of the Integrated Child Exploitation ICE team, regarding the Lloydminster chapters' interference with one of their investigations.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Kabadi'(played {{between two}} teams, each team having 7 players, one team {{operates}} as raiders {{and the other}} <b>catchers,</b> if the raider is caught he is out but if he manages to over power the <b>catchers</b> and comes to the central line, all the <b>catchers</b> touching him are out.|$|R
50|$|It is umpire's {{interference}} {{when the}} umpire hinders a <b>catcher's</b> attempt to throw anywhere. In this case, if the <b>catcher's</b> direct throw retires a runner the play stands. If not, {{the ball is}} dead and all runners must return to the bases they had most recently touched (before the <b>catcher's</b> throw).|$|R
5|$|<b>Catcher</b> Steven Lerud – Signed a minor-league {{contract}} with the Atlanta Braves on January 13, 2014.|$|E
5|$|During the 201415 offseason, the Braves traded Heyward {{with the}} {{intention}} of shifting Gattis to left field, with Bethancourt at <b>catcher.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{threw the}} no-hitter despite {{being unable to}} feel the ball or see the batter or <b>catcher</b> clearly. Ellis said his <b>catcher</b> Jerry May wore {{reflective}} tape on his fingers which helped him to see May's signals. Ellis walked eight batters and struck out six, and he was aided by excellent fielding plays from second baseman Bill Mazeroski and center fielder Matty Alou.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>catchers</b> {{respond with}} a {{specific}} stipulation; [...] "Only if you're wearing blue/have blonde hair/have an S in your name!" [...] etc. This means the runners run across in smaller groups, instead of one large group, and the <b>catchers</b> only typically need to tag the runners {{to turn them into}} <b>catchers,</b> rather than tackle them to the ground.|$|R
50|$|Dickey {{was named}} in 1999 to The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players, ranking number 57, {{trailing}} Johnny Bench (16), Josh Gibson (18), Yogi Berra (40), and Roy Campanella (50) among <b>catchers.</b> Like those <b>catchers,</b> Dickey was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, but the fan balloting chose Berra and Bench {{as the two}} <b>catchers</b> on the team.|$|R
5000|$|A two-time All-Star, Tettleton was {{considered}} one of the best-hitting <b>catchers</b> of his era, winning three Silver Slugger Awards. At the time of his retirement, he ranked eighth in major league history in career home runs by a switch-hitter. Tettleton's [...]369 on-base percentage ranks him 10th highest all-time among major league <b>catchers.</b> His [...]821 on-base plus slugging percentage is 11th highest all-time among major league <b>catchers.</b>|$|R
5|$|End {{of season}} awards for Posey {{included}} selection as <b>catcher</b> on Baseball Americas All-MLB Team.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} the 2009 season ranked first {{in major league}} history with 13,910 putouts as a <b>catcher,</b> ahead of Brad Ausmus (12,671).|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the San Francisco Giants as a bullpen <b>catcher.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Catcher's</b> mitt : Leather mitt worn by <b>catchers.</b> It is {{much wider}} than a normal fielder's glove {{and the four}} fingers are connected. The mitt is also better-padded than the {{standard}} fielder's glove.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{the first}} public body to admit using IMSI <b>catchers</b> was the Scottish Prison Service, though {{it is likely that}} the Metropolitan Police Service has been using IMSI <b>catchers</b> since 2011 or before.|$|R
5000|$|In a sixteen-year {{major league}} career, Sullivan played in 1,147 games, accumulating 777 hits in 3,647 at bats for a [...]213 career batting average along with 21 home runs, 378 {{runs batted in}} and an on-base {{percentage}} of [...]254. He led American League <b>catchers</b> three times in fielding percentage and ended his career with a [...]976 average, which was 12 points above the league average during his playing career. Sullivan also led American League <b>catchers</b> twice in baserunners caught stealing and caught stealing percentage, and once in assists. His 952 baserunners caught stealing ranks him 11th on the all-time list for major league <b>catchers.</b> Sullivan also ranks 11th overall among major league <b>catchers</b> in shutouts caught during his career. He was also durable, leading league <b>catchers</b> in games played three times, while consistently within the top three most of his career.|$|R
5|$|Matt Walbeck {{is listed}} by Baseball-Reference as a <b>catcher,</b> but never {{appeared}} in a game {{in the field for}} the Phillies.|$|E
5|$|Posey {{was born}} in Leesburg, Georgia. He played four sports in high school; when playing baseball, he excelled at hitting and pitching. He {{attended}} Florida State University, where he began playing the <b>catcher</b> position. He won the Golden Spikes Award in 2008 and was selected by the Giants with the fifth overall pick in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft. Posey made his major league debut on September 11, 2009. After starting the 2010 season in the minor leagues, he was called {{back up to the}} major leagues in May. With the presence of then full-time <b>catcher</b> Bengie Molina, Posey played first base when originally called up to the majors, but became the Giants' regular <b>catcher</b> at the end of June when Molina was traded to the Texas Rangers, the team the Giants later faced in the World Series.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Johnny Bench, Hartnett was {{considered}} the greatest <b>catcher</b> {{in the history of}} the National League. A six-time All-Star, he appeared in four World Series during his playing career. At the time of his retirement, Hartnett held the career records for catchers in home runs, runs batted in, hits, doubles and in most games played as a <b>catcher.</b> Hartnett was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} the control strategy for a hybrid natural ventilation wind <b>catchers</b> and air-conditioning {{system and to}} assess the contribution of wind <b>catchers</b> to indoor air environments and energy savings if any. Design/methodology/approach – Most of the modeling techniques for assessing wind <b>catchers</b> performance are theoretical. Post-occupancy evaluation studies of buildings will provide an insight into the operation of these building components and help to inform facilities managers. A case study for POE was presented in this paper. Findings – The monitoring of the summer and winter month operations showed that the indoor air quality parameters were kept within the design target range. The design control strategy failed to record data regarding the operation, opening time and position of wind <b>catchers</b> system. Though the implemented control strategy was working effectively in monitoring the operation of mechanical ventilation systems, i. e. AHU, did not integrate the wind <b>catchers</b> with the mechanical ventilation system. Research limitations/implications – Owing to short-falls in the control strategy implemented in this project, it was found difficult to quantify and verify {{the contribution of the}} wind <b>catchers</b> to the internal conditions and, hence, energy savings. Practical implications – Controlling the operation of the wind <b>catchers</b> via the AHU will lead to isolation of the wind <b>catchers</b> in the event of malfunctioning of the AHU. Wind <b>catchers</b> will contribute to the ventilation of space, particularly in the summer months. Originality/value – This paper demonstrates the value of POE as indispensable tool for FM professionals. It further provides insight into the application of natural ventilation systems in building for healthier indoor environments at lower energy cost. The design of the control strategy for natural ventilation and air-conditioning should be considered at the design stage involving the FM personnel...|$|R
50|$|Crock uses sporting-themed weapons such as {{exploding}} baseballs, flying bases, rocket baseball bats, knockout basketballs, lacrosse snare nets, exploding hockey pucks. Their outfits generally {{included a}} baseball cap, <b>catcher's</b> mask, padded jersey, <b>catcher's</b> chestguard, football-style pants, and cleats.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time for the West coast of the Caspian Sea, the number and {{location}} of the <b>catchers</b> concentrations have been studied, the <b>catchers</b> fauna in the region has been specified, the comparative investigation of the spatial distribution and food behavior of the <b>catchers</b> under the stable and unstable conditions of the coast has been performed, the diagrams of places of the <b>catchers</b> accumulations in the Caspian Sea have been compiled, the many-year dynamics of the <b>catchers</b> number dynamics in the Kysyl-Agach reserve has been traced. It has been established, that the surf and ebb and flow phenomena exclude the mass arrests of <b>catchers</b> on the sand coast, the leading role of the substrate in the determination of the spatial structure of the accumulations has been shown, the evidences of the limited intra- and interspecies trophic competition have been revealed in the places of the <b>catchers</b> accumulations. The materials can be used in the monitoring of the birds population {{under the influence of the}} hydrological cycles of the Caspian Sea, for planning of protection of the rare species, the results are used in teaching the number of disciplines in the Higher Schools, have been reflected in the Exhibition of the Darvin's MuseumAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
5|$|Ramírez had {{difficulty}} with his vision; {{he could not}} see which pitch the <b>catcher</b> was calling for. He was fitted for prescription goggles, which he continued to wear throughout his career. Angels' MLB players of the time did not remember working with Ramírez; <b>catcher</b> José Molina suggested that Ramírez must not have been in the Angels' long-term plans, as they had a number of right-handed power pitching relief pitchers in the organization.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{to college}} the next year, Chance led {{his team to}} a third-place finish in an amateur tournament of 50 teams. Bill Lange of the Chicago Cubs {{discovered}} Chance and convinced the Cubs to sign him as a backup <b>catcher</b> and outfielder, receiving $1,200 a year ($ in current dollar terms). Chance was scouted by other teams, but chose the Cubs as Tim Donohue was the only <b>catcher</b> ahead of him on the Cubs' depth chart.|$|E
5|$|Since 1957, {{there have}} been five Gold Glove batteries. The pitcher and <b>catcher,</b> collectively known as the battery, {{are the only two}} players on the field {{involved}} in every pitch. In particular, the pitcher and <b>catcher</b> control the running game with tools such as pickoffs or the strength of the catcher's throwing arm. The first pitcher and <b>catcher</b> on the same team to win Gold Gloves in the same year were Jim Kaat and Earl Battey, with the Minnesota Twins in 1962. Only two pairs of batterymates have won Gold Gloves together more than once: Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers won with the Texas Rangers in 2000, and again with the Detroit Tigers in 2004 and 2006. Yadier Molina and Adam Wainwright matched the feat, winning in both 2009 and 2013.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a ten-year}} major league career, Hoiles played in 894 games, accumulating 739 hits in 2,820 at-bats for a [...]262 career batting average along with 151 home runs, 449 {{runs batted in}} and an on-base {{percentage}} of [...]366. He led American League <b>catchers</b> four times in fielding percentage and ended his career with a [...]994 average, which was [...]004 above the league average during his playing career. His [...]994 career fielding percentage ranks ninth all-time among Major League <b>catchers.</b> Hoiles' career [...]837 on-base plus slugging percentage is seventh-highest all time among major league <b>catchers.</b> His [...]467 slugging percentage is 11th highest all-time among major league <b>catchers.</b> His 151 career home runs rank 12th highest in Orioles team history.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, {{baseball}} <b>catchers</b> {{have begun}} wearing facemasks similar in style to goaltender masks. Charlie O'Brien {{was the first}} to use a hockey style <b>catcher's</b> mask in a Major League Baseball game in 1996 while playing for the Toronto Blue Jays.|$|R
50|$|In his {{minor league}} career, he led California League <b>catchers</b> with 18 double plays and 38 passed balls while {{playing for the}} Stockton Ports in 1962, and led Eastern League <b>catchers</b> with 17 double plays while playing for the Elmira Pioneers in 1963.|$|R
