5000|$|Einstein's Brain:In early 1984, Diamond {{received}} {{four blocks}} of the preserved brain of Albert Einstein from Thomas Stoltz Harvey. Harvey, pathologist of Princeton Hospital {{at the time of}} Einstein's death, had removed Einstein's brain during autopsy in 1955 and maintained personal possession of the brain. The fact that the Einstein brain tissue was already embedded in <b>celloidin</b> when the Diamond lab received it meant that their choice of methods of examination would be somewhat limited. However, they were able to successfully analyze both the superior prefrontal (area 9) and inferior parietal (area 39) association cortices of the left and right hemispheres of Einstein's brain and compare results with the identical regions in the control base of 11 human, male, preserved brains. From previous analysis of the eleven control brains, the Diamond lab [...] "learned the frontal cortex did have more glial cells/neuron than the parietal cortex." [...] After many years of research, Diamond and her team had data proving that, in the rat brain, glial cells increased with enriched conditions, but did not increase with age. Diamond and her associates discovered that the big difference in all four areas was in nonneuronal cells. Einstein had more glial cells per neuron than the average male brains of the control group. Importantly, the biggest difference was found in area 39 of the left hemisphere of Einstein's brain where {{the increase in the number}} of glial cells per neuron was statistically significantly greater than in the control brains. Astrocyte and oligodendrocyte glial cells were pooled for these results.|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{physiological}} {{conditions as}} well as behavioral conditions {{have been shown to}} influence central nervous system vascular structure. Many of the methods used to investigate these structural alterations take advantage of the visibility of viscous substances (e. g. India ink in gelatin) perfused into the vasculature. The high viscosity of the solution, however, can cause incomplete vessel perfusion. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test whether or not capillaries seen in tissue perfused with fixative, embedded in <b>celloidin</b> and stained with Methylene Blue–Azure II (n= 6) could be a useful alternative for the investigation of brain vascular structure. The method was compared to tissue from six rats perfused with India ink in gelatin and stained with cresyl violet. Qualitatively, vessels in the standard perfused tissue embedded in <b>celloidin</b> yielded clear vessels with stained pericytes. The two methods did not differ in branch point to cell ratio, length of individual capillaries, vessel length per mm 3, and capillary tortuosity. The capillary diameter was greater in the <b>celloidin</b> embedded tissue than in the India ink perfused tissue. Measuring the diameter between vessel walls appears to provide a more accurate measure than the widest distance between India ink pigments. Quantitative comparisons suggest that perfusion with standard fixative followed by embedding in <b>celloidin</b> provides vascular quantification comparable to that from India ink perfused tissue. The present method has several advantages, which include visualization of pericytes, increased probability of complete perfusion, clear view of cells that might otherwise b...|$|E

40|$|Ataxia-telangiectasia is a {{familial}} cerebellar degenera-tion {{of childhood}} associated with telangiectases and frequent infections {{of the lungs}} and air sinuses. It was first described by Louis-Bar in 1941, but it has only become more widely known since Boder and Sedg-wick {{drew attention to the}} condition with its peculiar and stereotyped symptoms in several papers (Boder and Sedgwick, 1958, 1963, and 1964). The clinical features of some 100 cases have now been recorded but only about a dozen necropsies have been reported. This paper presents the findings in three more necropsies, including some pathological features which have not been described before. MATERIAL AND METHODS The brain, spinal cord, spinal ganglia, samples from peri-pheral nerves and muscles, and from other organs were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde in 10 % saline. Numerous blocks were taken and embedded in paraffin wax. In addition representative portions of the central nervous system from cases 2 and 3 were embedded in <b>celloidin.</b> Frozen sections from nervous tissue were stained for lipids with oil-red-O or Sudan black. Frozen sections of muscle were stained for nerve fibres by the Schofield method (1960). Paraffin and <b>celloidin</b> sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, haematoxylin and van Gieson's mixture, cresyl violet, luxol-fast-blue (with cresyl violet) or Heidenhein's method for myelin, Holzer's method and Mallory's phosphotungstic acid method for glial fibres; nerve fibres were stained by the Palmgren method (1948) in paraffin sections and by the Gros-Bielschowsky method in <b>celloidin</b> sections.

The aim of {{this study}} was to present a comprehen-sive {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) morphology of the petrous bone with computer image-processing technology, which could be beneficial for the teaching of anatomy and for surgical proce-dures. The unstained <b>celloidin</b> sections of human temporal bone were digitized with high resolution and quality, and then processed with Amira ® software to include alignment, segmentation and reconstruction. The integral structure of the human inner ear was presented with computer modeling, including the petrous bone, bone labyrinth, internal carotid artery canal, internal jugular vein canal, sigmoid sinus, infe-rior petrosal sinus, glossopharyngeal meatus, vagal meatus, internal acoustic meatus, facial nerve canal, greater superficial petrosal nerve, vestibular aqueduct, extraosseous portion of the endolymphatic sac, round and oval window, processus cochleariformis and pyramidal eminence. The 3 D model showed detailed structure of the external and internal petrous bone, as well as their spatial relationship.

40|$|ABSTRACT Optical disector {{counting}} {{is currently}} applied most often to cryosections, followed in frequency by resin-embedded tissues, paraffin, and vibratome sections. The preservation quality of these embedding options differs considerably; yet, {{the effect of}} tissue morphology on numerical estimates is unknown. We tested whether different embedding media significantly influence nu-merical estimates in optical disector counting, using the previously calibrated trochlear motor nu-cleus of hatchling chickens. Animals were perfusion-fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) only or in addition with glutaraldehyde (GA), or by Methacarn immersion fixation. Brains were prepared for paraffin, cryo-, vibratome- or <b>celloidin</b> sectioning. Complete penetration of the thionin stain was verified by z-axis analysis. Neuronal nuclei were counted using an unbiased counting rule, num-bers were averaged for each group and compared by ANOVA. In paraffin sections, 906 6 12 (SEM) neurons were counted, similar to previous calibrated data series, and results obtained from fixation with Methacarn or PFAwere statistically indistinguishable. In <b>celloidin</b> sections, 9126 28 neurons were counted—not statistically different from paraffin. In cryosections, 812 6 12 neurons were counted (underestimate of 10. 4 %) when fixed with PFA only, but 867 6 17 neurons were counted when fixed with PFA and GA.

40|$|In calculating {{by means}} of model the {{pressure}} to be exerted on the mucous membrane {{at the time of}} inserting alginic impression material into epipharynx the pressure was found to be slight; amounting to only about 1. 5 to 2. 0 mg Hg (2. 03 - 2. 71 g/cm(2)). Next, the author compared the morphological difference of the epipharynx, in vivo, 24 hours after death, after fixing in 10 % formalin, and after embedding in <b>celloidin</b> the decalcified specimens, by inserting alginic impression material into the rabbit epipharynx. As the result the rabbit epipharynx 24 hours after death is fairly wider than that in vivo. This seems to be due to the slackening in the tension of salpingopharyngeus muscle. In the case of epipharynx after fixing in the 10 % formalin solution and that after embedding in <b>celloidin,</b> however, it is revealed that the epipharynx is extremely narrow. This appears to be due to the contraction of the whole tissue by fixation. Therefore, it is obvious that there would be considerable differences in the measurements after death and in vivo in such an organ as epipharynx surrounded by soft tissues, making it impossible to estimate in vivo measurements from those of cadaver. In the present experiment it has been confirmed that alginic impression material enables to represent minute morphological changes...|$|E

There was a good correlation between the extent and severity of the abnormal MRI signal and the pathological changes. Areas of diffuse MRI abnormality corresponded with areas of axonal and myelin loss with gliosis, and small "lacune"-like lesions corresponded with lacunar infarcts histologically. Sparing of the subcortical U-fibres was seen histologically and on MRI.

40|$|The {{identification}} {{and distribution of}} mechanoreceptors in the cranial cruciate ligament of the cat (analogous to the anterior cruciate ligament in other species) was studied histologically using a modified <b>celloidin</b> embedding technique to achieve serial sectioning of bone-ligament-bone preparations with gold chloride staining. We identified distinctive large elongated structures situated between the collagen bundles of the ligament (resembling endings described as Freeman and Wyke type III; also termed Golgi tendon receptors). These endings were found near {{the middle of the}} ligament well away from the bone-ligament junction. Axons seen entering only one end of each type III ending helped to confirm its neural basis. While we saw structures resembling types I and II endings (i. e. Ruffini and pacinian endings, respectively) in individual sections, serial sections failed to reveal convincing evidence of their existence. Such structures almost always appeared to be vascular in nature on adjacent sections, with vessels entering and exiting.

The standards consist of <b>celloidin</b> cylinders stained with the PAS reaction and embedded in paraffin. For prior characterization of the cylinders, sections of different thickness were obtained and mounted. The optical density of each section was measured by direct microphotometry or image analysis. The actual thickness of each section was evaluated following re-embedding of piled groups of sections in a paraffin block and transversal sectioning. The thickness was then measured with a micrometric eye-piece. Optical density and actual thickness of each section were plotted on a normogram curve.

The corpuscles were oval or elliptical, their longitudinal and transverse diameters being 590. 0 +/- 207. 6 microns and 320. 0 +/- 119. 6 microns. There were 667 corpuscles (mean value for 4 feet) in each forefoot, 80 % {{of which were}} in the toe region and the remainder in the palmar region.

Scattered corpuscles were found in contact with the periosteum of distal and middle phalanges and with flexor tendon sheath, and in the dermis of the palm. Corpuscles were observed to be clustered in the skin folds of the toes. Skin folds, made of dorsal hairy skin, covered the claw on both sides, with most corpuscles in contact with hair follicles and others scattered between hair follicles.

The fetuses ranged from 9. 1 to 40 cm in crown-rump length and {{are believed to be}} between 12 weeks and term. Acetabula were decalcified embedded in paraffin or <b>celloidin,</b> sectioned, and stained using conventional histologic techniques. Sections from the superior one-quarter of the acetabulum were examined for the initial appearance and later spread of osseous tissue. Throughout the fetal period bone was present only in the floor of the acetabulum and did not extend into the socket walls. Ossification was detected initially more posteriorly in the socket floor, and at all ages, ossification was more prominent on the ischial side of the socket. Despite the lack of osseous tissue a well-formed hyaline cartilage socket was present. The fetal labrum was composed of fibrous tissue with the density of fibers increasing with age. Typical-appearing chondrocytes were detected at only the inner articular margin of the labrum. Contributing from one-fifth to one-half of the socket depth, the labrum may play a greater role in containing the femoral head at birth than it does in the mature joint. In seven acetabula, from joints that were neither subluxated nor dislocated, an area of areolar tissue with capillaries was detected at the hyaline cartilage-labrum junction.

40|$|CLINICAL and electrocortical {{observations}} (Caveness, 1969; and Caveness et al., 1973) {{have indicated}} {{significant differences in}} the development and propagation of focal seizure activity induced by penicillin injection into the face-hand area of the motor cortex of the Macaca mulatto at birth and at 24 months of age. From histoanatomical study of the cerebra of the newborn and 24 -month-old monkeys, Yakovlev (1962) concluded that these differences correlate with the early maturation of cortico-subcortical-cortical connexions and the later elaboration of the intracortical connexions. This interpretation has been further supported by recent electrophysiological experiments of Caveness et al. (1973) which showed that when the subcortical connexions of the face-hand area of the motor cortex of the newborn monkey were interrupted by undercutting the cortex prior to the injection of penicillin, there was no or only minimal spread of seizure activity. In contrast, subpial circumsection of the intracortico-cortical connexions of the face-hand area of the motor cortex without cortical undercutting did not prevent the spread of the penicillin-induced seizure activity to either the ipsilateral or contralateral hemisphere. The present study was undertaken to extend the earlier histoanatomical observations of Yakovlev and experimental studies of Caveness referred to, with special attention {{to the development of the}} dendritic arbours and postsynaptic spines of the individual neurons of the motor cortex in relation to age.

About 5 hours later the abdominal aorta was taken out, and it was cut into longitudinal and cross <b>celloidin</b> sections of about 100 μ in thickness, which were stained with aldehyde-fuchsin or light-green solution {{and the distribution of}} lymph vessels in the arterial wall was observed. With some of the above specimens transparent samples were also prepared. By the forced reverse flow of lymph {{it was found that the}} excretory lymph vessel group arising from lymph capillary immediately adjacent to the internal elastic membrane of the aortic wall runs gradually along collagenous fibers through the fenestrations of each elastic membrane of the tunica media, and appears at the tunica adventitia and after confluencing they become a ralatively large excretory lymph vessel, but they further confluence with the excretory lymph vessel arising from the lymph capillary of fat tissue in the tunica adventitia, and they form an aggregative lymph vessel which runs over the exterior layer of the tunica adventitia, and when it comes out of the tunica adventitia it enters into the aortic lymph node. What is noteworthy is the fact that both the aggregative and excretory lymph vessels have peri-lymphvessel spaces. Embryologically, such a peri-lymphvessel space is a kind of closed space formed by the peri-arterialwall connective tissue consistig of double membrane that covers a part of the aortic lymph nodes to make an aggregative lymph vessel, and then excretory lymph vessel, which should be considered as a lymph space.

40|$|Objectives: We {{describe}} the histopathologic {{findings in the}} temporal bones of a patient who had, during life, received a diagnosis of superior canal dehiscence (SCD) syndrome. Methods: The patient {{was found to have}} SCD syndrome at 59 years of age. She became a temporal bone donor, and died of unrelated causes at 62 years of age. Both temporal bones were prepared in <b>celloidin</b> and examined by light micros-copy. Results: The patient developed bilateral aural fullness, pulsatile tinnitus, and difficulty tolerating loud noises after minor head trauma at 53 years of age. The symptoms were worse on the right. She also had Valsalva-induced dizziness and eye movements, as well as sound-induced dizziness (more prominent on the right). Audiometry showed a small air-bone gap of 10 dB in the right ear. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing showed an abnormally low threshold of 66 dB on the right, and a computed tomography scan showed dehiscence of the superior canal on the right. Histopathologic exami-nation of the right ear showed a 1. 4 × 0. 6 -mm dehiscence of bone covering the superior canal. Dura was in direct contact with the endosteum and the membranous duct {{at the level of the}} dehiscence. No osteoclastic process was evident within the otic capsule bone surrounding the dehiscence. The left ear showed thin but intact bone over the superior canal. Both ears showed focal microdehiscences of the tegmen tympani and tegmen mastoideum. The auditory and vestibular sense organs on both sides appeared normal. No endolymphatic hydrops was observed. Conclusions: The findings were consistent with the hypothesis put forth by Carey and colleagues that SCD may arise from a failure of postnatal bone development, and that minor trauma may disrupt thin bone or stable dura over the supe-rior canal...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{anatomical}} investigations {{provide the}} basis for functional models. In this study the density of neurons and synapses was measured in three different areas (8, 6, and 17) of the neocortex of the mouse. Both kinds of measurements were made on the same material, embedded in Epon/Araldit. In order to determine the synaptic density per mm 3, the proportion of synaptic neuropil was also measured; it was found to be 84. The cortical volume occupied by cell bodies of neurons and glia cells amounted to 12, that by blood vessels to 4. The total average was 9. 2 × 104 neurons/mm 3 and 7. 2 × 108 synapses/mm 3. About 11 of the synapses were of type II. The density of neurons increased with decreasing cortical thickness; thus the number of neurons under a given surface area was about constant. The synaptic density, on the other hand, was almost constant in the three areas, the number of synapses under a given cortical surface area tended, therefore, to increase with cortical thickness. The average number of synapses per neuron was 8, 200, with a tendency to increase with increasing cortical thickness. Shrinkage of the tissue was also measured for various staining techniques. No shrinkage occurred during perfusion with 3. 7 formaldehyde or with a solution of buffered paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde and during fixation in situ. Electron microscopical material showed almost no shrinkage, whereas Nissl-preparations on paraffin-embedded material had only 43 of their original volume. After Nissl stain on frozen sections the volume had shrunken to 68 and after Golgi impregnation and embedding in <b>celloidin</b> to 70.

Thickening of the subependymal cell layer in two brains and subependymal nodular dysplasia in one brain is indicative of active neurogenesis in two autistic children. Subcortical, periventricular, hippocampal and cerebellar heterotopias detected in the brains of four autistic subjects (31 %) reflect abnormal neuronal migration. Multifocal cerebral dysplasia resulted in local distortion of the cytoarchitecture of the neocortex in four brains (31 %), of the entorhinal cortex in two brains (15 %), of the cornu Ammonis in four brains and of the dentate gyrus in two brains. Cerebellar flocculonodular dysplasia detected in six subjects (46 %), focal dysplasia in the vermis in one case, and hypoplasia in one subject indicate local failure of cerebellar development in 62 % of autistic subjects. Detection of flocculonodular dysplasia in only one control subject and of a broad spectrum of focal qualitative neuropathological developmental changes in 12 of 13 examined brains of autistic subjects (92 %) reflects multiregional dysregulation of neurogenesis, neuronal migration and maturation in autism, which may contribute to the heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{relative}} {{growth of}} the neocortex parallels the emergence of complex cognitive functions across species. To determine the regions of the mammalian genome responsible for natural variations in cortical volume, we conducted a complex trait analysis using 34 strains of recombinant inbred (Rl) strains of mice (BXD), {{as well as their}} two parental strains (C 57 BL/ 6 J and DBA/ 2 J). We measured both neocortical volume and total brain volume in 155 coronally sectioned mouse brains that were Nissl stained and embedded in <b>celloidin.</b> After correction for shrinkage, the measured cortical and noncortical brain volumes were entered into a multiple regression analysis, which removed the effects of body size and age from the measurements. Marker regression and interval mapping were computed using WebQTL. Results An ANOVA revealed {{that more than half of}} the variance of these regressed phenotypes is genetically determined. We then identified the regions of the genome regulating this heritability. We located genomic regions in which a linkage disequilibrium was present using WebQTL as both a mapping engine and genomic database. For neocortex, we found a genome-wide significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 11 (marker D 11 Mit 19), as well as a suggestive QTL on chromosome 16 (marker D 16 Mit 100). In contrast, for noncortex the effect of chromosome 11 was markedly reduced, and a significant QTL appeared on chromosome 19 (D 19 Mit 22). Conclusion This classic pattern of double dissociation argues strongly for different genetic factors regulating relative cortical size, as opposed to brain volume more generally. It is likely, however, that the effects of proximal chromosome 11 extend beyond the neocortex strictly defined.

40|$|DNA and RNA {{have been}} used as markers of tissue quality and {{integrity}} throughout the last few decades. In this research study, genomic quality DNA of kidney, liver, heart, lung, spleen, and brain were analyzed in tissues from post-mortem patients and surgical cancer cases spanning the past century. DNA extraction was performed on over 180 samples from: 70 + year old formalin-fixed celloidin-embedded (FFCE) tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from surgical cases and post-mortem cases from the 1970 ’s, 1980 ’s, 1990 ’s, and 2000 ’s, tissues fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin/stored in 70 % ethanol from the 1990 ’s, 70 + year old tissues fixed in unbuffered formalin of various concentrations, and fresh tissue as a control. To extract DNA from FFCE samples and ethanol-soaked samples, a modified standard operating procedure was used in which all tissues were homogenized, digested with a proteinase K solution {{for a long period of}} time (24 - 48 hours), and DNA was extracted using the Autogen Flexstar automated extraction machine. To extract DNA from FFPE, all tissues were soaked in xylene to remove the paraffin from the tissue prior to digestion, and FFPE tissues were not homogenized. The results were as follows: celloidin-embedded and paraffin-embedded tissues yielded the highest DNA concentration and greatest DNA quality, while the formalin in various concentrations, and long term formalin/ethanol-stored tissue yielded both the lowest DNA concentration and quality of the tissues tested. The average DNA yield for the various fixatives was: 367. 77 μg/ mL FFCE, 590. 7 μg/mL FFPE, 53. 74 μg/mL formalin-fixed/ 70 % ethanol-stored and 33. 2 μg/mL unbuffered formalin tissues. The average OD readings for FFCE, FFPE, formalin-fixed/ 70 % ethanol-stored tissues, and tissues fixed in unbuffered formalin were 1. 86, 1. 87, 1. 43, and 1. 48 respectively. The results show that usable DNA can be extracted from tissue fixed in formalin and embedded in <b>celloidin</b> or paraffin from the early 1900 ’s to present, and may be amplified through PCR and used for clinical and experimental studies...|$|E
40|$|THE {{observation}} of certain irregularities in the exposed bifurcation of the l lower first molars {{has led to}} an investigation of these features. A study of the bifurcation of 328 extracted lower molars, divided into 3 groups, was undertaken. In 107 of these teeth (Group 1), buccolingual specimens were prepared by grinding off the mesial half of the tooth, preserving the distal half up to the height of the bifurcation. In 112 other of these teeth (Group 2), the distal half of the tooth was sacrificed, preserving the mesial half of the tooth up to the height of the bifurcation. In 109 teeth (Group 3), both roots were amputated at right angles at a line about 2 mm. from the height of the bifurcation. All these specimens were studied under a dissecting microscope (x 18). Buccolingual ground sections ground {{at the height of the}} bifurcation were then prepared of 35 molars from Group 3. An additional 20 teeth from Group 3 were decalcified and embedded in <b>celloidin.</b> Ten of them were sectioned serially in a buccolingual direction through the bifurcation, the other 10 were sectioned serially in mesiodistal direction. All decalcified sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Every effort was made to observe, as closely as possible, a correct buccolingual plane in cutting and sectioning of gross speci-mens, ground sections, and serial decalcified sections, in order to avoid possible tangential views of the roots. RESULTS The most striking feature found in a majority of specimens was the presence of a distinct ridge, running across the bifurcation in a mesiodistal direction. We called this the intermediate bifurcational ridge (Figs. 1 - 4, 6 - 11). This ridge, where present, originates on the mesial surface of the distal root about 2 mm. from the height of the bifurcation, runs across the bifurcation, and ends high up on the mesial root, there blending into the concavity characteristic for the distal surface of the mesial root of this tooth (Fig. 4). This intermediate ridge was found pronounced (Figs. 1, 2, 4, and 6) in 44 pe...|$|E
40|$|E RUPTION is {{essentially}} the movement of a tooth or a tooth germ as related to its bony crypt and its overlying mucosa. To study the direction or mechanism of eruption, therefore, one must (1) establish some fixed points of reference within the jaws, and (2) compare {{the movement of the}} tooth at suc-cessive stages. Under normal circumstances, however, bone formation and bone destruction occur simultaneously and no permanent landmark remains in a growing bone. Thus, a study concerning the eruptive movements of teeth is difficult. Greepl discovered a recessive mutation in rats (ia) which is char-acterized by a retardation or absence of bone resorption but in which bone apposition occurs in a more or less normal manner. 2 Consequently, if one were to compare the bones of these animals at successive stages, the growth pattern of these bones becomes apparent. This method has been used to study the detailed growth patterns of various bones. 3 - 6 Since the ia bones present numerous fixed points of reference, the jaws in these animals offer an unusual opportunity to study the course and mechanism of eruption. In the present investigation, therefore, an attempt was made to determine the cause as well as the direction of movement of the mandibular first molar in the rat. In a part of this study, the ia and normal animals were used, while in part it depends exclusively on the normal rats. METHODS AND MATERIALS The investigation is based on serial histologic sections through the first molar region of 20 ia and 34 heterozygous rats, ranging from 13 days ' insemina-tion age to 30 days after birth. The heads were fixed in 5 per cent formalin, decalcified in 5 per cent nitric acid, embedded in <b>celloidin,</b> cut serially in the frontal plane and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Camera lucida tracings were made of representative areas in all the ia and normal mandibles.

40|$|The {{auditory}} and vestibular organs {{form the}} inner ear and have a common developmental origin. Insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) has {{a central role in}} the development of the cochlea and maintenance of hearing. Its deficiency causes sensorineural hearing loss in man and mice. During chicken early development, IGF- 1 modulates neurogenesis of the cochleovestibular ganglion but no further studies have been conducted to explore the potential role of IGF- 1 in the vestibular system. In this study we have compared the whole transcriptome of the vestibular organ from wild type and Igf 1 -/- mice at different developmental and postnatal times. RNA was prepared from E 18. 5, P 15 and P 90 vestibular organs of Igf 1 -/- and Igf 1 +/+ mice and the transcriptome analysed in triplicates using Affymetrix® Mouse Gene 1. 1 ST Array Plates. These plates are whole-transcript arrays that include probes to measure both messenger (mRNA) and long intergenic non-coding RNA transcripts (lincRNA), with a coverage of over 28 thousand coding transcripts and over 7 thousands non-coding transcripts. Given the complexity of the data we used two different methods VSN-RMA and mmBGX to analyse and compare the data. This is to better evaluate the number of false positives and to quantify uncertainty of low signals. We identified a number of differentially expressed genes that we described using functional analysis and validated using RT-qPCR. The morphology of the vestibular organ did not show differences between genotypes and no evident alterations were observed in the vestibular sensory areas of the null mice. However, well-defined cellular alterations were found in the vestibular neurons with respect their number and size. Although these mice did not show a dramatic vestibular phenotype, we conducted a functional analysis on differentially expressed genes between genotypes and across time. This was with the aim to identify new pathways that are involved in the development of the vestibular organ as well as pathways that maybe affected by the lack of IGF- 1 and be associated to the morphological changes of the vestibular neurons that we observed in the Igf 1 -/- mice.

He discusses the anatomy and physiology of the dental innervation {{and the effect of}} section of the inferior dental nerve on the trophic, vasomotor, protective, and sensory functions, with special reference to the relation between dental disease and neuropathies. He describes the innervation of the tooth germ {{and the nature of the}} growing fibrils seen before calcification in the dentinal papilla and draws attention to the innervation of the periodontal membrane. He has found that these nerves anastomose across the crest of the interdental septa with their fellows and demonstrates coiled sub-cemental nerve-endings. He has been unable to find any difference in the eruption and casting of teeth after section of the inferior dental nerve, and does not find degeneration of the nerves of deciduous teeth prior to casting to be inevitable. He discusses the effect of local anæsthesia on the dental pulp, some of the causes of odontalgia and neuralgia and the effect of old age and general disease on the dental innervation. He has failed with lethal or continued sublethal doses of ethyl and methyl alcohol, lead or tetanus and diphtheria toxins, using the oral, gastric, subcutaneous and intravenous route, to produce dental neuronic change. The effects of fracture of teeth and jaws, the introduction of arsenic into the pulp chamber and amputation and extirpation of the pulp are examined. The vital resistance of the pulp and the significance of granulomata as a protective mechanism are discussed. The author has found that after extraction although there is at first degeneration of the nerve-fibres concerned, there may subsequently be regeneration, sometimes in the form of plexiform neuroma. He has produced degenerative changes in both the nerves and the Gasserian ganglia on both the operated and unoperated sides by the introduction of tetanus and diphtheria toxins into extraction sockets, where the neuronic involvement is proportionate to the degree of trauma with which the extraction is effected.

40|$|The {{present report}} aimed {{to study the}} {{fecundity}} of sea bream, Pagrus major (Ternminck et Schlegel), by obtaining the basic information on the number and maturation process of its ovarian eggs and comparing the number of spawned eggs by the cultured fish with the fecundity of the wild ones. The materials used in this investigation were collected from the coastal waters of Chikuzenkai region of northern Kyushu, {{during the period from}} March, 1969 to July, 1970. Here the study is principally based on the histological observations of the ovarian eggs, related with their diameters as well as their numbers. The ovaries preserved in 10 per cent formalin were weighed, and the egg counts and diameter measurements were made under 50 times magnification using the projector. Egg number was obtained by computing the number in {{a small portion of the}} ovary for its total. Histological sections of the ovary were prepared by the paraffin and the <b>celloidin</b> method, and stained with Delafield haematoxylin and eosin. The peak spawning season is during the period from late April to late May. From the egg diameter distribution curves, the growth of the ovarian eggs for maturity were discussed, and the multiple spawning by individual sea bream was suggested by the multiplicity of modes in the distribution curves (Fig. 1). There are shown in P 1. 1, 2 and 3 the general histological features of the ovary and the ovarian eggs of sea bream in each maturation stage. The eggs in the various maturation stages, newly formed empty follicles and the old ones were found simultaneously within the ovary of a mature sea bream. Therefore, the spawning is thought to occur in many times for long period. Maturation stage and size range of the eggs, maturation phase and type of the ovary were arranged in Table 1 based on the observations of the sections and the egg diameter measurements. Relationship between the number of ovarian eggs developed over peripheral nucleolus stage and fork length of the fish by ovary types is shown in Fig. 2. No significant differences are observed between wild fish and cultured one in the number of ovarian eggs corresponding to the fork length in different areas. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the number of eggs developed over yolk vesicle stage and fork length in each ovary type. All these eggs increase in number with the increase of the fork length of the body. The total number of spawned eggs during a spawning season by cultured fish is about twice as many as the number of ovarian eggs developed over peripheral nucleolus stage and about quadruple as many as the number of eggs developed over yolk vesicle stage. It may be concluded that the immature eggs are continuously developed into the mature ones throughout the spawning season. Comparing the number of the eggs in the most matured batch with those of spawned by the cultured fish in the same size, it may be estimated sea bream ovulate their eggs into the ovarian cavity from one to four times during a day and spawn once at a time a day. この報告の目的は,マダイ卵巣卵の成熟過程と卵巣内卵数に関する基礎知識を求め,既往の飼育魚の産卵例と対比しつつ,産卵数との関係を検討することである. この調査に用いた材料は九州北部の筑前海域より 1969 年 3 月から 1970 年 7 月にかけて採集したものであり,主として卵巣卵の組織学的観察と卵数および卵径測定を行なつたものである. 10 %フォルマリン液で保存した卵巣標本を用いた. 卵数および卵径測定は万能投影機を用い, 50 倍に拡大して行なつた. 卵数算定は重量法で行ない,卵巣中の 1 部分の卵数を卵巣重量比で全卵数にひきのばした. 卵巣の組織切片標本はパラフィン法もしくはセロイジン法により作製し,デラフィールド・ヘマトキシリンとエオシンの二重染色をほどこした. 産卵盛期は年度により多少異なるが 4 月下旬から 5 月下旬にかけてである. 卵径組成を求め,卵の発育について論議し,卵径組成が多峯型で多回産卵を行なうことを暗示した(Fig. 1). 各成熟期の卵巣および卵巣卵の一般的組織像についてはPl. 1, 2 および 3 に示した. 成熟魚の組織学的検査によれば,種々の成熟期にある卵や,新・旧の排卵痕がその卵巣中に同時にみられ,長期にわたつて多数回の産卵がなされることを示している. 卵の成熟期,その卵径範囲,卵巣の卵径組成による型とその成熟期については,切片観察と卵径測定を基にしてTable 1 にとりまとめた. 卵巣型別にフォーク長と卵黄胞期以上に発育した卵の数との関係を求めた(Fig. 2). 北島の資料(未発表) を用いて養成魚と天然魚の卵巣内卵数のフォーク長に対する関係を,異なつた水域の材料で比較したが,差は認められなかつた. 卵黄球期以上に発育した卵の数をフォーク長との関係において卵巣型別にプロットした(Fig. 3). これらの全ての卵数はフォーク長の増大にともなつて増加する. 養成魚の産卵期中の全産卵数(古賀ら,北島の資料) は,卵黄球期以上に発育した卵巣内卵数の約 4 倍,卵黄胞期以上のそれの約 2 倍である. この結果から毎日の産卵を行なうかたわら産卵期中は,常時未成熟期の卵団から成熟期の卵団へと,発育添加がなされていると推定した. 養成魚の産卵数とそれと同じフォーク長の魚が有する卵巣内の分離成熟卵団の卵数を比較することによつて,マダイは 1 日のうちに 1 ～ 4 回排卵すると推定した. なお,それらの産卵はほとんど 1 回(多くて 3 回) でなされる...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUÇÃO: Imagens por tensores de difusão (diffusion tensor imaging - DTI) do cérebro são parte {{fundamental}} de exames de ressonância magnética (RM) na rotina clínica. Entretanto, não há informação científica suficiente para inferir a base histológica de parâmetros de imagens de DTI. Um dos achados frequentes nos exames de RM são as áreas de alteração de sinal na substância branca (AASSB). Neste estudo, analisamos imagens de RM post-mortem, em particular as AASSB, e seus correlatos histológicos e imuno-histoquímicos. OBJETIVOS: Descrever os parâmetros quantitativos de imagens de DTI imagens obtidas in cranio post-mortem, comparar com parâmetros de relaxometria e transferência de magnetização e avaliar seus correlatos histológicos nas AASSB e AHAN, utilizando técnicas de correspondência espacial ponto-a-ponto. MÉTODOS: Analisamos áreas distribuídas na substância branca de encéfalos de quatro sujeitos submetidos ao exame de RM post-mortem, aproximadamente 12, 87 horas (± 2, 59). A RM foi realizada em sistema com campo de 3, 0 T, sendo utilizadas imagens FLAIR; T 2 multi-eco, DTI, Densidade de Prótons para cálculo da taxa de transferência de magnetização (magnetization {{transfer ratio}} - MTR). Foram delimitadas regiões de interesse (ROI) em 20 áreas contendo AASSB e 20 áreas homólogas aparentemente normais (AHAN). Para cada área, foram obtidos valores de anisotropia fracional (FA), coeficiente de difusão aparente (ADC), MTR e tempo T 2. Os encéfalos foram seccionados em fatias de 0, 4 mm e fotografados em alta resolução. Estas imagens foram co-registradas tridimensionalmente com as imagens de RM, utilizando técnica semi-automatizada para correlação ponto-a-ponto. Os fragmentos analisados foram corados por hematoxilina-eosina (HE), Kluverx Barrera (KB), galocianina (GALL), anti-neurofilamento (anti-NF), antiproteína básica de mielina (anti-MBP) e anti-proteína ácida fibrilar glial (anti- GFAP). RESULTADOS: Os valores de FA foram 0, 40 ± 0, 12 nas AASSB, e 0, 52 ± 0, 15 nas AHAN. Os valores de ADC foram nas AASSB de 0, 129 ± 0, 04 x 10 - 3 mm 2 /s, e 0, 108 ± 0, 03 x 10 - 3 mm 2 /s nas AHAN. Os valores de MTR foram 51, 59 ± 0, 88 % nas AASSB, e 52, 88 ± 4, 09 % nas AHAN. Os valores de RT 2 foram 91, 79 ± 1, 95 % nas AASSB, e 69, 94 ± 4, 54 % nas AHAN. Os valores de HE foram 162, 9 ± 20, 0 nas AASSB, e 163, 3 ± 20, 4 nas AHAN. Os valores de GALL foram de 181, 8 ± 4, 36 nas AASSB, e 167, 11 ± 20, 65 nas AHAN. Os valores de KB foram de 168, 9 ± 19, 08 nas AASSB, e 182. 82 ± 20, 65 nas AHAN. Os valores de NF médios mensurados foram de 131, 6 ± 12, 23 nas AASSB, e 128, 03 ± 4, 74 nas AHAN. Os valores de MBP médios mensurados foram de 153, 9 ± 13, 67 nas AASSB, e 153, 18 ± 12, 69 nas AHAN. Os valores de GFAP médios mensurados foram de 94. 61 ± 7, 85 nas AASSB, e 81, 23 ± 6, 29 nas AHAN. Os testes não paramétricos de correlação (Spearman) entre variáveis de imagens de RM e histologia apresentaram correlação apenas entre FA e GFAP (r=- 0, 59; p < 0, 005). DISCUSSÃO E CONCLUSÕES: De acordo com os resultados obtidos, podemos inferir que a presença de gliose é um processo patológico que pode ser detectado utilizando os parâmetros de FA nas imagens de DTI. Os resultados apresentados demonstram que imagens de RM adquiridas post-mortem podem servir para compreender melhor as alterações estruturais do tecido cerebralBACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) {{is part of}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition methods available in clinical exams. However, {{there are not enough}} scientific basis to infer the histological substract of DTI parameters. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are frequent findings in clinical MRI routine. In the last years, scientific evidences show that these injuries are not just age-related benign changes, but they could be associated to pathological processes. In this study we analyzed post-mortem MRI DTI data, specifically investigating WMH, their histological and immunohistochemical correlates. OBJECTIVES : At present study, we aimed to analyze quantifiable DTI parameters - Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) - relaxometry (RT 2) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) in WMH compared and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) from images obtained postmortem and in situ, and assess their histological substracts at WMH and NAWM using a point-topoint correlation platform. METHODS : We analyzed 20 regions of interest (ROI) encompassing WMH and NAWM selected from four subjects using in situ post-mortem MRI data acquired in 3. 0 T MR system. The subjects were scanned with a post-mortem interval of approximately 12 h 54 m (± 2 h 36 m). The MRI analysis included 3 D T 1, FLAIR; multi-echo T 2, DTI, and proton density to calculate the rate of magnetization transfer (magnetization transfer ratio - MTR). In each ROI we obtained measures of FA, ADC, RT 2 and MTR. Brain specimens were posteriorly fixed in <b>celloidin,</b> sectioned into 0. 4 mm slices and photographed in high resolution. These images were co-registered with three-dimensional MR images using semi-automated technique for correlation using a point-to-point method established in our group. WMH and NAWM ROIs from MRI were submitted to quantitative histological analysis based on optical density color-deconvolution technique. Histological section were stained in hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Kluver-Barrera (KB), galloccyanin (GALL), anti-neurofilament (anti-NF), anti-basic myelin protein (anti-MBP) and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP). RESULTS: The mean FA values were 0. 40 ± 0. 12 in WMH, and 0. 52 ± 0. 15 in NAWM. ADC in WMH was 0. 1290 ± 0. 04, x 10 - 3 mm 2 /s and 0. 1081 ± 0. 03 x 10 - 3 mm 2 /s in NAWM. MTR was 51. 59 ± 0. 88 % in WMH, and 52. 88 ± 4. 09 % in NAWM. RT 2 was 91. 79 ± 1. 95 % in WMH, and 69. 94 ± 4. 54 % in NAWM. FA, ADC and RT 2 values were different between WMH and NAWM in a non-parametric analysis. On the quantitative histological analysis, the HE was 162. 9 ± 20. 0 in WMH, and 163. 3 ± 20. 4 % in NAWM. GALL values at WMH was 181. 8 ± 4. 36 and 167. 11 ± 20. 65 at NAWM. KB was 168. 9 ± 19. 08 in WMH, and 182. 82 ± 20. 65 at NAWM. NF mean were 131. 6 ± 12. 23 in WMH, and 128. 03 ± 14. 74 at NAWM. MBP was 153. 9 ± 13. 67 at WMH, and 153. 18 ± 12. 69 at NAWM. Only GFAP values were different between WMH and NAWM. Mean GFAP was 94. 61 ± 7. 85 in WMH, and 81. 23 ± 6. 29 at NAWM. Non-parametric test (Spearman) between MR images and histology, showed correlation only for FA vs GFAP (r=- 0. 594, p < 0. 005). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: DTI FA and ADC parameters (and RT 2 values) showed different patterns in WMH compared to NAWM, indicating that MR images acquired post-mortem may serve to understand the structural changes of the brain tissue.

40|$|It will be {{seen from}} the above that we have studied the {{conditions}} associated with the deposit of calcareous salts: (I) in connection with normal and pathological ossification, and (2) in pathological calcification as exhibited in (a) atheroma of the vessels; (b) calcification of caseating tubercular lesions; (c) calcification of inflammatory new growth, and (d) degenerating tumors; and we have induced experimentally deposits of calcareous salts in the lower animals: (a) within <b>celloidin</b> capsules containing fats and soaps; (b) in the kidney, and (c) in connection with fat necrosis. I. We have found that bone formation and pathological calcareous infiltration are wholly distinct processes. In the former {{there is no evidence of}} associated fatty change, and the cells associated with the process of deposition of calcium are functionally active. In the latter there is an antecedent fatty change in the affected areas, and the cells involved present constant evidences of degeneration. The view that would seem to account best for the changes observed in the latter case is that with lowered vitality the cells are unable to utilize the products brought to them by the blood, or which they continue to absorb, so that the normal series of decompositions associated with their metabolism fails to take place and hence they interact among themselves in the cytoplasm with the result that insoluble compounds replace soluble ones. II. Besides the fact that calcification is always preceded by fatty change within the cells, another fact should be emphasized. namely: that combination of the fats present with calcium salts to form calcium soaps tends to occur. The stages immediately preceding these are difficult to follow with anything approaching certainty, perhaps because the earlier stages vary under different conditions. In fat necrosis, for instance, the cells affected are normally storehouses for neutral fats, and as long as they remain healthy neutral fats alone are present in them. When they are subjected to the action of the pancreatic juice with its fat-splitting ferment the cells are killed and coincidently the neutral fats are decomposed, fatty acids being deposited. The fatty acids now slowly combine with the calcium salts. In degenerating lipomata the process would seem to be similar. But in other cases the cells are not obviously fat-containing in the normal state; nevertheless prior to calcification they undergo so-called fatty degeneration, which is really a form of cell degeneration accompanied by fat infiltration. As regards the source of the cell fats in general we may safely accept: 1. That fats are transported in the blood as diffusible soaps. 2. That taken up by the cells these soaps may either— (a) Be reconverted into neutral fats and become stored in the cytoplasm as such, or (b) undergo assimilation proper, becoming part and parcel of the cell substance, in which case they are not recognizable by the ordinary microchemical tests. 3. If these two possibilities be accepted it follows that the appearance of fats and soaps in the degenerating cell may be due to either— (a) Absorption or infiltration of soaps from the surrounding medium, the degenerating cell retaining the power of splitting off the fat but being unable to utilize this in metabolism. (b) Cytoplasmic disintegration with dissociation of the soap-albumen combination or, more broadly, liberation of the fats from their combination with the cytoplasm. The appearances seen in the cells of atheromatous areas indicate that the first of these does occur. III. In areas undergoing calcareous infiltration we have demonstrated. the presence of soaps, and this often in such quantities that they can be isolated and estimated by gross chemical methods. By microchemical methods also we have been able to show that after removing all the neutral fats and fatty acids by petroleum ether there remains behind a substance giving with Sudan III the reaction we associate with the presence of soap. And experimentally we have produced these soaps within the organism, more particularly by placing capsules containing fats and fatty acids within the tissues and after several days finding that the capsules contain calcium soaps and possess a calcium content far in excess of that of the normal blood and lymph. IV. While these are the facts, certain of the details of this reaction demand elucidation. The existence of sodium and it may be potassium soaps in the degenerated cells is comprehensible if we accept that these are present in the circulating lymph and simply undergoing absorption. But even then, as these are diffusible substances how is it to be explained that they become stored up in these particular areas? We have found that, as a matter of fact, in regions which give the reaction for soaps, but which give no reaction for calcium (which therefore presumably contain at most amounts of the insoluble calcium soap too small to need consideration, the ordinary solvents for potassium and sodium soaps do not forthwith remove the stainable material; they are relatively insoluble. The reason for this insolubility is suggested by the observations made in the test tube, that soap solutions mixed with solutions of white of egg or blood serum form a precipitate of combined soap and albumen, which likewise is insoluble in water and alcohol. The indications are therefore that in cells undergoing degeneration, with degeneration of the cytoplasm, certain albuminous molecules unite with the soaps present to form relatively insoluble soap-albuminate. V. With regard to calcium soaps, these are also present and in certain stages appear to be the dominating form in the affected tissues. Two questions suggest themselves, viz. : what is the source of calcium, and what is the process by which they become formed? As to the source, the amount present in well-marked calcification is far in excess of the normal calcium contents of the affected tissue. If in the kidneys of experimental calcification three hundred times as much calcium may be present as in the normal kidney (von Kossa), the calcium must be conveyed to the part by the blood and lymph, and that this is so is demonstrated, as we have pointed out, by the distribution of the infiltration in solid organs, that like ovarian fibroids have undergone necrosis, in which the earliest deposits are superficial. As to the process, there are three possibilities: 1. That sodium and potassium soaps and soap albuminates are first formed and that interaction occurs between them and the diffused calcium salts from the lymph, the less soluble-calcium replacing the sodium and potassium. 2. That under certain conditions the calcium salts act directly on the neutral fats present in the degenerating cells. 3. That the neutral fats are first broken down into fatty acids and that these react with the calcium salts to form the soaps. We are assured that the first process occurs and that because in the boundary zone of areas of calcification we can detect soapy particles devoid of calcium, identical in position and arrangement with the particles more deeply placed which give the calcium reactions. But this is not the only reaction. In case of fat necrosis we see clearly that the third process is in evidence. And we are far from being convinced that the second does not also obtain. We have been impressed by the large accumulation of neutral fats in the cells in cases of early atheroma and the absence at any stage of the process of recognizable fatty acid. While soaps, it is true, are compounds of fatty acids with alkalies, it is recognized in ordinary domestic life that they can be formed by the direct action of strong lye upon ordinary fats, and this even in the cold. It is quite possible therefore that there occurs a similar direct process in the organism. The point is worth noting, however, that this does not occur in healthy cells the seat of fatty infiltration. We therefore leave this an open question, only laying down that, as indicated by the hyalin albuminous matrix left when calcium salts are dissolved out of an area of calcification, there must exist a calcium soap- or fat-albuminate similar to the potassium and sodium soap-albuminates already mentioned—such an albuminate as we can form with calcium soaps in the test tube. VI. In old areas of calcification soaps are largely if not entirely wanting, although these are to be detected at the periphery, when the process is still advancing. The reactions given by these older areas are almost entirely those of calcium phosphate, though some calcium carbonate is at times to be made out. This seems surely to indicate that the final stage in calcification is an interaction between the calcium soap-albuminates and substances containing phosphoric and carbonic acids. Such substances, it is needless to say, are present in considerable amounts in the lymph and blood. We must conclude that the acid sodium phosphates of the lymph act on the calcium soap, the highly insoluble calcium phosphates being formed (plus the albuminous moiety of the original compound) and diffusible sodium soap being liberated, while similarly alkaline carbonates form calcium carbonate and liberate sodium and potassium soaps. Calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate thus become the insoluble earthy salts of old crystalline areas of calcification. VII. As already stated very little soap is to be found in these old areas. It is possibly worth suggestion that the soaps liberated in this last reaction, as they diffuse out, again react with diffusible calcium salts and form calcium soaps which once more react with the alkaline salts to produce the phosphates and carbonates; that, in short, they have a katalytic action. Certain it is that old calcareous areas are extraordinarily dense, and have a coarse crystalline structure, wholly at variance with the finely granular appearance of the more recent areas, and these large crystalline masses, it would seem, can only be formed by successive deposition of new material and eventual fusion, as the interspaces become filled in between the original masses...|$|E
