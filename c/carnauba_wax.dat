5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, lanolin, turpentine, wax (often <b>Carnauba</b> <b>wax),</b> gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E

500|$|Shoe polish {{is applied}} to the shoe using a rag, cloth, or brush. Shoe polish is not a {{cleaning}} product, and therefore the footwear should be both clean and dry before application. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as spit-polishing or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as a spit shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water.

500|$|The Rosetta Stone {{is listed}} as [...] "a stone of black granodiorite, bearing three inscriptions... found at Rosetta" [...] in a {{contemporary}} catalogue of the artefacts discovered by the French expedition and surrendered to British troops in 1801. At some period after its arrival in London, the inscriptions on the stone were coloured in white chalk {{to make them more}} legible, and the remaining surface was covered with a layer of <b>carnauba</b> <b>wax</b> designed to protect the Rosetta Stone from visitors' fingers. This gave a dark colour to the stone that led to its mistaken identification as black basalt. These additions were removed when the stone was cleaned in 1999, revealing the original dark grey tint of the rock, the sparkle of its crystalline structure, and a pink vein running across the top left corner. Comparisons with the Klemm collection of Egyptian rock samples showed a close resemblance to rock from a small granodiorite quarry at Gebel Tingar on {{the west bank of the}} Nile, west of Elephantine in the region of Aswan; the pink vein is typical of granodiorite from this region.|$|E
40|$|Solid lipid {{nanoparticles}} (SLNs) {{have been}} widely studied and tested as vehicles for natural compounds. Recently, Witepsol and Carnauba SLNs were shown to be effective systems for the entrapment of rosmarinic acid (RA) and herbal extracts. In the present work, the improvement of stability and bioactivity of these systems was studied. Thus, the freeze-drying of SLNs produced with Witepsol and <b>Carnauba</b> <b>waxes</b> loaded with RA and herbal extracts (sage and savory) were tested. The use of three different cryoprotectants (glucose, mannitol and trehalose) at two different concentrations (5 and 10 %, w/v) were evaluated. Furthermore, the prepared SLNs were stored under different conditions (atmosphere, temperature, absence or presence of light) and in different packaging materials, over 365 days. The effect on the SLNs physical stability and bioactivity was assessed. The most suitable cryoprotectant was mannitol at 10 % (w/v) for all formulations tested. The solid state of SLNs, with storage at room temperature, in glass flasks, protected from light and under N 2 controlled atmosphere were the best storage conditions in which the SLNs bioactivity was maintained during 365 days. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Considering the reduced bioavailability after oral use, effective (and safe) delivery systems {{are crucial to}} protect RA from gastrointestinal degradation. This study aims to characterize the safety profile of solid lipid nanoparticles produced with Witepsol and <b>Carnauba</b> <b>waxes</b> and loaded with RA, using in vitro and in vivo approaches, focused on genotoxicity and cytotoxicity assays, redox status markers, hematological and biochemical profile, liver and kidney function, gut bacterial microbiota, and fecal fatty acids composition. Free RA and sage extract, empty nanoparticles, or nanoparticles loaded with RA or sage extract (0. 15 and 1. 5 mg/mL) were evaluated for cell (lymphocytes) viability, necrosis and apoptosis, and antioxidant/prooxidant effects upon DNA. Wistar rats were orally treated for 14 days with vehicle (control) and with Witepsol or Carnauba nanoparticles loaded with RA at 1 and 10 mg/kg body weight/d. Blood, urine, feces, and several tissues were collected for analysis. Free and loaded RA, at 0. 15 mg/mL, presented a safe profile, while genotoxic potential was found for the higher dose (1. 5 mg/mL), mainly by necrosis. Our data suggest that both types of nanoparticles are safe when loaded with moderate concentrations of RA, without in vitro genotoxicity and cytotoxicity and with an in vivo safety profile in rats orally treated, thus opening new avenues for use in nutraceutical applications. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Photochemistry {{is one of}} {{the main}} ways of {{pollutants}} degradation in the environment. There is an obvious lack of data concerning the photostability of agrochemicals on plant foliage. We report here the first photodegradation study of a triketonic herbicide (sulcotrione) used as a substitute of atrazine. To mimic surface Leaves, we used films made of <b>carnauba</b> grey <b>wax</b> or of cuticular wax extracted from maize Leaves. Under simulated solar light, sulcotrione was rapidly phototyzed. The phototysis was much faster on cuticular wax films than in aqueous phase. Moreover, the formulated sulcotrione (Mikado) disappeared even more quickly than the pure active ingredient. Sulcotrione mainly underwent an intramolecular cyclization. To validate these observations, sulcotrione and its main photoproduct were monitored after maize field treatment. The day after the treatment the main photoproduct was detected on the maize leaves and suLcotrione had already significantly disappeared. This experiment demonstrates that phototysis can be a relevant process in real conditions after field treatment...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{tamarind}} (Tamarindus indica L.) seed extracts {{with potential}} antioxidant activity and toxicity to cancer cells were developed as functional foods and nutraceutical {{ingredients in the}} form of emulsion gel beads. Three extracts were obtained from ethanol and water: TSCH 50, TSCH 95 and TSCH. All extracts exhibited high potential for superoxide anion scavenging activity over the IC 50 range < 5 – 11 µg/mL and had no toxic effects on normal cells, however, the water extract (TSCH) was the most effective due to its free radical scavenging activity and toxicity in mitochondrial membranes of cancer cells. Next a study was designed to develop a new formulation for encapsulation and intragastric floating delivery of tamarind seed extract (TSCH) using wax-incorporated emulsion gel beads, which were prepared using a modified ionotropic gelation technique. Tamarind seed extract at 1 % (w/w) was used as the active ingredient in all formulations. The effect of the types and amounts of wax on the encapsulation efficiency and percentage of the active release of alginate gel beads was also investigated. The results demonstrated that the incorporation of both waxes into the gel beads had an effect on the percentage of encapsulation efficiency (%) and the percentage of the active ingredient release. Furthermore, the addition of water insoluble <b>waxes</b> (<b>carnauba</b> and bee <b>wax)</b> significantly retarded the release of the active ingredient. The addition of both waxes had a slight effect on drug release behavior. Nevertheless, the increase in incorporated waxes in all formulations could sustain the percentage of active ingredient release. In conclusion, wax-incorporated emulsion gel beads using a modified ionotropic gelation technique could be applied for the intragastric floating delivery and controlled release of functional food and nutraceutical products for their antioxidant and anticancer capacity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{controlled}} release of lysozyme by modification of hydrophobicity and morphology of zein films using composite and blend film making methods. The incorporation of beeswax, <b>carnauba</b> or candelilla <b>wax</b> into films at 5 % (w/w) of zein gave composite films containing amorphous wax particles, while incorporation of oleic acid into film at 5 % of zein caused formation of blend films containing many spherical zein capsules within their matrix. The lysozyme release rates of composites reduced as the melting point of waxes increased. The composites and blends showed 2. 5 to 17 fold lower lysozyme release rates than controls. The films were effectively plasticized by using catechin. The catechin also provided antioxidant activity of films (up to 69 mu mol Trolox/cm(2)) and contributed to their controlled release properties by reducing film porosity. The films showed antimicrobial activity against Listeria innocua.

40|$|From Introduction: Wax and wax-like {{substances}} {{have been}} defined in many ways. One reasonably extensive definition, by Hatt and Lamberton (1956) is given below: "The term "wax" seems best used to denote {{a group of}} substances which qualitatively have certain physical properties in common. These properties are familiar ones, for in almost all countries some natural wax - beeswax, Japan wax, Chinese insect <b>wax,</b> the <b>carnauba</b> and candelilla <b>waxes</b> of the Americas - {{has been an important}} material in art and industry from prehistoric times. Waxes are understood to be opaque or translucent solids, which melt without decomposition to form mobile liquids at temperatures in the region of 100 ⁰C. They differ in hardness, but are all essentially soft substances with poor mechanical strength. Most waxes can be easily shaped or kneaded at a little above ambient temperatures. In fact, the term could easily have been made to cover the whole class now named thermoplastics. " Pure n-paraffins would be too crystalline and brittle for use as waxes, whereas mixtures of n-paraffins have some valuable properties. The molecules bear such close resemblance to one another that they form mixed crystals of lowered crystallinity and the melting point {{is a function of the}} mean molecular weight. This is a desirable feature for it permits crystallinity and brittleness to be reduced without a marked loss in the melting point or hardness. It also allows a mixture to simulate a pure compound very closely. Waxes, in general, have been put to a large number of uses. They are used, for example, in candles, polishes, paper-coating, plastics, printing, matches, rust protectants and insulation. Each application requires its own appropriate range of wax properties...|$|R

40|$|Mamey sapote (Pouteria sapote (Jacq.) H. E. Moore and Stearn) {{fruit is}} highly {{appreciated}} in the Caribbean region; however, marketable life is significantly limited by abrupt softening during postharvest handling. Postharvest wax and 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) treatments were evaluated for potential of extending mamey sapote postharvest life. Fruit of the cv. Magaña were harvested at mature green (G), light orange (LO) and orange (O) {{stages of the}} pulp color, and brushed to remove excess epidermal fiber. <b>Waxed</b> (<b>carnauba</b> emulsion) and unwaxed fruit (G and LO stages) were held at 13 °C for 7 days, then transferred to 20 °C for ripening; those at O stage were held constantly at 20 °C. In a subsequent test, ‘Magaña’ fruit were harvested at a preclimacteric stage (LO), brushed, and treated with ±carnauba wax and ± 1 -MCP (1 μl l− 1 at 20 °C for 24 h). Fruit from all treatments were subsequently stored at 20 °C and 85 – 90 % relative humidity. Unwaxed ‘Magaña’ fruit reached climacteric maxima in 10 – 11 days, irrespective of harvest maturity or storage regime (Exp. 1). At 20 °C, peak CO 2 production ranged from 90 to 137 ml kg− 1 h− 1 and peak ethylene production from 116 to 209 μl kg− 1 h− 1, respectively. Waxed fruit generally had higher CO 2 and C 2 H 4 production rates than unwaxed fruit. When LO fruit was stored continuously at 20 °C (Exp. 2), wax treatment alone hastened the onset of respiration and ethylene climacteric peaks by 5 days over unwaxed fruit. 1 -MCP treatment alone delayed the onset of respiration and ethylene climacteric maxima by 6 and 5 days, respectively. Marketable life for wax-only fruit stored continuously at 20 °C was 10 days, while that for control, wax + 1 -MCP and 1 -MCP-only fruit was 13, 14, and 14 days, respectively.

40|$|This is {{the first}} piece that has been created {{as part of a}} wider on going {{practice}} based research project entitled “Can an artefact be created to store the memory of lost love”. The study hypothetically defines what love is in the context of differing relationships, such as familial, platonic and romantic the explanation of ‘lost love’ is to be explored as this changes the status and emotion felt. Lost love {{for the purpose of this}} study is defined as love felt for a person who is estranged from another, no longer in contact with or passed away from the participant. The reasoning behind using lost love as the starting point is considered here. “Lost or dead loves, enshrined in an aura of imaginary perfection, seem to hover over all our loves…within the imagination, they take on a magical and healing power. We idealise their attributes, make them the bearers of all our good and wholeness, the healers of our wounds” (Appignanesi, 2011, p. 36). The study will capture a number of participants lost love narratives, which will then be translated in to the design of storage artefacts. These narratives of lost love portray heightened emotion; therefore creating the belief that this lost love can be transubstantiated and harnessed within an object. The chest is an area of the body synonymous with love. Our heart, being the symbol of love is encased here, our neck being a sensual area on display or waiting to be kissed. The N-exlace is an accessory or the means to ‘store’ the love of a lost relationship. The natural veg tanned leather is moulded tightly to the curves and undulations of the body to allow a seamless fit as if the leather was the skin from earlier years. Imprinted on the leather are memories of the relationship, both good and bad. Images from happier times in photo booths, playfully pulling faces, letters and postcards received talking about the future and that pain of being apart and diary excerpts as the relationship broke down, knowing it was nearly over, but not sure where to turn or what to do. In the centre of piece is a bubble. The ghost of an object symbolizing the embodiment of the lost love. A locket once given as a gift. Like the love, the locket no longer remains, but the imprint on the person is still present, leaving memories that shape our character, lifestyle and fashion choices and in certain aspects our future relationships. The Design Process This is a personal piece, rather than creating from collected narratives. Therefore the locket, letters, photographs and diary entries are all my own. The design process started with collecting these souvenirs from a previous relationship or ‘lost love’ and experimenting with how the objects could be applied to create a new fashion artefact. Casting with translucent silicone is a predominant part of my work as it allows the detail of objects to be captured clearly and viewed as if they were still present. I like to re-imagine objects as being absent from their original location, but leaving a lasting impression in the space they once possessed. The locket here felt as if it should still be part of the skin and so I chose to embed it into the leather. Like tattoos, the memories from the relationship are captured on the leather/skin and remind the wearer about the relationship, both happy and sad times. The design and making process allowed me to rethink the ending of the relationship and acted as a therapeutic cathartic exercise remembering why choices were made, but how they have shaped who I have become. Making Process The leather was decorated with old photographs and excerpts by using acetone printing, where by a reverse image is placed face down on the leather, then acetone is painted on and rubbed through to create the print. This gives a distressed finish depending on how hard or regular the paper is rubbed. Traditional leather craft technique of wet moulding natural vegetable tanned leather to form the shape of the piece. It is then left to dry and set into place. The leather is finished using traditional edge burnishing techniques and <b>carnauba</b> crème <b>wax</b> finishing. The locket was cast using a platinum cure silicone and a spherical mould. The locket was suspended just on the surface of the silicone to give the front half impression. The bezel of the locket remains as an idea of what once was there. The silicone mould was then secured in place by sandwiching between the leather and secured using silicone glue. Using rivets and a buckle and strap to keep the piece in place around the neck finishes the piece...|$|R
