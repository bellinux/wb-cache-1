5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is forced by the English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E
500|$|Irene Kacandes, {{professor}} of German Studies and Comparative Literature at Dartmouth College, calls Rosa's internal monologues apostrophes, or [...] "intrapsychic witnessing", in which [...] "a character {{witnesses to the}} self about the character's own experience". Kacandes points out that Rosa believes {{she would not be}} able to internalise anything if she knew someone was listening. In an apostrophe addressed to Conrad, Rosa remarks, [...] "If you knew I was talking to you I wouldn't be able to talk". But because Rosa is not vocalising her monologues, no one <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her,</b> and she is able to proceed with her self-analysis unhindered. Kacandes says [...] "Rosa imagines an interlocutor and then occupies that place herself." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} effect of the Angels rocking the TARDIS Mulligan and Robertson threw {{themselves}} around the ship's set. The camera's operator then shook the camera in the opposite direction that Mulligan and Robertson threw themselves. The scene wherein the Doctor talks to Sally via a DVD extra was created by writing a conversation, removing Sally's lines, then having David Tennant record his lines. Moffat felt that this one-way filming made the performance more convincing. Moffat initially wrote placeholder dialogue in the script for the scene where the Doctor tells Sally that he <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> in the DVD shop, because he knew the lines that appeared would have to play [...] "double duty later on" [...] and be authentic and fresh both times. Gold called the sequences [...] "the heart of the Chinese puzzle".|$|E

500|$|Later that year, Padukone {{played the}} part of a businessperson who helps Ranbir Kapoor's {{character}} overcome his conflicts in Imtiaz Ali's romantic drama Tamasha. Despite poor financial returns, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com named Padukone's performance as the best by an actress that year, writing that she [...] "is so potent in Tamasha, it’s almost as if you <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> heartbeat across the screen". In her final release of 2015, Padukone reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh in Bajirao Mastani, a historical drama about a tragic extramarital affair. Singh was cast as the maratha general Bajirao I, while Priyanka Chopra and Padukone featured as his first and second wife, respectively. In preparation for the role of the warrior-princess Mastani, Padukone learnt sword-fighting, horse-riding and kalaripayattu. [...] With a revenue of over , Bajirao Mastani proved to be the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. Anupama Chopra found Padukone [...] "riveting" [...] in the film, but Subhash K. Jha while praising her [...] "grace and dignity" [...] thought that she was [...] "way too subtle and silken, and not steely enough as [...] firebrand warrior-princess". The film was showcased at the International Film Festival of India; at the 61st Filmfare Awards, Bajirao Mastani was named Best Film and Padukone received her second Best Actress nomination in that year.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, America's Got Talent, judge Piers Morgan said: [...] "I {{have never}} seen an act, on this show or the British show {{or any of the}} other talent shows in the world, with more {{potential}} than Jackie Evancho. [...] was perfection. Perfection!" [...] Christopher Hahn, General Director of the Pittsburgh Opera, observed: [...] "It's very unusual for a young child to have a voice that sounded so rich and developed." [...] "I thought she was just lovely, sweetly compelling". Hahn particularly praised Evancho's phrasing. Composer Tim Janis commented that Evancho [...] "takes a classical piece and makes it friendly and accessible. ... Her voice is so pure and natural, there's no flaw in it. People say 'I <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> potential coming,' but no, it's here, it's now." [...] Claudia Benack, Assistant Professor of musical theatre at Carnegie Mellon University, said that Evancho [...] "has an unusually adult feel for the repertoire. ... She sings to the important part of the phrase, and then backs off. That's instinctual. ... She takes breaths sometimes where an adult would not, but that's just because she's young and little. ... She sings from the healthy part of her voice." [...] Jia Tolentino of The New Yorker later called Evancho's YouTube audition for AGT [...] "supernaturally blissful", and commented that she delivered [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] with [...] "graceful phrasing, a controlled, slow vibrato, and a tone that resonates impersonally, like a bell." [...] Critic Tim Page, however, wrote that Evancho [...] "has many years of work ahead of her before she becomes any sort of musician." [...] Doctor Clark Rosen, director of the University of Pittsburgh Voice Center, noted that Evancho's talent is made possible by how her brain coordinates her body for singing.|$|E

50|$|El Naddaha {{takes the}} form of stunningly {{beautiful}} woman who appears, as if by chance, to men walking by the Nile at night. The men are usually a pair. The creature calls one by his first name, rendering him speechless, hypnotized, and obedient to her voice which he blindly follows, while the other man is unaffected, and attempts to pull the other back. The creature calls in a soft, sleepy, hypnotizing voice until the second unaffected man succeeds at last in reviving the called man from his trance. The two run away as fast as they <b>can,</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>her</b> voice still echoing as they run.|$|R

60|$|This form of {{consciousness}} is established at conception, and continues long after birth. Nay, it continues all life long. But the particular interchange of dynamic consciousness {{between mother and}} child suffers no interruption at birth. It continues almost the same. The child has no conception whatsoever of the mother. It cannot see her, for its eye has no focus. It <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her,</b> because hearing needs no transmission into concept, but it has no oral notion of sounds. It knows her. But only by a form of vital dynamic correspondence, a sort of magnetic interchange. The idea does not intervene at all.|$|E

She has issued underclothes all around from the slop-chest, and is {{ordering}} them to take a bath in the rain-water just caught. And to make sure of their thoroughness in the matter, she has told off Louis and the steward to supervise the operation. Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after- room. And, to cap everything, they are to scrub walls, ceiling, everything, and then start to-morrow morning at painting. All of which serves to convince me almost that mutiny does not obtain and that I have imagined it.|$|E
