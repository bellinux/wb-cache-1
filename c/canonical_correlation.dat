25|$|As {{a result}} of this semi-classical idea, many {{numerical}} computations were done based on the percolation picture. On top of the classical percolation phase transition, quantum tunneling was included in computer simulations to calculate the critical exponent of the `semi-classical percolation phase transition'. To compare this result with the measured critical exponent, the Fermi-liquid approximation was used, where the Coulomb interactions between electrons are assumed to be finite. Under this assumption, the ground state of the free electron gas can be adiabatically transformed into the ground state of the interacting system and this gives rise to an inelastic scattering length so that the <b>canonical</b> <b>correlation</b> length exponent can be compared to the measured critical exponent.|$|E

The asymptotic distributions of the <b>canonical</b> <b>correlations</b> have been studied extensively when the dimensions q and p are fixed and the sample size N tends toward infinity. However, these approximations worsen when q or p is large in comparison to N. To overcome this weakness, this paper first derives asymptotic distributions of the <b>canonical</b> <b>correlations</b> under a high-dimensional framework such that q is fixed, m=n−p→∞ and c=p/n→c 0 ∈[0, 1), assuming that x 1 and x 2 have a joint (q+p) -variate normal distribution.
