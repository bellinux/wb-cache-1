40|$|Farm tenancy in Iowa is a live {{question}} because already, {{a large percentage}} <b>of</b> the <b>farms</b> <b>of</b> the state are operated by tenants and {{because there has been}} a rapid increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> <b>rented</b> from year to year. The opinion is quite generally held that one can tell a <b>rented</b> <b>farm</b> by its dilapidated buildings, poor crops and worn out land. It is also quite generally believed that {{there is something wrong with}} the existing system <b>of.</b> <b>farm</b> leases as a whole. The fact is that many of the best managed and most successful farms are operated by tenants and in general it may be stated that out of experience have come several methods of leasing which seem to provide for good farming and a fair division of returns between the land owner and tenant. These general facts were brought out in an investigation prompted by the general interest in farm tenancy and the rapid increase <b>of</b> <b>rented</b> <b>farms</b> operated by year to year tenants. Director C. F. Curtiss of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment station planned to undertake this investigation and secured the cooperation of the United States Department of Agriculture in an effort to get at the truth about farm tenancy and to determine what constitutes a satisfactory farm lease. In other words, the purpose of the investigation was to learn what the landlord and tenant each should furnish and what each should receive in a lease which calls for profitable farming and a fair division <b>of</b> the <b>farm</b> returns...|$|R

50|$|Farm {{control and}} {{ownership}} {{has traditionally been}} a key indicator of status and power, especially in Medieval European agrarian societies. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> ownership has historically been closely linked to form of government. Medieval feudalism was essentially a system that centralized <b>control</b> <b>of</b> farmland, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> labor and political power, while the early American democracy, in which land ownership was a prerequisite for voting rights, was built on relatively easy paths to individual farm ownership. However, the gradual modernization and mechanization <b>of</b> <b>farming,</b> which greatly increases both the efficiency and capital requirements <b>of</b> <b>farming,</b> has led to increasingly large farms. This has usually been accompanied by the decoupling of political power from farm ownership.|$|R

50|$|Among {{the early}} rules of {{governance}} tenants {{were required to}} attend two divine services each day in the cathedral and must not be absent from the cathedral close {{for more than a}} month in each year. When the charity was first established the selection of the tenant widows was the responsibility of Bishop Ward, on his death the task fell alternately to the bishop and the dean and chapter. Over the intervening centuries the charity has benefited from the wills of various individuals, for example, William Benson Earle who left 2000 guineas in 1796, Thomas Henry Allen Poynder from Hartham Park in Corsham gave 1,000 guineas in 1865, Helen Nevill, who bequeathed £1,000 in 1929 and Mary Fletcher, who bequeathed £1,500 in 1953. The College of Matrons also derived income from various property rents in Middlesex, London, Sussex, Cambridgeshire and Berkshire; in 1883 these rents totalled about £28 per year. However, by the end of the 19th century many <b>of</b> these <b>farm</b> <b>rents</b> had been redeemed and by 1958 the charity was only receiving £13 per year from <b>farm</b> <b>rents.</b>|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the influence of extension contact on <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> land degradation among yam farmers. Eight rural communities were randomly selected for the study. From the eight communities one hundred and twenty (120) yam farmers were randomly drawn to compose the sample. Data were collected by use of structured interview schedule and analysed by mean, Chi square test and Pearson r. It was found that majority of the farmers were old (M = 47. 77) and below secondary education (M = 9. 41). The mean number of extension contact had by the farmers was 3. 93. The yam farmers agreed that land degradation could cause famine (M = 2. 78), low yam yield (M = 2. 71), low quality of yam (M= 3. 14), and tussle and pressure on available land M = 2. 51). There was a positive and significant relationship between extension contact and perception of the effects <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> land degradation on yam production (r = 0. 87). There were significant relationships between number of extension contacts, and mulching (X 2 = 60. 25, r = 0. 71); organic manure application (X 2 = 55. 03, r = 0. 68); and avoidance of bush burning (X 2 = 86. 40, r = 0. 85).

50|$|The {{laws are}} widely held {{to have been}} discriminatory {{measures}} specifically targeting the Japanese, spurred by fears about {{the increasing number of}} Japanese immigrants settling in California.

Disease control has been achieved by monitoring the herds and flocks, eliminating infected animals, and diversifying animals (animals and products are processed differently depending on Salmonella status) and animal food products according to the determined risk. In 2001, the Danish society saved U. S. $ 25. 5 million by controlling Salmonella. The total annual Salmonella control costs in year 2001 were U. S. $ 14. 1 million (U. S. $ 0. 075 /kg of pork and U.

Of 160 samples of food, drinking water, feathers, droppings or dust collected during experimental infection, 103 were positive using a M. gallisepticum-specific PCR (MG-PCR) and 68 were positive using a PCR (mycoplasma-PCR) that detects all species of the genera Mycoplasma, Spiroplasma, Acholeplasma and Ureaplasma. Six of these samples were also positive by culture.
