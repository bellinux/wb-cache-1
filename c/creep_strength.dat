Second-generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines for the F-15 and F-16, whereas the newer single-crystal third-generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the F-22 and F-35 engines. Rhenium is also used in the superalloys, such as CMSX-4 (2nd gen) and CMSX-10 (3rd gen) that are used in industrial gas turbine engines like the GE 7FA. Rhenium can cause superalloys to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable TCP (topologically close packed) phases. In 4th- and 5th-generation superalloys, ruthenium is used to avoid this effect. Among others the new superalloys are EPM-102 (with 3% Ru) and TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), as well as TMS-138 and TMS-174.|$|E

Compressive testing at 1300 K of such materials densified by 1505 K extrusion or isostatic pressing at 1323 K or 1623 K indicated that strength at relatively fast strain rates ($GR 10 - 7 s- 1) is slightly dependent on the method of consolidation. At slower rates, however, no clear dependency on densification technique appears to exist, and four different consolidation methods possessed similar <b>creep</b> <b>strengths.</b> In all cases deformation at 1300 K occurred by two distinct mechanisms: at high strain rates the stress exponent is greater than 11 while at slower rates (< 10 - 7 s- 1) a much lower stress exponent (approximately 6) was found.

In the present study, a brachial plexus injury model was established in rabbits using the C 6 root avulsion method. A suspension of human amniotic epithelial cells was repeatedly injected over an area 4. 0 mm lateral to the cephal and caudal ends of the C 6 brachial plexus injury site (1 × 10 6 cells/mL, 3 μL/injection, 25 injections) immediately after the injury.

The curing process is by condensation and a typical figure for Redux Liquid 775/Powder 775 is 30 minutes at 145 °C (293 °F) under a pressure of 100 lbf/in2 (690 kPa).

50|$|A major {{challenge}} facing turbine design is reducing the creep that is {{induced by the}} high temperatures. Because of the stresses of operation, turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms. As temperatures are increased {{in an effort to}} improve turbine efficiency, creep becomes more significant. To limit creep, thermal coatings and superalloys with solid-solution strengthening and grain boundary strengthening are used in blade designs. Protective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit oxidation. These coatings are often stabilized zirconium dioxide-based ceramics. Using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy. This reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade. Oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup {{on the outside of the}} blades, which is especially important in the high-temperature environment. The nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance. The microstructure of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition. A uniform dispersion of the gamma-prime phase - a combination of nickel, aluminum, and titanium - promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure. Refractory elements such as rhenium and ruthenium can be added to the alloy to improve <b>creep</b> <b>strength.</b> The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase, thus preserving the fatigue resistance, strength, and creep resistance.|$|E

40|$|Brittle {{deformation}} of oceanic lithosphere due to thermal stress is explored with a numerical model, {{with an emphasis}} on the spacing of fracture zones. Brittle deformation is represented by localized plastic strain within a material having an elasto-visco-plastic rheology with strain softening. We show that crustal thickness, <b>creep</b> <b>strength,</b> and the rule governing plastic flow control the formation of cracks. The spacing of primary crack decreases with crustal thickness {{as long as it is}} smaller than a threshold value. <b>Creep</b> <b>strength</b> shifts the threshold such that crust with strong <b>creep</b> <b>strength</b> develops primary cracks regardless of crustal thicknesses, while only a thin crust can have primary cracks if its <b>creep</b> <b>strength</b> is low.

The effect of a post-cure cycle on the compliance and <b>creep</b> rupture <b>strength</b> of composite materials is discussed. The Zhurkov type failure law is applied to experimental creep rupture data of a typical laminate and is shown to correlate the data. A beneficial mechanical strengthening effect is described which significantly affects the failure strengths of specimens which have been under creep loading {{for a period of}} time. This aging effect is reversible if the specimen is allowed to recover before being loaded to failure. Other environmental aspects of composite materials are also reviewed...|$|R
