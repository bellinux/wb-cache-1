40|$|During {{the past}} decade EU {{competition}} policy has had a clear focus: to punish and deter. The European Commission has increasingly imposed high fines and improved its leniency programme aimed at destabilizing cartels. However, enforcement {{with a focus on}} detection and punishment is costly and the administrative procedure is burdensome on both the undertakings under investigation and the Commission. Consequently, two formal procedures were introduced with a view to streamlining the administrative procedure and ensuring a swift solution through ‘negotiation’: the <b>commitments</b> procedure <b>and</b> the <b>settlement</b> procedure. In principle these two procedures should work to the advantage of both the Commission and the undertakings. All parties want the procedure to be fast and simple, without the need for appeal, although their underlying motives and interests differ. However, even assuming that these two procedures are in fact more efficient, the negative implications of (over) using these procedures can be substantial. First, the <b>commitments</b> <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures may directly affect the procedural safeguards and rights of defence that ought to be attributed to the undertakings concerned. Second, the <b>commitments</b> <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures may indirectly affect the overall effectiveness of the Commission’s competition law enforcement. In order to assess the effects of these two procedures on competition law enforcement, this research is based on two perspectives: (i) a micro perspective, evaluating the use of the <b>commitments</b> <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures to end investigations efficiently and the effect they will have {{on the rights of the}} undertakings; and (ii) a macro perspective, which will put the <b>commitments</b> <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures into a broader context and will evaluate the impact of these procedures on the overall competition law enforcement policy of the Commission. These two perspectives will form the basis for the conclusion, which will consist of a recommendation for a holistic approach towards this negotiated enforcement, which in essence will constitute a balancing act. status: publishe...|$|R

While it would seem that China will have extraordinarily open markets for these services by 2007 (and for banking, perhaps in the world), the starting point for implementing these policy changes seems so highly restricted that doubts have been raised about the feasibility of implementing such changes over such a short time even if threats of eventual retaliation from WTO partners speeds things along. WTO members are monitoring the implementation of China's WTO <b>commitments,</b> <b>and</b> following dispute <b>settlement</b> might retaliate in the future were these agreed changes not to be implemented.

40|$|The Kantian peace {{research}} program has produced generally robust {{results on the}} role of democracy and international trade in reducing the risk of international conflict. Yet a key theoretical linkage in the Kantian argument, that of international governmental organizations (IGOs) to peace, has proved less robust and more problematic. We propose a new theoretical perspective focusing on the contributions of a particular kind of IGO that composed largely of democracies to peaceful conflict resolution through aiding credible <b>commitments,</b> dispute <b>settlement,</b> <b>and</b> socialization to peaceful behavior. A set of statistical tests provides strong support for our hypotheses that such densely democratic IGOs {{are far more likely to}} engender peaceful relations between members than are more homogenous IGOs. This is true when controlling for regime type, interdependence, and several realist-oriented influences. The peace-inducing influences affect both democratic and nondemocratic member states.

The conceptual and operational definitions of the variables were ascertained from prior research. The {{reliability and validity of}} collected data were tested by various methods and hypotheses are tested by a moderated regression analysis. The results are as follows. First, the moderating variables on the relationship between <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> transportation services are identified as internal orientation and market orientation. The former has three sub-dimensions such as collaboration between departments, work standardization and process improving and the latter has three sub-dimensions such as intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination, and responsiveness.

A model of job satisfaction, organizational <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention is developed and tested in one field study. In this study, using a 250 employees of a Turkish manufacturing company, were given questionnaires to complete during regular working hours; 188 completed questionnaires were returned [...] Job satisfaction, organizational <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention are popular topics in the study of work related attitudes.

Although employee <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> {{job satisfaction}} have been studied extensively, their links with organisational performance have not often been considered.
