25|$|DNA profiling, {{based on}} typing {{individual}} highly variable minisatellites {{in the human}} genome, was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985, with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many minisatellites simultaneously. By focusing on {{just a few of}} these highly variable minisatellites, DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal <b>case</b> <b>work</b> and paternity testing worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show (roughly 8 years), Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD. Though he hasn't been cured of many of them, if any at all, {{he has been able to}} put them in the back of his mind when {{involved}} in <b>case</b> <b>work.</b> His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy", when Adrian is locked in a car trunk with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival, Harold Krenshaw. During the terrifying trip, both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia (fear of small spaces), as well as their own differences, resulting in them becoming friends. Possibly due to this, as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years, he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Badge". Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially, Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn't mean that he would be happier. In a session with Dr. Bell, Monk realizes he was always happy as a private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss. After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer window-washer, Monk turns in his badge. In the series finale, he learns that his late wife, Trudy, had given birth to a daughter before they had met. The knowledge and events of the episode lead to positive changes in his personality.|$|E

It was claimed by Roddenberry that Nimoy said he was unwilling to return to television as Spock. However, Nimoy said that the first offer Roddenberry gave was a contract for the pilot of the new series, and then guaranteed appearances in two out of every 11 episodes thereafter, which Nimoy rejected. At the time, Nimoy had undertaken a legal challenge against Paramount related to the Heineken adverts and Roddenberry had refused to support his <b>case.</b> <b>Work</b> began on a replacement Vulcan, Xon, with David Gautreaux cast. Production gradually changed {{to the creation of}} a feature film over the course of five months in 1977.

This followed a high-profile inquiry headed by Lord Denning into the Portland Spy Ring, which resulted in the conviction of [...] five people who had been spying within the Royal Navy for the Soviets.

[...] In February 1968 MI5 received a tip that an RAF serviceman was offering information to the Soviet GRU intelligence service and after initial <b>case</b> <b>work</b> was completed, in July the RAF became involved. As head of RAF counterintelligence, Innes led the hunt and identified Chief Technician Douglas Britten (born 31 October 1931, died Feb 1990), an RAF signals intelligence specialist serving at No. 399 Signals Unit at RAF Digby and also at a listening station in Cyprus which cooperated with Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Innes’s team arrested Britten on 13 September 1968. Searches of Britten’s home and other locations yielded spying equipment including some supplied by the Soviet Intelligence Service. Britten confessed and stood trial at the Central Criminal Court, receiving a sentence of 21 years imprisonment.|$|E
