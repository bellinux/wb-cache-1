CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9.

25|$|Although {{the terms}} direct and {{indirect}} bilirubin are used equivalently with conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, this is not quantitatively correct, because the direct fraction includes both <b>conjugated</b> <b>bilirubin</b> and δ bilirubin (bilirubin covalently bound to albumin, which appears in serum when hepatic excretion of <b>conjugated</b> <b>bilirubin</b> is impaired in patients with hepatobiliary disease). Furthermore, direct bilirubin tends to overestimate <b>conjugated</b> <b>bilirubin</b> levels due to unconjugated bilirubin that has reacted with diazosulfanilic acid, leading to increased azobilirubin levels (and increased direct bilirubin).|$|E
25|$|Unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinaemia}} in {{a newborn}} {{can lead to}} accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions {{that may lead to}} hyperbilirubinaemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of <b>conjugated</b> <b>bilirubin</b> in the faeces (this is largely why the faeces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the <b>conjugated</b> <b>bilirubin</b> is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation.|$|E
40|$|AIM: Test {{the ability}} of adult-derived human liver stem/progenitor cells (ADHLSC) from large scale {{cultures}} to <b>conjugate</b> <b>bilirubin</b> in vitro and in bilirubin conjugation deficient rat. METHODS: ADHLSC from large scale cultures were tested for their phenotype and for their capacity to <b>conjugate</b> <b>bilirubin</b> in vitro after hepatogenic differentiation. In vivo, Gunn rats [uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1 A 1 (UGT 1 A 1) deficient animal] were injected with ADHLSC and cryopreserved hepatocytes (positive control). Two, 4, 13 and 27 wk posttransplantation,transplanted Gunn rat bilirubin serum levels were determined by High performance liquid chromatography (HLPC). Human cell engraftment of transplanted cells was assessed 27 wk post-transplantation using immunohistochemistry and RTqPCR. RESULTS: large scale culture conditions do not modified ADHLSC phenotype, ADHLSC were able to specifically <b>conjugate</b> <b>bilirubin.</b> ADHLSC were intraportally injected into Gunn rats and blood UCB was measured at different times post-transplantation, infused-Gunn rats exhibited a metabolic effect 3 mo post-transplantation and maintained over a 6 mo period. ADHLSC engraftment into Gunn rat’s liver was demonstrated by RTqPCR and immunohistochemistry against albumin and UGT 1 A 1. CONCLUSION: ADHLSC from large scale cultures are efficient in <b>conjugating</b> <b>bilirubin</b> in vitro and in restoring a deficient metabolic function (reducing bilirubin level) in hyperbilirubinemic rats...|$|R

Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase in urine urobilinogen. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{structure of the}} major <b>conjugate</b> of <b>bilirubin</b> was unequivocally elucidated by structural analysis. The <b>conjugated</b> <b>bilirubins</b> were first separated from the lipid components of human duodenal aspirates or dog gall-bladder bile, and then resolved by t. l. c. {{into a series of}} tetrapyrroles. The major tetrapyrrole was then converted into its more stable dipyrrolic azo derivative for further analysis. The conjugated moiety of the azopigment was characterized after methanolysis with sodium methoxide. This reaction yields two types of product, those soluble in water and those soluble in organic solvents. The organic-soluble fraction was shown by t. l. c. and mass spectrometry to contain the methyl esters of the dipyrrolic azo derivatives of bilirubin. The water-soluble materials were analysed by enzymic procedures, t. l. c., n. m. r. spectrometry and combined g. l. c. and mass spectrometry. This analysis showed that the only water-soluble product resulting from the methanolysis was glucuronic acid. The structure was identical with that of pure standards, on both mass spectrometry and n. m. r. spectroscopy. No contaminating moieties were found. Quantitative measurement indicated that the glucuronic acid had been released in a 1 : 1 molar ratio with the resulting methyl esters of the dipyrrolic azo derivatives of bilirubin. This unequivocally establishes bilirubin diglucuronide as the major pigment present in bile. Past problems with identification of bilirubin diglucuronide were shown to originate from procedures which resulted in incomplete separation and isolation of the azopigments of the <b>conjugated</b> <b>bilirubins,</b> owing to contamination by biliary lipids...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that biliary secretion is rate-limiting for the plasma-to-bile transport of a saturating load of bilirubin. Previous studies from this laboratory have suggested {{a relationship between}} the hepatic bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase activity and the apparent maximal rate of bilirubin secretion (excretory transport maximum). The present study was undertaken to further investigate this relationship in rats {{with a wide range of}} transferase levels and to analyze the effects of transferase activity on the formation of bilirubin monoglucuronides and diglucuronides in vivo and in vitro. Animals with moderately decreased enzyme activity still showed a near-normal excretory transport maximum but decreased fractional amounts of <b>conjugated</b> <b>bilirubins</b> in plasma and liver and a decreased ratio of bilirubins diconjugates to monoconjugates in bile, liver, and plasma. A more pronounced decrease in the level of transferase activity yielded lower excretory transport maximum values as well. Enhanced transferase activities were obtained by pretreatment with a series of enzyme-inducing agents, usually at dosages not influencing bile flow. An enhanced transferase activity produced significant increases in bilirubin excretory transport maximum, decreased concentrations of both unconjugated and <b>conjugated</b> <b>bilirubins</b> in plasma, and an increased ratio of diconjugates to monoconjugates in bile and in liver. In all animals, the ratio of disconjugates to monoconjugates observed in bile was correlated with the ratio found after incubation of liver homogenates in vitro at low concentrations of bilirubin substrate. Overall, the relationship between bilirubin excretory transport maximum and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase activity can best be described by a hyperbolic curve. At "saturation" of the excretory transport maximum values, no increase of conjugates in liver or in plasma could be observed, suggesting that not the biliary secretion, per se, but rather the conjugation rate in vivo is rate-limiting. The latter seems lower than the in vitro assayed enzyme activity. The present investigations point to an equilibration of bilirubin pigments between plasma, liver, and bile. The in vivo conjugation rate can be estimated from the in vitro assay (but not at high enzyme activities) and determines the maximal biliary secretion rate, the ratio of diconjugates to monoconjugates in the three compartments studied, and the relative amount of conjugates in plasma. Our studies suggest that the conjugation rate in vivo rather than the biliary secretion step is the major determinant of the maximal bilirubin secretion rate. status: publishe...|$|R
