40|$|Carbapenems are a {{class of}} {{antibiotics}} used for life-threatening and multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. The penicillin agents, cephalosporins, and carbapenems (β-lactam antibiotics) are structurally related, with a bi-cyclic core structure known as the β-lactam ring. This chemical entity is responsible for <b>cross-hypersensitivity</b> reactions, the most common adverse effect associated with these antibiotics. The frequency of carbapenem-as-sociated hypersensitivity {{in the general population}} is es-timated to be less than 3 %, with higher instances in peni-cillin-allergic patients. 1 Reported penicillin allergies vary among patients, with the most severe reaction classified as a type 1 reac-tion mediated through immunoglobulin E antibodies. The reaction can be immediate and is characterized a...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of individuals allergic to latex, exhibiting <b>cross-hypersensitivity</b> with plant-derived food has been frequently reported as the so-called latex-fruit syndrome. Nonetheless, molecular mechanisms underlying allergy to latex and/or fruit are poorly understood. The aims {{of this study}} were to identify candidate genes that may be associated with the pathogenesis of allergy to latex and/or vegetable food, and to assess if similar molecular pathways are involved in both types of hypersensitivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA microarray analysis was performed to screen the molecular profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with allergy to latex, to fruit, or with latex-fruit syndrome, and from control healthy subjects. RESULTS: Molecular profiling identified an overlapping dataset of genes commonly regulated in all the atopic patients enrolled in this study, suggesting that similar molecular mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of allergy to the fruit and/or latex. Several regulators of the innate and acquired immunity reported to polarize the immunological response towards a Th 2 -mediated immune response were overexpressed in the patients. Evidences suggested that the expression of T-regulatory cells might be defective in allergic patients, as a consequence of a dysregulation of some inflammatory cytokines. Finally, several transcription factors that may be responsible for the Th 1 /Th 2 imbalance were modulated in allergic patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified relevant genes that may help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying allergic disease. Knowledges of critical targets, along with transcription factors regulating gene activity may facilitate the development of new therapeutic option...|$|E
