5000|$|The {{photo on}} the right shows the axle {{attaching}} the limb to cam is mounted {{at the edge of}} the cam as opposed to the center. As the string is drawn the <b>cam</b> <b>turns</b> and imparts force to compress the limb. Initially, the archer has the 'short' side of the cam, with the leverage being a mechanical disadvantage. High energy input is therefore required. When near full draw is reached, the <b>cam</b> has <b>turned</b> to its full extent, the archer has gained mechanical advantage, and the least amount of force needs to be applied to the string to keep the limbs bent. This is known as [...] "let off". The lower holding weight enables the archer to maintain the bow fully drawn and take more time to aim. This let-off enables the archer to accurately shoot a compound bow with a much higher peak draw weight than other bows (see below).|$|R

50|$|Unlike later {{mechanical}} shutters {{such as the}} Compur {{which use}} a clockwork mechanism, shutter timing is achieved by releasing air from a small cylinder typically mounted horizontally {{at the top of}} the shutter through a small aperture. A <b>cam</b> <b>turned</b> by the shutter speed dial positions a piston in the cylinder to provide the correct exposure. When the shutter release is pressed the shutter opens and air in the cylinder is gradually released, letting the piston move; it closes the shutter when it reaches the end of its travel. The piston travels for a very short distance at the higher speeds, making their accuracy very sensitive to the precise manufacturing of the cam; lower speeds are more reliably accurate.|$|R
40|$|Development of a {{servo-control}} {{system for}} a voice coil actuated direct drive used in turning of automotive camshafts is presented.

Reduced inertia, however, makes the system more sensitive to the external forces acting on the drive, and may lead to chatter during cutting. High dynamic stiffness must be established by the control system to minimize the effects of the additional dynamics intro-duced by the machining process. This work presents a systematic approach to design of local acceleration feedback to increase the dynamic stiffness of the drive. An acceleration loop is added to the drive’s servo-controller, that consists of an aggressive position feedback and a feedforward controller, resulting in a five-fold im-provement in the system’s performance. ...|$|R

50|$|The Type 86S design {{departs from}} the usual AK-47 in several ways. The trigger-sear-hammer group is housed in a rear {{extension}} of the receiver, well behind the pistol grip. The operating mechanism {{is exactly the same}} as in the standard AK-47/AKM, {{with the exception of a}} connecting rod between the trigger and sear. The selector switch/safety is quite different from the sheet metal lever found on the standard AK-47/AKM. The Type 86S selector/safety is thumb-shaped and located on the right side of the receiver, directly above the pistol grip. The cocking handle is located under the carrying handle. A vertical, spring-loaded, plastic folding fore grip is mounted on the front of the receiver. When not in use, it folds forward beneath the barrel. The magazine well is located to the rear of the pistol grip and will accept 10-, 20-, and 30-round magazines as well as drum magazines. The rear sight is an aperture/peep sight mounted on a <b>cam.</b> <b>Turning</b> the adjustment knob sets the rear sight for 100-, 200-, or 300-meter ranges.

50|$|A {{disturbed}} area {{of weather}} {{to the south}} of Hong Kong in the South China Sea became more organized early on September 23, and the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system.

The depression gradually intensified, becoming Tropical Storm Cam on September 24. Later that day, the storm reached its peak winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). Around this time, <b>Cam's</b> motion gradually <b>turned</b> towards the north.

50|$|Another {{initiative}} was the Center for Advanced Materials (<b>CAM).</b> In <b>turn,</b> {{this led to}} the establishment of the Center for X-Ray Optics (CXRO), the world's first research facility devoted to specialise in the use of soft x-rays and extreme ultraviolet light known as XUV. As it turned out, these are ideal for manipulating the atoms and molecules on materials' surfaces, where most chemical reactions take place. In 1984, Shirley proposed the construction of the Advanced Light Source, a synchrotron optimized to produce XUV. Not everyone saw the value in it, but the scientific case was sound, and Shirley eventually secured $100 million of funding from the Secretary of Energy, John S. Herrington.

The TL-R took aim at Ducati's 916 both in the Superbike Championship and in consumer sales. The R shares basic engine architecture with the S but has special components including forged pistons, stronger connecting rods, and a much stiffer frame while retaining the motors 90° V-twin for perfect primary balance and had hybrid chain/gear driven cams.

30|$|For example, to {{standardize}} {{the handling of}} PRF exudate (PRFexu), in a previous study [18], we developed a compression device and proposed {{the use of this}} device to create a PRF membrane with uniform thickness and to minimize loss of PRFexu assuming that PRFexu contains significant amounts of important growth factors for wound healing. As a result of this comparative study using an ex vivo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (<b>CAM)</b> assay, it <b>turned</b> out that growth factors were distributed both in the exudate portion and in the fibrin network.

40|$|Abstract Background The use of Complementary and Alternative {{medicine}} (CAM) {{has increased}} over the past years. In Germany, many general practitioners (GPs) use CAM in their daily practice. However, {{little is known about}} possible differences of GPs using CAM compared to GPs not using CAM. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore differences in personal and practice characteristics, work load and job satisfaction of GPs depending on their use of and attitude towards CAM. Furthermore, predictors for CAM use should be explored. Methods A questionnaire was developed based on qualitatively derived data. In addition, a validated instrument assessing job satisfaction was included in the questionnaire, which was sent to 3000 randomly selected GPs in Germany. Results 1027 returned the questionnaire of which 737 indicated to use CAM in daily practice. We found that GPs using CAM are more female, younger and have a trend towards a healthier life style. Their practices have higher proportions of privately insured patients and are slightly better technically equipped with ultrasound. GPs with a positive attitude had significant better values within the job satisfaction scale and lower working hours per week compared to GPs with neutral/negative attitude. Significant predictors for CAM use were a positive attitude towards CAM, holding a special qualification in CAM, own CAM use and the availability of an ultrasound in practice. Conclusions The identified differences suggest that those GPs using and believing in CAM have a different medical orientation and approach which in turn may influence their job satisfaction. With this finding <b>CAM</b> use <b>turns</b> out to be a relevant factor regarding job satisfaction and, with this, may be a possible lever to counteract the growing dissatisfaction of GPs in Germany. This finding could also be important for designing strategies to promote the recruitment of young doctors to general practice. </p...|$|R
40|$|BZ Cam is {{the first}} cataclysmic {{variable}} star with an accretion disk wind evident in its optical spectrum. The wind was found by Thorstensen, who discovered intermittent P Cygni profiles occurring simultaneously in He I 5876 Angstroms and H alpha. We have since obtained spectra with 0. 4 -Angstroms/pixel dispersion and 60 -s time resolution. We find a wind much faster and more rapidly variable than the radiatively accelerated winds of OB stars, Wolf-Rayet stars, or luminous blue variables. Instead of showing blob ejection, the whole wind of BZ <b>Cam</b> appears to <b>turn</b> on and off. We use this to measure the acceleration law of a CV wind for the first time. The velocity increases linearly with time, attaining blue edge velocities near - 3000 km/s, and absorption velocities near - 1700 km/s, in 6 to 8 min after starting near rest. We also find a subsequent linear deceleration to nearly rest in 30 to 40 min, perhaps an effect of dilution as the wind expands. No periodicity from rotational outflow is obvious. This wind is erratic and incessantly variable, and perhaps bipolar and face-on, but not highly collimated. The P Cygni absorption events trace out sawtooth waves, occurring within 30 to 40 white dwarf radii from the disk. This is the approximate size of the disk, {{as well as the}} disk/wind transition region recently postulated by Knigge and Drew.

40|$|Short-term {{synaptic}} facilitation {{plays an}} important role in information processing in the central nervous system. Although the crucial requirement of presynaptic Ca 2 + in the expression of this plasticity has been known for decades, the molecular mechanisms underlying the plasticity remain controversial. Here, we show that presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) bind and release Munc 18 - 1 (also known as rbSec 1 /nSec 1), an essential protein for synaptic transmission, in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner, whose actions decrease and increase synaptic vesicle release, respectively. We found that mGluR 4 bound Munc 18 - 1 with an EC 50 for Ca 2 + of 168 nM, close to the resting Ca 2 + concentration, and that the interaction was disrupted by Ca 2 +-activated calmodulin (CaM) at higher concentrations of Ca 2 +. Consistently, the Munc 18 - 1 -interacting domain of mGluR 4 suppressed both dense-core vesicle secretion from permeabilized PC 12 cells and synaptic transmission in neuronal cells. Furthermore, this domain was sufficient to induce paired-pulse facilitation. Obviously, the role of mGluR 4 in these processes was independent of its classical function of activation by glutamate. On the basis of these experimental data, we propose the following model: When neurons are not active, Munc 18 - 1 is sequestered by mGluR 4, and therefore the basal synaptic transmission is kept low. After the action potential, the increase in the Ca 2 + level activates <b>CaM,</b> which in <b>turn</b> liberates Munc 18 - 1 from mGluR 4, causing short-term synaptic facilitation. Our findings unite and provide a new insight into receptor signaling and vesicular transport, which are pivotal activities involved in a variety of cellular processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is {{increasingly}} popular with cancer patients and yet information provision or discussion about CAM by health professionals remains low. Previous {{research suggests that}} patients may fear clinicians' 'disapproval' if they raise the subject of <b>CAM,</b> and <b>turn</b> to other sources to acquire information about CAM. However, little empirical {{research has been conducted}} into how cancer patients acquire, and, more importantly evaluate CAM information before deciding which CAM therapies to try. Methods Qualitative study, comprising semi-structured interviews with 43 male cancer patients of varying ages, cancer type and stage of illness, 34 of whom had used CAM. They were recruited from a range of NHS and non-NHS settings in Bristol, England. Results As a result of the lack of CAM information from health professionals, men in this study became either 'pro-active seekers' or 'passive recipients' of such information. Their main information resource was the 'lay referral' network of family, friends and acquaintances, especially females. 'Traditional' information sources, including books, magazines, leaflets and the media were popular, more so in fact than the internet. Views on the internet ranged from enthusiasm or healthy scepticism through to caution or disinterest. CAM information was generally regarded as 'empowering' as it broadened treatment and self-care options. A minority of participants were information averse fearing additional choices that might disrupt their fragile ability to cope. There was general consensus that CAM information should be available via the NHS, to give it a 'stamp of approval', which combined with guidance from informed health professionals, could help patients to make 'guided' choices. However, a small minority of these men valued the independence of CAM from the NHS and deliberately sought 'alternative' information sources and treatment options. Men were selective in identifying particular therapies to use and sceptical about others, basing their choices on forms of 'evidence' that were personally meaningful: personal stories of individuals who had been helped by CAM; the long history and enduring popularity of some therapies; the plausibility of the mechanism of action; a belief or trust in individual therapies or their providers; scientific evidence. Scientific evidence ranked low in the men's personal decision-making about CAM, while it was recognised as important for NHS support for CAM. Conclusion These male cancer patients valued the support and guidance of 'trusted individuals' in making choices about CAM. Trusted health professionals could also {{play a significant role in}} helping patients to make informed choices. Any such dialogue must, however, acknowledge the different standards of evidence used by patients and clinicians to evaluate the benefits or otherwise of CAM therapies. Such open communication could help to foster an environment of mutual trust where patients are encouraged to discuss their interest in CAM, rather than perpetuate covert, undisclosed use of CAM with its attendant potential hazards. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of "integrative health care" (IHC) settings combining {{various aspects of}} Western biomedicine and complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) is a relatively recent phenomenon among biomedical and CAM professions. While IHC is recognised internationally and occurs in many different contexts (e. g. clinic or hospital), patterns of interaction between biomedical and CAM practitioners, {{and the nature of}} IHC settings, are largely unknown. This paper presents findings from a research study of two newly established IHC settings in Canada. The main research question was: how are biomedical and CAM practitioners integrating or not integrating with each other at the level of professional interaction in IHC settings? Using a case study design, in-depth interviews were conducted with 13 biomedical and eight CAM practitioners during 2002 - 2003, and ethnographic observation and document analysis was conducted at each site. Drawing from closure theory of the professions, comparative analysis of the sites revealed that biomedical practitioners enact patterns of exclusionary and demarcationary closure, in addition to the use of "esoteric knowledge", by: (a) dominating patient charting, referrals and diagnostic tests; (b) regulating CAM practitioners to a specific "sphere of competence"; (c) appropriating certain CAM techniques from less powerful CAM professions; and (d) using biomedical language as the primary mode of communication. <b>CAM</b> practitioners, in <b>turn,</b> perform usurpationary closure strategies, by: (a) employing their own "esoteric knowledge" in relation to biomedicine and other CAM professions; (b) appropriating biomedical language and terminology; (c) increasing their professional status by working with biomedicine; and (d) referring among CAM practitioners to increase patient flow. The findings suggest that when attempts are made to integrate biomedicine and CAM, dominant biomedical patterns of professional interaction continue to exist. Despite continued patterns of social closure, biomedical and CAM practitioners continue to provide a certain form of integrative care that may be of benefit to patients, albeit not as integrative as current models of integration would prefer.

5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and cloth curtains are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the take-up spool in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting control cam) has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not disengage. To drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two twist-lock <b>cams</b> that <b>turn</b> and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for lining-up of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the frame count and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing frame spacing issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame counter system, tied to the counter roller, operates the automatic reset of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis of CD 4 + T {{cells and}} their {{eventual}} depletion constitute {{a hallmark of}} HIV infection and disease progression. However, monocytes/macrophages unlike CD 4 + T cells survive HIV replication and hence represent a major reservoir of virus. The mechanism underlying this resistance to HIV-mediated apoptosis in monocytic cells is not clear. It is believed that TNF-alpha which is produced during HIV infection may {{play a major role}} in inducing resistance in monocytes. In this study I investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of resistance to HIV-Vpr induced apoptosis in monocytic cells. LPS and LPS induced TNF-alpha are known to induce resistance to monocyte apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism regulating this process is not known. cIAP 2, one of the anti-apoptotic genes is known to be induced in monocytes in response to LPS. First of all, I demonstrated that LPS and TNF-alpha induced survival of human monocytic cells through the induction of the c-IAP 2 gene. Further, I studied the involvement of MAPKs and PI 3 K signaling pathways in c-IAP 2 induction by using specific pharmacological inhibitors. My results suggest that neither MAPKs nor PI 3 K is involved in c-IAP 2 induction. Since calcium signaling pathway is considered to be one of the upstream signaling molecules in signaling cascade, I investigated its involvement in c-IAP 2 induction in monocytic cell line. I showed that binding of LPS/TNF-alpha to their respective receptors induces calcium influx. Calcium is also known to activate calmodulin (<b>CaM)</b> which in <b>turn</b> activates various kinases and phosphatases. My results revealed that activation of CaM and CaM kinase II (CAMKII) is involved in c-IAP 2 induction, whereas calcineurin, the protein phosphatase activated by CaM is not involved in this process. I have shown for the first time that LPS/TNF-alpha induced c-IAP 2 and associated anti-apoptotic activity is regulated by CaM/CAMKII through the activation of NFkappaB. Since TNF-alpha is believed to be involved in inducing resistance to HIV induced apoptosis in monocytes, further I used Vpr, one of the HIV proteins to induce apoptosis in monocytes. My results showed that HIV-Vpr induces apoptosis in monocytes and pretreatment of cells with either LPS/TNF-alpha induces resistance to Vpr mediated apoptosis. To determine the molecular mechanisms involved in Vpr induced apoptosis, I used the C-terminal synthetic peptide (Vpr 52 - 96) which mimics the whole Vpr protein for induction of apoptosis. I also used the N-terminal (Vpr 1 - 45 aa) peptide as control. I demonstrated that both the C-terminal and N-terminal peptides phosphorylate all the three MAPKs such as p 38, ERK, and JNK MAPK; however, only C-terminal (Vpr 52 - 96) peptide induced apoptosis is regulated selectively by JNK MAPK. To determine the involvement of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in Vpr induced apoptosis, RNAse protection assay was performed. My results revealed that in response to Vpr 52 - 96, there was downregulation of Bc 12, whereas other pro and anti-apoptotic genes of Bc 12 family remained unchanged. I also demonstrated the involvement of c-IAP 1, one of the inhibitor of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) in Vpr induced apoptosis. My results show that Vpr peptide-induced apoptosis is mediated by down regulation of anti-apoptosic Bc 12 and c-IAP 1 genes through JNK MAPK activation. Deregulation of the JNK pathway has been implicated in cancer and other diseases. Therefore, investigation of the molecular mechanisms that govern the role of the JNK pathway in apoptosis should provide insight into its biological functions and strategies to target this pathway for prevention and treatment of human diseases and cancer. Finally, I demonstrated that pretreatment of cells with LPS or TNF-alpha induced resistance to Vpr 52 - 96 mediated apoptosis. My results suggest that LPS induced resistance is mediated by endogenous production of TNF-alpha in monocytes. I also demonstrated that LPS/TNF-alpha mediated resistance is regulated by induction of c-IAP 2 through NFkappaB by activation of CAMKII. However, pretreatment with Vpr followed by LPS or TNF-alpha stimulation no longer gave protection to Vpr induced apoptosis. Vpr peptide also inhibited LPS/TNF-alpha-induced calcium influx, activation of CAMKII, and c-IAP 2 induction. Taken together, my results suggest that the c-IAP 2 gene plays a critical role in LPS and TNF-alpha-induced resistance to HIV-Vpr-mediated apoptosis in human monocytic cells. Since the calcium/CAMKII pathway is involved in LPS/TNF-alpha induced resistance to Vpr mediated apoptosis, strategies based on manipulation of these molecules, which would suppress c-IAP 2 induction may be useful in clearing virus reservoirs in monocytes...|$|R
