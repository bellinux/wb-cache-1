[...] Rabbi Akiva, however, opposed this principle, and desired to have one measure for all. A practical case decided by Rabbi Akiva is then cited (viii. 7). In addition to all the compensation paid, the offender must beg the injured man's pardon.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the negative-sequence {{compensation}} mentioned here is referred to as the symmetrical compensation in a broad sense. As stated in [10], the symmetrical <b>compensation</b> <b>includes</b> negative-sequence compensation and reactive power compensation based on three-phase to one-phase symmetrical transformation. Since the power factor of an AC–DC–AC train is close to 1, the reactive power compensation has been achieved, and just the negative-sequence compensation has become the main target of compensation. Thus the symmetrical compensation can be termed as the negative-sequence compensation. In the same principle as applied in a co-phase compensation device [11], the NCD needs to transfer active power to compensate negative sequence. If necessary, functionalities of reactive power compensating and harmonic filtering are able to be realized at these device terminals.|$|E

The results are not sensitive to controls for sample selectivity bias and the estimated selectivity effects are more consistent with the principle of comparative advantage than is existing evidence from developing countries. The returns to on-the-job training are also higher than indicated by previous evidence in developing countries. [JEL: I 21, J 31...|$|E
30|$|Supply {{and demand}} {{in the labor market}} is a basic theory in economics. In the labor market for {{teachers}}, supply refers to the number of teachers willing to teach at a given level of compensation, and demand refers to the number of teaching positions open at a given level of compensation. <b>Compensation</b> <b>includes</b> both pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits, with the former including benefits like salary, health coverage, and a pension and the latter including benefits like preferential scheduling, favorable working conditions, and a sense of altruism. Under the economic laws of supply and demand, an undersupply of teachers, an increase in the demand for teachers, or both simultaneously, can result in a teacher shortage, and vice versa. Changes to local, state, and federal policies in regards to teacher staffing are, in turn, driven by these fluctuations in supply and demand to the extent of how much one outstrips the other.|$|E

Optimal contracting in the model includes an important role for portfolio restrictions that are {{more complex than the}} sharing rule. The manager’s <b>compensation</b> <b>includes</b> an incentive fee based approximately on the excess of return above an en-dogenously chosen benchmark. This measure is often used by practitioners but is simpler than the Jensen measure and other measures commonly rec-ommended in the academic literature. In addition to the excess return above the fixed benchmark, the manager is given some additional incentive to take a position that deviates from the benchmark. Efficient contracting involves restrictions on what portfolio strategies can be pursued, or equivalently, prior communication of the information gathered...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that intact performance on an executive attention task after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) reflects functional adaptation within neural networks, rather than recovery of premorbid modes of information processing. However, {{it is unclear whether}} this <b>compensation</b> <b>includes</b> the recruitment of alternative neural processing resources. The current study used source localization analysis to determine the location and timing of activated brain areas involved in the generation of an eventrelated potential (ERP) component marker of executive attention in 10 adults with mTBI and in 10 matched healthy controls. In both groups the cerebral sources of the late processing negativity component of the ERP waveform elicited during the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task were localized to the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Timing of the dipole moments was consistent with previous reports of the relative contributions of subregions of the frontal cortex critically involved in aspects of executive attention control. Finally, whereas abnormal intensity of ERP activation has recently been related to the achievement of normal levels of performance after mTBI, abnormal sources of cerebral activation {{do not appear to be}} a feature of the compensatory response. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Compensation {{contracts}} used {{in different}} firms embody both incentive and risk sharing components. This study {{builds on the}} existing literature by empirically investigating the relationship between executive risk sharing and firms’ stock performance in new and old economy firms. It tries to answer the fundamental {{question of whether or}} not using risk sharing contracts actually motivate executives to increase shareholder value, and whether that effect differs between new and old economy firms. The results indicate that the level of risk sharing does not influence the future market value of firm shares in high-risk sharing and new economy firms. However, it does negatively influence the current and future return to shareholders. The results also indicate that more intensive stock-based contacts positively influence current and future stock performance. This indicates that although stock based <b>compensation</b> <b>includes</b> a level of risk sharing, the level of risk sharing is not what drives stock performance in high-risk sharing and new economy firms. Rather, it is the value of the stock based compensation that drives performance leading to a higher market value per share and higher return to shareholders. </p...|$|E
