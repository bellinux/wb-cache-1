5|$|The Cayman Islands first {{participated in}} the Olympics when they sent two male athletes {{to compete in the}} Montreál 1976 Summer Olympic Games. Between then and Beijing, the Cayman Islands participated in eight Olympic games, {{including}} every summer Olympic competition excluding the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics. The number of <b>Caymanian</b> athletes participating in Olympic events peaked at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona with ten athletes, but has since fallen. In the Beijing Olympics, the Cayman Islands sent four athletesthree men and a womanto participate in two distinct sports. Two athletes progressed to post-preliminary rounds (Ronald Forbes and Cydonie Mothersille) in their events, and Mothersille, ranked eighth in the final round of her event. However, as of and including its participation in Beijing, the Cayman Islands had yet to medal. Ronald Forbes carried the <b>Caymanian</b> flag at ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The Cayman Islands sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The delegation included fifteen people; of the delegation, four athletes participated under the <b>Caymanian</b> flag. In the track and field events was Ronald Forbes, who also served as the Cayman Islands' flag-bearer during the Opening Ceremony and reached quarterfinals in the 110m hurdles, and Cydonie Mothersille, who reached finals and ranked eighth in the 200m dash. Brothers Shaune and Brett Fraser, both swimmers, participated in the 100 and 200m freestyle and in the 200m backstroke, respectively. The Cayman Islands' appearance at the Beijing Olympics marked its ninth appearance since its debut at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.

5|$|Then 29-year-old Trinidadian Ato Modibo, {{a former}} athlete of Clemson University {{and the husband}} of <b>Caymanian</b> {{sprinter}} Cydonie Mothersille, marked his third Olympic appearance (after the 2000 Sydney and 2004 Athens Olympics) upon his participation in Beijing. Modibo represented Trinidad and Tobago in the men's 400meters dash as an Olympian for the third time. During the August 17 qualification round, Modibo {{was placed in the}} fifth heat. He completed the event in 45.63seconds, placing fifth out of eight athletes in his heat. Modibo defeated Alleyne Francique of Grenada (46.15seconds), but fell behind Belgium's Jonathan Borlee (45.25seconds). The leaders of Modibo's heat were LaShawn Merritt (44.96seconds), Nigeria's Saul Weigopwa (45.19seconds) and Italy's Claudio Licciardello (45.25seconds). Out of 56 athletes, Modibo ranked 26th. He did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
50|$|Those {{living on}} the islands often partook in what is called wrecking. <b>Caymanians</b> enticed passing ships by {{creating}} objects that peaked sailors' interests. Often these objects {{did not look like}} other vessels. <b>Caymanians</b> made mules or donkeys with lanterns tied to their bodies to walk along the beaches or lit a large bonfire to attract sailors. Having very little knowledge of the area, sailors often became stuck on the reefs in the process of reaching a distance to where they could communitcate with those on the island. Once the ships were stuck on the reefs, islanders took canoes to plunder and salvage the ships under the false pretense of providing assistance.|$|R

25|$|Young {{was born}} in Jamaica in 1955. One of twelve siblings, {{he grew up in}} Clarendon, and went on to attend Glenmuir High School, {{subsequently}} studying surveying at the College of Arts, Science and Technology (now the University of Technology). His work as a land surveyor first brought him to the Cayman Islands in 1984, to work on the Cayman Brac airport, and he emigrated permanently in 1987, taking up a surveying job with the <b>Caymanian</b> government. Although he had played club cricket in both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, Young later concentrated on umpiring, and in 1995 became the inaugural president of the Cayman Islands Cricket Umpires Association (CICUA). He relinquished the position in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{featured}} five teams, {{the same}} number as at the inaugural 2001 edition, who played {{each other in a}} round-robin. Canada was undefeated in its four matches, and consequently qualified for the 2004 Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh. Making its tournament debut, the Cayman Islands placed second, losing only to Canada (with a narrow two-wicket margin). Troy Taylor, a <b>Caymanian,</b> led the tournament's wicket-taking, with 10 wickets, including a tournament record 7/12 against Argentina (who were winless). Argentina also had the highest individual innings of the tournament scored against them, a double century (204) by Bermuda's Dion Stovell (who was the tournament's leading runscorer). Bermuda placed third, ahead of the United States, which recorded its worst-ever tournament finish, with only a single victory.|$|E
25|$|Having {{previously}} only umpired domestically, Young {{made his}} umpiring debut {{at an international}} tournament in 2000, standing in the inaugural edition of the Americas Championship. He officiated in the 2004 edition of the same tournament, held in July 2004, {{and later in the}} month was selected to make his first-class umpiring debut, standing alongside another <b>Caymanian,</b> Hubert Smythe, in the 2004 Intercontinental Cup fixture between Bermuda and the United States. The pair also umpired the Bermuda–Canada fixture in Toronto the following month. Young went on to umpire two more first-class matches, both of which were Intercontinental Cup home matches for Canada – against Kenya in July 2006 and against the United Arab Emirates in July 2007. He has umpired in at least one international tournament in every year since, regularly standing in ICC Americas tournaments, and also umpired at the 2012 Under-19 World Cup in Australia. Young has served on the 11-member ICC Associates and Affiliates Umpire Panel since 2011, and was most recently re-appointed in January 2015, as one of two representatives from the Americas region (alongside American umpire Sameer Bandekar).|$|E

50|$|The Cayman Islands {{historically}} {{have been a}} tax-exempt destination. On 8 February 1794, the <b>Caymanians</b> rescued the crews {{of a group of}} ten merchant ships, including HMS Convert, an incident that has since become known as the Wreck of the Ten Sail. The ships had struck a reef and run aground during rough seas. Legend has it that King George III rewarded the island with a promise never to introduce taxes as compensation for their generosity, as one of the ships carried a member of the King's own family. While this remains a popular legend, the story is not true.|$|R
50|$|Although many Caribbean islands were {{initially}} populated by Amerindian {{groups such as}} the Taíno and Caribs, no evidence of this has been found in the Cayman Islands. Therefore, native <b>Caymanians</b> do not have any Amerindian heritage from their own islands; however, a significant number of Jamaicans have settled in the Cayman Islands over the years, so they and their descendants may have some Amerindian blood via Jamaica. Slavery was less common on the Cayman Islands than in many other parts of the Caribbean, resulting in a more even division of African and European ancestry. Those of mixed race make up 40% of the population, with blacks and whites following at 20% each. The remaining 20% belong to various immigrant ethnic groups.|$|R

50|$|Most, if not all, early {{settlers}} {{were people}} who came from outside of the Cayman Islands and were {{on the fringes of}} society. Due to this, the Cayman Islands have often been given the term total colonial frontier. Cayman society was a lawless society during the early settlement years. The Cayman Islands remained as a frontier society until well into the twentieth century. The year 1734 marked the rough beginning period of permanent settlement in Grand Cayman. Cayman Brac and Little Cayman were not permanently settled until 1833. A variety of people settled on the islands: pirates, refugees from the Spanish Inquisition, shipwrecked sailors, and slaves. The majority of <b>Caymanians</b> are of African and English descent, with considerable interracial mixing.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} {{language of the}} Cayman Islands is English. Islanders' accents retain elements passed down from English, Scottish, and Welsh settlers (among others) in a language variety known as Cayman Creole. <b>Caymanians</b> of Jamaican origin speak in their own vernacular (see Jamaican Creole and Jamaican English). It is also quite commonplace to hear some residents converse in Spanish as many citizens have relocated from Latin America to work and live on Grand Cayman. The Latin American nations with greatest representation are Honduras, Cuba, Colombia, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic. Spanish speakers comprise approximately between 10-12% {{of the population and}} is predominantly of the Caribbean dialect. Tagalog is spoken by about 5% of inhabitants most of whom are Filipino residents on work permits.|$|R
50|$|England took {{formal control}} of the Cayman Islands, along with Jamaica, {{as a result of}} the Treaty of Madrid of 1670. Following several {{unsuccessful}} attempts at settlement, a permanent English-speaking population in the islands dates from the 1730s. With settlement, after the first royal land grant by the Governor of Jamaica in 1734, came the perceived need for slaves. Many were brought to the islands from Africa; this is evident today with the majority of native <b>Caymanians</b> being of African and English descent. The results of the first census taken in the islands in 1802 showed the population on Grand Cayman to be 933 with 545 of those inhabitants being enslaved. Slavery was abolished in the Cayman Islands in 1833. At the time of abolition, there were over 950 Blacks of African ancestry enslaved by 116 white families of English ancestry.|$|R

2500|$|The Cayman Turtle Farm is a 23-acre {{marine park}} that {{operates}} in the West Bay district of Cayman Islands.

5000|$|The {{boom in the}} Cayman Islands' {{international}} finance industry can also be at least partly attributed to the British overseas territory having no direct taxation. A popular legend attributes the tax-free status to the heroic acts of the inhabitants during a maritime tragedy in 1794, {{often referred to as}} [...] "Wreck of the Ten Sails". The wreck involved nine British merchant vessels and their naval escort, the frigate HMS Convert, that ran aground on the reefs off Grand Cayman. Due to the rescue efforts by the <b>Caymanians</b> using canoes, the loss of life was limited to eight. However, records from the colonial era indicate that Cayman Islands, then a dependency of Jamaica, was not tax-exempt during the period that followed. In 1803, the inhabitants signed a petition addressed to the Jamaican governor asking him to grant them a tax exemption from the [...] "Transient Tax on Wreck Goods".|$|R
50|$|Residents of the Cayman Islands enjoy a tax-free existence; local {{legend has}} it that the reason for the absence of {{taxation}} is related directly to the Wreck of the Ten Sail. According to the legend, a member of the passenger list for the 10 vessels included a royal prince, one of the sons of Britain’s King George III. The legend further states that when the King was apprised of the bravery {{on the part of the}} <b>Caymanians</b> in saving the crews and passengers of the foundering ships, he decided to repay their bravery. The reward became a decree that the people of the Cayman Islands would thereafter be free from war conscription and taxes. There is, however, no documented evidence that the decree was ever issued or that there was a member of the Royal Family on board one of the ships. Regardless, the legend continues today and is often repeated to travellers and tourists as well as amongst the residents of the Cayman Islands.|$|R
50|$|Grand Cayman was {{the only}} island of the three that create the Cayman Islands that had instituted slavery. Although slavery was instituted, Grand Cayman did not hold witness to violent slave revolts. While {{scholars}} tend to agree that to an extent a slave society did exist on at least Grand Cayman, there are debates amongst them on how important slavery was to the society as a whole. The slave period for the Cayman Islands lasted between 1734 and 1834. In 1774, George Gauld estimated that approximately four hundred people lived on Grand Cayman; half the inhabitants were free while the other half were constituted slaves. By 1802, the estimation of inhabitants was at 993 with a 58 percent slave population. An April 1834 census recorded a population of 1,800 with roughly 46 percent considered free <b>Caymanians.</b> By the time of emancipation, slaves outnumbered that of freemen on Grand Cayman. In 1835, Governor Sligo arrived in Cayman from Jamaica to declare all slaves free {{in accordance with the}} Emancipation Act of 1833.|$|R
