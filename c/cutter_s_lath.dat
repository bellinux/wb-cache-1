40|$|Gamma {{titanium}} aluminides are {{an interesting}} alternative for nickel, iron or cobalt matrix superalloys. Due to the advantageous strength properties at high temperatures they can successfully replace superalloys in applications such as high pressure compressor blades, low pressure turbine blades, high pressure compressor case, low pressure turbine case. Milling {{is one of the}} processes that can be applied in the forming elements made from this type of alloys for the aviation industry. Research included the selection of tool, the process kinematics and the range of milling gamma titanium aluminide (Ti- 45 Al- 5 Nb- 0. 2 B- 0. 2 C) process parameters were carried out. Milling can be an effective method of forming of elements made of gamma TiAL in the range of processing parameters: vc = 20 - 70 m/min, ap = 0. 3 - 0. 7 mm, fz = 0. 1 - 0. 45 mm/tooth.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} to compare the clinical outcomes of a 6 -row 3 -D linear cutter with the standard 4 -row linear cutter in patients who underwent elective gastrointestinal surgery anastomosis. METHOD: Patients who underwent elective open gastrointestinal surgery that included stapled anastomosis using a linear cutter (Proximate®, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH) between January 2011 and May 2011 were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups according to the linear cutter that was used in the surgery: the standard 4 -row <b>cutter</b> (the <b>S</b> group) or the new 6 -row cutter (the N group). The groups were compared based on the patient demographic data, the laboratory parameters, the preoperative diagnosis, the surgery performed, the operation time, intra-or postoperative complications, the time to oral tolerance and the length of the hospital stay. RESULTS: The S group included 11 male and nine female patients {{with a mean age of}} 65 ± 12 (35 - 84) years, while the N group included 13 male and eight female patients with a mean age of 62 ± 11 (46 - 79) years (p = 0. 448, p = 0. 443, respectively). Anastomotic line bleeding was observed in eight (40 %) patients in the S group and in one (4. 7 %) patient in the N group (p = 0. 006). Dehiscence of the anastomosis line was observed in two (10 %) patients in the S group and none in the N group (p = 0. 131). Anastomotic leakage developed in three (15 %) patients in the S group and in one (4. 7 %) patient in the N group (p = 0. 269). The mean hospital stay was 12. 65 ± 6. 1 days in theS group and 9. 52 ± 2. 9 days in the N group (p = 0. 043). CONCLUSION: The 6 -row 3 -D linear cutter is a safe and easily applied instrument that can be used to create anastomoses in gastrointestinal surgery. The new stapler provides some usage benefits and is also superior to the standard linear cutter with regard to anastomotic line bleeding...|$|R

Physicians and patients could benefit from {{a better understanding of}} the reasons for switching therapy. Purpose: To investigate the reasons patients switch DMTs and identify characteristics associated with the decision to switch. Method: The North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) Registry conducted a supplemental survey among registry participants responding to the 2011 update survey. The supplemental survey investigated reasons for switching DMT, origin of the discussion of DMT change, and which factors influenced the decision. Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests, and logistic regression were used for the analyses. Results: Of the 691 eligible candidates, 308 responded and met the inclusion criteria (relapsing disease course, switched DMT after September 2010). The responders were 83. 4 % female, on average 52 years old, with a median (interquartile range) Patient-Determined Disease Steps score of 4 (2 – 5). The most recent prior therapy included first-line injectables (74. 5 %), infusions (18. 1 %), an oral DMT (3. 4 %), and other DMTs (4. 0 %). The discussion to switch DMT was initiated almost equally by physicians and participants. The primary reason for choosing the new DMT was based most frequently on physician’s recommendation (24. 5 %) and patient perception of efficacy (13. 7 %). Conclusion: Participants frequently initiated the discussion regarding changing DMT, although physician recommendations regarding the specific therapy were still weighed highly. Long-term follow-up of these participants will provide valuable information on their disease trajectory, satisfaction with, and effectiveness of their new medication.
