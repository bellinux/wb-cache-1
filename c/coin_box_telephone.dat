These red boxes were considered flawed in parts by BT for several reasons, including cost, lack of ventilation, accessibility and maintenance. BT announced the £160 million series of new boxes, the KX series designed by GKN, as well as announcing the eventual replacement of all existing <b>telephone</b> <b>boxes.</b> The main <b>telephone</b> <b>box</b> in the KX range is the KX100.

Beautiful lithographs would be placed over the lids or dome of the trunk and truly capture the Victorian aesthetic of that day. There {{were numerous}} chromolithographs that a trunk maker could use, {{and they could be}} indicative of who the trunk was intended for, such as ladies or men.
