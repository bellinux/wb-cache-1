5000|$|Julia Davis Park has {{its roots}} in the 1862 journey of two orphans, Thomas and Frank Davis, who {{traveled}} to the Boise area from Cincinnati, Ohio, with hopes of joining in the widely publicized gold rush in the Idaho Territory. The brothers staked a claim and mined for a year, before building a cabin in 1863 on the Cottonwood Creek near the site of the present Julia Davis Park. On July 4, 1863, Fort Boise was established and shortly after, the Davis brothers along with seven friends met in the Davis' cabin and planned the formation of the City of Boise. According to one of the friends, William Lowery Ritchie, “in the summer of 1863 the soldiers came and established the garrison; that was sometime early in July. It was about that time we met in our cabin and formed a town co.” [...] Thomas Davis came to play a pivotal role in the development of Boise as a city and sought to help attract visitors and pioneers to the valley. With his mining claim being less than profitable, Davis turned to the promotion of agriculture by planting 7,000 apple trees on his land along the Boise River. Additionally, he started buying up land in the valley from the United States land office, receiving <b>Cash</b> <b>Certificate</b> No. 1 for 160 acre in 1868 when the first land office opened up. Within several years, Davis went on to purchase the first water rights in the valley, as well as an additional 1150 acre from the federal government along the foothills and where the town of Garden City was developed. In 1871, Davis married Julia McCrumb, who had travelled to Boise from Ontario, Canada, to visit family in 1869.|$|E

The familiar least preferred model group shared more than the control group. There were significant interaction effects between sex and treatment and between sex, treatment, and age of model. Unfamiliar models with no similarity mentioned and peer models each produced more sharing than parent models. Subjects who observed an unfamiliar model described as similar donated more than those seeing an unfamiliar model described as dissimilar.

ISMAS Symposium cum Workshop on Mass Spectrometry ISMAS organizes Workshops on Mass Spectrometry at Research Institutes and Universities in different parts ofIndia. These Workshops are aimed at introducing the subject of Mass Spectrometry to novices, updating theMass Spectrometrists with the latest developments in the field, exposing the participants to innumerable applications of Mass Spectrometry and providing a common forum for discussing the day-to-day problems when working with a Mass Spectrometer. The programme of these Workshops consists of Tutorials, Panel Discussions, Research Scholar Presentations, Poster Presentations and Invited Lectures. The lectures include fundamentals of Mass Spectrometry, qualitative and quantitative aspects and data interpretation,maintenance of Mass Spectrometers, selection of a mass spectrometer, applications in various branches of science as well as recent advances in Mass Spectrometry. The lectures are supplemented by (i) Open-forum discussions on the experiences gained by the Resource Persons (faculty) as well as by the participants in running and maintaining the mass spectrometers and (ii) Visits to local laboratories equipped with mass spectrometers. During Workshop cum Symposium, Research Scholars are provided with an opportunity to make oral presentations of their research work. <b>Cash</b> Awards and <b>Certificates</b> of Merit are given to the best presentations.
