This vehicle (registration MXY1) was powered by an air-cooled 5HP V-twin JAP engine, and had only a single gear, though gears were available on 'other models'. The engine was mounted behind the rear axle and drove it via chain, there being no differential.

The engine and low storage position of the fuel in the fuel tank combined to give a low centre of gravity which aided its handling prowess.

40|$|Abstract — As we {{all know}} the fuel prices {{especially}} the petrol is rising steadily day by day. Again the pollution due to vehicles in metro cities & urban areas is increasing continuously. To overcome these problems, an effort is being made to search some other alternative sources of energy for the vehicles. Again, it is also not affordable to purchase vehicles (mopeds, scooters or motorcycles) for all the class of society. Keeping this in mind, a search for some way to cater these economically poor people as well as to provide a solution for the environmental pollution was in progress. The solar assisted bicycle developed is driven by DC motor fitted in front or rear axle housing & operated by solar energy. The solar panels mounted on the carriage will charge the battery & which in turn drive the hub motor. When the bicycle is idle, the solar panel will charge the battery. This arrangement will replace the petrol engine, the gear box & the fuel tank in case of a two wheeler or a <b>chain</b> <b>sprocket,</b> chain & gear shifting arrangement of a conventional bicycle being used by most common man. [9] As a part of dissertation work, the solar assisted bicycle is fitted with a dc hub motor on front axle of a bicycle with power rating of 250 W and with a travelling speed of around 25 - 30 kmph. It is provided with a pair of lead acid batteries of 35 Ah each, a photovoltaic solar panel with capacity of 20 watt, a voltage regulator of 24 v 10 Amp, accelerator and motor controller of 24 v 25 Amp. There is also a provision for charging of the battery with 220 - 240 V, AC wall outlet supply, in case of poor solar supply due to cloudy weather. [4...|$|E

The advantage of this method over previous techniques is that it allows the differentiation of lubricants in a more controlled operating environment and evaluates the overall lubricant performance as opposed to individual properties. The lubricants tested were a wax spray, PTFE spray and drip fed light oil. The test rig allowed measurement of the power saved by the lubricant in running the <b>chains</b> and <b>sprockets.</b> <b>Chain</b> length and component masses were also taken before and after running the <b>chains</b> and <b>sprockets</b> under load on the test rig.

40|$|In Pakistan {{there is}} a short fall of electricity. Currently, {{the total amount of}} energy {{produced}} in Pakistan is about 19, 500 MW through various resources such as hydel power, natural gas etc. The energy produces via hydel power is much less in comparison to production of energy through Furnace oil or Natural gas. Hydel power produces only 65, 00 MW, while rest of 13, 000 MW is produced either using Furnace oil or Natural Gas. Furthermore, nuclear and coal resources also contribute in energy production, but the yield is lower than the hydel power production, which is 450 MW and 150 MW respectively. The shortage of electricity reaches its peak i. e 6, 000 MW in summer season and it is expected that this figure is expected to rise with time. Since Pakistan posses abundant wind resources for electricity generation, therefore it is essential to build indigenous low cost wind turbine to utilize these available resources efficiently and economically. This study specifically concerns with development of generator of horizontal axis of wind turbine. In this study, three-phase AC asynchronous induction motor has been converted into a wind turbine generator to produce a robust and economical design. For this purpose, a test rig, consisting of two induction motors, <b>chain</b> <b>sprocket,</b> motor coupling, capacitors, and load bank of 2. 3 KWwere used. During experimental trials, high voltage oil based capacitors were used to magnetize the generator coil. As generator motor is rotated slightly above its rated rpm of 2800, capacitors starts magnetizing the coil, which in turns produce potential difference that reverses the motor behavior and it start working as a generator. During the laboratory trials, {{it has been shown that}} this approach presents a robust and economical solution for developing wind turbine generators, as these induction motors are easily available at considerably low prices in comparison to DC generators...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{most of the}} {{factories}} use lift indicators to guide the mill operators in adjusting their roller speeds. However, {{it is not only}} important to keep the roller floating all the time, but as pointed out earlier, ' great importance should be attached {{to the fact that the}} rollers should remain as closely as possible to a predetermined position, as any movement of the top roller affects the work ratio. The necessity of keeping the top roller at its predetermined position prompted the S. M. R. I. to develop a reliable means of continuously recording the lift of a top roller. Further important considerations were the advantage of having an instrument that enables the staff to carry out a "from minute to minute " control, the fact that the S. M. R. I. intends to propose the initiation of a system of "Mutual Milling Control " and the fact that some investigations concerning moisture in final bagasse were being conducted at Illovo. As direct recording was regarded as being impossible, due to the constant vibrations of a mill, an electrical system was selected. Since it was considered essential to make measurements both at pinion and at pintle sides of the mill, a six-point recording mA meter was transformed into a two-point recorder by short circuiting the terminals. Basically, the linear movement of the roller plus bearing is transformed into a rotating one by means of a <b>chain,</b> <b>sprocket</b> wheel and contraweight (all very cheap Meccano parts). A movement of 0. 5 " of the roller causes a rotation of 29 ° of the sprocket wheel, and as a potentiometer normally. turns 290 - 300 ° between its extreme positions, the potentiometer was linked with the sprocket wheel by means of a 1 : 10 gear ratio (also Meccano parts). Hence, a movement of 0. 5 " of the top roller caused the potentiometer to rotate over its full range. A rectifier with voltage stabilisation was built in order to make the reading independent of possible variations in the voltage of the mains, and the circuit decided upon is shown in Fig. I (see also Appendix) ...|$|E
