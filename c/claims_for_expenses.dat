5000|$|Moran's <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>expenses</b> 2004-05 were £73,198 {{higher than}} those of Luton North MP Kelvin Hopkins. However, it was not until May 2009 that the full details of her claims were revealed. These caused Moran to {{announce}} she would not stand in the 2010 general election, and she was later barred from doing so by the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. Speaking in Parliament, the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown described Moran's behaviour as [...] "totally unacceptable".|$|E
5000|$|On 23 February 2011 it was {{announced}} that following legal advice, Chaytor was seeking leave to appeal against the length of his sentence. The application was heard by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) on 22 March 2011 and refused on 23 March 2011, when the Lord Chief Justice described the behaviour referred to in the charges as [...] "calculating", with the element of dishonesty being [...] "not simply inflated <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>expenses,</b> but rather the careful preparation of bogus claims". The primary grounds of appeal (and the main mitigation in the original hearing) - that according to the UK Parliament's 'Green Book' expenses guidelines, Chaytor's situation would have entitled him to claim more than he had done but on a different property - was dismissed as not relevant.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Laing {{voted against}} MPs' expense claims being made public.

The Millwall club made no <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>expenses</b> involved in staging the match, {{and the entire}} proceeds were donated to the fund set up to support those affected by the Senghenydd Colliery Disaster, an explosion in a South Wales coal mine in which 440 people were killed, which had happened eight days after the Charity Shield match.|$|R
50|$|Tkuchak was {{involved}} in the Mike Duffy scandal, serving as one of a three-member senate committee whose report sought to whitewash Duffy's fallacious <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> living <b>expenses.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{the three}} {{suspects}} {{had been killed}} while preparing an act of terrorism, the court rejected the families' <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> damages, {{as well as their}} <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>expenses</b> incurred at the inquest. The court did order the British government to pay the applicants' costs incurred during the proceedings in Strasbourg. The government initially suggested it would not pay, and there was discussion in parliament of the UK withdrawing from the ECHR. It paid the costs on 24 December 1995, within days of the three-month deadline which had been set by the court.|$|R

50|$|Under English common law, {{on which}} American law is based, there was {{generally}} no accountant-client privilege. In the United Kingdom {{in particular the}} Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 actually requires accountants (and solicitors, insolvency practitioners, etc.) who suspect their clients of tax evasion to report them to the authorities without telling the clients they have done so, subject to a maximum punishment of 14 years in jail. This affects even accountants who uncover a possibly inadvertent <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>expenses.</b> In Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal took note of the American policy but refused to give any weight to it {{on the grounds that}} it is for Parliament to choose to enact a similar rule in Canada.|$|R
5000|$|The Court used similar {{reasoning}} in earlier cases concerning deductions <b>claimed</b> <b>for</b> <b>expenses</b> {{arising out of}} illegal or illegitimate business activity. In United States v. Sullivan, the taxpayer <b>claimed</b> a deduction <b>for</b> rent and wages paid {{in support of a}} gambling enterprise. The enterprise and the rent and wages paid were illegal under state law. The IRS challenged the claimed deduction, stating that the illegality of the gambling enterprise required disallowance of the deduction. The Supreme Court upheld the deduction, holding that “to enforce as federal policy the rule espoused by the Commissioner IRS in this case, we would come close to making this type of business taxable {{on the basis of its}} gross receipts…If that choice is to be made, Congress should do it.” ...|$|R
50|$|Dunham's employer-provided health {{insurance}} covered {{most of the}} costs of her medical treatment, leaving her to pay the deductible and uncovered expenses, which came to several hundred dollars per month.

Eventually the matter was resolved when, under protest, Gallaher repaid the disputed amount. This settlement, coupled with his performance in 26–0 North Island win over the South Island in the pre-tour trial, allowed Gallaher to be considered for selection for New Zealand's 1905–06 tour of Europe and North America. The NZRFU had been trying to secure an invitation to send a team to Britain for some time, and were finally able to secure satisfactory financial guarantees to proceed in 1905. This was the first representative New Zealand team to undertake such a tour, though a privately organised team, the New Zealand Natives, had preceded them in 1888–89.|$|R
25|$|The {{location}} of the ships drew an objection from the shipbuilders Messrs Rennie because some of their employees refused to work near the riverside where Atlas was moored. It was also necessary to move Atlas and Endymion every time Rennie's launched a ship. In 1882, the Thames Conservancy wrote to the Metropolitan Asylums Board urging them to move Atlas and Endymion from Greenwich. The Thames Conservancy also called upon the board to pay a large <b>claim</b> <b>for</b> <b>expenses</b> incurred by Messrs Rennie's.

The board decided to await the report from a Royal Commission into infectious diseases hospitals before deciding whether or not to move the ships.
