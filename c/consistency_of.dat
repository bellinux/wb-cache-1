40|$|AbstractAutomatic {{debugging}} of UML class diagrams {{helps in}} the visual specification of software systems because users cannot detect errors in logical consistency easily. This study focuses on the tractable <b>consistency</b> checking <b>of</b> UML class diagrams. We accurately identify inconsistencies in these diagrams by translating them into first-order predicate logic that is generalized by counting quantifiers and classify their expressivities by eliminating certain components. We introduce optimized algorithms that compute the respective <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> class diagrams of different expressive powers in P, NP, PSPACE, or EXPTIME {{with respect to the}} size of the class diagrams. In particular, owing to the restrictions imposed on attribute value types, the complexities <b>of</b> <b>consistency</b> checking <b>of</b> class diagrams decrease from EXPTIME to P and PSPACE in two cases: (i) when the class diagrams contain disjointness constraints and overwriting/multiple inheritances and (ii) when the class diagrams contain both these components along with completeness constraints. Additionally, we confirm the existence of a restriction of class diagrams that prevents any logical inconsistency...|$|R

5|$|The maximum spacing {{estimator}} is {{a consistent}} estimator {{in that it}} converges in probability to the true value of the parameter, θ0, as the sample size increases to infinity. The <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators.

An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with a shape parameter less than 1. The density will tend to infinity as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent.|$|E

5|$|Adam used a {{wide variety}} of sources for his designs, and created an inventive {{personal}} style of decoration. His chief influences were from English Palladianism, and several of his houses have been likened to designs reproduced in Colen Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus, but Adam mixed these with English Baroque motifs from Gibbs and Vanbrugh. He relied greatly on a range of French, Italian and English pattern books, including Gibbs' Book of Architecture, from which he borrowed freely with little regard for <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> style. In addition, he took inspiration from earlier Scottish renaissance architecture, and from his predecessors Bruce and Smith. During his nearly 30-year career as an architect, Adam designed, extended or remodelled over 40 country houses, and undertook numerous public contracts. He also laid out landscape garden schemes, for instance at Newliston and Taymouth Castle.|$|E

Commercial data stores offer tunable consistency guarantees at transaction level where the user specifies the desired level <b>of</b> <b>consistency</b> in terms <b>of</b> number of participating replicas in {{read and write}} consensus. Selective data consistency model applies strict consistency to a subset of data objects. The <b>consistency</b> guarantees <b>of</b> data attributes or objects are measured using an application independent metric called consistency index (CI). Our consistency model is predictive and helps in expression <b>of</b> data <b>consistency</b> {{as a function of}} known database design parameters, like workload characteristics and number of replicas of the data object.

The adaptive consistency guarantees are implemented with a consistency tuner, which probes the <b>consistency</b> index <b>of</b> an observed replicated data object in an online application. The tuner uses statistically derived threshold values of an optimum time gap, which, when padded in a workload stream, guarantees a desired value <b>of</b> <b>consistency</b> index for the observed data object.
