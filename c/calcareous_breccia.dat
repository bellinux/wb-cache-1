For, observe, {{there was a}} difficulty in getting the forms of the triangle into anything like reconciliation at this point, and a mediæval artist always delights in a difficulty: instead of concealing it, he boasts of it; and just as we saw above that he directed the eye {{to the difficulty of}} filling the expanded sides of the upper band by elongating his triangles, so here, having to put in a piece of stone of awkward shape, he makes that very stone the most conspicuous in the whole arch, on both sides, by using in one case a dark, cold grey; in the other a vigorous green, opposed to the warm red and purple and white of the stones above and beside it. The green and white piece on the right is of a marble, as far as I know, exceedingly rare. I at first thought the white fragments were inlaid, so sharply are they defined upon their ground. They are indeed inlaid, but I believe it is by nature; and that the stone is a <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccia</b> of great mineralogical interest. The white spots are of singular value in giving piquancy to the whole range of more delicate transitional hues above. The effect of the whole is, however, generally injured by the loss of the three large triangles above. I have no doubt they were purple, like those which remain, and that the whole arch was thus one zone of white, relieved on a purple ground, encircled by the scarlet cornices of brick, and the whole chord of color contrasted by the two precious fragments of grey and green at either side.|$|E
50|$|The up to 500 m {{thick layer}} of Lower Triassic (Buntsandstein) {{comprises}} conglomerates, breccia, brown sandstones, argillites, shales, and siltstones. The Middle Triassic (Muschelkalk) can attain a thickness of 400 m and shows silty shales, evaporite deposits, and dolomitic micrites. The up to 500 m thick Upper Triassic Keuper deposits {{are made up of}} carbonate-rich sediments, salt, siltstones, and intercalated ophitic diabases/olivine dolerites. The lower Lias is a transgressive sequence with up to 200 m of non-marine sandstone, near-shore marine limestone and evaporites. A pelagic fauna at the top suggests open marine conditions. The middle and upper Lias consist of 230 m of shallow marine platform sediments (bioclastic limestone, argillaceous limestone, and micritic limestone). During the Middle Jurassic, an oolitic barrier, made up mostly of argillaceous micrites, separates an outer shelf from an inner shelf. The Upper Jurassic (Malm) deposits are mainly shales and carbonates. Near the end of the Jurassic, restricted environments were established with dolomicrites, banded limestones, and evaporites. The Lower Cretaceous layer starts with sandstones, shales, limestones, and <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccia</b> in the Neocomian, followed by Barremian marls and limestones. During the lower Aptian, sandstones, shales, sandy marls, and limestones were laid down. The upper Aptian and the Albian are mainly marls and limestones. The Upper Cretaceous includes a littoral Turonian with sandstones and sandy limestones. By the beginning of the Senonian (Campanian), a deep trough had formed (the Subpyrenean Basin) receiving a very thick flysch sequence. The Campanian and Maastrichtian flyschs comprise 2000 to 3000 m of periodically interlayered fines (marls, calcareous shales, and mudstones) and coarser sediments (conglomerates, sandstones, and greywackes). Near the K/T boundary, the Subpyrenean Basin was filled with continental red deposits in Garumnian facies even including dinosaur eggs in a few places. At this point, the Subpyrenean Basin underwent folding accompanied by a weak metamorphism.|$|E
40|$|The {{recovery}} of <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccia</b> and other carbonate-cemented rocks from Mont dels Oliva in the Balearic Promontory indicates that both this seamount and the adjacent Mont Ausias Marc, east of Ibiza and Formentera islands, are of continental origin. Recent multibeam echosounder mapping and high-resolution seismic reflection profiles {{indicate that the}} third high, Emile Baudot Seamount, is located within a field of more than 118 pinnacles. Based on their magnetic signature and the {{recovery of}} basalt {{in the vicinity of}} the pinnacles suggest that the features are of volcanic origin. A basalt sample dredged from Emile Baudot Seamount indicates an igneous origin for this seamount. The limited sampling, the chemistry of the rock recovered and the size of the seamount itself (18 by 3 km), however, does not preclude the possibility that Emile Baudot may be a fractured uplifted continental block intruded by the basalt. The K/Ar age of 1. 46 ± 0. 18 my yielded by the basalt sample verifies the earlier proposal by Acosta et al. (Mar. Pet. Geol. 128 (2001 a) 349) that the volcanism that created part or all of Emile Baudot Seamount and the Southwest Majorca Volcanic Field associated with the seamount took place in the Pleistocene. This volcanism is probably related to decompression resulting from the normal faulting that led to the subsidence of the low (Central Depression) between Ibiza and Majorca (Balearic Islands). ...|$|E

40|$|The Slovenian Basin was a Mesozoic deep-water {{paleogeographic}} domain located {{north of}} the Dinaric Carbonate Platform. Due to {{a considerable amount of}} southward-directed thrusting and subsequent erosion, the marginal parts of this basin are only sparsely preserved. The southernmost remains of the Slovenian Basin in western Slovenia are found in the Ponikve Klippe, where we studied a Middle Jurassic (? Aalenian) to Lower Cretaceous (Albian) succession. We dated the succession with radiolarians, calpionellids, and benthic foraminifers. The succession is divided into three formations. The first is the Middle Jurassic to Lower Tithonian Tolmin Formation, composed of radiolarian cherts, siliceous limestone, and calciturbidites. The second formation is the Upper Tithonian–Berriasian Biancone limestone, which consists of pelagic limestone with calpionellids and one interstratified calciturbidite. The third formation, the Lower flyschoid formation, rests upon a prominent, regionally recognized erosional unconformity. The formation begins with <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccia</b> and continues with finer-grained calciturbidites that alternate with marl/shale and chert. Only the lower part of this formation was investigated and dated to the late Aptian to early Albian. The correlation of the studied section with the previously described successions of the Slovenian Basin shows that the Jurassic part of the section clearly exhibits a more marginal setting, whereas the Cretaceous part of the section correlates well with the central basinal succession. This inversion was related to the late Aptian tectonic event that was also responsible for the considerable submarine erosion and deposition of the basal breccia of the Lower flyschoid formation. </p...|$|E

The Paczółtowice "marble" is {{a unique}} Carboniferous {{limestone}} modified in the later Carboniferous-Permian times {{as a result of}} plutonic and tectonic activity that resulted in the rocks inhomogeneity. Three varieties of the Paczółtowice "marble" can be distinguished. The first and prettiest variety of the Paczółtowice "marble", called "polish onyx", is a multicolour, middling and thickly-crystalline calcite vein with thickness up to 20 m. It is probably Permian lateral secretion in the Carboniferous limestone, which was formed by the hydrothermal processes. Second variety is a multicolour Carboniferous limestone modified by warm, Fe-rich dilutions related to the volcanic activity known from the Dębnik anticline. It is represented by white, grey and reddish "marble" exhibiting unusual diffusion rings. The third variety is a <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccia</b> of this Carboniferous limestone joined together with multicoloured calcite. These limestones are called "marbles" because they show similar technical properties like marble sensu stricto. The Paczółtowice "marble" has favorable technical properties and significant parts of the deposit have a high decorative value. Hence, it was a valuable material used for many monuments. Most often, this colorful limestone was combined together with the Dębnik marble, which exhibits a deep black colour after polishing. Both marbles together give a fantastic contrast and wonderful decorative effect in the monuments. The Paczółtowice "marble" was discovered in the Paczółtowice village which is situated 6 km from Krzeszowice and occurs within the "Kraków Valleys" Landscape Park (southern Poland). This area is protected because of its valuable geology, fauna and flora. In such situation, there is a conflict between any desire to deposit development and the requirements of the protection of nature and landscape. The peculiarity of this "marble" tends to maintain deposits in the balance sheet as a reserve of raw material for a small retrieval, mainly for reconstruction of existing monuments. Exploitation of the "marble" could be possible in parts of the deposit, but appropriate environmental and landscape rigors must be respected. The quarry face could expose the details of the geological structure of the site. After finishing exploitation, a quarry would improve its landscape value and become a fantastic geotouristic attraction. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|Downtown L'Aquila {{suffered}} {{severe damage}} (VIII-IX EMS 98 intensity) during the 2009 April 6 Mw 6. 3 earthquake. The city is {{settled on a}} top flat hill, with a shear-wave velocity profile characterized by a reversal of velocity {{at a depth of}} the order of 50 – 100 m, corresponding to the contact between <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccia</b> and lacustrine deposits. In the southern sector of downtown, a thin unit of superficial red soils causes a further shallow impedance contrast that may have influenced the damage distribution during the 2009 earthquake. In this paper, the main features of ambient seismic vibrations have been studied in the entire city centre by using array measurements. We deployed six 2 -D arrays of seismic stations and 1 -D array of vertical geophones. The 2 -D arrays recorded ambient noise, whereas the 1 -D array recorded signals produced by active sources. Surface-wave dispersion curves have been measured by array methods and have been inverted through a neighbourhood algorithm, jointly with the H/V ambient noise spectral ratios related to Rayleigh waves ellipticity. We obtained shear-wave velocity (Vs) profiles representative of the southern and northern sectors of downtown L'Aquila. The theoretical 1 -D transfer functions for the estimated Vs profiles have been compared to the available empirical transfer functions computed from aftershock data analysis, revealing a general good agreement. Then, the Vs profiles have been used as input for a deconvolution analysis aimed at deriving the ground motion at bedrock level. The deconvolution has been performed by means of EERA and STRATA codes, two tools commonly employed in the geotechnical engineering community to perform equivalent-linear site response studies. The waveform at the bedrock level has been obtained deconvolving the 2009 main shock recorded at a strong motion station installed in downtown. Finally, this deconvolved waveform has been used as seismic input for evaluating synthetic time-histories in a strong-motion target site located in the middle Aterno river valley. As a target site, we selected the strong-motion station of AQV 5 km away from downtown L'Aquila. For this site, the record of the 2009 L'Aquila main shock is available and its surface stratigraphy is adequately known making possible to propagate the deconvolved bedrock motion back to the surface, and to compare recorded and synthetic waveforms...|$|E

During episode 1, a subsident coastal salina filled with Ca-sulphates was formed in the downthrown block of two normal faults. Erosion of the Upper Triassic units (Keuper facies and Imón Fm) and deposition of terrestrial facies (lutites, sandstones and polymict breccias), took place in the uplifted blocks. During episode 2, tectonic reactivation combined to long-term sea level rise, resulted in the setting of tidal flat facies, preserved as dolomitic breccias, cellular limestones and finelly-crystalline limestones. Deposition of shallow subtidal facies (mudstones and oolitic-peloidal and bioclastic packstones-grainstones) was favoured in the more subsident areas of downthrown blocks. Cracking and fracturing of the early lithified subtidal carbonates also originated the local deposition in these areas of <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccias</b> and rudite...|$|R
40|$|The city of L’Aquila {{is built}} on a deep intramontane basin filled by silty clay of {{lacustrine}} origin with average S-wave velocity of about 725 m=s, topped by a <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccias</b> unit with a higher speed of about 900 m=s. New geologic and geophysical investigations following the 6 April 2009 Mw 6. 3 L’Aquila, Italy, earthquake have allowed us {{to develop a new}} velocity model for the basin deposits that, coupled with the inversion of velocity, includes lateral velocity variations in the top breccia layer and a newly found red silts unit, the Limi Rossi del Colle dell’Aquila (LRCA). The city area where the LRCA unit outcrops is correlated with clusters of reinforced concrete buildings that collapsed in the nor- mal faulting earthquake. We simulate the 2 D seismic response of this new velocity model along two orthogonal cross sections and compare the synthetic spectral ratios to the experimental ones evaluated using aftershock recordings. As a result, taking into account the full scatter about the mean of the observed spectral ratios, we are able to predict not only the main features of the primary observed low-frequency resonance peak, but also the level of amplification at high frequency at most of the sites investigated...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Beech {{forests in}} the subalpine belt of Velebit (1 - 4) have not been {{extensively}} investigated so far, nor have their nomenclatural and systematic affiliation been analyzed {{according to the latest}} phytocoenological concepts (5 - 7). Phytocoenological research and adjustment were combined with the study and analysis of basic soil types and their pedophysiographic properties. Materials and Methods: Phytocoenological research, encompassing the analysis of 11 relevés and comparisons with other relevant studies (3, 8, 9), follows classical principles of the Braun-Blanquet School (10). Taxonomic nomenclature was coordinated according to Nikoli} (11 - 13). Pedophysiographic soil features were described by types and pedogenetic horizons {{on the basis of the}} profiles opened within the community. Results: As many as 96 species, or 41 species per relevé on average, were registered in 11 phytocoenological relevés. The dominant layer of the community under study was characterized by Fagus sylvatica, with Acer pseudoplatanus also taking an important position and Abies alba featuring on the bottom boundary. There were no distinctly dominant species in the shrub layer, while the ground layer contained important species of the alliance Aremonio-Fagion and the order Fagetalia. The substrate of limestones with dolomite interbeds, dolomitized limestones, and <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccias</b> (14 - 17) supports a long series of subtypes and varieties of mollic leptosol and cambisols, luvisols in sinkholes and sporadic occurrences of rendzic leptosols.

40|$|L'Aquila {{downtown}} (Central Italy) suffered strong damages {{during the}} April 6 th 2009 Mw 6. 3 earthquake. In particular many collapses and strong damages on buildings {{have been observed}} near {{the southern edge of}} the L'Aquila downtown. L'Aquila is bounded southward by the Aterno river valley along a steep scarp. The downtown is settled on a calcareous terrace, mainly composed of a Pleistocene stiff <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccia</b> over-imposed to ancient lacustrine sediments. The upper portion of the L'Aquila breccia in the area of Via XX Settembre, which borders the southern edge of the top of the morphological terrace of L'Aquila downtown, is irregularly affected by the presence of residual soils known as "red soils" or filling material. The continental deposits are characterized by a velocity inversion at a depth ranging from few tens up to one hundred meters. We performed extensive ambient vibration measurements along the south-western slope of the L'Aquila terrace, where some RC structures without anti-seismic design were heavily damaged during the Mw 6. 3 mainshock. Noise measurements were conducted along several sections starting {{from the top of the}} terrace toward the base of the Aterno river valley. The aim was to investigate the relationship between horizontal-to-vertical amplitude spectra ratio (H/V method) with the geological and geomorphological variations existing along the flanks of the L'Aquila terrace. We also performed noise measurements within some open underground caves that are present along the slope of the calcareous terrace. We integrate our geophysical data with the available geological, geotechnical and geophysical data, performed for the seismic microzonation and the reconstruction of the damaged buildings. We find that the resonance frequency is varying from about 0. 6 to 1 Hz for sites at the top of terrace and in proximity of the Aterno river valley, respectively. Larger amplitude of the resonance peak is observed at sites on the top of the terrace rather than the measurements performed at the base. Additionally, the H/V curves at the bottom of the L'Aquila terrace show an amplification in a broader frequency band. The variation in the H/V shapes, moving along the flanks of the L'Aquila terrace, is mainly related to a different behavior of the vertical component. Indeed the vertical recordings show a spectral minimum shifted at higher frequency for measurements nearby the Aterno river...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} Holocene a small lake formed by landslide-damming of the Fosso del Lago stream close to Montelago (Sassoferrato, Province of Ancona), {{a village of}} the {{northern}} Marche sector of the Adriatic side of the Umbria-Marche Apennines (central Italy). A targeted comprehensive and multidisciplinary project, consisting of a geomorphological survey, seismic tomography, and sediment core drilling, {{was carried out in}} this area and complemented by radiocarbon dating and pollen analysis. Geomorphological, chronological and paleoenvironmental constraints for the lake formation, evolution and extinction, also accounting for some apparently contradictory information from the Gregorian Cadastre (1816 - 1835 AD), were thus obtained and are presented and discussed in this work. We propose an evolutionary frame where the damming landslide (Montelago Landslide, MLL) is the reactivation of a larger «first time landslide» post-dating the upper Pleistocene coldest stages. Large amounts of <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccia</b> boulders incorporated into the MLL runout caused an effective stream blockage and the formation of a small lake. The radiocarbon dating of the lacustrine sediment was useful for roughly constraining the landslide blockage at about the Boreal-Atlantic transition. Both the stream blockage and some secondary landslide movements brought about important changes in the Fosso del Lago catchment. Besides the production of the lacustrine trough, key modifications include a marked convexity of the longitudinal stream profile, an associated epigenetic gorge and distinctive knickpoints on residual landslide boulders. Our study allowed the reconstruction of a preliminary Holocene pollen sequence that, to date, is unique for this sector of the Central Apennines. The pollen record revealed that in the Montelago site, a pre-forest environment with Corylus, Ulmus, Fraxinus and Tilia characterizes the early stages of lake existence and is followed by a beech forest expansion culminating at about 6640 - 6490 cal. BP with a delayed spread of Abies. Starting from 5910 - 5750 cal. BP, an increasing human agro-forestry-pastoral activity is recorded in association with beech forest reduction and concomitant expansion of xerofile and herbaceous taxa. The major environmental modifications recorded by the sediment core can be related to climate changes as well as to human activity, displaying both specific behaviours and similarities with already known sites of the Mediterranean area. Although the age of the landslide-dammed lake extinction is not strictly constrained, it is yet ascertained that the water pond represented in the 19 th century Gregorian cadastral maps a little further upstream the paleolake site, far from being a relic of the landslide-dammed lake, is rather a small man-made reservoir dug long after the former lake dried up...|$|E
40|$|Outcropping strike-slip faults in Cretaceous peritidal limestones (Altamura Fm.) display {{different}} type of <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccia</b> present either within isolated pockets or continuous volumes surrounding the main slip surfaces. Furthermore, original neptunian dikes and sheared neptunian dikes infilled with bauxite-rich matrix and limestone fragments are along walls and pavements of inactive quarries of the Altamura area (Murge area, Italy). In this work, {{we focus on the}} distribution, geometry, texture and composition of representative sheared neptunian dikes and tectonic limestone breccias to investigate the role exerted by Cretaceour neptunian dikes on nucleation and growth of strike-slip faults within tight layered limestones. In fact, during post-Cretaceous tectonics some of the 10 ’s of cm to m-thick neptunian dikes have been sheared, either right- or left-laterally, deforming its original fabric. At the same time, cataclastic deformation of intact limestones took place, at very shallow depths, within the evolving fault zones forming tectonic breccias. The sheared neptunain dikes are sub-vertical open fissures infilled matrix-supported monomictic intraformational clasts embedded within a reddish hematite-bauxite clayish matrix mixed to calcite microsparry cement. Clasts are from cm- to dm-sized, sub-angular to angular and, overall, quite unsorted. In contrast, tectonic breccias consist of either isolated pockets (along m-offset faults) or continuous, at the mesoscale, volumes (10 ’s of m-offset faults) of cm- to 10 ’s of cm-sized, angular to sub-rounded clasts embedded within a calcite marix and often reddish bauxite matrix. Generally, the overall clast size decreases {{in the vicinity of the}} main slip surfaces. Meso- and microscopic evidence clearly indicate that clasts are due to comminution processes. The results of mineralogic analysis conducted on selected samples of sheared neptunian dikes show that the red matrix and cements are mainly made up of quartz, calcite, kaolinite, hematite and goethite. Differently, the results of similar analyses conducted on samples of tectonic limestone breccias are consistent with calcite and iron oxides. The different mineralogic and textural composition of the two aforementioned elements well portray the variety of breccia distribution along the major, 10 ’s of m-offset fault zones present in the area. In fact the two different rocks show dissimilar grain matrix ratio and clast shape. The conclusions of this study can be discussed in terms of the control exerted by pre-existing deformation on karst evolution. The study fault zone, actually, show evidences of multiple stages of karst development. Many features such as fracturing, brecciation and cementation suggest that subsurface fluid flow was strongly localized within these evolving fault zones. Faults with presence of remnants of former neptunian dikes can be inferred as a local barriers to fluid flow due to the presence of terrigenous materials chacterised by clay minerals. In contrast, faults in which the fault core is entirely made up of tectonic breccia the abundance of coarse and angular particles ensures efficient transmissibility...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} of fossil carbonates as products of microbial chemosynthesis associated with fluid and hydrocarbon venting {{at the sea}} floor (chemoherms) {{has been linked to}} two main indicators (Sakai et al., 1992; Terzi et al., 1994; Kelly et al., 1995; Corselli and Basso 1996) : the marked depletion in carbon isotope composition of the authigenic carbonates and the low diversity/high abundance of benthic chemosymbiotic communities (densely packed mussels and clam bivalves, gastropods, tube worms). Nevertheless, not all methane-derived carbonates enclose remains of large chemosymbiotic taxa, making the {{recognition of}} unfossiliferous methanogenetic limestones in the field problematic. Recently, new studies (Cavagna et al., 1998; Conti and Fontana, 1998) have shown that other diagnostic criteria, such as geometric, sedimentologic and compositional characteristics, can be useful in the identification of fossil seep environments and associated carbonates. In particular, brecciated structures and fluid-flow conduits, which frequently occur in methane-related carbonates, are of outstanding importance in connecting fluid ventings, slumping of pelitic sediments and tectonics. Indeed, these structures could permit the reinterpretation of many chaotic deposits as due to diapiric processes. Carbonate deposits bearing fossil chemosynthetic assemblages are concentrated in middle-late Miocene of the northern Apennines and are found in various domains and basin types (Vai and Ricci Lucchi, 1994; Conti and Fontana, 1998) : from internal tectonic zones (Epiligurian basins) to external ones (foredeep). Enclosing sediments are mudstones, muddy sandstones and marlstones; commonly they have low permeability but are severely fractured. They are present in syntectonic deposits, related to compression and thrusting of the Apennine chain. In the foredeep, chemoherms are moderately reworked and concentrated in slumped pelitic horizons, suggesting a close relationship between sediment instability and hydrocarbon-fluid venting. Field and petrographic examination of methane-derived carbonates permits different lithofacies to be recognized: light blue to dark grey micritic limestones, biomicritic marly limestones, light brown to grey calcareous marls, fine to coarse calcarenites, calcarenitic limestones and various types of <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccias</b> and fractured limestones...|$|R

The Guerrero Terrane in southwestern Mexico {{is divided into}} three subterranes: from west to east: the Zihuatanejo-Huetamo subterrane, Arceha - Palmar Chico subterrane, and Teloloapan subterrane. [...] This thesis research targets the Teloloapan subterrane and is aimed at establishing its stratigraphy, sedimentology, petrography and geochemistry as the basis for an improved understanding of its tectonic history. The Teloloapan subterrane contains a thick Lower Cretaceous age sequence of volcanic, volcaniclastic, and carbonate rocks (the arc-related succession), which is covered by Upper Cretaceous mostly deep-water siliciclastic rocks (the sedimentary cover successions). All rocks are strongly deformed. [...] The arc-related succession contains three formations (Villa Ayala, Acapetlahuaya and Teloloapan formations) showing concordant and transitional boundaries. Facies analysis of the Villa Ayala and Acapetlahuaya formations (Berriasian-Late Aptian) records the construction of volcanic build-ups and their destruction by gravity-current processes that formed slope-apron deposits. Carbonate rocks of the Teloloapan Formation developed on top of extinct volcanoes and formed an Aptian-Albian carbonate platform. [...] The Miahuatepec and Mezcala formations constitute the sedimentary cover succession. The Mezcala Formation is comprised of interbedded sandstone and shale with minor thin-bedded limestone and <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccias.</b> The Miahuatepec Formation is a thick sequence of interbedded sandstone and shale with minor thin-bedded limestone. Facies analysis shows both units were deposited by low- to high- concentration turbidity currents on the middle to lower parts of submarine fans. [...] Volcaniclastic and epiclastic sandstones from the arc-related succession are rich in volcanic lithic grains derived from contemporaneous volcanic source. They have an undissected to transitional arc provenance (terminology of W. R. Dickinson). Geochemical data indicate a mafic to felsic volcanic source with a calc-alkaline affinity. REE patterns {{are similar to those of}} evolved intraoceanic arcs. [...] Sandstones from the Mezcala Formation show quartzolithic and carbonate-rich petrofacies, while the sandstones of the Miahuatepec Formation are mainly quartzolithic. Both formations were derived by erosion of volcanic sources and have a transitional to dissected arc provenance. The Mezcala Formation also has a coeval formations contribution from the erosion of platform carbonates of the Teloloapan Formation. Geochemistry of the Miahuatepec Formation supports a calc-alkaline volcanic source with REE pattems similar to those of evolved intraoceanic arcs.

Hence, {{the lower part of the}} TE section documents early presence of hominids in Europe and constituted an important element in the understanding of human dispersions out-of-Africa. The middle phase (TE 15 -TE 19) dated to Middle Pleistocene and it is further sud-divided into a basal part (TE 15 -TE 17), still largely unexplored, but no vertebrate fossil record is present at this levels. Units TE 18, and mainly TE 19 unit, date to late Middle Pleistocene, and contain an abundant record of large mammals as well as stone tools included in <b>calcareous</b> <b>breccias.</b> The TE 19 G level contains abundant pieces of charcoal, though verification of its antropic character is pending. Finally, the third and last sedimentary phase (TE 20 and TE 21) date to Last Pleistocene and it defined the final infilling of the cavity and soil formation. The chronological intervals represented in the fertile levels of the Sima del Elefante enlarge the temporal and biostratigraphic local succession at the Atapuerca Hill complex. The lower phase was deposited in a time previous to the lower levels from Gran Dolina site (TD 4), whereas the TE upper levels possibly correspond to a moment later than the sedimentation of Galería GIII/GIV, and Gran Dolina TD 10 /TD 11. In addition, the structural features of the TE site together with its sedimentary and arqueo-paleontological record allow the eventual exploration of problems that remain unresolved in other Atapuerca cave sites. El yacimiento de la Sima del Elefante (TE) (Atapuerca, España) se localiza en el extremo sur de la trinchera del ferrocarril de la Sierra de Atapuerca. TE constituye una sección transversal de una antigua galería kárstica totalmente colmatada de sedimentos pleistocenos. La secuencia estratigráfica completa alcanza los 25 m de potencia y ha sido dividida en 21 unidades lito-estratigráficas delimitadas por discontinuidades mayores. La historia de la cavidad puede ordenarse en al menos tres fases. La fase inferior (niveles TE 8 a TE 14) data del tercio final del Pleistoceno Inferior, con una cronología entre 1. 1 y 1. 4 millones de años. Es rica en registro arqueo-paleontológico y presenta claras evidencias de actividad antrópica. Dada su cronología, los niveles inferiores de TE representan un importante referente para la comprensión de la primera colonización humana de Europa. La fase intermedia la constituyen las unidades TE 15 a TE 19. El tramo basal de esta segunda fase de relleno (TE 15 a TE 17) hasta la fecha no ha deparado contenido fósil. El tramo superior (TE 18 y TE 19), cuya cronología parece corresponder a la parte final del Pleistoceno Medio, es rica en restos de grandes mamíferos e industria lítica sobre sílex y cuarcita. La unidad TE 19 se caracteriza por una sucesión de coladas detríticas (“debris-flow”) (TE 19 A a TE 19 G), con matriz muy dura y carbonatada, rica en huesos de grandes mamíferos y ausencia de micromamíferos. El nivel TE 19 G contiene abundantes restos de carbón pendiente de verificar su posible carácter antrópico. Finalmente, la tercera y última fase de relleno (TE 20 y TE 21) corresponde al Pleistoceno superior y se define por la colmatación final de la cavidad y formación de un horizonte edáfico. Los intervalos cronológicos representados en los niveles fértiles de la Sima del Elefante (TE) complementan la secuencia cronológica y bioestratigráfica local del complejo Atapuerca. La fase inferior de TE tuvo lugar en un tiempo anterior a los niveles inferiores de Gran Dolina (TD 4), mientras que el relleno de las unidades superiores de TE corresponde a un momento posterior a la sedimentación de GIII/GIV de Galería y TD 10 /TD 11 de Gran Dolina...|$|R
40|$|The Noggin Cove Formation {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fragmental mafic volcanic rocks with subordinate pillowed basalt and black shale. Massive volcanic conglomerates and coarse sandstones, with lesser amounts of medium-bedded tuffs and lapilli breccias, dominate the fragmental rocks. Volcanic conglomerates and coarse-grained sandstones were predominantly deposited as subaqueous debris flows, {{some of which}} are spectacular in terms of their thickness and clast size. [...] The volume of fragmental rocks relative to basaltic lavas indicates an explosive volcanic source; ubiquitous vesicular clasts indicate shallow marine to subareal eruption. Debris flow conglomerates and sandstones dominate southern exposures but in the north they are subordinate to basaltic lavas and shallow marine deposits (highly <b>calcareous</b> tuffs and <b>breccias).</b> This distribution implies fragmental rocks were transported southward to form a marine volcaniclastic apron over pillow lavas, lava flows and basaltic dykes. [...] The Carmanville Melange consists mainly of sandstone, siltstone and mafic volcanic clasts and blocks in a black shale matrix. Melange is interbedded and interfolded with volcanic rocks of the underlying Noggin Cove Formation and with siltstones and sandstones of the overlying Woody Island Siltstone. In many cases, folded beds of siltstone can be seen within the black shale matrix. The melange is interpreted as olistostromal. [...] The Noggin Cove Formation and Carmanville Melange have undergone at least three stages of folding. D₂ deformation is the most intense, resulting in a very strong northeast trending cleavage which is axial planar to tight to isoclinal folds. Microprobe, SEM and textural analyses show that greenschist facies metamorphism and subsequent contact metamorphism have extensively altered the volcanic rocks of the Noggin Cove Formation. [...] Rifting is indicated by the debris flows of the Noggin Cove Formation and by olistostromes of the Carmanville Melange and Woody Island Siltstone. An arc to back-arc geochemical transition matches the stratigraphic record of rifting. The arc to back-arc succession is correlated with the Exploits and Wild Bight groups of the western Exploits Subzone...|$|R
40|$|SEDIMENTOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY OF EL BIERZO (NW SPAIN) The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study sedimentation in an intramontane basin in its relation to the relief of the surrounding mountain area. El Bierzo, an intramontane basin in NE Spain, is partly filled by continental Tertiary sediments whose age is thought to be Vindobonian on the basis of comparison with those of the Duero basin. These deposits were analysed by sedimentological methods: determination of grain-size, grain roundness, pebble composition, mineralogy of the light and heavy fractions and of the clays (by x-ray). In some places the Tertiairy deposits overlie deeply weathered Paleozoic rocks, considered to be the C-horizon of paleosols of Tertiary age from which the red and more clayey A and B zones have disappeared. The latter, together with unweathered rocks, are thought to be the source material of the Tertiary beds. Five different facies have been distinguished in the Miocene deposits. In the SW there are red-brown conglomerates with pebbles consisting partially of shale (Las Médulas facies). The main mass of the basin sediments are mostly silts and clayey silts with some gravels, the sandy fractions again consisting mainly of shale fragments (Santalla facies). These deposits are therefore thought to derive from the the same source as those of Las Médulas and to represent the finer fractions which were transported farther. Near the borders of the basin there are some local grey <b>calcareous</b> deposits containing <b>breccias</b> that are assumed to have been formed near faults (Vega de Espinareda facies). On top of the beds in the Santalla facies there are again local conglomerates of a more yellow colour (Fresnedo facies). The Astorga-facies, lastly, forms a transition to the deposits of the Duero basin in the E; it contains red conglomerates as well as sands and silts. Among the clay minerals, illite usually predominates as in the source rocks, but in the stagnant waters of the basin centre montmorillonite was formed as well. Towards the E there is an increasing kaolinite content, and in one case a considerable amount of attapulgite was found. The heavy minerals are {{for the most part the}} common resistant species, with the addition of anatase (which occurs in lateritic soils) in the Astorga facies. These facts suggest that the Tertiary soil-forming processes were more intense (i. e. lateritic in type) in the eastern part than in the Bierzo basin proper. Sedimentation started when some parts of the Miocene relief, covered by a thick soil, began to rise and were partly eroded, and others subsided so as to form an area of sedimentation. Remains of the Early Miocene topography are preserved in various places as surfaces with low relief on which remainders of Tertiary deposits and deep weathering are found. The most important of these is the Brañuelas surface, a plateau separating the Bierzo from the Duero basin. This plateau must once have been covered by Miocene sediments, which means that the deposits of both areas were connected and that drainage took place towards the E. After the tectonic movements that affected the Bierzo basin towards the end of the Miocene, the connection was severed and the drainage direction was reversed to the W. Later, probably during the Villafranchian, pediments on the lower slopes of the uplifted mountain masses were covered by thin angular gravels(raña’s) and fanglomerates, and the erosion surfaces were remodelled. During the remainder of the Quaternary, five terrace levels were formed in the easily erocable deposits of the Bierzo, and the partial evacuation of the basin deposits was accomplished...|$|R
