5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess cellulase, which by softening plant cell walls makes plant <b>cell</b> <b>contents</b> accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E

Yet, there is little information on changes in satellite <b>cell</b> <b>content</b> from birth to old age in humans. The present study defines muscle fiber type-specific satellite <b>cell</b> <b>content</b> in human skeletal muscle tissue over the entire lifespan. Muscle biopsies were collected in 165 subjects, from different muscles of children undergoing surgery (3 ̆c 18 years; n[*]=[*] 13) and from the vastus lateralis muscle of young adult (18 – 49 years; n[*]=[*] 50), older (50 – 69 years; n[*]=[*] 53), and senescent subjects (70 – 86 years; n[*]=[*] 49). In a subgroup of 51 aged subjects (71 [*]±[*] 6 years), additional biopsies were collected after 12 weeks of supervised resistance-type exercise training. Immunohistochemistry was applied to assess skeletal muscle fiber type-specific composition, size, and satellite <b>cell</b> <b>content.</b> From birth to adulthood, muscle fiber size increased tremendously with no major changes in muscle fiber satellite <b>cell</b> <b>content,</b> and no differences between type I and II muscle fibers. In contrast to type I muscle fibers, type II muscle fiber size was substantially smaller with increasing age in adults (r[*]=[*]− 0. 56; P[*] 3 ̆c [*] 0. 001). This was accompanied by an age-related reduction in type II muscle fiber satellite <b>cell</b> <b>content</b> (r[*]=[*]− 0. 57; P[*] 3 ̆c [*] 0. 001). Twelve weeks of resistance-type exercise training significantly increased type II muscle fiber size and satellite <b>cell</b> <b>content.</b> We conclude that type II muscle fiber atrophy with aging is accompanied by a specific decline in type II muscle fiber satellite <b>cell</b> <b>content.</b> Resistance-type exercise training represents an effective strategy to increase satellite <b>cell</b> <b>content</b> and reverse type II muscle fiber atrophy...|$|R

Male E. imperialis typically ignore members of other species, both bees and animals, in the immediate area of their perch and vicinity of their territories.

25|$|Diversified Technologies Inc. {{has created}} a patent pending {{pre-treatment}} option to reduce costs of oil extraction from algae. This technology, called Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) technology, is a low cost, low energy process that applies high voltage electric pulses to a slurry of algae. The electric pulses enable the algal cell walls to be ruptured easily, increasing the availability of all <b>cell</b> <b>contents</b> (Lipids, proteins and carbohydrates), allowing the separation into specific components downstream. This alternative method to intracellular extraction has shown the capability to be both integrated in-line as well as scalable into high yield assemblies. The Pulse Electric Field subjects the algae to short, intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation in a treatment chamber, electroporating the cell walls. The formation of holes in the cell wall allows the contents within to flow into the surrounding solution for further separation. PEF technology only requires 1-10 microsecond pulses, enabling a high-throughput approach to algal extraction.|$|E

40|$|Lung cancer {{encompasses}} multiple malignant epithelial tumour types, {{each with}} specific targetable, potentially actionable mutations, such that precision management mandates accurate tumour typing. Molecular characterisation studies require high tumour <b>cell</b> <b>content</b> and low necrosis content, yet lung cancers are frequently a heterogeneous mixture of tumour and stromal cells. We hypothesised {{that there may}} be systematic differences in tumour <b>cell</b> <b>content</b> according to histological subtype, and that this may have implications for tumour banks as a resource for comprehensive molecular characterisation studies in lung cancer. To investigate this, we estimated tumour <b>cell</b> and necrosis <b>content</b> of 4267 samples resected from 752 primary lung tumour specimens contributed to a lung tissue bank.
