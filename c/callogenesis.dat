40|$|<b>Callogenesis</b> {{and somatic}} {{embryogenesis}} (SE) {{are influenced by}} several factors including climate and phenology. To assess such an influence, the percentage of <b>callogenesis</b> and SE variations depending on five climatic and two phenological parameters was measured for 2 years. Staminodes and petals from six hybrids and two clones as controls were cultured in bulk, onto three distinct calli induction media only differing in hormonal concentrations. From the results, it emerged that sole leaves flush does not vary from year to year. Maximal temperature and flowering level are the most stably linked. Non-linear regression provides the best R 2 -values of fitted curves. This shows that the link among climate, phenology, <b>callogenesis</b> and SE is not linear. In the first year, in control clones, climatic and phenological parameters explain 52. 80 % <b>callogenesis</b> variations, against 31. 50 % for SE. Therefore, climate and phenology significantly influence <b>callogenesis,</b> but not SE. For further industrial production of secondary metabolites such as butter, theobromin and chocolate aroma from calli, it would be desirable also to identify the favourable periods for calli production. Nevertheless, somatic embryos {{will continue to be}} produced all the year irrespective of period. Key Words: Côte d’Ivoire, petals, staminodes RÉSUM...|$|E

40|$|Studying explants {{affected}} by Agrobacterium rhizogenes {{shows that in}} addition to possible formation of hairy roots, it is likely that <b>callogenesis</b> can be induced in these tissues. The T-DNA region of A. rhizogenes codes enzymes that participate in biosynthesis of plants growth hormones. These hormones also affect <b>callogenesis,</b> hence, the formation of various calluses with different morphological properties are possible. It is very likely that the level of biosynthetic growth hormone, the plasmid carried by each bacteria strain, the position of T-DNA, and the level of gene expression contribute to this morphologic variation. In this study, the root explants of four species of the family Solanaceae namely Atropa belladonna, Datura metel, D. stramonium and Hyoscyamus niger were induced by using different strains of A. rhizogenes (A 4, A 7, AR 15834, AR 318, AR 9402 and AR 9543). Some of these explants entered callus phase and formed various calluses with different colors and shapes. Moreover, in some callus samples hairy roots were also appeared. These variations were probably caused by variations in the levels and ratios of auxin and cytokinine hormons after the induction.

40|$|While <b>callogenesis</b> in {{date palm}} can be {{initiated}} by culturing immature leaf segments on medium containing 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), {{it is difficult}} to obtain callus from certain genotypes. To better understand the mechanisms of <b>callogenesis</b> in date palm, we studied the developmental events underlying this process at the cellular level. The callogenic capacity of leaf segments depends on the state of cell differentiation. The most callogenic segments were within the leaf elongation zone, required polar auxin transport to initiate <b>callogenesis</b> and contained the highest quantities of free endogenous indole- 3 -acetic acid. At the cellular level, callus induction involves two spatially and temporally separated events. The first event involves cells from the fascicular parenchyma in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the vascular axis that within 2 days of culture in the presence of 2, 4 -D, acquire structural and ultrastructural features typically observed in meristematic cells. The second event occurs 3 days later and is characterised by the modification of adjacent perivascular sheath cells. The latter cells become callogenic in that they reinitiated their cell cycles and undergo cell division leading to callus formation.

This study tested single-nodes of a thermo therapied plant that was emerged from a meristem culture of Agria cultivar that had been cultured for micro propagation from leaf and internode explants. Healthy mini tubers from this cultivar were also used to supply explants after surface sterilization. Different explants were cultured on a solid MS medium supplemented with different treatments of BAP, kinetin+ 2, 4 -D, GA 3 and zeatin. Cultures were incubated in darkness at 20 - 22 °C for callus induction and callus emerged on the explants fourteen days after culture. The next stage of the experiment was done following determination of the best hormone treatment for <b>callogenesis.</b> Ordinary callus was stressed by a nutritive element in 1 / 2 Ms, for induction of somatic embryogenesis and incubated in darkness at 20 - 22 °C. Embryogenic callus emerged on ordinary callus after 14 - 20 days. Somatic embryogenesis and regeneration were initiated after 28 days...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Using {{the method}} of micro propagation, {{conditions}} of mass obtaining of somatic clones in in vitro culture have been established for loquat (Eriobotria japonica L.) {{and the effect of}} phytohormones on shoot rooting investigated. Different concentrations of synthetic cytokinin- benzylaminopurine (BAP) and auxin- 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (1 -NAA) and their different combinations were tested. Cytokinin at low concentration (8 mkM) stimulated apical morphogenesis, which was less expressed when adding higher concentrations of BAP – 12 - 26 mkM or 20 - 24 mkM to the cultivation medium. It has been revealed that introduction of auxin together with cytokinin into the cultivation medium caused an intensive <b>callogenesis</b> in the basal part of the main shoot. <b>Callogenesis</b> was more active in the case of 3 mkM concentration of 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid as compared to 1 mkM concentration of the same growth regulator. The latter concentration of 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid turned out to be most favorable for the expression of morphogenetic potential of the callus. As to the influence of phytohormones on the rooting of regenerated shoots, indolebutyric acid (IBA) at 5 mkM proved to be the most effective of all growth regulators used. The index of rooting of regenerated shoots attained 80 - 90 % in this variant. © 2009 Bull. Georg. Natl. Acad. Sci.

After 4 weeks, {{the best results}} were observed with 0. 54 microM alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid and 2. 22 microM benzyladenine. On this medium, the rate of regeneration depended on seedling age and agar concentration. The highest number of shoots per explant {{was obtained}} with small cuttings from 30 -day-old seedlings grown on a medium containing 8 g/l of agar. Regeneration success was also dependent on explant size. When longer explants (7 - 20 mm) were cut from the main root, direct regeneration was obtained in two weeks. These cuttings also generated shoots through <b>callogenesis</b> in four weeks but always in lower quantities than with direct regeneration, whatever the seedling age. Here also, the best regeneration was obtained with cuttings from 30 -day-old seedlings maintained on a medium with 8 g/l of agar. Regenerants were rooted on growth-regulator-free Murashige and Skoog medium and then acclimatized in a greenhouse.

Para o controle da calogênese de Caesalpinia echinata, foram usados discos de foliólolos do pau-brasil em diferentes fases de desenvolvimento combinados com os fitorreguladores 2, 4 -D (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 mg/L) e 6 -BAP (2, 0 mg/L), cultivados em meio de cultura de Murashige e Skoog (1962) acrescido de sacarose (30 g/L), mioinositol (100 mg/L) e ágar (7, 5 g/L). Foi testado, também, o efeito de 6 -BAP (0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 0 e 10 mg/L) no crescimento de ápices meristemáticos. Foliólolos juvenis cultivados com baixa concentração de 2, 4 -D (5 e 20 mg/L) e foliólolos jovens tratados com altas concentrações de 2, 4 -D (50 e 100 mg/L) geraram calos sem diferenças significativas entre luz e escuro. Quanto ao controle da oxidação, melhores resultados foram proporcionados pelo carvão ativado, porém inibidores da calogênese. A transferência dos calos do meio de cultura MS com altas concentrações de 2, 4 -D (5, 0; 10, 0; e 20, 0 mg/L) para meio sem fitorreguladores estimulou a formação de massas pró-embrionárias (MPEs). Os meios livres de fitorreguladores, 2, 0 mg/L de 2, 4 -D e 0, 5 mg/L de 2, 4 -D elevaram o número de calos embriogênicos e de massas pré-embrionárias. Somente em 0, 5 mg/L 2, 4 -D se verificaram algumas estruturas semelhantes a embriões somáticos nas fases {{globular}} e codiforme. The present work {{dealt with}} the in vitro control of <b>callogenesis</b> of brazilwood. The induction of <b>callogenesis</b> {{is the first step}} to obtain embryos and seeds. In order to control the <b>callogenesis</b> of Caesalpinia echinata, leaf discs of brazilwood in different developmental stages were used combined with the growth regulators 2, 4 -D (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 mg/L) and 6 -BAP (2, 0 mg/L), cultivated in the Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium supplemented with sucrose (30 g/L), myo-inositol (100 mg/L) and agar (7, 5 g/L). The effect of 6 -BAP (0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 2, 0, 5, 0 and 10 mg/L) on the growth of meristematic shoot apexes was also tested. Juvenile leaves cultured with low concentrations of 2, 4 -D (5 and 20 mg/L) and young leaves treated with high concentrations of 2, 4 -D (50 and 100 mg/L) produced callus, without presenting significant differences between light and dark. As for the oxidation control, the best results were provided by activated charcoal, which inhibited <b>callogenesis.</b> The transfer of callus from the MS culture medium with high concentrations of 2, 4 -D (5, 0, 10, 0 and 20, 0 mg/L) to the medium without growth regulators stimulated the formation of pro-embryonic masses (PEMs). The media without growth regulators, 2, 0 mg/L of 2, 4 -D and 0, 5 mg/L of 2, 4 -D, increased the number of embryogenic calluses and pre-embryonic masses.

The culture medium, supplemented with 3. 0 % sucrose and 0. 7 % agar, was enriched with naftalenacetic acid (NAA), 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) and gibberellic acid (GA 3) at different concentrations. Explants were superficially disinfested by immersing them in 70 % (v/v) ethanol for 2 minutes and then in 10 % of 0. 4 % (w/v) NaOCl for 20 minutes or in 0. 05 % (w/v) mercuric chloride for 20 minutes. Subsequently all the explants were rinsed repeatedly in a solution of 50 mg L- 1 ascorbic acid in distilled-sterile water. The cultures were placed in sterile petri plates and incubated in a growth chamber at 231 °C in the dark or light and dark (16 / 8 h) condition. The substrate was renewed every 30 - 40 days for the increase in biomass. <b>Callogenesis</b> varied in response to hormonal concentrations and combinations. Callus formation was excellent using the combinations with the three growth regulators. According to this, the presence of auxin is indispensable to promote <b>callogenesis</b> in artichoke, while no significant statistical differences were observed between the explants grown {{in the dark and}} under 16 h photoperiod. The highest callus growth was registered in the dark by applying the lowest concentration of auxin, cytokinin and gibberellic acid.
