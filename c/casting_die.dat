40|$|Abstract: The {{die casting}} {{industry}} has an imperative {{need for an}} automated or semi-automated approach for die <b>casting</b> <b>die</b> design. One of the key challenges that die makers face is how to shorten the lead-time to the market and reduce the cost in die design and manufacturing. Most die makers have employed computer aided design (CAD) systems to improve the e¤ciency and quality of die design. However, conventional CAD systems {{do not have the}} functionality specially for the die <b>casting</b> <b>die</b> design, therefore, a speci®c computer aided system for die <b>casting</b> <b>die</b> design is needed to meet the market demand. This paper describes a prototype system structured by several functional modules as speci®c add-on applications on a commercial CAD system for die <b>casting</b> <b>die</b> design. These modules include data initialization, cavity layout, gating system design, die-base, parting, standard component design, etc. Focus of the development will be placed on gating, runner and die-base design...|$|E

The light pipe is linked to an optic fibre, which is connected to a monochromatic pyrometer. Thermocouples and pyrometer measurements are recorded with a data logger. A high pressure die <b>casting</b> <b>die</b> was instrumented with one such gauge. A set of 150 castings was done and the data recorded. During the casting, some process parameters have been modified such as piston velocity, intensification pressure, delay before switch to the intensification stage, temperature of the alloy, etc [...] The data was treated with an inverse method in order to transform temperature measurements into heat flux density and {{heat transfer}} coefficient plots. The piston velocity and the initial temperature of the die seem to be the process parameters that have the greatest influence on the heat transfer. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thixo <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> of Al alloy is {{suitable}} for complicated {{large parts of the}} near net shape with less defect and excellent mechanical properties in comparison with conventional liquid metal <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> processes. To manufacture products with high performance, the reheating conditions, the <b>casting</b> plan, the <b>die</b> design, the injection conditions, the defect analysis, and the quantitative evaluation of mechanical properties are required.
