40|$|The {{phenomenon}} whereby some {{plant species}} display a river corridor distribution pattern {{has long been}} recognized but is still poorly understood. The goals {{of this study were}} to supplement the list of river <b>corridor</b> <b>plants</b> for Central Europe, analyse their habitats and compare their ecological features with those of their widely distributed counterparts. The ATPOL (Atlas of Poland) database was used to compile a list of river <b>corridor</b> <b>plants</b> of Poland and calculate their river corridor-specificity indices (RCSIs). The Ellenberg indicator values, dispersal modes and life forms of river corridor and widely distributed species were compared using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Eighty-five species were classified as river corridor species. The most numerous habitat groups were meadow species (19 %), wet-habitat therophytes (15 %), riverside tall herbs (13 %) and species of dry, sandy soils (12 %). These species had mostly requirements for a higher temperature and alkalinity than widespread species. Among river <b>corridor</b> <b>plants,</b> there were a few eurytopic species. Corridor species had usually only one life form and less dispersal modes than widespread species. Hence, specific demands of <b>corridor</b> <b>plants</b> and lower phenotypic plasticity may explain their restricted geographical distribution.

The analysis {{was based on the}} results of a detailed mapping on a 50 km-long section of the Lower San River valley (366 cartogram cells of 1 square km). Selected species were divided into two groups: (1) strictly and (2) loosely confined to river <b>corridors.</b> River <b>corridor</b> <b>plants</b> were found throughout the valley (river channel, active and historical floodplain, older terraces, slopes); however, their frequency was diverse in particular areas. The highest concentrations were observed on the floodplain. Their number decreased towards the border areas of the valley. Species which were less confined to rivers were found more frequently in the valley (one species occupied, on average, 12. 9 % of grid cells), than plants strictly confined to the river system (one species occupied, on average, 5. 9 % of grid cells); however, the ranges of species of the second group were more restricted to the Holocene part of the valley, especially to the floodplain. River <b>corridor</b> <b>plants</b> were, ecologically, a highly diversified group.

40|$|In Central Europe, {{more than}} 100 {{vascular}} plant species are exclusively or predomi-nantly {{confined to the}} basins of large rivers: the so-called river <b>corridor</b> <b>plants.</b> As the natural habitats along the rivers have been destroyed and degraded by the regulation of watercourses, the building of dikes, land reclamation and agricultural intensification, they may account for an above-average proportion of endangered species. Due to the fragmentation of their habitats, many populations are small and highly isolated and this may threaten the viability of populations. The degree {{and the way in}} which species are impacted can vary between species or groups of species, respectively, depending on their traits, such as their distribution pattern or their life-form. The aim of this study was therefore to find a general pattern reflecting the fragmentation effects on perennial river <b>corridor</b> <b>plants</b> and to advise conservation measurements for these species. The study was carried out in the highly fragmented floodplains of the Weser and Elbe systems in North-western Germany. The first objective of the study was to assess the effects of habitat fragmentation on the extinction of populations and the changes in population sizes of four endangered perennial river corridor plants: Euphorbia palustris, Pseudolysimachion longifolium, Sanguisorba officinalis und Senecio paludosus. High extinction rates of small populations (&# 8804; 25 individuals) could be identified as the most probable cause for the decline of the species studied while the isolation of populations had no effect. Sudden environmental stochasticity induced by human activity, such as land reclamation, changes in land use, or utilization of pesticides, may have led to extinction in the short-term. If conditions stay unchanged, nearly all of the surveyed populations will have become in less than 120 years. This also includes the large populations (> 100 individuals) even though they have a much higher chance of survival or even growth to a size of 1000 individuals and more. In a next step, we analyzed whether the negative effects of habitat fragmentation would reduce reproduction in fragmented populations of Euphorbia palustris, Lathyrus palustis, Pseudolysimachion longifolium, Sanguisorba officinalis and Senecio paludosus and would thus lead to extinction of populations in the long-term, too. Reproductive success of all species studied was reduced in small but not always in isolated populations. This is possibly due to limited pollination and/or the loss of genetic variation. In a following investigation on E. palustris, the loss of genetic variation in small populations was, however, not clearly confirmed and this was probably caused by the longevity of the species. Overall, the effects of habitat quality, such as light availability, soil parameters and parameters of the surrounding vegetation, on the survival and the reproduction of the species studied were considerably less pronounced compared to the effects of population size. However, the recruitment of populations of E. palustris was determined by gaps in the vegetation and a relatively high content of organic matter in the soil, both indicating abundant winterly floodings. Consequently, most populations are static and aged since they are completely cut off from the dynamics of the river due to the construction of dikes. Further investigations on E. palustris over three years showed, that the relationships between reproductive success, population size, genetic variation, and habitat quality varied depending on the weather conditions of each growing season. Thus, studies concerning the impact of habitat fragmentation on the fitness of plant populations should preferably be based on surveys conducted over several consecutive years. In conclusion, river <b>corridor</b> <b>plants</b> are highly threatened by habitat fragmentation and will be further on the decline throughout the study area. The following management measures based on the findings of this study should be included in a conservation plan of this species group to stop or reverse this development: increase of population area and sizes, improvement of the connectivity between populations, re-attachment of habitats to natural river dynamics, utilisation of restored flood plains for reintroduction or introduction of species...|$|R
40|$|The {{group of}} river <b>corridor</b> <b>plants</b> (RCP) {{includes}} vascular plant species which grow mainly or {{exclusively in the}} valleys of large rivers. Despite the long recognized fact that some plant species display a corridorlike distribution pattern in Central Europe, {{there is still no}} exhaustive explanation of the mechanisms generating this peculiar distribution. The main goal of this study was therefore to investigate whether arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and fungal root endophytes influence the RCP distribution. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) were observed in 19 out of 33 studied RCP. Dark septate endophytes (DSE) and Olpidium spp. were recorded with low abundance in 15 and 10 plant species, respectively. The spores of AMF were found only in 32 % of trap cultures established from the soils collected in the river corridor habitats. In total, six widespread AMF species were identified. Because the percentage of non-mycorrhizal species in the group of RCP is significant and the sites in river corridors are characterized by low AMF species diversity, RCP can be outcompeted outside river valleys by the widespread species that are able to benefit from AM associations in more stable plant-AMF communities in non-river habitats...|$|R

This study attempts to link habitat enhancements, biodiversity and changes in ecosystem functions by: 1. inventorying the existing biodiversity and the associated belowground community structure and composition in the various habitats of an organic farm in California’s Central Valley; and 2. monitoring key ecosystem functions of these habitats. Two years of inventories show greater native plant diversity in non-cropped areas. While nematode diversity did not differ between habitats, functional groups were clearly associated with particular habitats as were soil microbial communities (phospholipid fatty acid analysis). Earthworm diversity did not differ between habitats, but biomass was higher in non-cropped areas. Habitats with woody vegetation stored 20 % of the farmscape’s total carbon (C), despite their relatively small size (only 5 % of the total farm). Two years of monitoring data of farmscape C and nitrogen (N) through emissions, run-off and leaching showed distinct tradeoffs in function associated with each habitat.

40|$|Specimens of Viola elatior (VE), V. pumila (VP), and V. stagnina (VS) in 38 Austrian, Czech, and Slovak public herbaria were revised, {{and almost}} 1700 {{specimens}} were found {{from the three}} countries. Apart from VE, the quality of original identifications was rather poor, especially of VS specimens (VS is frequently confused laso with V. canina). This, together with nomenclatural confusion lasting over the whole 19 th century, makes the use of old literature records rather problematic. Hybrids are usually difficult-to-identify, and they are rarer than generally believed. VS and VP have similar distribution patterns: they occur mainly in floodplains of large lowland rivers and adjacent hill countries of the N part of Bohemia, in S and Central Moravia, E Austria, and S Slovakia; they may be classified as river <b>corridor</b> <b>plants.</b> VS differs from VE and VP mainly by its presence in S Bohemia and its absence from large parts of S Slovakia, {{as well as by}} its rarity in Austria and Slovakia. All three species grow predominantly in regions with relatively warm and dry climate: most localities are situated in regions with mean annual temperature 7 – 11 °C and mean annual precipitation 401 – 700 mm. A temporal analysis of records has shown that all three species have been declining in all three countries: generally, this decline has been the weakest in Austria, with 46 – 61 % of grid cells with occurrences confirmed after 1980 (compared with the number of grid cells with records from 1801 – 2008), and the strongest in Slovakia, with 18 – 32 % of grid cells with occurrences confirmed after 1980. The causes of decline include mainly river canalization and subsequent changes in land use, as well as urbanization, and recently also afforestations. VE may also be endangered by modern forestry practices.

40|$|River valleys {{have been}} {{subjected}} to human-induced changes for centuries, but they are still considered regional hotspots of biodiversity. In central Europe, some vascular plant species demonstrate confinement to the corridors of large rivers. They are termed river <b>corridor</b> <b>plants</b> (RCPs). RCPs are an important component of regional biodiversity and include a high proportion of threatened species, thus they deserve attention. Here we examine: (1) the detailed distribution pattern of RCPs within a river valley, (2) the habitat preferences of RCP species, and (3) the correlation between the richness of RCP species and selected variables. The studied variables include: river bed proximity, distance from the river mouth, floodplain coverage, richness of native, red listed and invasive species, and number of habitats considered to be of Europaean Community importance. Surveys were conducted in 10 transects running perpendicularly to the San River bed (Poland, central Europe). Each transect was divided into 14 plots (1 km × 1 km). In each plot, the site locations of RCPs as well as their habitats were recorded. The occurrence of all vascular plant species in a particular plot was also noted. The richness and abundance of RCP species depended on the distance from the river and the floodplain coverage in a plot. The plots located {{in the vicinity of the}} river were the richest in RCP species and usually harbored the largest number of native, red-listed and invasive species. They were also characterized by the largest number of habitats considered to be of importance to the European Community. RCP species differed in the degree of confinement to habitats regarded as typical for them. Some of the RCP species were recorded only within typical habitats while others were found in several different types of habitats, including anthropogenic ones. Knowledge concerning the RCP distribution pattern and its correlates can make restoration initiatives in river valleys more effective. While implementing conservation measures in river valleys, one should keep in mind that: (1) hotspots of RCP and invasive species spatially overlap and (2) anthropogenic linear elements occurring within river valleys constitute important habitats for some RCP species...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{strategies}} for maintaining populations of both plants and animals in fragmented landscapes is to connect isolated patches with thin strips of habitat, called corridors. Corridors are thought to increase the exchange of individuals between habitat patches, promoting genetic exchange and reducing population fluctuations. Empirical studies addressing the effects of corridors have either been small in scale or have ignored confounding effects of increased habitat area created {{by the presence of}} a corridor. These methodological difficulties, coupled with a paucity of studies examining the effects of <b>corridors</b> on <b>plants</b> and plant–animal interactions, have sparked debate over the purported value of corridors in conservation planning. We report results of a large-scale experiment that directly address this debate. In eight large-scale experimental landscapes that control for patch area and test alternative mechanisms of corridor function, we demonstrate that corridors not only increase the exchange of animals between patches, but also facilitate two key plant–animal interactions: pollination and seed dispersal. Our results show that the beneficial effects of corridors extend beyond the area they add, and suggest that increased plant and animal movement through corridors will have positive impacts on plant populations and community interactions in fragmented landscapes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of the Study: A {{number of}} major {{problems}} exist in {{our knowledge of the}} prehistory of the northern Sierra Nevada. Many of these are related to the concept of boundaries between human groups and how they are represented archaeologically. The {{purpose of this study is}} to summarize these problems through discussion of their origins and relation to different schools of archaeological thought, and to apply data obtained from a survey of 14, 000 acres in the northern Sierra to the problems. Procedure: The major prehistoric issues of the northern Sierra Nevada were summarized through a history of archaeological research conducted in northern California and the Great Basin. A number of cultural chronologies were seen as potentially applicable to the survey area, however, there are no precise methods for determining the boundaries of the cultures which make up the chronological sequences and no agreement on what the boundaries represent. Attempts were made to assign sites and artifacts located during the survey to cultures defined in the various chronologies and to determine whether different settlement patterns could be associated with the cultures. Sites were examined in relation to deer migration <b>corridors</b> and <b>plant</b> communities to understand relationships between sites and available resources and to determine whether boundaries were suggested. Lithic material distributions were also examined for their potential as boundary indicators. Findings: Because of the lack of chronological clarity, sites could not be definitively assigned to cultures. Deer migration data refuted previous hypotheses on boundary locations (i. e., that major river canyons served as tribelet boundaries). Lithic materials suggested some boundaries, particularly between the Windmiller Complex in the Central Valley and the Martis Complex in the Sierra. Conclusions: In the northern Sierra, projectile point forms seem to transcend cultural boundaries, although chronological confusion, lack of standardized nomenclature, and disagreement on what constitutes cultural boundaries, make this difficult to discern.

Metacommunity ecology provides a useful framework to answer this question but so far relatively few studies have concerned plant species. Here, we evaluate the connectivity effect of small streams originating in a large forest for plant communities of forest patches within an agricultural landscape. We compared α- and β-diversity of patches connected to a large forest with isolated patches whilst controlling for habitat effects and patch area. Species composition of each patch type was examined with a nonparametric MANOVA and an indicator species analysis. We found that forest patches connected to the main forest through streams were not more species rich after accounting for habitat effects but were more similar than isolated patches, be the latter crossed or not by a stream. Connected patches exhibited a different species composition with more forest habitat specialists and more hydrochores than nonconnected patches. Many forest herb species well known for being dispersal-limited appeared to be efficiently transported by water as incidental hydrochores over long distances and relatively short-time scales. Using streams as ‘high-speed corridors’, these species increased their colonization speed by at least 15 times compared with conventional dispersal. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that streams can act as efficient <b>corridors</b> for <b>plant</b> species across agricultural landscapes and contribute to the dynamics of forest metacommunities. From a management perspective, preserving the longitudinal integrity of streams is likely to increase the connectivity within and between forest metacommunities and can assist dispersal-limited species to be resilient to projected climate warming by increasing their migration speed. Restoring not only wooded elements but watercourse networks is thus a suitable strategy to manage landscapes efficiently for the forest flora conservation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{future of}} {{tropical}} biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes will be conservation and restoration of processes of seed dispersal by birds and mammals. Here the Diversity Storage Hypothesis posits that immense biological diversity resides within skewed species-abundance distributions of tropical trees, and further predicts that many species will adjust to increases of 1. 5 – 3. 0  °C anticipated from climate change by 2100. Common and widespread tropical trees (> 100, 000, 000 individuals) may shift ranges but {{are unlikely to}} face extinction.

After the middle Miocene climatic optimum (MMCO), the Earth climate recorded a progressive cooling trend (Zachos et al. 2001). This reveals a global transformation in biodiversity and ecosystems. For the eastern Paratethys, the emergence of open habitats and the distribution of herbaceous vegetation during the late Miocene characterized the flora and the vegetation turnover (Ivanov et al. 2002, 2007 a). The territory of the Balkan Peninsula with its numerous Miocene lakes and swamps served as a key region {{for the study of the}} Neogene evolution of flora and vegetation, for the migration routes and for the exchange <b>corridor</b> of many <b>plant</b> species between Central-Eastern Europe and Asia Minor (Meulenkamp et al. 1996; Rögl 1998, 1999; Meulenkamp and Sissingh 2003; Popov et al. 2006; Akgün et al. 2007; Akkiraz et al. 2008; Ivanov et al. 2011; Alçiçek and Jiménez-Moreno 2013; Biltekin et al. 2015; Durak and Akkiraz 2016; Ivanov and Worobiec 2017; Kayseri-Özer 2017; Kayseri-Özer et al. 2017; Yavuz et al. 2017).

This study investigates the effects of vegetation management (slashing), on: (1) timing of small mammal recolonisation; (2) vegetation characteristics that drive small mammal responses; and (3) the point where corridor resources are sufficient to provide functional habitat for native species. Small mammal trapping was undertaken within Bunyip State Park, Australia, across three sites, once a month from January 2001 to May 2002 and every 2 months thereafter until January 2004. Changes in vegetation around each trap station were assessed annually in the forest and bi-annually in the corridor. Principal components analysis on the vegetation structural complexity values produced factors for use in species abundance models. Native small mammal species recolonised the corridor 1. 5 – 3. 5 years after management and the corridor supported a breeding population of small mammals around 2. 5 years post-management. Males however, generally recolonised the corridor first, resulting in a sex-biased population in these areas. Species corridor habitat models for five native and one introduced species suggested cover and shelter were more important in determining <b>corridor</b> use than <b>plant</b> species per se. Powerline corridors {{have the potential to}} create a mixture of different successional stages, enhancing habitat availability for many species. However, the intensity of current management needs to be reduced and an integrated approach to management needs to be undertaken if powerline corridors are to continuously provide habitat for native small mammal species. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Invasion by alien {{plant species}} may be rapid and aggressive, causing erosion of local biodiversity. This is {{particularly}} true for islands, where natural and anthropogenic corridors promote the rapid spread of invasive plants. Although evidence shows that <b>corridors</b> may facilitate <b>plant</b> invasions, {{the question of how}} their importance in the spread of alien species varies along environmental gradients deserves more attention. Here, we addressed this issue by examining diversity patterns (species richness of endemic, native and alien species) along and across roads, along an elevation gradient from sea-level up to 2050 m a. s. l. in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain), at multiple spatial scales. Species richness was assessed using a multi-scale sampling design consisting of 59 T-transects of 150 m × 2 m, along three major roads each placed over the whole elevation gradient. Each transect was composed of three sections of five plots each: Section 1 was located on the road edges, Section 2 at intermediate distance, and Section 3 far from the road edge, the latter representing the “native community” less affected by road-specific disturbance. The effect of elevation and distance from roadsides was evaluated for the three groups of species (endemic, native and alien species), using parametric and non-parametric regression analyses as well as additive diversity partitioning. Differences among roads explained the majority of the variation in alien species richness and composition. Patterns in alien species richness were also affected by elevation, with a decline in richness with increasing elevation and no alien species recorded at high elevations. Elevation was the most important factor determining patterns in endemic and native species. These findings confirm that climate filtering reflected in varying patterns along elevational gradients is an important determinant of the richness of alien species (which are not adapted to high elevations), while anthropogenic pressures may explain the richness of alien species at low elevation...|$|R
40|$|Biogeography and {{community}} ecology can mutually illuminate {{the formation of}} a regional species pool or biome. We apply phylogenetic methods to a large and diverse plant clade, Malpighiaceae, to characterize the formation of its species pool in Mexico, and its occupancy of the seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) biome that occurs there. We find that the ~ 162 species of Mexican Malpighiaceae represent ~ 33 dispersals from South America beginning in the Eocene and continuing until the Pliocene (~ 46. 4 – 3. 8 Myr). Furthermore, dispersal rates between South America and Mexico show a significant six-fold increase during the mid-Miocene (~ 23. 9 Myr). We hypothesize that this increase marked the availability of Central America as an important <b>corridor</b> for Neotropical <b>plant</b> migration. We additionally demonstrate that this high rate of dispersal contributed substantially more to the phylogenetic diversity of Malpighiaceae in Mexico than in situ diversification. Finally, we show that most lineages arrived in Mexico pre-adapted with regard to one key SDTF trait, total annual precipitation. In contrast, these lineages adapted to a second key trait, precipitation seasonality, in situ as mountain building in the region gave rise to the abiotic parameters of extant SDTF. The timing of this in situ adaptation to seasonal precipitation suggests that SDTF likely originated its modern characteristics by the late Oligocene, but was geographically more restricted until its expansion in the mid-Miocene. These results highlight the complex interplay of dispersal, adaptation, and in situ diversification in the formation of tropical biomes. Our results additionally demonstrate that these processes are not static, and their relevance can change markedly over evolutionary time. This has important implications for understanding the origin of SDTF in Mexico, but also for understanding the temporal and spatial origin of biomes and regional species pools more broadly...|$|R
40|$|For hedgerows {{to act as}} <b>corridors</b> for {{woodland}} <b>plants</b> {{they must}} provide habitat conditions to suit species’ autecological requirements. This supposition was tested by examining differences in the habitat and autecological characteristics of woodland plants according to their relative frequency in hedgerows and woodlands using a novel Habitat Preference Index (HPI). Indicator values for habitat and autecological characteristics of plant species were derived from Ellenberg and other published sources. Analyses were done separately for three main types of landscape in which hedgerows are found in Britain: (1) Lowland Arable; (2) Lowland Pastural; and (3) Marginal Upland. The relative frequency of plant species across all three landscape types was similar and significant differences between HPIs and environmental indicators were found for all three landscape types. Plants more frequently found in hedgerows had significantly higher indicator scores for soil fertility, temperature, continentality together with reduced soil acidity, in comparison to those species more frequent in woodlands. Analyses of autecological indicators failed to show similar consistent trends across landscape types except {{for the number of}} woodland types of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) in which species occur. Plants more frequently found in hedgerows were associated with fewer woodland communities suggesting that hedgerows contain only a narrow range of recognised woodland NVC stand types. Also, a significantly higher proportion of ancient woodland indicators were found in the group of plants that were more frequent in woodlands. Overall, results suggested that the environments of hedgerows are more similar to woodland edges than interiors. Qualitative differences between the environmental characteristics of hedgerows and woodlands are such that certain woodland plant species are highly likely to be limited in their capacity to use hedgerow networks. Implications for conservation of biodiversity are considered. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the next}} century, {{global climate change}} is {{predicted}} to have large influences on species' distributions. Much of the {{research in this area}} has focused on predicting the areas where conditions will be suitable for the species in future, and thus the potential distribution of the species. However, it is equally important to predict the relative abilities of species to migrate into new suitable areas as conditions shift, while accounting for dynamic processes, such as dispersal, maturation, mortality, and reproduction, as well as landscape characteristics, such as level of habitat fragmentation and connectivity. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit individual-based model that addresses these factors. As a motivating case study, we based aspects of the model on southwest Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot, but stress that the results obtained are generalizable beyond this region. Using the model, we enhanced current understanding of climate change impacts by investigating how and to what extent the functional traits of plant species affect their ability to move with climate change across landscapes with various levels of fragmentation. We also tested the efficacy of strategic restoration, such as <b>planting</b> <b>corridors</b> to increase connectivity among fragments. We found that even if the landscape is fully intact, only an average of 34. 2 % of all simulated functional groups had a good chance of successfully tracking climate change. However, our study highlights the power of strategic restoration as a tool for increasing species persistence. Corridors linking fragments increased species persistence rates by up to 24 %. The lowest persistence rates were found for trees, a functional group with high dispersal but also long generation times. Our results indicate that for trees intervention techniques, such as assisted migration might be required to prevent species losses...|$|R
