RKDG-LS-DGF method is used to simulate the physical process from the detonation of a <b>column</b> <b>charge</b> at {{one end to the}} formation of a nonspherical initial bubble and the process of bubble jet. And BEM is adopted to simulate bubble pulsing characteristics. In addition, the numerical results are compared with the experimental results to verify the feasibility of the numerical method. It is found that, during the detonation process of a <b>column</b> <b>charge,</b> the detonation product experiences a shape change from an initial ellipsoid into a sphere during expansion. After the detonation, the bubble experiences expansion and contraction and develops a jet. The jet threads through the bubble in the opposite direction to gravity and induces a high-pressure region. Subsequently, the pressure of this region decreases when the bubble reexpands after being penetrated by the jet. The numerical results agree well with the experimental data, which proves that axisymmetric RKDG-LS-DGF method and BEM are successfully combined to simulate the whole process of underwater explosion...|$|E

40|$|Student Number : 0210528 - PhD thesis - School of Mining Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmnetThis thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a directional primer charge for use in blasting in mining operations. The directional primer charge is an explosive gun which takes the place of a standard primer charge in a blasthole. It is a shaped charge which directs the explosive energy forwards into the blasthole. Its effectiveness is enhanced by a metal liner which is located at a specified stand-off distance from the toe of the hole. The explosive energy of the <b>column</b> <b>charge</b> is converted into the kinetic energy of the metal liner which transforms into an ultrasonic slug. This in turn converts into the impact energy of the slug impacting on the rock. This rock is axially compressed {{to such a degree that}} a radial fracture is developed. This radial fracture is termed an umbrella crack. Prior to the development of the directional primer charge, the phenomenon of the umbrella crack had only been observed in experimental Perspex blasting models and its formation mechanism had never been satisfactorily explained. If the directional primer charge could cause an umbrella crack in hard rock mining at the end of blastholes, then more rock would be broken out per blast than is currently achieved in practice. This thesis records the historical development of the explosive shaped charge with particular reference to the development of the explosively-forged projectile. It {{describes the}} classical theories and models which apply in determining the theoretical prediction of the physical properties of the designed directional primer charge. It describes the experimental procedures and measurements using flash X-ray radiography and electronic shorting screens to freeze the flight of a metal slug traveling at speeds of over 2000 metres per second. Underground tests were undertaken under full mining production conditions to compare the rock breaking effects of various designs. The theoretical calculation of the extent of the movement of the rock at the toe of the blasthole indicates that umbrella cracks should be formed. The underground tests confirm their formation. It is concluded that the use of the directional primer charge in stoping operations can improve the blasting efficiency in South African hard rock mines by up to 15...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} two methods of control over hot blast supply into a blast furnace with constant pressure and constant amount (consumption). The analysis of these two methods was performed {{with the aim of}} determining their influence upon changes in gas pressure in the blast furnace top. The blast furnace was considered as a unity of vessels (furnace hearth, the top) and gas-dynamic resistance (a <b>column</b> of <b>charge</b> materials). A differential equation was obtained, with regard to the dynamic balance of gas flow at the inlet and outlet of the top; the equation relates the pressure and gas consumption at the top to the pressure and hot blast consumption at the inlet and outlet of the furnace and to the resistance of the <b>column</b> of <b>charge</b> materials. The <b>column</b> of <b>charge</b> materials is considered as n-th number of channels through which gas flow inside the furnace moves and which resist to the flow. By the analysis of this equation at steady state (automatic stabilization of gas pressure in the top), the conditions were obtained to be satisfied with the specified value of gas pressure in the top. This value is equal to a half of the sum of the value of hot blast pressure at the inlet into the furnace and the value of pressure inside the collector of blast furnace gas. This conclusion is verified by the operation practice of blast furnaces in Ukraine. While analyzing the second method of controlling the supply of blast supply-stabilization of consumption (amount) of hot blast supplied into the furnace {{it has been shown that}} the method could be realized in condition of stabilization of the amount of blast furnace gas, going out of the furnace. As the resistance of the <b>column</b> of <b>charge</b> materials constantly changes it is necessary to change the hot blast pressure in order to ensure the constant amount of blast, supplied into the furnace. It is often connected with possible substantial pressure fluctuations of hot blast at the inlet of the furnace, which may result in stoppages in the motion of the <b>column</b> of <b>charge</b> materials. Due to it the hot blast pressure stabilization at the inlet of the furnace and the pressure stabilization in the top seem to be the most rational way to control the blast suppl...|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} generic {{design has}} been devised for implementing signal chains involved in readout from complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors {{and for other}} readout integrated circuits (ICs) that perform equivalent functions. The design applies to any such IC in which output signal charges from the pixels in a given row are transferred simultaneously into sampling capacitors at the bottoms of the columns, then voltages representing individual pixel charges are read out in sequence by sequentially turning on column-selecting field-effect transistors (FETs) in synchronism with source-follower- or operational-amplifier-based amplifier circuits. The improved design affords the best features of prior source-follower-and operational- amplifier-based designs while overcoming the major limitations of those designs. The limitations can be summarized as follows: a) For a source-follower-based signal chain, the ohmic voltage drop associated with DC bias current flowing through the column-selection FET causes unacceptable voltage offset, nonlinearity, and reduced small-signal gain. b) For an operational-amplifier-based signal chain, the required bias current and the output noise increase superlinearly with size of the pixel array because of a corresponding increase in the effective capacitance of the row bus used to couple the sampled <b>column</b> <b>charges</b> to the operational amplifier.

A layer of iron-oxy-hydroxy-sulfate 'scale' on particle surfaces encapsulated sulfide grains as well as elemental sulfur formed by the oxidation of pyrrhotite and was of sufficient depth and integrity to have hindered but not prevented leaching and bioleaching.

40|$|An inverse {{relationship}} {{exists between the}} net electrical charge of immunogens and the antibodies they elicit (1). Results of an earlier study have demonstrated that the net charge phenomenon has a cellular basis, since the immune response potential of murine spleen cells to 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) on a negatively charged synthetic polypeptide carrier was reduced by cell fractionation over negatively charged glass beads, whereas {{the response to the}} same hapten on a positively charged carrier was unaffected (14). To verify that the net charge correlation is expressed at the cellular level, spleen cells were fractionated over positively charged poly-L-lysine-coated glass bead columns, and their immunocompetence to DNP on positively and negatively charged carriers was tested by cell transfers in irradiated recipient mice. In this case, the fractionated cells showed reduced response potential to DNP on the positively charged carrier only. Thus, the cellular basis of the net charge phenomenon has been demonstrated for both positively and negatively charged immunogens (for the same specificity) by cell separation techniques over <b>columns</b> of opposite <b>charge.</b> In order to establish whether the cell population relevant for the charge properties of immunogens was of thymus or marrow origin, thymocytes and bone marrow cells were selectively passed over positively or negatively <b>charged</b> <b>columns</b> and mixed with unfractionated cells of the complementary type. Transfers of the filtered and unfiltered cell mixtures in irradiated recipient mice immunized with DNP on either a positive or a negative synthetic polypeptide carrier indicated that fractionation of thymocytes, but not of marrow cells, correlated with the spleen population. Thus, thymocytes fractionated over negatively <b>charged</b> <b>columns</b> and mixed with unfractionated marrow cells exhibited reduced response to DNP on the negative carrier, but normal responses to DNP on the positive carrier. The opposite result was obtained when thymocytes were passed over positively <b>charged</b> <b>columns.</b> No effect on the anti-DNP response was detected by filtration of bone marrow cells over <b>columns</b> of either <b>charge.</b> These findings indicate {{that it is possible to}} distinguish between thymocytes on the basis of their capacity to react with more acidic or more basic surfaces and that a population of thymus-derived cells may recognize immunogens on the basis of their overall electrical charge. No evidence was found by these techniques that marrow-derived cells contribute to the net charge phenomenon...|$|R
