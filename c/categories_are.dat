5|$|Although {{reference}} to major morphological {{categories such as}} root, stem, leaf, and trichome are useful, one has {{to keep in mind}} that these <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results.

5|$|In 1890 the English {{zoologist}} Edward Bagnall Poulton categorised animal colours {{by their}} uses, which cover both camouflage and mimicry.

5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into batik pedalaman (inland batik) or batik pesisir (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly {{into one of these}} two <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E
5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E
5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E

5|$|A character's {{performance}} in battle {{is determined by}} numerical values ("statistics") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> strength, the effectiveness of physical attacks; defense, the ability to reduce damage received; agility, the effectiveness of ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and mana, the effectiveness of magical attacks. A character's health is measured in hit points (HP), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.|$|E
5|$|Academic Decathlon is {{designed}} to include students from all achievement levels. Teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on grade point average: Honors (3.75–4.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00–3.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00–2.99 GPA). Each team member competes in all ten events against other students {{in his or her}} division, and team scores are calculated using the top two overall individual scores from each team in all three divisions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores. To earn a spot at the national competition in April, teams must advance through local, regional, and state competitions, though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states. Online competitions, separated into small, medium, and large <b>categories,</b> <b>are</b> also offered. USAD has expanded to include an International Academic Decathlon and has created an Academic Pentathlon for middle schools.|$|E
5|$|The player embarks {{with the}} {{expedition}} team (seven dwarves, their livestock and supplies), {{and does not}} have direct control over them. In order to construct and operate the fortress, the player has to designate specific tasks to be performed and the dwarves will go about it. They can be assigned any labors, but their work still depends on their relative skill with it, which can increase as they perform the said task. Some task <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> stone-working, woodworking, metalworking, farming, and crafting; there are further combat-related skills. They are categorized further, such as are leatherworking, butchery, clothesmaking, gem-related, glassmaking, and clay-related industries. Activities take place in workshops which need to be constructed; for example, stills for brewing alcohol. The metal industry has {{a very important role}} because it produces weapons and armor for the military, trap components for defense, and high-value furniture and decorations.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completing}} a mission, the player is awarded a rank, {{starting with the}} lowest at C and going to B, A and S, which is the highest. The ranks are based on three categories: Power, Technique, and Speed, each determined by meeting certain conditions in a battle. All three <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> rated {{on a scale from}} 0-150, and added together to form a numerical ranking from 0-450 in addition to their letter ranking; for example, any score between 300-450 earns an S ranking. Unlike previous games, the numerical score is not converted into points that can be redeemed to purchase new maps and COs; instead, COs are unlocked after the completion of certain missions and all maps (with the exception of training missions) are available at the beginning of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|While {{publishing}} short {{articles on}} the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay De quelques formes primitives de classification written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 magnum opus The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought {{to understand how the}} concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not a priori. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time. In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of rationalism and empiricism, arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori's (as Kant argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.|$|E
