40|$|An {{experimental}} {{system is}} described in which rapid and extensive sporulation of the obligately anaerobic bacterium Clostridium pasteurianum ATCC 6013 was reproducibly obtained in batch culture using a simple, defined medium containing only salts, vitamins, glucose and ammonium ions. Electron microscopy was used to follow the progress of cytological changes during sporulation and to relate these to {{the time course of}} Incubation in the sporulation medium. The production of a refractile spore from a vegetative cell took 9 to 10 h at 37 °C with the approximate times taken for the completion of each recognizable stage being as follows:- from septation to the completion of engulfment, 2 h; from engulfment to deposition of coat material, 3 h and from the first appearance of spore coat material to deposition of spore cortes, 2. 5 h. Approximately 80 % of the organisms produced mature, refractile spores and the degree of synchrony with which sporulation was accomplished compared very favourably with the best reported for aerobic sporulating bacteria. This C. pasteurianum system is therefore eminently suitable for use in studies of the biochemical changes associated with sporulation of an obligate anaerobe. A preliminary Investigation was made of some of the biochemical events associated with sporulation of C. pasteurlanum. Glucose was not a repressor of sporulation. in fact, high (3 - 4 % w/v) initial concentrations were required for optimal sporulation in the defined minimal medium. A striking and characteristic early event of sporulation was swelling of the cell brought about by the extensive deposition of granulose (an amylo- pectin-like polymer) in the sporangial cytoplasm. Even so, glucose uptake and the production of acetate and butyrate proceeded continuously throughout sporulation, suggesting that the energy required for sporulation was derived from continuous fermentation of exogenous glucose. A somewhat surprising finding was that sporulation proceeded without the production of detectable levels of extracellular proteinase, though very low intracellular proteolytic activity was present during both growth and sporulation. Furthermore, the extensive protein turnover which is associated with sporulation in aerobic bacteria was not detected in C. pasteurianum. Another departure from the pattern of events normally associated with sporulation of Bacillus species was that C. pasteurianum apparently produces no antibiotic during spore formation. The exosporium of C. pasteurianum, discovered during the electron microscopic examination of the sporulation process proved to possess several interesting features, some of which were investigated in more detail. The presence of a large opening at its base - not a usual feature of exosporia, was confirmed by demonstrating that ferritin molecules or bacteriophage particles could gain entrance to the peri-sporal space of autolytically liberated spores. When the three-dimensional structure of the spore was examined using the critical-point drying technique, {{it was found that the}} spore was slung within its exosporium by a system of 'suspensors' which were not readily detectable by other methods of specimen preparation. A more detailed investigation of the nature of the exosporium showed it to possess a simple, homogeneous structure consisting of superposed sheets of identical, possibly doughnut-shaped, subunits which were arranged in a regular, <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> <b>lattice</b> with a nearest neighbor separation of 5 nm. In surface view a subordinate, hexagonal pattern of 'holes' placed 10 nm apart was also discernible. The apparently paracrystalline structure of the exosporium suggested that during sporulation its synthesis might proceed by a process of spontaneous self-assembly. The presence of an opening in the exosporium posed the question of whether this might facilitate exit of the emergent germling cell. Examination of spore germination and outgrowth by electron microscopy revealed that whereas both spore coat and spore cortex underwent lytic digestion during this process, the exosporium remained essentially intire. However, escape of the germling cell was not impeded, since this invariably took place via the open end of the exosporium...|$|E

We performed total energy calculations {{on the basis of the}} density functional theory in the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) using the full-potential linearized augmented-plane wave method (FLAPW) in film geometry as a function of the lattice parameters, crystal structure, and magnetic order. The atoms are arranged in a two-dimensional (2 D) square lattice or in a (2 D) <b>hexagonal</b> <b>lattice</b> and we included nonmagnetic, p(1 x 1) -ferromagnetic and c(2 x 2) -antiferromagnetic structures. Antiferromagnetism on a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>lattice</b> leads to noncollinear spin-configurations, which we approximated by a c(2 x 2) -antiferromagnetic structure on a centered rectangular lattice. The results are summarized in a structure table. The UMLs at the beginning of the 3 d-series (Ti, V) are nonmagnetic and crystallize in the <b>closed</b> <b>packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> structure; Fe, Co and Ni are hexagonal with a ferromagnetic ground-state spin-structure. In the middle of the 3 d-series Mn and Cr are antiferromagnetic and there is a strong competition between the hexagonal and the square lattice: The ground-state found for Mn is hexagonal and for Cr quadratic.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that photonic and phononic crystals consisting of closely spaced inclusions constitute a versatile class of subwavelength metamaterials. Intuitively, the voids and narrow gaps that characterise the crystal form an interconnected network of Helmholtz-like resonators. We use this intuition {{to argue that}} these continuous photonic (phononic) crystals are in fact asymptotically equivalent, at low frequencies, to discrete capacitor-inductor (mass-spring) networks whose lumped parameters we derive explicitly. The crystals are tantamount to metamaterials as their entire acoustic branch, or branches when the discrete analogue is polyatomic, is squeezed into a subwavelength regime where the ratio of wavelength to period scales like the ratio of period to gap width raised to the power 1 / 4; at yet larger wavelengths we accordingly find a comparably large effective refractive index. The fully analytical dispersion relations predicted by the discrete models yield dispersion curves that agree with those from finite-element simulations of the continuous crystals.

Operating under high hydraulic pressure, the tubing used in the system requires high strength to weight and good impulse fatigue strength- particularly with respect to hoop strength.

The WVTR was measured to be as low as 10 (- 4) g/m(2). day initially, and stabilized at similar to 0. 48 g/m(2). day, which corresponds to 7 times reduction in WVTR compared to bare polymer substrates. We also showed that the graphene-passivated organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) exhibited excellent environmental stability as well as a prolonged lifetime even after 500 bending cycles with strain of 2. 3 %.

The as-deposited PrCo//Cr films are mostly amorphous with a small coercivity value but after annealing at 400 ∘C the PrCo layer is completely crystallized with a grain size of about 10 nm resulting in a large enhancement of coercivity. Nanodiffraction and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) studies show that the crystallites have a <b>closed</b> <b>packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> structure. The effects of Ar sputtering pressure, PrCo layer thickness, and Cr underlayer thickness on the magnetic properties were investigated. The magnetization reversal mechanism was investigated from the shape of the initial hysteresis loop, minor loops and time dependence of magnetization. The magnetic switching volume is in the range of 1 to 1. 7 × 10 - 18 cm 3. By annealing the as-deposited SmCo//Cr and PrCo//Cr thin films room temperature coercivity values ranging from 1 to 45 kOe were achieved. ...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{fourteen}} Bravais/space lattices {{are found}} to be inadequate for proper crystallographic representation and some conceptual understandings. The complicacies, confusions and ambiguities encountered in the representation of trigonal/rhomohedral and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>lattices</b> have been removed by suggesting the need of two more space lattices in the form of <b>Hexagonal</b> <b>Close</b> <b>Packing</b> (HCP) and Rhombohedral <b>Close</b> <b>Packing</b> (RCP) with appropriate justifications. Henceforth, these two lattices will be called as Wahab lattices and the sixteen lattices together as Bravais Wahab lattices (or space lattices as before). This finding will have immediate as well as far reaching implications...|$|R
40|$|Graphene - a {{monolayer}} {{of carbon}} atoms densely <b>packed</b> into a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>lattice</b> - {{has one of}} the strongest possible atomic bonds and {{can be viewed as a}} robust atomic-scale scaffold, to which other chemical species can be attached without destroying it. This notion of graphene as a giant flat molecule that can be altered chemically is supported by the observation of so-called graphene oxide, that is graphene densely covered with hydroxyl and other groups. Unfortunately, graphene oxide is strongly disordered, poorly conductive and difficult to reduce to the original state. Nevertheless, one can imagine atoms or molecules being attached to the atomic scaffold in a strictly periodic manner, which should result in a different electronic structure and, essentially, a different crystalline material. A hypothetical example for this is graphane, a wide-gap semiconductor, in which hydrogen is bonded to each carbon site of graphene. Here we show that by exposing graphene to atomic hydrogen, it is possible to transform this highly-conductive semimetal into an insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the material retains the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>lattice</b> but its period becomes markedly shorter than that of graphene, providing direct evidence for a new graphene-based derivative. The reaction with hydrogen is found to be reversible so that the original metallic state and lattice spacing are restored by annealing and even the quantum Hall effect recovers. Our work proves the concept of chemical modification of graphene, which promises a whole range of new two-dimensional crystals with designed electronic and other properties...|$|R
40|$|Graphene, a two {{dimensional}} monolayer carbon sheet with the atoms tightly <b>packed</b> in a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>lattice,</b> has exhibited so many excellent properties, which enable graphene to break several material records {{with regard to}} carrier mobility, strength yield and thermal conductivity to name a few. Therefore, graphene has been placed as a potential candidate to allow truly next-generation material. Graphene is a zero band gap material, implying that an energy band gap around the Dirac point {{is supposed to be}} open to make graphene applicable as a semiconductor. Covalent bond graphene functionalization becomes an essential enabler to open the energy gap in graphene and extend graphene applications in electronics, while the densely <b>packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> carbon atoms as well as the strong sp 2 hybridization carbon-carbon bonds jointly result in a changeling topic of allowing graphene to be decorated with functional groups. Here in this thesis, different routes to realize graphene functionalizations are implemented by using physical and chemical ways. The physical functionalization methods are the ion/electron beam induced graphene fluorination as well as local defect insertion and the chemical ways correspond to the photochemistry techniques to approach hydrogenation and hydroxypropylation of graphene. Furthermore, to incorporate graphene into devices, the tuning of mechanical properties of graphene is desired. Towards this aim, the structure modification of graphene is employed to investigate the nanometer size-effect of crystalline size of graphene on the mechanical properties, namely Young’s modulus and surface energy. In the process of the graphene hydrogenation project, we discovered a high yield way to synthesis high quality graphene nanoscroll (GNS). Interestingly, the GNS shows superadhesion property through our atomic force microscopy measurements. This superadhesion is around 6 -order stronger than van der Waals interaction and even higher than the hydrogen bonding enhanced and solid/liquid interfaces...|$|R
30|$|Graphene with a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>packed</b> <b>lattice</b> {{structure}} is widely proposed to {{be a star}} material, boosted by its appealing properties, including superb mechanical property, high superficial area, eco-friendliness, etc. [1 – 4] As the “graphene gold rush” go on, tremendous niche applications have been developed, including sensors catalysts, energy conversion, and energy storage [5 – 7]. Especially in the functionalized graphene material field, sundry-modified materials emerge in an unending flow, deriving countless technologies and applications. It is versatile for the aforementioned functional application to produce reduced graphene oxide-based material, for its rich active oxygen functional groups can be ornamented before the reduced process [8, 9]. Generally, for these materials, the adsorption is a practical and common application and {{it has been reported that}} reduced graphene oxid with its derivative could effectively absorb manifold organic dyes, such as methylene blue (MB), Rhodamine B (RhB), through π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding, the electrostatic force, etc. [10, 11].|$|R

Recently, “graphene”, a two dimensional single-layer carbon sheet with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>packed</b> <b>lattice</b> structure, imitative of nanomaterials, has shown great potential as alternative and eco-friendly solid carbocatalyst for a variety of acid-catalyzed reactions. Owing to their exceptional physical, chemical, and mechanical properties, graphene-based nanomaterials (G-NMs) offer highly stable Brønsted acidic sites, high mass transfer, relatively large surface areas, water tolerant character, and convenient recoverability as well as recyclability, whilst retaining high activity in acid-catalyzed chemical reactions. This comprehensive review focuses on the chemistry of G-NMs, including their synthesis, characterization, properties, functionalization, and up-to-date applications in heterogeneous acid catalysis. In line with this, in certain instances readers may find herein some criticisms that should be taken as constructive and would be of value in understanding the scope and limitations of current approaches utilizing graphene and its derivatives for the same...|$|R
