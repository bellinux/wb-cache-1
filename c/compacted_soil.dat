The deepest roots are generally found in deserts and temperate coniferous forests; the shallowest in tundra, boreal forest and temperate grasslands.

25|$|Geocells (also {{known as}} Cellular Confinement Systems) are {{three-dimensional}} honeycombed cellular structures that form a confinement system when infilled with <b>compacted</b> <b>soil.</b> Extruded from polymeric materials into strips welded together ultrasonically in series, the strips are expanded {{to form the}} stiff (and typically textured and perforated) walls of a flexible 3D cellular mattress. Infilled with soil, a new composite entity is created from the cell-soil interactions. The cellular confinement reduces the lateral movement of soil particles, thereby maintaining compaction and forms a stiffened mattress that distributes loads over a wider area. Traditionally used in slope protection and earth retention applications, geocells made from advanced polymers are being increasingly adopted for long-term road and rail load support. Much larger geocells are also made from stiff geotextiles sewn into similar, but larger, unit cells that are used for protection bunkers and walls.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{is a major}} disturbance {{associated with}} logging, but we lack a fundamental understanding of how this affects the soil microbiome. We assessed the structural resistance and resilience of the microbiome using a high-throughput pyrosequencing approach in differently <b>compacted</b> <b>soils</b> at two forest sites and correlated these findings with changes in soil physical properties and functions. Alterations in soil porosity after compaction strongly limited the air and water conductivity. Compaction significantly reduced abundance, increased diversity, and persistently altered {{the structure of the}} microbiota. Fungi were less resistant and resilient than bacteria; clayey soils were less resistant and resilient than sandy soils. The strongest effects were observed in soils with unfavorable moisture conditions, where air and water conductivities dropped well below 10 % of their initial value. Maximum impact was observed around 6 - 12 months after compaction, and microbial communities showed resilience in lightly but not in severely <b>compacted</b> <b>soils</b> 4 years post disturbance. Bacteria capable of anaerobic respiration, including sulfate, sulfur, and metal reducers of the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, were significantly associated with <b>compacted</b> <b>soils.</b> Compaction detrimentally affected ectomycorrhizal species, whereas saprobic and parasitic fungi proportionally increased in <b>compacted</b> <b>soils.</b> Structural shifts in the microbiota were accompanied by significant changes in soil processes, resulting in reduced carbon dioxide, and increased methane and nitrous oxide emissions from <b>compacted</b> <b>soils.</b> This study demonstrates that physical soil disturbance during logging induces profound and long-lasting changes in the soil microbiome and associated soil functions, raising awareness regarding sustainable management of economically driven logging operations...|$|R

Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica cv. Greenbelt) seedlings were grown in pot experiments with compact, loose and localized soil compaction created by either horizontal (compact subsoils 75 or 150 mm below loose topsoil) or vertical (adjacent compact and loose columns of soil) configurations of loose (1. 2 Mg m- 3) and compact (1. 8 Mg m- 3) <b>soil.</b> Entirely <b>compact</b> <b>soil</b> reduced leaf area by up to 54 %, relative to loose soil. When compaction was localized, only the vertical columns of <b>compact</b> and loose <b>soil</b> reduced leaf area (by 30 %). Neither the proportion of roots in <b>compact</b> <b>soil</b> nor the timing of exposure could explain the differing shoot growth responses to localized soil compaction. Instead, the strong relationship between total root length and leaf area (r 2 = 0. 92) indicated that localized soil compaction reduced shoot growth only when it suppressed total root length. This occurred when isolated root axes of the same plant were exposed to vertical columns of <b>compact</b> and loose <b>soil.</b> When a single root axis grew through loose soil into either a shallow or deep compact subsoil, compensatory root growth in the loose soil maintained total root length and thus shoot growth was unaffected.

40|$|International audienceIn {{geotechnical}} engineering, {{the proper}} design of thermo-active geostructures (piles, foundations, etc.) and deep waste storage disposals requires {{a better understanding}} of the thermo-hydro-mechanical behaviour of natural and <b>compacted</b> <b>soils.</b> Important mechanical parameters of the soils such as the cone resistance (qc) and the friction sleeve resistance (fs) are usually obtained by penetration in-situ tests. In the present study, penetration tests adapted from the static penetration method were conducted in laboratory, using a mini-penetrometer, to characterise compacted samples. The objective was to examine and quantify the influence of temperature changes on penetration parameters of two different <b>compacted</b> <b>soils.</b> Samples of an illitic material and the kaolinite–sand mixture compacted at different initial water contents and dry densities were subjected to a range of temperatures from 1 to 70  °C.

40|$|<b>Compacted</b> {{unsaturated}} <b>soils</b> show distinct behavioural patterns {{when compared}} with their saturated counterparts, and these behavioural patterns {{become more and more}} complex when soil is subjected to wetting, such as swelling or collapse and loss of shear strength. Ignoring these possible complex behaviours of unsaturated soils coupled with varying climatic conditions can lead to inaccurate assessment of the performance of geotechnical structures. Therefore, the accurate prediction of the wetting-induced volume change behaviour of <b>compacted</b> unsaturated <b>soils</b> is a key step in understanding and modelling unsaturated soil behaviour. Of the different constitutive models introduced to date which can define the wetting-induced volume change behaviour of <b>compacted</b> unsaturated <b>soils</b> reasonably satisfactorily, the MPK framework for the volumetric constitutive behaviour of <b>compacted</b> unsaturated <b>soils</b> proposed by Kodikara (2012) has shown favourable results with its direct relationship to moisture variation.

40|$|Abstract. Soil {{compaction}} {{includes a}} set of underlying stresses that limit root growth such as increased impedance and limited oxygen availability. The aims {{of the present study}} were to (i) find acclimations of triticale (Triticosecale) and soybean (Glycine max L.) roots to <b>compacted</b> <b>soils</b> in the field; (ii) reproduce these under controlled conditions; and (iii) associate these responseswith soil physical properties. To this end, plantswere grown at two different soil bulk densities in the field and under controlled conditions representingmature root systems and the seedling stage respectively. Diameters, lateral branching densities, the cortical proportion within the total root cross-section and the occurrence of cortical aerenchyma of main roots were quantified. Soil compaction caused decreasing root branching and increasing cortical proportions in both crops and environments. In triticale, root diameters and the occurrence of aerenchyma increased in response to compaction in the field and under controlled conditions. In soybean, these acclimations occurred at an initial developmental stage but due to radial root growth not in mature roots. These results showed that responses of root systems to <b>compacted</b> <b>soils</b> in thefield are, to a large extent, reproducible under controlled conditions, enabling increased throughput, phenotyping-based breeding programs in the future. Furthermore, the occurrence of aerenchyma clearly indicated the important role of limited oxygen availability in <b>compacted</b> <b>soils</b> on root growth...|$|R

The soil collapse has been analysed for stress levels corresponding to pre-yield, yield and post-yield condition.
