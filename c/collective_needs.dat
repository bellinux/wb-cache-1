5|$|The {{economic}} boom resulted in drawing {{large numbers of}} aborigines out of their villages and into the unskilled or low-skilled sector of the urban workforce. Manufacturing and construction jobs were generally available for low wages. The aborigines quickly formed bonds with other communities as they all had similar political motives to protect their <b>collective</b> <b>needs</b> {{as part of the}} labor force. The aborigines became the most skilled iron-workers and construction teams on the island often selected to work on the most difficult projects. The result was a mass exodus of indigenous members from their traditional lands and the cultural alienation of young people in the villages, who could not learn their languages or customs while employed. Often, young aborigines in the cities fall into gangs aligned with the construction trade. Recent laws governing the employment of laborers from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines have also led to an increased atmosphere of xenophobia among urban aborigines, and encouraged the formulation of a pan-indigenous consciousness in the pursuit of political representation and protection.|$|E

King was organizing the public transportation boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, which {{became known as the}} Montgomery Bus Boycott. According to Rustin, [...] "I think it's fair to say that Dr. King's view of non-violent tactics was almost non-existent when the boycott began. In other words, Dr. King was permitting himself and his children and his home to be protected by guns." [...] Rustin convinced King to abandon the armed protection, including a personal handgun. In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book Who Speaks for the Negro?, Rustin also reflected that his integrative ideology began to differ from King's. He believed a social movement [...] "has {{to be based on the}} <b>collective</b> <b>needs</b> of people at this time, regardless of color, creed, race." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have my own}} {{very strong}} preconceptions here, and since my {{temperament}} is sanguine they necessarily colour my view. I believe that this impulse to collective service can satisfy itself only under the formula that mankind is one state of which God is the undying king, and that the service of men's <b>collective</b> <b>needs</b> is the true worship of God. But eagerly as I would grasp at any evidence that this idea is being developed and {{taken up by the}} general consciousness, I am quite unable to persuade myself that anything of the sort is going on. I do perceive a search for large forms into which the prevalent impulse to devotion can be thrown. But the organised religious bodies, with their creeds and badges and their instinct for self-preservation at any cost, stand between men and their spiritual growth in just the same way the forestallers stand between men and food. Their activities at present are an almost intolerable nuisance. One cannot say [...] "God" [...] but some tout is instantly seeking to pluck one into his particular cave of flummery and orthodoxy. What a rational man means by God is just God. The more you define and argue about God the more he remains the same simple thing. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, modern Hindu religious thought, all agree in declaring that there is one God, master and leader of all mankind, in unending conflict with cruelty, disorder, folly and waste. To my mind, it follows immediately {{that there can be no}} king, no government of any sort, which is not either a subordinate or a rebel government, a local usurpation, in the kingdom of God. But no organised religious body has ever had the courage and honesty to insist upon this. They all pander to nationalism and to powers and princes. They exists so to pander. Every organised religion in the world exists only to exploit and divert and waste the religious impulse in man.|$|E

As a vehicle and institute of the state, the Academy created a canon of imagery, which was known throughout Europe. This enabled Louis XIV's image to be reversed by the creators of the satirical images.

5000|$|Studying {{the purpose}} for {{formation}} of a group, whether it is serving a [...] "functional" [...] purpose or an [...] "interpersonal attraction" [...] purpose (Mackie and Goethals, 1987), has implications for political popularity. Often people join groups {{in order to fulfill}} certain survival, interpersonal, informational and <b>collective</b> <b>needs.</b> [...] A political party that provides; stability, clear information, offers power to individuals and satisfies a sense of affiliation, will gain popularity.

Groups also form due to natural attraction. Newcomb (1960) states that we are drawn to others close in socioeconomic status, beliefs, attitudes and physical appearance.
