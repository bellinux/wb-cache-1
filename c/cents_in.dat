5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, {{commodity}} prices for copper and nickel, which make up the five-cent coin, rose dramatically, pushing the cost of manufacturing a nickel from 3.46 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> fiscal year 2003 to 10.09 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> fiscal year 2012. By comparison, a Canadian nickel (which is primarily made of steel) still costs less than its face value to produce as of 2013. In response, Mint Director Henrietta Fore in 2004 asked Congress to fund research into lower-cost alternatives to present coinage metals. Although the initiative lapsed when she left office in 2005, in 2010, Congress passed the Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act (CMOCA), directing the Mint to explore alternatives to the present compositions of the six denominations, from cent to dollar. In 2011, the Mint awarded a contract to study the issue to Concurrent Technologies Corporation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The report in response to the legislation declared that there is no material that would reduce the one-cent coin's manufacturing cost to below one cent, so it was removed from consideration. The report requested additional time to study the issue, ensuring the continuation, for the present, of the existing coinage metals. The Mint expected demand for nickels in commerce to increase from 840 million needed in Fiscal Year 2011 to 1.08 billion in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{major league}} {{game in the}} United States was {{originally}} targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience.

5|$|The {{silver dollar}} {{had never been}} a popular coin, {{circulating}} little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 <b>cents.</b> <b>In</b> the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.|$|E

Many {{remained}} there {{only a few}} years, being pulled out from among the new bronze <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> Treasury Department redemption programs in the 1860s and 1870s—thirteen million copper-nickel cents were retired by exchange for other base-metal coinage.

Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the 1857, 1858 large letters, and 1858 small letters each at $30 in G-4 Good condition, the next to lowest collectable grade (AG-3).

5|$|The Civil War economy catalyzed a {{shortage}} of United States coinage—gold and silver coins were hoarded given their intrinsic bullion value relative to irredeemable paper currency at the time. In late 1861, to help finance the Civil War, the U.S. government borrowed gold coin from New York City banks in exchange for Seven-thirties treasury notes and the New York banks sold them {{to the public for}} gold to repay the loan. In December 1861, the Trent Affair shook public confidence with the threat of war on a second front. The United States Department of the Treasury suspended specie payments and banks in New York City stopped redeeming paper money for gold and silver. In the absence of gold and silver coin, the premium for specie began to devalue paper currency. After the New York banks suspended specie payments (quickly followed by Boston and Philadelphia) the premium on gold rose from 1–3% over paper in early January 1862 to 9% over paper in June 1862, by which time one paper dollar was worth 91.69 <b>cents</b> <b>in</b> gold. This fueled currency speculation (e.g., redeeming banknotes for silver coin which was then sold at a premium as bullion), and created significant disruption across businesses and trade. Alternate methods of providing small change included the reintroduction of Spanish quarter dollars in Philadelphia, cutting dollar bills in quarters or halves, refusing to provide change (without charging a premium for providing silver coins), or the issuance of locally issued shinplasters (i.e., those issued by businesses or local municipalities) was forbidden by law in many states.|$|E

40|$|Quick {{test for}} quality check of {{processed}} food will be handy for Defence Forces. Acidity {{being one of}} the most important quality parameters, as per the ASC, BIS, PFA specifications, limits have been laid down as not to exceed 2 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> meat and fish products, 0. 1 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> cereal products, 1. 25 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> ice cream powder, 1. 5 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> milk powder, 0. 3 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> sweetened condensed milk, and 0. 15 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> butter. In the present study, a simple, quick, semi-quantitative test has been developed for checking acidity in processed foods to ascertain their quality. The test is based on a colour reaction with the sample. The test solution gives blue to green to yellow colour depending on the concentration of acid in the sample. Green colour is the cut-off point for non-acceptance. The large number of samples of meat (155), fish products (48), cereal products (222), ice cream powder (200), butter (200), milk powder (200) and sweetened condensed milk (202) were analysed by the quick test method and the results were compared with those from the standard titrimetric method. Acidity ranged form 0. 68 per cent to 2. 40 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> meat products, 0. 70 per cent to 2. 50 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> fish products, 0. 06 per cent to 1. 25 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> butter, 0. 60 per cent to 1. 91 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> milk powder, 0. 05 per cent to 0. 54 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> ice cream powder, 0. 32 per cent to 0. 60 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> sweatened condensed milk, 0. 05 per cent to 1. 10 per <b>cent</b> <b>in</b> cereal products.
