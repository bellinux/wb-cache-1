50|$|In 2004, {{the company}} sold its {{traditional}} home shopping (catalogues) division to the Barclay twins, who later merged the Littlewoods mail order operations into it. This included the iconic Great Universal Stores catalogue, {{from which the}} company took its name, and completed the departure of GUS from its original business areas. Around the same time, the Barclays announced {{the closure of the}} Littlewoods Index <b>catalogue</b> <b>showroom</b> chain, the principal rival to Argos in the UK, selling around 35 stores to Argos.|$|E
40|$|With the {{exception}} of Argos, <b>catalogue</b> <b>showroom</b> retailing {{has not been a}} major success in Europe. Argos, founded in 1973 by the Green Shield stamp entrepreneur, Richard Tompkins, has grown to be one of Britain's leading retailers. Its corporate history, with two periods of independence and two periods as a business unit in a conglomerate, is of interest. Its innovativeness, through its catalogue development and format experimentation, makes Argos important to our understanding of retail change. The catalogues themselves are essential social and retailing history documents. Now part of GUS plc, Argos has to face the challenge and opportunities of the Internet. With experience of the catalogue as an intervening element in the customer purchase process, Argos has further potential as a multichannel retailer...|$|E
25|$|The leading {{companies}} {{of the period}} issued <b>catalogues,</b> established <b>showrooms</b> in department stores and marketed their products around the world. Twyford had showrooms for water closets in Berlin, Germany; Sydney, Australia; and Cape Town, South Africa. The Public Health Act 1875 set down stringent guidelines relating to sewers, drains, water supply and toilets and lent tacit government endorsement to the prominent water closet manufacturers of the day.|$|R
5000|$|Consumers Distributing {{was plagued}} by the {{perception}} that items were frequently out of stock due to the catalogue shopping nature of the store. With the catalogue concept, the customer selected the item either at home while looking through the company's catalogue, or {{by a group of}} <b>catalogues</b> in the <b>showroom</b> of every store. It was not uncommon for a customer to wait in line only to be told by a clerk that the merchandise was not in stock. In 1984, a concept called the [...] "Flashboard" [...] was introduced. The Flashboard was a steel bulletin board with magnetic catalogue numbers for out of stock items. Customers were able to look at the Flashboard for their item and if it was listed, they knew that it was out of stock and {{they did not have to}} wait in line. This concept was used in some New York and New Jersey stores before computerization became mainstream.|$|R
40|$|Argos is Europe's most {{successful}} <b>catalogue</b> <b>showroom</b> retailer, with {{annual sales of}} over Â£ 2. 0 bn. Its success is dependent on many aspects of its retail system, but arguably the key component is the requirement to get the catalogue {{into the hands of}} potential customers. The catalogues are therefore advanced selling systems in their own right, which provide information on product retailing and consumption of the time. This paper takes the first Argos catalogue of 1973 / 1974 and compares it with the 50 th catalogue produced in 1998. Whilst using arbitrary dates and issues, the analysis allows us to consider aspects of retailing, product and consumer change. The comparison demonstrates changes in presentation techniques and merchandising. The product mix is much altered with considerable product development, both in terms of technological change and "lifestyle" components...|$|E
