5|$|Short (time duration) GRBs {{appear to}} <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lower-redshift (i.e. less distant) {{population}} {{and are less}} luminous than long GRBs.

5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought to <b>come</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at}} the data is required.|$|E
