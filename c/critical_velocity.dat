The rotation rate of the Eta Carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen.

The releases will be conducted mostly in darkness over the Maui telescope site. The vector sum of the satellite and gas velocities will exceed the velocity requirement for the critical ionization velocity (CIV) process of xenon. It is feasible that the xenon gas will achieve <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> ionization. Associative ionization and collisional stripping will not occur for the xenon gas and there is no photo-ionization in darkness; ionization processes competing with CIV are absent. Neutral density, ambient magnetic field, and seed ionization effects on the xenon gas CIV will be discussed. Unlike xenon, carbon dioxide will not undergo CIV because of its higher velocity requirement. However, it is feasible that carbon dioxide colliding with the atmospheric species will form excited CO and OH molecules, which will radiate subsequently. Optical, IR, and UV observations on the satellite and at Maui Optical Telescope will provide diagnostic measurements for the experiment.|$|E

40|$|Poor hole {{cleaning}} have {{dire consequences}} {{and as a}} result, special efforts and considerations are planned in drilling operations to avoid complications or hole cleaning issues. Drillers have often been tasked by finding the optimum drilling and rheological parameters for proper hole cleaning. Enormous breakthrough and improvement on hole cleaning has been observed in {{the oil and gas}} industry, thanks to past decades of efforts channeled through research and studies on the understanding of hole cleaning. Nevertheless, hole cleaning still pose a big challenge in many wells today, mostly as a result of non-compliance on use of optimum drilling and rheological parameters, as well as uncertainty of formation type drilled. Although significant amount of works and time have been devoted on hole cleaning by different authors, not so much resources have been dedicated to the <b>critical</b> <b>velocities</b> controlling mode of cuttings transport in wellbore. This thesis work focuses on improving the efficiency of transportation of cuttings in wellbore, with major emphasis on the <b>critical</b> <b>velocities</b> of transportation of particles. A literature review on hole cleaning and <b>critical</b> <b>velocities</b> was carried out by the author. Factors affecting hole cleaning and <b>critical</b> <b>velocities</b> of transportation of cuttings was also highlighted in this work. The author reviewed different models for calculating critical rolling and lifting velocities. Analyses of selected model were performed prior to starting the experimental work. Experimental work on <b>critical</b> <b>velocities</b> was performed on a flow loop and the results of the experiments were compared with the theoretical results. From the analyses, the author concluded that the theoretical model could be improved by taking into account plastic forces acting on cuttings particles...|$|R

Electrostatic waves are generated by the current driven ion cyclotron instability (CDICI), causing perpendicular velocity diffusion of ions plus electron heating via anomalous resistivity when and where the relative drift between electrons and ions exceeds certain <b>critical</b> <b>velocities.</b> Using the local bulk parameters we calculate these <b>critical</b> <b>velocities,</b> and so are able to self-consistently {{switch on and off}} the heating of the various particle species. Due to the dependence of these <b>critical</b> <b>velocities</b> on the bulk parameters of the species the heating effects exhibit quite complex spatial and temporal variations. A wide range of ion distribution functions are observed in these simulations, including conics with energies of a few electron volts and 'ring' distributions.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a canal in the Gunnison Valley, located in central Utah, which diverts water from the sediment-laden Green River. Grain size {{analyses}} were performed on sediment samples taken from the canal. These grain size analyses {{were used to determine}} the grain size distribution of the fine sediment, classify the fine sediment, and compare the fine sediment to a sediment deposit in the Green River. The <b>critical</b> incipient <b>velocity</b> for the D 50 and D 100 and the <b>critical</b> grain entrainment <b>velocity</b> corresponding to the D 95 were determined through flume experimentation. Two methods, developed by prior researchers, were chosen by the author to calculate the <b>critical</b> incipient <b>velocity</b> for the D 50 and D 100 of the fine sediment in the Green River Canal. The calculated <b>critical</b> incipient <b>velocity</b> for the D 50 and D 100 was compared to the <b>critical</b> incipient <b>velocity</b> for the D 50 and D 100 as determined from flume experimentation. Using flume data and one of the previously mentioned methods, the <b>critical</b> grain entrainment <b>velocity</b> was calculated and compared to the <b>critical</b> grain entrainment <b>velocity</b> as determined by flume experimentation. This study concluded that a minimum required average velocity of 1. 14 feet per second will retain in suspension the fine sediment sampled from the Green River Canal. This minimum average <b>critical</b> grain entrainment <b>velocity</b> corresponds to the D 95 of the fine sediment deposited in the Green River Canal.

With the increase of the directional well in transition flow or turbulent flow, the current common models cannot accurately predict the <b>critical</b> gas <b>velocity</b> of these wells. So we built a new model to predict continuous liquid-carrying <b>critical</b> gas <b>velocity</b> for directional well in transition flow or turbulent flow. It is shown from sensitivity analysis that the correction coefficient is mainly influenced by Reynolds number and deviation angle. With the increase of Reynolds number, the <b>critical</b> liquid-carrying gas <b>velocity</b> increases first and then decreases.
