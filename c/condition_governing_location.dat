40|$|The central {{claim of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is that an}} elliptical VP is a proform. This claim has two primary consequences: first, the elliptical VP can have no internal syntactic structure. Second, the interpretation of VP ellipsis must be governed by the same general <b>conditions</b> <b>governing</b> other proforms, such as pronouns. The basic <b>condition</b> <b>governing</b> the interpretation of a proform is {{that it must be}} semantically identified with its antecedent. A computational model is described in which this identification is mediated by store and retrieve operations defined with respect to a discourse model. Because VP ellipsis is treated on a par with other proforms, the ambiguity arising from "sloppy identity" becomes epiphenomenal, resulting {{from the fact that the}} store and retrieve operations are freely ordered. A primary argument for the proform theory of VP ellipsis concerns syntactic constraints on variables within the antecedent.
