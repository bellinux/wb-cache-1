5|$|However, Chase had {{designed}} the aircraft {{to allow for}} the easy installation of engines; the first XG-20 had already been modified with two radial piston engines, becoming the XC-123, the prototype of the long-serving C-123 Provider family of transports. Meanwhile, the second prototype XG-20 was returned to <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft,</b> to be fitted with two twin pods for General Electric J47 turbojets, becoming the XC-123A, the first jet-powered transport aircraft built in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Chase XCG-20, {{also known}} as the XG-20 and by the company {{designation}} MS-8 Avitruc, was a large assault glider developed immediately after World War II by the <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Company for the United States Air Force, and was the largest glider ever built in the United States. The XG-20 did not see production due to a change in USAF requirements, however, it was modified into the successful Fairchild C-123 Provider twin-engined transport aircraft which saw extensive service in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the United States Army Air Forces, {{which became}} the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1947, {{developed}} a requirement for a new, large assault glider type to replace smaller types that were then in service, all existing gliders having been declared obsolete. The new gliders were to be constructed entirely of metal, and were also required to be easily adaptable to a powered configuration. As part of a five-year development program, a contract was awarded to the <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Company of Trenton, New Jersey, in August 1946 {{for the construction of}} two types of gliders. These included a smaller model being designated XCG-18A, and the larger, definitive model being designated XCG-20.|$|E
50|$|Pure pursuit {{is a type}} of pursuit curve used in aerial {{combat in}} which an {{aircraft}} pursues another aircraft by pointing its nose directly towards it. This is in contrast with lead pursuit, in which the <b>chasing</b> <b>aircraft</b> points ahead of the aircraft it is following (typically used when attempting a gun attack) and lag pursuit, in which the <b>chasing</b> <b>aircraft</b> points behind the aircraft it is following (typically used when attempting a rear-aspect missile attack).|$|R
25|$|Kaiser-Frazer, meanwhile, {{had bought}} out the {{remaining}} 51% of <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft's</b> shares, intending {{to operate the}} company as a wholly owned subsidiary of Willys Motors; the sale closed on September 2, 1953, after the cancellation of the Air Force's contracts.|$|R
50|$|In 1956, the Civil Aeronautical Administration {{proposed}} a rear-view mirror mounted right above the pilot {{to keep an}} eye when private aircraft are landing or taxiing on the runway to prevent collisions. Fighter aircraft usually have one or more rear-view mirrors mounted on the front canopy frame to watch out for <b>chasing</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
25|$|Two {{prototype}} all-metal troop transport gliders {{built by}} <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft,</b> later designated the XG-20, one became the XC-123, {{the other the}} XC-123A.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft</b> had {{developed}} the XG-20, the largest glider ever {{built in the}} United States. By {{the time it was}} ready for operations, however, U.S. military doctrine had been altered to remove the requirement for the use of transport gliders in combat.|$|E
25|$|The Chase CG-14, {{also known}} as the G-14 or Model MS.1, was an assault glider {{manufactured}} by <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft</b> for the United States Army Air Forces during the Second World War. The aircraft failed to progress beyond the prototype stage, being overtaken by larger, improved glider designs.|$|E
500|$|Rotating the {{vectored}} thrust nozzles into a forward-facing position during normal flight is called vectoring in forward flight, or [...] "VIFFing". This is a dog-fighting tactic, allowing for more sudden braking and higher turn rates. Braking {{could cause a}} <b>chasing</b> <b>aircraft</b> to overshoot and present itself as a target for the Harrier it was chasing, a combat technique formally developed by the USMC for the Harrier in the early 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|United States Army {{operated}} three PC-9s from 1991-96 as <b>chase</b> {{and test}} <b>aircraft.</b> They {{were sold to}} Slovenia in 1995.|$|R
50|$|Other camera {{options include}} a mode that <b>chases</b> the <b>aircraft.</b> While {{this is not}} a {{realistic}} angle compared to real radio-controlled flight, it does help beginning pilots learn how to control the aircraft and to study how it reacts to the controls. Many commercial simulators feature this option as well.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Company, {{founded in}} 1943, was an {{aircraft}} manufacturer of the United States of America, primarily constructing gliders and military transport aircraft. Lacking space for expansion, {{the company was}} purchased by Henry J. Kaiser in 1951. Plans to produce the C-123 transport for the United States Air Force collapsed amid scandal, and the company closed in 1953. A successor company, Stroukoff Aircraft, continued experimental work for several years before closing in 1959.|$|E
25|$|The Fairchild C-123 Provider is an American {{military}} {{transport aircraft}} designed by <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft</b> and subsequently built by Fairchild Aircraft for the United States Air Force. In {{addition to its}} USAF service, which included later service with the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, it also went on to serve most notably with the United States Coast Guard and various air forces in South East Asia. During the Vietnam War, the aircraft was used to spray Agent Orange.|$|E
25|$|On 18 July 2012, the US Army's Aviation Flight Test Directorate {{received}} three UH-72As at Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, Alabama; {{they are}} used for general support and as <b>chase</b> <b>aircraft</b> to support aviation development testing. With this delivery, the service has received over 200 UH-72As. On 22 September 2012, the Oregon Army National Guard's Detachment 1, C Company, 1–112 Aviation, received {{the first of four}} UH-72A helicopters during a roll-out ceremony at Camp Rilea in Warrenton, Oregon.|$|E
5000|$|The London Naval Treaty forced {{shrinkage}} of {{a budget}} to the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). And it meant cooling of the Japanese shipbuilding industry worlds. The Great Depression more accelerated it. The IJN wanted to update their Notoro-class oilers and Ondo-class oilers, because these oilers {{were not able}} to <b>chase</b> the <b>aircraft</b> carrier.|$|R
25|$|Founded in New York, New York in 1943 with Michael Stroukoff, a Russian émigré, as {{president}} and chief designer, <b>Chase's</b> first <b>aircraft</b> design was the XCG-14 assault glider, produced for the U.S. Army Air Forces and first flying in January 1945. Development of improved, enlarged versions of the aircraft continued {{over the next two}} years, with the company moving to Trenton, New Jersey in 1946, before the XCG-14 was superseded by the XG-18, an even larger and heavier aircraft that was the world's first all-metal transport glider.|$|R
50|$|Getting back to {{the stolen}} aircraft, they paint it with {{politically}} charged slogans and psychedelic colors. Daria pleads with Mark to travel with her and leave the aircraft but Mark is intent on returning and taking the risks that it involves. He flies back to Los Angeles and lands the plane {{at the airport in}} Hawthorne. The police (along with some radio and television reporters) are waiting for him, and patrol cars <b>chase</b> the <b>aircraft</b> down the runway. Rather than stopping, Mark tries to turn the taxiing aircraft around across the grass and is shot to death by one of the policemen.|$|R
25|$|On 11 January 2011, the J-20 {{made its}} first flight, lasting about 15 minutes, with a Chengdu J-10S serving as the <b>chase</b> <b>aircraft.</b> After the {{successful}} flight, a ceremony was held, attended by the pilot, Li Gang, Chief Designer Yang Wei and General Li Andong, Deputy-Director of General Armaments. On 17 April 2011, a second test flight of an hour and 20 minutes took place. On 5 May 2011, a 55-minute test flight was held that included retraction of the landing gear.|$|E
25|$|Yeager went on {{to break}} many other speed and {{altitude}} records. He {{was also one of}} the first American pilots to fly a MiG-15, after its pilot, No Kum-sok, defected to South Korea. Returning to Muroc, during the latter half of 1953, Yeager was involved with the USAF team that was working on the X-1A, an aircraft designed to surpass Mach 2 in level flight. That year, he flew a <b>chase</b> <b>aircraft</b> for the civilian pilot Jackie Cochran as she became the first woman to fly faster than sound.|$|E
25|$|The Chase XC-123A was an {{experimental}} transport aircraft developed by <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft.</b> The first jet-powered transport {{built for the}} United States Air Force, it was intended {{for use as a}} high-speed transport for high-priority cargo and personnel. The XC-123A was determined to have insufficient advantages over existing types in service, and did not go into production. The sole prototype was converted into the piston-powered Stroukoff YC-123D to evaulate boundary layer control systems; following the conclusion of testing, it was sold onto the civilian market, and still exists, having been converted to turboprop power.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} Corvettes were sold and {{operated}} by several French regional airlines, such as Air Alsace, Air Alpes, Air Champagne and TAT. Sterling Airways of Denmark was another airliner that also operated the type. One Corvette {{was used as a}} VIP transport by the Congolese Air Force. By January 2009, a small number of Corvettes remained active in Europe and Africa, including one (F-GPLA cn 28) in France that had been fitted out for aerial photography missions. This Corvette was later used during high speed tests of the TGV high speed train, serving as a <b>chase</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 1953, Henry J. Kaiser {{purchased}} a majority share in <b>Chase</b> <b>Aircraft,</b> feeling that after having completed C-119s for Fairchild under contract, {{he could take}} control of the impending C-123 contract. Two airframes were completed at Kaiser's Willow Run factory in Ypsilanti, Michigan, before a pricing scandal that led to Kaiser's being told that no further contracts with him would be honored. The C-123 contract was put up for bid, and the two completed airframes scrapped. The contract was finally awarded to Fairchild Engine and Airplane, who assumed production of the former Chase C-123B, a refined version of the XC-123. Before turning production over to Fairchild, Chase originally named their C-123B the AVITRUC but it never stuck.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the Luftwaffe {{began to}} phase out their Alpha Jet A aircraft, reserving 45 for lead-in fighter training. In 1993, a total of 50 were passed on to Portugal to replace the Northrop T-38 Talon and Fiat G.91 fleets, with five of these used for spares. The rest of the Luftwaffe's Alpha Jets were {{gradually}} phased out, the last leaving service in 1998, and customers were sought to buy them. In October 1995, the German military offered 42 Alpha Jets to Poland for 143 million PLN. In 1999, 25 Alpha Jets were sold to Thailand at 1 million baht ($27,000) each, replacing the North American OV-10 Bronco in the border patrol role; while the British Defence Evaluation and Research Agency obtained 12 as <b>chase</b> <b>aircraft</b> and flight test platforms due to a shortage in available BAE Systems Hawk aircraft for the role.|$|E
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of <b>chasing</b> an <b>aircraft</b> and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|R
5|$|At first, the Japanese bombers {{appeared}} {{to be trying to}} approach and attack Enterprise but turned toward Chicago after six Enterprise CAP fighters began to engage them. Four other CAP fighters <b>chased</b> the 751AG <b>aircraft</b> as they entered the anti-aircraft fire from Chicagos escorting destroyers. Two of the bombers were shot down before they could release their ordnance. Six more were shot down moments later, but not before they dropped their torpedoes.|$|R
50|$|On 1 October 1939, Clouston {{rejoined the}} RAF, {{and served as}} a test pilot with the rank of flight {{lieutenant}} and acting squadron leader, in the Aerodynamics Flight at Farnborough. His activities included test flying of radio-controlled Airspeed Queen Wasp target drones. In June 1941, he was promoted to squadron leader. Although the unit operated some high speed fighters, it was forbidden to arm their weapons, but Clouston <b>chased</b> intruding German <b>aircraft</b> without damaging them.|$|R
25|$|NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center (formerly the Dryden Flight Research Center) at Edwards, California has {{operated}} two T-34C aircraft. The first aircraft was previously flown at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, {{where it was}} used for propulsion experiments involving turboprop engines. In 1996 this aircraft was moved Dryden as a <b>chase</b> <b>aircraft.</b> That aircraft was returned to the U.S. Navy in 2002. The second T-34C was obtained in early 2005 from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) at NAS Patuxent River, where {{it was due to}} be retired. At Armstrong, the T-34C is primarily used for chasing remotely piloted unmanned air vehicles which fly slower than NASA's F/A-18 mission support aircraft can fly. As a NASA mission support chase plane, the back seat would be occupied by a photographer or flight test engineer during research missions. It is also used for required pilot proficiency flying.|$|E

5000|$|The {{final phase}} of the {{incident}} was described in some detail by T/Sgt. Forrest Perkins, who was the Watch Supervisor in the Lakenheath Radar Air Traffic Control centre, and who wrote directly to the Condon Committee in 1968. Perkins claimed that two RAF De Havilland Venom interceptors were scrambled and directed towards a radar target near Lakenheath. The pilot of the first Venom achieved contact, but then found that the target manoeuvred behind him and <b>chased</b> the <b>aircraft</b> {{for a period of}} around 10 minutes despite the latter’s taking violent evasive action; Perkins characterised the pilot as [...] "getting worried, excited and also pretty scared". The second Venom was forced to return to its home station due to engine problems; Perkins stated that the target remained on their screens for a short period before leaving on a northerly heading.|$|R
50|$|During the dogfight, Johnson <b>chased</b> {{an enemy}} <b>aircraft</b> off his wingman's tail and {{destroyed}} it. Johnson's aircraft was then {{attacked by the}} enemy. His heavy fire tore the wing off a Japanese fighter and sent it spiraling, in the process ripping off Johnson's port (left) tail boom assembly. Johnson managed {{to regain control of}} his aircraft and was escorted back to base by the remaining friendly planes. He scored three victories that day, but at the cost of his own aircraft. Johnson was promoted to captain in the 9th Fighter Squadron in August 1943.|$|R
