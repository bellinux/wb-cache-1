The two-dimensional stability domain is given in closed-form solutions, in terms of Bessel functions. The limit of the convex stability domain tends towards Dunkerley's line when the intermediate load approaches {{the tip of the}} cantilever. However, the Dunkerley's line is no longer appropriate when the distance between both loads is sufficiently large. An approximate set of formulas is proposed for quick estimation of the buckling load. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Characterization of piezoelectric ZnO films deposited on Phynox (Elgiloy) substrate at different RF powers is discussed. ZnO films deposited at RF power of 100 W {{were found to have}} fine c-axis orientation, possesses excellent surface morphology with lower rms surface roughness of 1. 87 nm and maximum d(31) coefficient value 4. 7 pm V- 1. The thin <b>cantilever</b> <b>strip</b> of Phynox alloy with ZnO film as a sensing layer for flow sensing has been tested for flow rates ranging from 2 to 18 L min(- 1). A detailed theoretical analysis of the experimental set-up showing the relationship between output voltage and force at a particular flow rate has been discussed. The sensitivity of now sensing element is similar to 18 mV/(L min(- 1)) and typical response time is of the order of 20 m s. The sensing element is calibrated using in-house developed testing set-up.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, one {{investigates the}} elastic flexural-torsional {{buckling}} of linearly tapered <b>cantilever</b> <b>strip</b> beam-columns acted by axial and transversal point loads applied at the tip. For prismatic and wedge-shaped members, the governing differential equation is integrated in closed form {{by means of}} confluent hypergeometric functions. For general tapered members (0 <(h(max) -h(min)) /h(max) < 1), {{the solution to the}} boundary value problem is obtained {{in the form of a}} Frobenius' series, which is shown to converge in the interior of the domain and at the boundary if and only if 0 <(h(max) -h(min)) /h(max) < 1 / 2. Therefore, for 1 / 2 <=(h(max) -h(min)) /h(max) < 1 the Frobenius' series solution cannot be used to establish the characteristic equation for the cantilever beam-columns; the problem is then solved numerically by means of a collocation procedure. Some of the analytical solutions (buckling loads) were compared with the results of shell finite-element analyses and an excellent agreement was found in all cases, thus validating the mathematical model and confirming the correctness of the analytical results. The paper closes with a discussion on the convexity of the stability domain (in the load parameter space) and the accuracy of approximations based on Dunkerley-type theorems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of a differential pressure sensor with a geometrical structure accommodating dual diaphragms fixed with cantilever operated mechatronic pickup. Thin metallic spherical diaphragms of shallow shell configuration are employed to yield larger drift resulting in increased sensitivity. The cantilevers are excited electromechanically as to produce vibrations and the frequencies of vibrations are determined by picking up signals with orthogonally arranged opto-couplers linked to the <b>cantilever</b> <b>strips.</b> With each frequency determined a lookup table is referred to obtain the pressure acting on each diaphragm. Then, the average pressure acting on two diaphragms and the differential pressure are computed. They are transmitted digitally and also as analogue currents. With improved performance this pressure sensor would be very much useful for measurement of relatively heavy pneumatic pressure...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally Nafion is {{actuated}} while being hydrated along its surface. This paper presents {{an investigation into}} the electro-active actuation characteristics of Nafion while being hydrated from one of its edges to avoid direct water contact with the surface. The effectiveness of actuation of electrically excited platinum coated Nafion cantilever past a 12 minute time period without direct hydration is investigated. While <b>cantilever</b> <b>strips</b> were subjected to pressurised water at the fixed end, both coated and uncoated Nafion actuation characteristics were investigated for amplitude and time of response.. The oscillations of coated strips were able to be sustained for more than 24 hours with the techniques used. Although there was a decrease in the amount of deflection over the time period, the results suggest that hydration of the Nafion substrate can be maintained without complete surface contact, and a platinum coated region can perform as an actuator, continuously, for longer periods than previously observed in air...|$|R
40|$|Ionic polymer–metal {{composites}} (IPMCs) are biomimetic actuators and sensors. A typical IPMC {{consists of}} a thin perfluorinated ionomer membrane, with noble metal electrodes plated on both faces, and neutralized with the necessary amount of cations. A <b>cantilevered</b> <b>strip</b> of IPMC responds to an electric stimulus by generating large bending motions and, conversely, produces an electric potential upon sudden bending deformations. IPMCs have been considered for potential applications in artificial muscles, robotic systems, and biomedical devices. By examining the underpinning mechanisms responsible for the actuation and the factors that affect IPMC’s performance, novel methods to tailor its electro-mechanical response to obtain optimized actuation activities are developed and presented in this paper. By introducing various monovalent or multivalent single cations and cation combinations, diverse actuation behaviors can be obtained and optimal actuation activities can be identified. The experimental measurements show good agreement with the results obtained using the nano-scaled, physics-based model that was introduced by the first author to predict the actuation of IPMCs qualitatively and quantitatively. The bending motion of IPMCs can also be tailored by modifying the time variation of the applied direct or alternating current. We have discovered that the Nafion-based IPMC’s initial motion towards the anode can be controlled and ultimately eliminated by applying a linearly increasing electric potential at a suitable rate. For Flemion-based IPMCs, the tip displacement towards the anode is always linearly related to the cation charge accumulation at the cathode. These results have significant bearing on verifying various IPMC actuation models. (Some figures {{in this article are}} in colour only in the electronic version) 1...|$|R
40|$|Ionic polymer-metal {{composites}} (IPMCs) {{consist of}} a perfluorinated ionomer membrane (usually Nafion ® or Flemion®). The ionomer is plated on both faces with a noble metal such as gold or platinum. It is neutralized {{with a certain amount}} of counterions that balance the electrical charge of anions covalently fixed to the backbone membrane. IPMCs are electroactive materials that can be used as actuators and sensors. Their electrical-chemical-mechanical response is highly dependent on the cations used, the nature and the amount of solvent uptake, the morphology of the electrodes, and other factors. When a <b>cantilever</b> <b>strip</b> of solvated Nafion-based IPMC sample is subjected to a suddenly applied and sustained (DC) electric potential of several volts (1 - 3 V) across its faces, it bends towards the anode. For Nafion-based IPMCs with alkali metals, actuation towards the anode is followed by a slow back relaxation towards the cathode. If the electric potential is removed and the two electrodes are shorted during this back relaxation, the sample displays a fast bending deformation towards the cathode and then slowly relaxes back towards the anode, attaining a new equilibrium position generally distinct from its initial state. One way to change various phases of IPMC actuation is achieved by changing input potential. The electric potential inputs may be used to control the actuation of IPMCs. We present the results of a series of tests on Nafion-based IPMCs with ethylene glycol as solvent, actuated under electric potential inputs other than DC electric potential. We present experimental results for increasing ramp and sinusoidal electric potential waveforms...|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the urgent}} need for an {{efficient}} and accurate structural analysis method in bridge design practice, this paper introduces a total integrated analytical solution for multi-span, continuous slab-on-girder and box girder bridges, by modeling the bridge deck and the piers together, using the finite strip method (FSM). FSM has been well accredited for its efficiency in the structural analysis of bridges, reducing the time required for data input and analysis without affecting the degree of accuracy. By using a continuously differentiable smooth series in the longitudinal direction, a complex 3 D problem is reduced to a 2 D problem using the FSM. However, difficulties are encountered when components of different orientation, such as the piers, are included to the formulation. Thus, the analytical model developed using the conventional FSM is limited to the super-structures, without proper consideration of the interactions between the bridge deck (super-structure) and piers (sub-structure). In this regard, a cantilever type of pier strip element is formulated by the authors, based on the spline finite strip concept, which is compatible with the well developed spline finite strip bridge deck. In addition, by combining the piers and the bridge deck altogether in a single finite strip formulation, with some appropriate connecting boundary conditions, the time required for both static and dynamic analysis can be significantly reduced. In this paper, the development and verification of the vertical <b>cantilever</b> <b>strip</b> is introduced and the overall integrated method of analysis is presented with the aid of numerical examples. In addition, the efficiency of the proposed approach in seismic analysis using the Pseudo Excitation Method (PEM) is also demonstrated as an extension of its application...|$|E
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest to re-invent device technologies for use in actual field applications where resources may be limited. Numerous examples exist in the medical and agricultural industry where the demand and benefits for on-the-spot methods of sample collection, preparation, and characterization is being recognized by the scientific community. Some key attributes of devices that cater to this demand of on-the-spot testing are portability, low cost, disposability, easy fabrication and storage, simple operational procedure, and reasonable sensitivity and selectivity. Within the abovementioned realm of device technologies, the thesis attempts to provide low-cost alternative methods for two applications: (i) fluid flow in paper microfluidic devices and (ii) nematode egg separation and counting. Chapter 1 presents a technique to control and operate fluid flow between multiple paper substrates by employing a folded paper <b>cantilever</b> <b>strip.</b> The paper strip is mechanically actuated by a small fluid droplet. The technique can be scaled up to accomplish multiple colorimetric tests, and is demonstrated for the parallel detection of three analytes (glucose, nitrite, and protein). This actuator is intended for use in paper microfluidic devices to quantify levels of disease biomarkers. Chapter 2 describes a method to separate nematode eggs from soil particles followed by {{counting the number of}} eggs within a fluid suspension. Nematode eggs with similar-sized soil particles are collected from a series of soil processing steps. Conventionally, through a staining procedure and sucrose centrifugation, a relatively cleaner soil suspension with eggs is obtained that is later counted manually on a microscopic slide. Here we present a method of density-based centrifugation that seems to provide better efficiency in separating the eggs from the soil particles. Egg counting from large-volume fluids is accomplished on a scanner with a custom imaging software that recognizes and counts the number of eggs. In summary, the use of paper substrates is advocated in the thesis because they are considerably cheaper than polymeric substrates and can be easily fabricated, molded, stored, transported, and imaged. For both applications, the methods presented here could be adopted in field settings and integrated with other current procedures of sample preparation and characterization...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of elastically-tailored self-adaptive structures {{through the use}} of anisotropic advanced composite materials continues to attract more interest and new applications. However, the process required to design a structure which exploits the elastic-couplings of an anisotropic material is complex. Considerably more understanding of advanced composite materials is required to successfully deliver a tailored elastic response than is required to design a typical laminate. The research of this thesis has thoroughly assessed the effectiveness of using first-order theories to approximate the deformation response of laminated bend-twist coupled cantilever beams/plates as a method for developing system understanding during preliminary design. The bend-twist coupling response of laminated <b>cantilevered</b> <b>strips</b> was measured to higher levels of accuracy than other examples in the literature {{with the aid of a}} 3 -D laser scanner. The experimental results were compared with one-dimensional analytical models and finite element numerical simulations (both derived from first-order laminated plate stiffnesses) to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the first-order approximations for developing an understanding of bend-twist coupled cantilever response. Through this research it was demonstrated that the understanding of a bend-twist coupled cantilever can be significantly enhanced with the use of simple and uncomplicated methods derived from the elementary laminated plate theories. The one-dimensional model was found to provide liberal (overestimated) deflection and twist approximations, the magnitude of which was dependent on planform aspect ratio and material properties. The main contributor to the inaccuracy of the one-dimensional models was attributed to the restraint of rotation at the finite width fixed-end boundary. However, specific insight has arisen from this research which shows that in spite of the systematic overestimation of deflection and twist, a first-order approximation provides considerable insight into the deformation response of bend-twist coupled cantilevers. In addition to deformation approximations, it was also found that there are certain aspects of first-order laminated plate models which are very effective at characterising the bend-twist coupling response of thin cantilevers. The locus of flexural-centres, the bend-twist coupling twist rate and a new parameter, the Cross-Sectional Centre of Twist, were all demonstrated to be accurately approximated by expressions derived from the one-dimensional model...|$|R
40|$|A {{common form}} of MEMS {{actuator}} is a thermally actuated bimaterial, which is easy to fabricate by surface micromachining and permits out of plane actuation, which is otherwise difficult to achieve. This paper presents an analytical framework {{for the design of}} such microelectrothermal bimaterial actuators. Mechanics relationships for a <b>cantilever</b> bimaterial <b>strip</b> subjected to a uniform temperature were applied to obtain expressions for performance metrics for the actuator, i. e., maximum work/volume, blocked (force) moment, and free-end (displacement) slope. Results from finite-element analysis and closed form relations agree well to within 1 %. The optimal performance for a given pair of materials and the corresponding thickness ratio were determined. Contours of equal performance corresponding to commonly used substrates (e. g., Si, SiO 2) were plotted in the domain of governing material properties (thermal expansion coefficient and Young's modulus) to identify candidate materials for further development. These results and the accompanying methodology provide a rational basis for comparing the suitability of "standard" materials for microelectrothermal actuators, as well as identifying materials that might be suitable for further research...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of Active Fiber Composites (AFC) as sensors for detecting damage, a pretwisted strip made of AFC with symmetric free-edge delamination is considered in this paper. The strain developed on the top/bottom of the strip is measured to detect and assess delamination. Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) {{is used in the}} development of a non-classical non-linear cross sectional model of the strip. The original three dimensional (3 D) problem is simplified by the decomposition into two simpler problems: a two-dimensional (2 D) problem, which provides in a compact form the cross-sectional properties using VAM, and a non-linear one-dimensional (1 D) problem along the length of the beam. This procedure gives the non-linear stiffnesses, which are very sensitive to damage, at any given cross-section of the strip. The developed model is used to study a special case of <b>cantilevered</b> laminated <b>strip</b> with antisymmetric layup, loaded only by an axial force at the tip. The charge generated in the AFC lamina is derived in closed form in terms of the 1 D strain measures. It is observed that delamination length and location have a definite influence on the charge developed in the AFC lamina. Also, sensor voltage output distribution along the length of the beam is obtained using evenly distributed electrode strip. These data could in turn be used to detect the presence of damage...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to show that}} plate strips subjected to transverse line loads can be analysed by using the beam on elastic foundation (BEF) approach. It is shown that the elastic behaviour of both the centre line section of a semi infinite plate supported along two edges, and the free edge of a <b>cantilever</b> plate <b>strip</b> can be accurately predicted by calculations based on the two parameter BEF theory. The transverse bending stiffness of the plate strip forms the foundation. The foundation modulus is shown, mathematically and physically, to be the zero order term of the fourth order differential equation governing the behaviour of BEF, whereas the torsion rigidity of the plate acts like pre tension in the second order term. Direct equivalence is obtained for harmonic line loading by comparing the differential equations of Levy's method (a simply supported plate) with the BEF method. By equating the second and zero order terms of the semi infinite BEF model for each harmonic component, two parameters are obtained for a simply supported plate of width B: the characteristic length, 1 / λ, and the normalized sum, n, being the effect of axial loading and stiffening resulting from the torsion stiffness, nlin. This procedure gives the following result for the first mode when a uniaxial stress field was assumed (ν = 0) : 1 /λ = √ 2 B/π and nlin = 1. For constant line loading, which is the superimposition of harmonic components, slightly differing foundation parameters are obtained when the maximum deflection and bending moment values of the theoretical plate, with v = 0, and BEF analysis solutions are equated: 1 /λ= 1. 47 B/π and nlin. = 0. 59 for a simply supported plate; and 1 /λ = 0. 99 B/π and nlin = 0. 25 for a fixed plate. The BEF parameters of the plate strip with a free edge are determined based solely on finite element analysis (FEA) results: 1 /λ = 1. 29 B/π and nlin. = 0. 65, where B is the double width of the <b>cantilever</b> plate <b>strip.</b> The stress biaxial, v > 0, is shown not to affect the values of the BEF parameters significantly the result of the geometric nonlinearity caused by in plane, axial and biaxial loading is studied theoretically by comparing the differential equations of Levy's method with the BEF approach. The BEF model is generalised {{to take into account the}} elastic rotation stiffness of the longitudinal edges. Finally, formulae are presented that take into account the effect of Poisson's ratio, and geometric non linearity, on bending behaviour resulting from axial and transverse inplane loading. It is also shown that the BEF parameters of the semi infinite model are valid for linear elastic analysis of a plate strip of finite length. The BEF model was verified by applying it to the analysis of bending stresses caused by misalignments in a laboratory test panel. In summary, it can be concluded that the advantages of the BEF theory are that it is a simple tool, and that it is accurate enough for specific stress analysis of semi infinite and finite plate bending problems...|$|R
40|$|The cross-sensitivity of microcantilever sensors {{presents}} {{a major obstacle}} {{in the development of}} a commercially viable microcantilever biosensor for point of care testing. This thesis concerns electrothermally actuated bi-material microcantilevers with piezoresistive read out, developed for use as a blood coagulometer. Thermal properties of the sensor environment including the heat capacity and thermal conductivity affect the ‘thermal profile’ onto which the higher frequency mechanical signal is superimposed. In addition, polymer microcantilevers are known to have cross-sensitivity to relative humidity due to moisture absorption in the beam. However it is not known whether any of these cross sensitivities have a significant impact on performance of the sensor during pulsed mode operation or following immersion into liquid. When analysing patient blood samples, any change in signal that is not caused by the change in blood viscosity during clotting could lead to a false result and consequently an incorrect dose of anticoagulants may be taken by the patient. In order to address these issues three aspects of the operation of polymer bi-material <b>strip</b> <b>cantilevers</b> has been researched and investigated: relative humidity; viscosity/density, and thermal conductivity of a liquid environment. The relative humidity was not found to affect the resonant frequency of a microcantilever operated in air, or to affect the ability of the cantilever to measure clot times. However, a decrease in deflection with increasing relative humidity of the SmartStrip microcantilever beams is observed at 1. 1 ± 0. 4 μm per 1...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to develop and {{demonstrate}} a comprehensive analysis of single and multi-body composite strip-beam systems using an asymptotically-correct geometrically nonlinear theory. The comprehensiveness refers to the two distinguishing features of this work, namely the unified framework for the analysis and {{the inclusion of the}} usually ignored cross-sectional nonlinearities in thin-beam and multi-beam analyses. The first part of this work stitches together an approach to analyse generally anisotropic composite beams. Based on geometrically exact nonlinear elasticity theory, the nonlinear 3 -D beam problem splits into either a linear (conventionally considered) or nonlinear (considered in this work) 2 -D analysis of the beam cross-section and a nonlinear 1 -D analysis along the beam reference curve. The two sub-tasks of this work (viz. nonlinear analysis of the beam cross-section and nonlinear beam analysis) are accomplished on a single platform using an object-oriented framework. First, two established nonlinear cross-sectional analyses (numerical and analytical), both based on the Variational-Asymptotic Method (VAM), are invoked. The numerical analysis is capable of treating cross-sections of arbitrary geometry and material distributions and can capture certain nonlinear effects such as the trapeze effect. The closed-form analytical analysis is restricted to thin rectangular cross-sections for generally anisotropic composites but captures ALL cross-sectional nonlinearities, and not just the well-known Brazier and trapeze effects. Second, the well-established geometrically-exact nonlinear 1 -D governing equations along the beam reference curve, after being generalized to utilize the expressions for nonlinear stiffness matrix, are solved using the mixed variational finite element method. Finally, local 3 -D stress, strain and displacement fields for representative sections in the beam are recovered, based on the stress resultants from the 1 -D global beam analysis. This part of the work is then validated by applying it to an initially twisted <b>cantilevered</b> laminated composite <b>strip</b> under axial force. The second part is concerned with the dynamic analysis of nonlinear multi-body systems involving elastic strip-like beams made of laminated, anisotropic composite materials using an object-oriented framework. In this work, unconditionally stable time-integration schemes presenting high-frequency numerical dissipation are used to solve the ensuing governing equations. The codes developed based on such time-integration schemes are first validated with the literature for two standard test cases: non-linear spring mass oscillator and pendulum. In order to apply the comprehensive analysis code thus developed to a multi-body system, the four-bar mechanism is chosen as an example. All component bars of the mechanism have thin rectangular cross-sections and are made of fiber reinforced laminates of various types of layups. They could, in general, be pre-twisted and/or possess initial curvature, either by design or by defect. They are linked to each other by means of revolute joints. Each component of the mechanism is modeled as a beam based on {{the first part of this}} work. Results from this analysis are compared with those available in the literature, both theoretical and experimental. The margins between the linear and non-linear results are evaluated specifically due to the cross-sectional nonlinearities and shown to vary with stacking sequences. This work thus demonstrates the importance of geometrically nonlinear cross-sectional analysis of certain composite beam-based four-bar mechanisms in predicting system dynamic characteristics. To enable graphical visualization, the behavior of the four-bar mechanism is also observed by using commercial software (I-DEAS + NASTRAN + ADAMS). Finally, the component-laminate load-carrying capacity is estimated using the Tsai-Wu-Hahn failure criterion for various layups and the same criterion is used to predict the first-ply-failure and the mechanism as a whole...|$|R
