The research describes the Chilean Navy acquisition system based on its current organization, its regulations, and procedures, and the Supply Management foundations act as a theoretical structure to analyze Chilean Navy acquisition systems, whose results are expressed in eight recommendations to improve the Chilean Navy acquisition system. The Supply Management Theory provides a competitive advantage that is applicable to the defense environment in reducing costs, improving combat systems, and increasing efficiencies that accelerate the satisfaction of troop’s requirements. The foundational principles used in the analysis include strategic formulation, performance measurement, supply base optimization and management, and an adequate organizational structure.

Each time reinforcement was programmed, only the first response to occur, that is, the response of {{only one of the}} subjects, was reinforced. “Competitive” behavior that developed under these conditions was examined in three experiments. In Experiment 1 subjects responded under fixed-interval (FI) 30 -s, 60 -s, and 90 -s schedules of reinforcement. Under the competition condition, relative to baseline conditions, the response rates were higher and the pattern was “break-and-run. ” In Experiment 2, subjects were exposed first to a conventional FI schedule and then to an FI competition schedule. Next, they were trained to respond under either a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) or fixed-ratio (FR) schedule, and finally, the initial FI competition condition was reinstated. In this second exposure to the FI <b>competition</b> <b>procedure,</b> DRL subjects responded at lower rates than were emitted during the initial exposure to that condition and FR subjects responded at higher rates.

An immunosensor device for the determination of triazinic pesticides based on two different <b>competition</b> <b>procedures</b> is therefore described. The immunosensor developed uses an amperometric electrode for hydrogen peroxide as transducer and the peroxidase enzyme as marker. The results demonstrate the full validity of this immunosensor method which was optimized by comparing two different "competition" operating procedures. The results obtained using the new immunosensor were then compared with those found using an inhibition OPEE (Organic Phase Enzyme Electrode) for triazinic pesticide detection, which showed no selectivity toward different classes of triazinic, carbamate or organophosphate pesticides. The immunosensor developed displayed on the contrary an appreciable selectivity both toward different classes of pesticides and toward triazinic or benzotriazinic products. In addition, the K(aff) value was evaluated. Lastly, the immunosensor was also used to test triazinic pesticide recovery from common real matrices such as milk and vegetal samples, obtaining good recoveries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Due process’ {{has grown}} into a {{hallmark}} of EU competition law enforcement. Fundamental procedural rights like the right to be heard or the right to judicial review now provide a generally accepted basis for improving the legitimacy and effectiveness of competition law enforcement. Emphasis on procedural guarantees also triggers important – but largely overlooked – institutional consequences. In responding to due process challenges, supranational and national enforcement agencies have been and still are invited to adapt to newfound procedural realities. These adaptations result in the gradual convergence of formerly diverging institutional arrangements into a single EU ‘due process’ institutional model. This paper frames the converging institutional role of due process in EU competition law enforcement and assesses the ways in which it affects our understanding of legitimate competition enforcement. A first part analyses two recent institutional evolutions that resulted in institutional transformations at either the national or the supranational level. On the one hand, the Court of Justice mandated transformations in national competition law enforcement systems for the sake of effective judicial review in its 2010 Vebic judgment. On the other, the Commission adapted its Hearing Officer’s terms of reference with a view to enhance due process at the EU level and to remain on a par with particular national evolutions. In both instances, concrete institutional modifications resulted from the interplay between due process, EU <b>competition</b> <b>procedure</b> and national enforcement structures. A second part integrates both examples into a conceptual EU ‘due process’ convergence framework, which provides markers for future developments in institutional transformation. The identified convergence framework in turn calls for a reassessment of the indicators of legitimate competition law enforcement. A third part of this paper therefore outlines a proposal for new indicators and discusses their potentially transformative effects on the proxies of legitimate competition enforcement. status: accepte...|$|E

The practice showed that the legislative framework is most defective at the decrees of the professional qualification verification as it defines only the methods for its verification, among which it is possible to choose arbitrarily, but it does not define, what should be verified.
