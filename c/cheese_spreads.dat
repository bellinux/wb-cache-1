2500|$|On 13 June 2009, Kraft {{released}} {{a new version}} of Vegemite. The formula combines Vegemite and Kraft cream <b>cheese,</b> <b>spreads</b> more easily and has a considerably less salty and milder taste than the original. To coincide with the release of the new recipe, Kraft ran a competition to give the new flavour a name. The new name was announced during the broadcast of the 2009 AFL Grand Final as iSnack 2.0. The name was chosen by a panel of marketing and communication experts to appeal to a younger market, capitalising on the popularity of Apple's iPod and iPhone. The choice immediately drew universal criticism and ridicule within Australia. Within days, opinion columns and social networking sites were flooded with derision and vitriol, and after only four days, Kraft released plans to abandon the iSnack name, admitting that {{it may have been a}} mistake. Two days later, Kraft opened a new poll on its website, and the final name was announced on 7 October 2009 as [...] "Vegemite Cheesybite", with Kraft claiming that the name had received 36% of the 30,357 votes that were cast for a name option, or approximately 10,900 votes. It was noted that the popular suggestion [...] "Cheesymite", long associated with the popular Cheesymite scroll, was already trademarked by other organisations.|$|E
