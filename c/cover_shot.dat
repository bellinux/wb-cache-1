5|$|The {{headquarters}} of the Religious Society of Friends, {{better known as the}} Quakers, is at Friends House, No.173 Euston Road. It was built between 1925–7 and holds the society's library dating back to 1673, including George Fox's journal covering the foundation of Pennsylvania. Euston Road School was opened at No.314 in 1934 by William Coldstream, Victor Pasmore and Claude Rogers to encourage artwork in an atmosphere different to traditional art schools. The school struggled and closed by the start of World War II. It was demolished in the early 1960s; the <b>cover</b> <b>shot</b> of the Beatles' Twist and Shout EP was taken on its remains after demolition.|$|E

Kramer & The Dakotas, Gerry & The Pacemakers (including <b>cover</b> <b>shots</b> for their How Do You Like It and Ferry Across The Mersey LPs) and Cilla Black (including <b>cover</b> <b>shots</b> for the Cilla and Cilla Sings A Rainbow LPs). He also did several photographs of the hugely successful Australian folk-pop group The Seekers, including the <b>cover</b> <b>shots</b> for the LP Seekers Seen in Green (1967); his Seekers photos were also used for the archival CD Live at the Talk of the Town and The Seekers Complete boxed set, and a more recent photo of Judith Durham was used on the cover of her 2001 solo CD Hang on to Your Dream.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{returning}} to Washington, D.C., the band suggested this same system to local clubs {{as a means}} to allow teenagers in to see musical performances without being served alcohol. The Teen Idles released a record in 1980 called Minor Disturbance with the <b>cover</b> <b>shot</b> being two hands with black Xs on the back. The mark soon became associated with the straight edge lifestyle. It can also be used by drinking establishments to note a patron as under the drinking age, regardless of their views towards drugs and alcohol.|$|E
500|$|For the 10th, 17th and 25th anniversaries of the album, Spencer Elden recreated {{the front}} <b>cover</b> <b>shot</b> for {{photographer}}s each time. He {{wanted to do}} the [...] 25th anniversary shoot nude but the photographer preferred that he wore swim shorts.|$|E
500|$|Eric Hayes {{took the}} {{photo on the}} sleeve design for the UK release, which {{featured}} neither album title nor band name. The photo captured Denny's parents, Neil and Edna Denny, standing outside the family home in Arthur Road, Wimbledon, south London, with the band distantly visible through the garden fence. St Mary's Church, Wimbledon, {{can be seen in}} the background. Joe Boyd later said [...] "Unhalfbricking, then, that <b>cover</b> <b>shot</b> was taken in the early spring, right before the crash, I think; and that record came out in June".|$|E

500|$|Years later, Wintour {{admitted}} the photo {{had never been}} planned as the <b>cover</b> <b>shot.</b> In 2011, when Vogue put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, [...] "I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, 'This is something new. This is something different.' [...] The printers called {{to make sure that}} was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made." [...] In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. [...] "t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for Vogue." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1993, Jackson {{made her}} film debut in Poetic Justice. While {{the film was}} {{critically}} panned, her performance was described as [...] "beguiling" [...] and [...] "believably eccentric." [...] Jackson's ballad [...] "Again", which was written for the film, received Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for [...] "Best Original Song." [...] In September 1993, Jackson appeared topless {{on the cover of}} Rolling Stone, with her breasts covered by former husband René Elizondo, Jr. The photograph is the original version of the cropped image used on the Janet album <b>cover,</b> <b>shot</b> by Patrick Demarchelier. The Vancouver Sun reported, [...] "Jackson, 27, remains clearly established as both role model and sex symbol; the Rolling Stone photo of Jackson... {{became one of the most}} recognizable, and most lampooned, magazine covers." [...] The Janet World Tour launched in support of the studio album garnered criticism for Jackson's lack of vocal proficiency and spontaneity, but earned critical acclaim for her showmanship. It was described as erasing the line between [...] "stadium-size pop music concerts and full-scale theatrical extravaganzas." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} denoted Madonna's {{continued}} fascination with Spanish culture and fashion. She wore a female toreador outfit with a lacy bustier, embroidered bolero {{jacket and a}} cummerbund with a flouncy bustle. Jeri Heiden, who had worked on the cover art for True Blue, was given the task of editing the photos and making them compatible for appearance in an album <b>cover.</b> <b>Shot</b> by Herb Ritts, the cover showed Madonna again as a platinum blond. Heiden explained {{in an interview with}} Aperture magazine in October 2006 that the cover was not meant to be a tie-in with the True Blue cover. [...] "It was just Madonna's look at the time– Platinum Blond. And of course the handwriting reappears on that album." [...] The album sleeve included a free poster and the gold wrap-around liner notes contained approximate running time to indicate the difference between the length of the remix and the original track. Brian Chin, a Rolling Stone journalist, wrote the liner notes for the album, explaining the process of remix and why the seven songs were chosen for the track list.|$|E

5000|$|Cynthia Dall (born Cynthia Meggin Loya) (March 12, 1971 April 5, 2012), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} [...] "Cindy Dall", was an American lo-fi musician and photographer.

500|$|The album <b>cover,</b> <b>shot</b> by {{photographer}} Herb Ritts, {{is one of}} Madonna's {{most recognizable}} pictures. It features a picture of Madonna from the neck up. The main colors in the picture are gray, white and various shades of blue to reinforce the album's title. Madonna positioned herself in an elegant pose while wearing pale make up with red lips, tilting back her neck in a swan like pose. Jeri Heiden, who was working at Warner Bros. art department, was given the task of editing the photos and making them compatible for appearance in an album cover. She {{had to work with}} a total of 60 rolls of photos, each of size 35 mm. Heiden ordered about 30 to 40 test prints from Ritts' studio and made recommendations based on it. Several images from the photo shoot were considered for the album cover, some of which later became the single covers for [...] "Papa Don't Preach", [...] "True Blue" [...] and [...] "Open Your Heart". The final photo was selected by Madonna, Heiden and Jeff Ayeroff, creative director of Warner Bros. at that time.|$|E
500|$|The {{band played}} shows along the East Coast in December 1969, {{attempting}} to kick-start the record onto Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums chart. In January, the band {{performed at the}} Electric Factory in Philadelphia and the Fillmore West in San Francisco before debuting at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles, representing the Allmans' first engagement there since their days in the Hour Glass. On {{the third day of}} their Whisky residency, the album logged at number 188 on the top 200, [...] "enough to prove that the ABB was more than a regional outfit." [...] Capricorn issued [...] "Black Hearted Woman" [...] as the album’s single, edited down to nearly two minutes shorter in an effort to place on top 40 radio. Despite Ed Och's rave review in Billboard, the single failed to register on pop radio. Rather than employing the standard <b>cover</b> <b>shot</b> for the advertising campaign, marketing rather emphasized the nude group shot, alongside a quote from Och's Billboard review, describing the group as a [...] "bad bunch of electric Southern longhairs." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was taken}} from a shoot by fashion {{photographer}} Mario Testino, in which Madonna modelled Versace clothes for their upcoming Fall/Winter 1995 campaign. Subsequently, other images taken from the shoot appeared in fashion magazines, such as Vanity Fair and Vogue Italia. The packaging included with the release showed Madonna looking [...] "deliciously cosmopolitan" [...] as she wore a tight-fit white cocktail attire, while the back cover artwork is predominantly more playful. The front cover artwork presented Madonna leaning against a wall {{with an expression of}} [...] "romantic loss or absorption." [...] Designed as the Madonna album which would appeal to a larger audience in contrast to her previous records, Bedtime Stories and [...] Erotica, the booklet featured red roses inside and a golden yellow flower on the back cover. According to The Guardian writer Caroline Sullivan, the fact that Madonna removed her nose ring for the <b>cover</b> <b>shot</b> indicated she [...] "wants the album to be taken on its own merits." [...] In 2013, the artwork was dubbed as one of the [...] "20 Most Fashionable Album Covers Ever" [...] by the Dutch edition of Elle magazine. The title of the album derives from her 1990 song of the same name since it had received little attention during the release of its original album, I'm Breathless.|$|E

2500|$|The June/July {{issue of}} Men's Fitness {{magazine}} carried {{an article on}} Roddick. The <b>cover</b> <b>shot</b> featured the tennis ace in a T-shirt, straining to contain massive, pumped-up biceps and hulking shoulder and chest muscles. The image set off widespread online speculation that the magazine had altered Roddick's likeness, a suspicion echoed by Roddick himself. Roddick has quipped that he saw the photo, and that [...] "Nadal wanted his arms back." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sweet's initial album {{appearance}} {{was on the}} budget label Music for Pleasure {{as part of a}} compilation called Gimme Dat Ding, released in December 1970. The Sweet had one side of the record; the Pipkins (whose sole hit, [...] "Gimme Dat Ding", gave the LP its name) had the other. The Sweet side consisted of the A- and B-sides of the band's three Parlophone singles. Andy Scott appears in the album <b>cover</b> <b>shot,</b> even though he did not play on any of the recordings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Ronstadt {{reached the}} Top 3 of Billboards Album Chart and won her second career Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her third {{consecutive}} platinum album Hasten Down the Wind. The album featured a sexy, revealing <b>cover</b> <b>shot</b> and showcased Ronstadt the singer-songwriter, who composed {{two of its}} songs, [...] "Try Me Again" [...] (co-authored with Andrew Gold) and [...] "Lo Siento Mi Vida". It also included an interpretation of Willie Nelson's classic [...] "Crazy", which became a Top 10 Country hit for Ronstadt in early 1977.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album cover}} was {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson (with Peter Curzon and Rupert Truman) – who, {{as leader of the}} group of artists known as Hipgnosis, was best known for his cover work for Pink Floyd. [...] "We {{knew we were going to}} set this idea of the eternal flame, the graphic flame, in Lanzarote, a volcanic island, since volcanoes suited the brooding menace of Audioslave," [...] Thorgerson recalled. An unreleased version of the <b>cover,</b> <b>shot</b> elsewhere at the same location, features a naked man looking at the flame. [...] "We so nearly used it," [...] said Thorgerson, [...] "but we were not entirely sure of the nude figure." ...|$|E
2500|$|The magazine's photographers {{also made}} their mark with {{innovations}} like putting cameras [...] at a hockey game and [...] at a basketball game. In 1965, offset printing began {{to allow the}} color pages of the magazine to be printed overnight, not only producing crisper and brighter images, but also finally enabling the editors to merge the best color with the latest news. By 1967, the magazine was printing 200 pages of [...] "fast color" [...] a year; in 1983, SI became the first American full-color newsweekly. An intense rivalry developed between photographers, particularly Walter Iooss and Neil Leifer, to get a decisive <b>cover</b> <b>shot</b> that would be on newsstands and in mailboxes {{only a few days}} later.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} entitled London and the album <b>cover</b> <b>shot</b> {{was going to be}} of a fruit-and-vegetable cart. Albarn stated tongue-in-cheek, [...] "That was the last time that Dave Balfe was, sort of, privy to any decision or creative process with us, and that was his final contribution: to call it London". The cover refers to the British pastime of greyhound racing. Most of the pictures in the CD booklet are of the band in the greyhound racing venue Walthamstow Stadium, although the actual cover was not shot there. The album cover for Parklife was among the ten chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of [...] "Classic Album Cover" [...] postage stamps issued in January 2010.|$|E
