40|$|International audienceThe <b>C-method</b> {{was born}} in the eighties in Clermont-Ferrand, France, from the need to solve rigorously {{diffraction}} problems at corrugated periodic surfaces in the resonance regime. The main difficulty of such problems is the matching of boundaries conditions. For that purpose, Chandezon et al introduced the so called translation coordinate system in which the boundary of the physical problem coincides with coordinate surfaces. The second ingredient of <b>C-method</b> is to write Maxwell's equation under the covariant form. This formulation comes from relativity where the use of curvilinear non orthogonal coordinate system is essential and natural. The main feature of this formalism is that Maxwell's equations remain invariant in any coordinate system, the geometry being shifted into the constitutive relations. The third ingredient of <b>C-method</b> {{is that it is a}} modal method. This nice property is linked with the translation coordinate system in which a diffraction problem may be expressed as an eigenvalue eigenvector problem with periodic boundary conditions. The key point of <b>C-method</b> is the joint use of curvilinear coordinates and covariant formulation of Maxwell's equations. All the new developments in the modeling of gratings like Adaptive Spatial Resolution, and Matched Coordinates derive from this fundamental observation...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{elements}} of dendrochronological standardization is removing the biological trend, i. e. the progressive decline of ring width along a cross-sectional radius that is caused by the corresponding increase in stem size and tree age over time. The ‘‘conservative’’ option for removing this biological trend is to fit a modified negative exponential curve (or a straight line with slope ≤ 0) to the ring-width measurements. This method {{is based on the assumption}} that, especially for open-grown and/or shade-intolerant species, annual growth rate of mature trees fluctuates around a specific level, expressed by a constant ring width. Because this method has numerical and conceptual drawbacks, we propose an alternative approach based on the assumption that constant growth is expressed by a constant basal area increment distributed over a growing surface. From this starting point, we derive a mathematical expression for the biological trend of ring width, which can be easily calculated and used for dendrochronological standardization. The proposed <b>C-method</b> is compared to other standardization techniques, including Regional Curve Standardization (RCS), of tree-ring width from ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex P. Lawson & C. Lawson) located at the Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) in northern Arizona, USA. Master ring-index chronologies built from ring area, RCS, and <b>C-method</b> reproduced stand-wide patterns of tree growth at the GPNA, whereas other standardization options, including the ‘‘conservative’’ one, failed to do so. In addition, the <b>C-method</b> has the advantage of calculating an expected growth curve for each tree, whereas RCS is based on applying the same growth curve to all trees. In conclusion, the <b>C-method</b> replaces the purely empirical ‘‘conservative’’ option with a theory based approach, which is applicable to individual ring-width measurement series, does not require fitting a growth curve using nonlinear regression, and can be rigorously tested for improving tree-ring records of environmental changes...|$|E

This family includes, as particular cases, some of the most famous third-order iterative methods: Chebyshev methods, Halley methods, super-Halley methods, <b>C-methods</b> and Newton-type two-step methods.

This technique allows us to obtain a general semilocal convergence result for these methods, where the usual conditions on the second derivative are relaxed. On the other hand, the main practical difficulty related to the classical third-order iterative methods is the evaluation of bilinear operators, typically second-order Fréchet derivatives. However, in some cases, the second derivative is easy to evaluate. A clear example is provided by the approximation of Hammerstein equations, where it is diagonal by blocks.

Second, {{we consider the}} nonlinear systems of conservation laws which propagate shock waves, rarefactions, and contact discontinuities, and introduce what we call the <b>C-method.</b> We shall focus our attention on the compressible Euler equations in one space dimension. The novel feature of our approach involves the coupling of a linear scalar reaction -diffusion equation to our system of conservation laws, whose solution C(x, t) is the coefficient to an additional (and artificial) term added to the flux, which determines the location, localization, and strength of the artificial viscosity.

We apply this method to multilayer gratings with an arbitrary number of interfaces. The interfaces can have different functional form and amplitude and can be parallel or not. For each interface separating two homogeneous media, we consider two horizontal planes aboveand below the interface, and define a coordinate system such that the interface and both horizontalplanes correspond to coordinate surfaces. Inside the area delimited by the two horizontal planes,the Maxwell's equations lead to an initial value problem which can be solved with initial conditionssatisfying the boundary conditions. Outside this area, the fields are represented by Rayleighexpansion. The scattering matrix between two consecutive media is obtained by using continuityrelations between different components of fields on the horizontal planes. We consider a n + 1 layer diffraction grating, thus there are n interfaces separating the layers. From the uppermost to downmost, these layers are composed of medium 1 to medium n + 1. Each medium has a constant optical index. Thus we can calculate the scattering matrix Si,i+ 1 which associate the incoming and outcoming waves from medium i and i + 1.

Chl a showed an average value of 40, 20, and 30 mgm− 3 for the three lakes, respectively. Integrated areal primary production for the total phytoplankton (gCm− 2 d− 1) varied 2 -fold in the three lakes but on different levels, from 0. 67 – 1. 8 in L. Ziway, 1. 8 – 4. 6 in L. Awassa, and 1. 0 – 2. 6 in L. Chamo. The overall photosynthetic efficiency of utilizing photosynthetically active radiation by the phytoplankton on molar basis (mmol C mol of photons− 1) resulted in an average value of 1. 4 for L. Ziway, 3. 5 for L. Awassa and 1. 6 for L. Chamo. Among the different factors regulating phytoplankton primary productivity, light penetration and nutrients {{were the most important}} in the three lakes. The seasonal variations of incident radiation (most values between 5 and 7 Em− 2 h− 1) and water temperature (most values between 22 and 24 °C) were small and unlikely to result in the marked differences in phytoplankton primary production. Although relative increase in nutrient concentrations occurred following the rainy periods, the major algal nutrients were either consistently low (nitrate and/or silicate) or high (phosphate and/or ammonium) and remained within a narrow range for most of the study period in all the three lakes. Consequently, phytoplankton biomass and primary production seem to be maintained more by nutrient regeneration or turnover (facilitated by high temperature) than by allochthonous nutrient input. This would be coupled with wind-induced mixing that would {{play an important role in}} determining hydrographic characteristics (water column structure) and the associated redistribution of nutrients and phytoplankton, the availability of light and subsequently the spatial (vertical) and temporal patterns of phytoplankton production in these three ERVL. Phytoplankton production (PP) is regarded as a good predictor of fish yield in lakes and seasonal measurements of PP is a prerequisite for good such estimates...|$|E
40|$|We {{carried out}} monthly photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) {{experiments}} with the 14 <b>C-method</b> for 12 years (2003 – 2014) {{to determine the}} photosynthetic parameters and primary production of surface phytoplankton in the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory, a coastal sampling station in the NW Mediterranean Sea. Our goal was to obtain seasonal trends and to establish the basis for detecting future changes of primary production in this oligotrophic area. The maximal photosynthetic rate PBmax ranged 30 -fold (0. 5 - 15 mg C mg Chl a– 1 h– 1), averaged 3. 7 mg C mg Chl a– 1 h– 1 (± 0. 25 SE) and was highest in August and lowest in April and December. We only observed photoinhibition twice. The initial or light-limited slope of the P-E relationship, αB, was low, averaging 0. 007 mg C mg Chl a– 1 h– 1 (μmol photons m– 2 s– 1) – 1 (± 0. 001 SE, range 0. 001 - 0. 045) and showed the lowest values in spring (April-June). The light saturation parameter or saturation irradiance, EK, averaged 711 μmol photons m– 2 s– 1 (± 58. 4 SE) and tended to be higher in spring and lower in winter. Phytoplankton assemblages were typically dominated by picoeukaryotes in early winter, diatoms in late autumn and late winter, dinoflagellates in spring and cyanobacteria in summer. Total particulate primary production averaged 1. 45 mg C m- 3 h– 1 (± 0. 13 SE) with highest values in winter (up to 8. 50 mg C m- 3 h– 1) and lowest values in summer (summer average, 0. 30 mg C m- 3 h– 1), while chlorophyll-specific primary production averaged 2. 49 mg C mg Chl a– 1 h– 1 (± 0. 19, SE) and peaked in summer (up to 12. 0 mg C mg Chl a– 1 h– 1 in August). 14 C-determined phytoplankton growth rates varied between ca. 0. 3 d– 1 in winter and 0. 5 d– 1 in summer and were within 60 - 80 % of the maximal rates of growth, based on PBmax. Chlorophyll a was a good predictor of primary production only {{in the winter and}} autumn. Seasonality appeared to explain most of the variability in the studied variables, while phytoplankton composition played a minor role. Daily integrated primary production was fairly constant throughout the year: similar to previous oxygen-based estimates in winter but considerably lower than these in summer. The difference between 14 C- and oxygen-based estimates of primary production could be explained by community respiration. Annually integrated primary production amounted to a rather modest 48 g C m– 2 yr– 1 (equivalent to 130 mg C m– 2 d– 1). Although no interannual patterns were detected, our work soundly establishes the seasonal trends for the coastal NW Mediterranean, therefore setting the basis for future detection of change...|$|E
