40|$|Traditionally, real GNP or {{permanent}} income or wealth {{have been the}} scale variable of choice in empirical money demand equations. Recently, Mankiw and Summers (1986) argue that <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures</b> are an ideal proxy f{{or permanent}} income in money demand, and they provide evidence that total consumption expenditures or consumption expenditures on non-durables and services are better scale variables in money demand than current GNP. This result is odd because <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures</b> reflect only the desires of the households, and {{a significant proportion of}} money balances is held by firms. This paper shows the difficulties in using <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures</b> as a proxy for permanent income, shows that, properly estimated and compared, <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures</b> are no better as a scale variable than real GNP and provides evidence that permanent income is a better scale variable than either <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures</b> or GNP.

40|$|Article {{deals with}} <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures</b> development. Concretely with a {{potential}} which mar- keting research disposes with within these questions. a brief literature overview shows <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures</b> {{as a result of}} product and service seeking, from that consumers expect satisfying of their needs. On the basis of introduced determination authors realized a marketing research which main aim was to enable more detailed insight into this economic category. The data was divi- ded according to the data of the European Bureau of Statistics, the percentage compound of con- sumption expenditures. For better comparison possibilities, the structure of individual market sub- ject consumption expenditures was added. The structure was averaged to original 15 European Union member countries, which are considered as the most developed regions. Before analysing the results of this marketing study the structure of <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures</b> development of Czech households is briefly outlined. Its scheme shows a gradual convergence to EU 15 countries. Rea- lized facts in combination with a marketing insight into <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures</b> realization served as a starting-point for an analysis of factors forming a consumer’s buying decision. Summary of results enabling both relative and absolute comparison through surveyed consumption categories and influencing factors is presented {{at the end of the}} article.

The component questions of the aggregate Index of Consumer sentiment improve forecasts, not only of <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures</b> on durables but also on non-durables and services. Empirical studies have historically focused on whether consumer sentiment improves one-quarterahead forecasts of <b>consumer</b> <b>expenditures.</b> In fact, we document that measures of consumer sentiment are especially predictive at the longer, four-quarter-ahead horizon. In addition, they typically contribute {{at least as much}} to one-quarter-ahead and four-quarter-ahead forecasts of consumption as do income and wealth variables. Out-ofsample forecasts for the 2000 - 2005 period further substantiate that measures of consumer sentiment can reduce consumption forecasting errors appreciably.

50|$|These {{data from}} the <b>Consumer</b> <b>Expenditure</b> Survey are used {{in a number of}} {{different}} ways by a variety of users. One important use of the survey is for the periodic revision of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Bureau uses survey results to select new market baskets of goods and services for the CPI every two years, to determine the relative importance of CPI components, and to derive new cost weights for the market baskets. Working with the U.S. Census Bureau, <b>Consumer</b> <b>Expenditure</b> Survey data are used to calculate thresholds for the Supplemental Poverty Measure. The US Department of Agriculture uses <b>Consumer</b> <b>Expenditure</b> information in estimating the cost of raising children. Market researchers find the data useful in analyzing the demand for groups of goods and services. The data allow them to track spending trends of different types of consumer units. Government and private agencies use the data to study the welfare of particular segments of the population, such as those consumer units with a reference person aged 65 and older or under age 25, or for low-income consumer units. Economic policymakers use the data to study the impact of policy changes on the welfare of different socioeconomic groups. Researchers use the data in a variety of studies, including those that focus on the spending behavior of different family types, trends in expenditures on various expenditure components including new types of goods and services, gift-giving behavior, consumption studies, and historical spending trends.|$|E
