25|$|Generally, {{there are}} four {{elements}} of criminal copyright infringement: {{the existence of a}} valid copyright, that copyright was infringed, the infringement was willful, and the infringement was either substantial, or for commercial gain (at levels often set by statute). Offering warez is generally understood to be a form of copyright infringement that is punishable as either a <b>civil</b> <b>wrong</b> or a crime.|$|E
25|$|Conversion, as {{a purely}} <b>civil</b> <b>wrong,</b> is {{distinguishable}} from both theft and unjust enrichment. Theft is obviously an act inconsistent with another's rights, and theft {{will also be}} conversion. But not all conversions are thefts because conversion requires no element of dishonesty. Conversion is also different from unjust enrichment. If one claims an unjust enrichment, {{the person who has}} another's property may always raise a change of position defense, to say they have unwittingly used up the assets they were transferred. For conversion, there always must be an element of voluntarily dealing with another's property, inconsistently with their rights.|$|E

2500|$|Plagiarism is also {{considered}} a moral offense against {{anyone who has}} provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is specifically supposed to be original content (for example, the plagiarist's publisher, employer, or teacher). In such cases, [...] acts of plagiarism may sometimes also form part of a claim for breach of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a <b>civil</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Macneil's theory {{posits that}} the {{traditional}} approach of doctrinal contract law in the common law countries, which he calls [...] "classical" [...] and [...] "neoclassical", which concentrates on [...] "the deal" [...] at its time of making, and treats individual contracts as discrete entities, is an inadequate and inaccurate tool {{for the study of}} contracts. He argues that all contracts are in fact not discrete at all but belong in the context of complex webs of exchange relations. This theory {{can be seen as a}} counter to both the [...] "death of contract" [...] idea, that contract as a separate idea was no longer relevant and that breach of contract is best regarded just as another tort (<b>civil</b> <b>wrong),</b> most closely associated with Grant Gilmore, and to Legal formalism in contract, in which the approach is to ignore, to a large extent, contextual matters surrounding the contract and concentrate only on the express terms and a strictly limited range of implied terms (though Robert E. Scott has argued that a formalist approach can still work within the context of an acceptance of a relational view of contract). Contract relations fall along a spectrum from the highly relational (e.g., long-term employment contracts) to the [...] "as if discrete", largely transactionalised relation (e.g., spot purchases of commodities). All relations, though, are connected with and belong within a broader social context, with which successful relations must be harmonised. It is possible to draw axes through many facets of contractual relations, indicating the likely features of such facets in relations falling at different points along the spectrum.|$|E
5000|$|The law of England {{recognised}} {{the concept}} of a [...] "wrong" [...] before it recognised the distinction between <b>civil</b> <b>wrongs</b> (governed by <b>civil</b> law) and crimes (defined by criminal law), which distinction was developed during the thirteenth century.|$|R
500|$|In Coleman's Appeal (1874), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania {{held that}} [...] "a man shall only be {{liable to be}} called on to answer for <b>civil</b> <b>wrongs</b> in the forum of his home, and the {{tribunal}} of his vicinage." ...|$|R
50|$|Thai {{lawyers have}} a very {{different}} role from their Western counterparts in dealing with <b>civil</b> <b>wrongs</b> and disputes. In Thailand, parties tend to avoid legal proceedings because of its confrontational nature. Instead, they rely on mutual understanding to reach a solution.|$|R
50|$|A <b>civil</b> <b>wrong</b> {{or wrong}} {{is a cause}} of action under {{the law of the}} {{governing}} body. Tort, breach of contract and breach of trust are types of <b>civil</b> <b>wrong.</b> Something that amounts to a <b>civil</b> <b>wrong</b> is said to be wrongful. A wrong involves the violation of a right because wrong and right are complementary terms. A statement that an act complained of is legally wrongful as regards the party complaining implicitly includes a statement that the act complained of prejudicially affects the party complaining in some legal right.|$|E

50|$|Public {{liability}} {{is part of}} the law of tort {{which focuses}} on <b>civil</b> <b>wrongs.</b> An applicant (the injured party) usually sues the respondent (the owner or occupier) under common law based on negligence and/or damages. Claims are usually successful when it can be shown that the owner/occupier was responsible for an injury, therefore they breached their duty of care.|$|R

50|$|A wrong (from Old English wrang - crooked) is an {{act that}} is illegal or immoral. Legal wrongs are usually quite clearly defined in the law of a state and/or jurisdiction.

Only exceptionally should the remedial constructive trust be invoked...|$|R

50|$|In Roman Catholic theology, detraction is {{the sin of}} {{revealing}} another person's faults to a third person without a valid reason.

50|$|Economic torts in English law {{refer to}} a species of <b>civil</b> <b>wrong</b> which protects the {{economic}} wealth that a person will gain in the ordinary course of business.

2500|$|Stalking is {{unwanted}} attention towards {{others by}} individuals (and sometimes groups of people). Stalking behaviours {{are related to}} harassment and intimidation. The word [...] "stalking" [...] is a term that has different meanings in different contexts in psychology and psychiatry; and some legal jurisdictions use it {{to refer to a}} certain type of criminal offence. It may also to refer to criminal offences or <b>civil</b> <b>wrongs</b> that include conduct which some people consider to be stalking, such as those described in law as [...] "harassment" [...] or similar terms.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary sources}} of {{obligations}} are contract and delict, {{the latter being}} wrongful and blameworthy conduct that harms a person. There is a close similarity between a breach of contract and a delict, in that both are <b>civil</b> <b>wrongs</b> and may {{give rise to a}} duty to pay damages as compensation. It is unsurprising, then, that certain conduct may constitute both a breach of contract and a delict (as when, in Van Wyk v Lewis, a surgeon negligently left a cotton swab inside a patient’s body), in which case there is concurrent liability, permitting the plaintiff to sue on either basis.|$|R
50|$|Double {{jeopardy}} {{also does}} not apply if the later charge is civil rather than criminal in nature, which involves a different legal standard (crimes must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas <b>civil</b> <b>wrongs</b> need only be proven by preponderance of evidence or in some matters, clear and convincing evidence). Acquittal {{in a criminal case}} does not prevent the defendant from being the defendant in a civil suit relating to the same incident (though res judicata operates within the civil court system). For example, O. J. Simpson was acquitted of a double homicide in a California criminal prosecution, but lost a civil wrongful death claim brought over the same victims.|$|R
5000|$|The term is {{also used}} in some jurisdictions {{as a means to}} {{determine}} whether a jury award is out of line with the underlying civil wrong; a jury award can be overturned on appeal if, by its amount relative to the underlying <b>civil</b> <b>wrong,</b> it [...] "shocks the conscience".|$|E
5000|$|In a civil lawsuit, a {{defendant}} (or a respondent) {{is also the}} accused party, although not of an offense, but of a <b>civil</b> <b>wrong</b> (a tort or a breach of contract, for instance).

50|$|Historically that {{concluding}} phrase, now legally superfluous, {{represents the}} last {{trace of the}} process by which the royal courts assume jurisdiction over all offences, and gradually eroded the jurisdiction of the sheriff and of lords of manor and franchises, making crime a matter of national concern as distinguished from <b>civil</b> <b>wrongs</b> or infractions of the rights of local magnates. The Peace of the King was sworn on his accession or full recognition, and the jurisdiction of his courts to punish all violations of that peace was gradually asserted. The completion of this process is marked by the institution of the office of Justice of the Peace.|$|R

40|$|Unlike {{many other}} core areas {{of law that}} {{students}} are required to study in their degree, the law of torts consists of a number of distinct <b>civil</b> <b>wrongs.</b> It {{is for this reason that}} defining exactly what amounts to a tort has proved difficult. Many commentators prefer to define torts in the negative, by comparing and distinguishing torts from other actions with similar features, such as contract law and criminal law. Others prefer to define torts by considering the types of interests the law of torts seeks to protect. In general terms, torts law provides a right to compensation where one person wrongfully breaches a duty or obligation that has been imposed by the law (rather than the parties themselves) for the protection of another...|$|R
