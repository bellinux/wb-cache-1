Setright of Car magazine asked who <b>could</b> <b>want</b> one given the crowded market into which it came. Concluding a group test in Car, the Tagora {{was described as a}} [...] "problematic newcomer" [...] that did not exceed the standard set by the winner of the group test, the Volvo 244 GLE.

[...] " [...] The New Yorker Janet Malcolm remarked that unlike some of her forerunners in film and literature, [...] "Blair already has all the money and position anyone <b>could</b> <b>want.</b> She is pure naked striving, restlessly seeking an object, any object, and never knowing when enough is enough." ...|$|E

He furthered his claim as the potential number one pick when he recorded the second fastest time by a non-Indigenous player in the twenty metre sprint with 2.82 seconds at the AFL draft camp, in addition to placing second in the agility test, fifth in the standing vertical jump and seventh in the repeated sprints. His rise during the year saw The Age journalist, Emma Quayle, describe him as the [...] "most complete prospect in [...] draft, {{he has all the}} athletic qualities you <b>could</b> <b>want</b> in a key forward—he's quick, agile, he's a good kick and he can mark".

500|$|O'Hara next {{played an}} {{unconventional}} {{role as a}} timid socialite who joins the army as a cook in Henry Hathaway's Ten Gentlemen from West Point (1942), which tells the fictional story of the first class of the United States Military Academy in the early 19th century. The film was disagreeable to O'Hara because Payne dropped out {{and was replaced by}} George Montgomery, whom she found [...] "positively loathsome". Montgomery attempted to make a pass at her during the production, prolonging his kiss with her after the director had yelled [...] "cut". Later that year, O'Hara starred opposite Tyrone Power, Laird Cregar and Anthony Quinn in Henry King's swashbuckler The Black Swan. O'Hara recalled that it was [...] "everything you <b>could</b> <b>want</b> in a lavish pirate picture: a magnificent ship with thundering cannons; a dashing hero battling menacing villains... sword fights; fabulous costumes...". She found it exhilarating working with Power, who was renowned for his [...] "wicked sense of humor". O'Hara grew very concerned about one scene in the picture in which she is thrown overboard in her underwear by Power, and sent a warning letter home to Ireland in advance. She refused to take her wedding ring off in one scene which resulted in screen adjustments {{to make it look like}} a dinner ring. Though the film was praised by critics and is seen as one of the period's most enjoyable adventure films, the critic from The New York Times thought O'Hara's character lacked depth, commenting that [...] "Maureen O'Hara is brunette and beautiful—which is all the part requires".|$|E
500|$|Writing for GamePro, Captain Squideo called Destruction Derby [...] "the most raucous racing {{experience}} of the fall". He believed that its [...] "graphics are almost all you <b>could</b> <b>want</b> for a game" [...] of this type, but wrote that [...] "nothing here stands out as graphically spectacular". He complained that the game does not let players customise cars, and he disliked its lack of split-screen multiplayer. He summarised, [...] "Limited options keep Destruction Derby out of the winner's circuit, but this rowdy stock-car racer still generates a stadium full of thrashin' fun." [...] Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground stated that [...] "the beauty of the game" [...] is the strategy involved in making [...] "calculated strikes" [...] against enemy vehicles, and he wrote, [...] "If you go all {{out and try to}} make big noise on the track, more than likely you'll be limping to the scrap yard in seconds." [...] He believed that the game's Stock Car racing mode [...] "is no match for the white knuckle inertia of either Wipeout or Ridge Racer", and that the demolition derbies in The Bowl were [...] "most fun to be had" [...] in the game. He praised the game's graphics and physics, and concluded, [...] "Destruction Derby is a winner in every capacity." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation was extremely pleased with the concept of smashing into other cars, saying it taps into a near-universal fantasy. He remarked the single-player mode is indefinably [...] "lacking" [...] but the multiplayer offers unqualified enjoyment.|$|E
500|$|The Legendary Axe {{received}} positive coverage {{upon its}} release. It was previewed by various video gaming magazines before its release. A preview from Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game [...] "a definite 10" [...] and [...] "one {{of the best}} video games we've ever played". In {{an overview of the}} PC Engine, VideoGames & Computer Entertainment referred to the game as [...] "characteristic of the PC Engine's advanced sound, graphics and game play". A later preview from the same magazine said {{that it was one of}} the console's better games, and they applauded the arcade-like graphics and gameplay. They said that everyone who owned the console should own the game and that it was an [...] "excellent showcase of the game system's capabilities". It was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly in September1989. In the review, Steve Harris said it was one of his favorite games, praising its theme, graphics, sound, and execution; he added that its features were unsurpassed by any video game at the time. Ed Semrad used this game to criticize Rastan, saying The Legendary Axe [...] "is how [...] should have been done". He added that it should be the first game TurboGrafx-16 owners should buy. Donn Nauert called the game one of the best adventure games seen at the time and echoed Harris' praises. Jim Allee repeated Semrad's observation that the game is Rastan but with better graphics; he praised its detailed sprites, the diverse music and gameplay, and difficulty level and concluded that it [...] "is everything you <b>could</b> <b>want</b> in a game". Later in that issue Nauert presented a partial walkthrough of the game, where he further praised the game for breathing new life into the platformer genre. An abridged walkthough was published in VideoGames & Computer Entertainment in November1989.|$|E

500|$|Skyfall {{received}} [...] "generally positive {{reviews from}} critics and fans", {{according to the}} GlobalPost. Rotten Tomatoes sampled 349 reviewers and judged 93% of the reviews to be positive, while the film scored 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 49 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". A number of critics, including Kate Muir, reviewing for The Times, Philip French, writing in The Observer, IGN's Daniel Krupa and the reviewers for the Irish Independent and the Daily Record, all asked whether Skyfall was the best Bond film produced. The Daily Telegraphs film reviewer, Robbie Collin, considered Skyfall to be [...] "often dazzling, always audacious", with excellent action sequences in a film that contained humour and emotion. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter thought that Skyfall was [...] "dramatically gripping while still brandishing a droll undercurrent of humor", going {{on to say that}} it was a film that had [...] "some weight and complexity to it". Variety Peter DeBruge suggested that the film's greatest strength lay in its willingness to put as much focus on characterisation as it did action set-pieces, allowing the two to co-exist rather than compete for the audience's attention, while Manohla Dargis, reviewing for The New York Times, considered Skyfall to be [...] "a superior follow-up to Casino Royale" [...] which is [...] "opulent rather than outlandish and insistently, progressively low-key". Kim Newman, reviewing the film for Empire, concluded, [...] "Skyfall is pretty much all you <b>could</b> <b>want</b> from a 21st Century Bond: cool but not camp, respectful of tradition but up to the moment, serious in its thrills and relatively complex in its characters but with the sense of fun that hasn't always been evident lately". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, describing it as [...] "a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon". Reviewing for the New Statesman, Ryan Gilbey saw that [...] "nostalgia permeates the movie", going on to say that [...] "sometimes the old ways are the best".|$|E

[...] Many critics were particularly complimentary of [...] "Illumination Theory", which Revolver described as [...] "stunningly ambitious". Grantland's Steven Hyden, whose introduction to the band was through the self-titled album, wrote, [...] "I drank this cocktail, and I’m glad. Dream Theater is a blast."

2500|$|Both {{halves of}} the fifth season {{received}} overwhelming critical acclaim. Following {{the end of the}} series, critic Nick Harley summarized his commendation of the show: [...] "Expertly written, virtuosic with its direction, and flawlessly performed, Breaking Bad is everything you <b>could</b> <b>want</b> in a drama. Critics will spend the next decade dissecting and arguing about what made it great, but the reasons are endless and already well documented." [...] During the final season, the show also received praise from George R. R. Martin, author of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, particularly the episode [...] "Ozymandias"; Martin commented that [...] "Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros." [...] In his review of the second half of season 5, Seth Amitin of IGN stated, [...] "This final batch of Breaking Bad {{is one of the best}} run of episodes TV has ever offered," [...] and praised [...] "Ozymandias" [...] in particular, referring to it as [...] "maybe the best episode of TV [...] ever seen." [...] Jonah Goldberg of National Review called it [...] "the best show currently on television, and perhaps even the best ever." [...] The veteran actor Sir Anthony Hopkins wrote a letter of praise to Bryan Cranston, telling him that his [...] "performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen– ever." [...] He lauded the rest of the cast and crew as well. The letter first appeared on Steven Michael Quezada's (who portrayed DEA Agent Steven Gomez) Facebook page, and in spite of it being taken down, the letter soon went viral. In 2013, Guinness World Records named Breaking Bad the highest-rated TV series of all time, citing its season 5 Metacritic score of 99 out of 100.|$|E
2500|$|Radiosurgery {{garnered}} positive reviews {{upon its}} release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream music critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 9 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] Critics' praise was often {{centered on the}} album's nostalgic sound and its catchy hooks, while Bethany Cosentino's guest appearance on track [...] "Caught in the Act" [...] was also widely applauded. Indeed, Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press called Radiosurgery [...] "focused and precise" [...] while awarding four stars out of five in her review. She noted that the album is rich on [...] "summary riffs and brisk tempos", before summarising, [...] "by refusing to settle for [...] "good enough" [...] – and by creating a homage to youthful, timeless pop punk – New Found Glory sound revitalised and relevant." [...] AbsolutePunk staff writer Thomas Nassiff described the album as containing [...] "beautiful pop-punk jammers" [...] while awarding a score of 8 out of 10. Though {{pointing out that the}} album offers nothing new to the band's catalog, he reflected [...] "New Found Glory has too many good records to call this one their best, but that doesn't really matter in the end. Comparing Radiosurgery to Sticks and Stones, New Found Glory or even Catalyst or Not Without a Fight is simply irrelevant. It's better to concentrate on what's in front of us: a hard-hitting, purely enjoyable album from South Florida's proudest sons." [...] David McLaughlin of Kerrang! magazine expressed that [...] "Radiosurgery is pretty much everything anyone <b>could</b> <b>want</b> from a New Found Glory record." [...] Awarding an [...] "excellent" [...] four K! rating, he noted the album's [...] "nostalgic 90s sound" [...] by adding, [...] "Age-old tales about lovestruck boys and girls told in three minutes via three chords, killer choruses and golden melodies. The Ramones knew {{a thing or two about}} that. So do New Found Glory. These tried and tested musical staples still make for some really special moments." [...] Tom Williams of Big Cheese magazine awarded the album five stars out of five in his review. He praised the band's [...] "mashup of bleeding heart lyrics, catchy melodies and punk rock energy" [...] before asserting, [...] "Infectious as always, professionally delivered and with a sound purpose built for partying, the album is a hit plain and simple." [...] Gregory Heaney of Allmusic awarded the album a favorable three and a half stars out of five in his review. He noted how [...] "pop-punk is becoming a lost art, a rarefied ability to sugarcoat heartache rather than embellish it, and that's exactly what New Found Glory do on this album. Without falling back on breakdowns, half-time choruses, or screaming, the band delivers 11 tracks of upbeat rock ruminations on unrequited love and heartbreak." ...|$|E
