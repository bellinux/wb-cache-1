An editor for iTunes claimed the song's lyrics to be sultry. She stated that of the 16 tracks, [...] "Cuando" [...] means the most to her because it is an Rbolero track which would remind men to value women.|$|E

About Salmaan's performance, The Hindus critic Baradwaj Rangan wrote: [...] "Dulquer Salmaan checks off all boxes in the <b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Be</b> The Next Madhavan? questionnaire", though he believed the film belonged primarily to Menen.

He also received a third Best Actor nomination at Filmfare.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{the bands}} {{presented}} themselves as {{no different from}} minor local bands. Jack Endino said in the 1996 documentary Hype! that Seattle bands were inconsistent live performers, since their primary objective {{was not to be}} entertainers, but simply to [...] "rock out". Grunge bands gave enthusiastic performances; they would thrash their long hair during shows as [...] "a symbolic weapon" [...] for releasing [...] "pent-up aggression" [...] (Dave Grohl was particularly noted for his [...] "head flips"). One of the philosophies of the grunge scene was authenticity. Dave Rimmer writes that with the revival of punk ideals of stripped-down music in the early 1990s, [...] "for Cobain, and lots of kids like him, rock & roll...threw down a dare: <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> pure enough, day after day, year after year, to prove your authenticity, {{to live up to the}} music ...

In 1986, Madonna told Company magazine, that although she did not write or create the song, the lyrical meaning and concept did apply to her situation at that point of time. She elaborated, [...] "I'm very career-oriented. You are attracted {{to people who are}} ambitious that way, too, like in the song 'Material Girl'. You are attracted to men who have material things because that's what pays the rents and buys you furs. That's the security. That lasts longer than emotions." [...] During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna was asked by interviewer Austin Scaggs, regarding her first feelings, after listening to the demos of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". Madonna responded by saying, [...] "I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I certainly wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> like a virgin? I liked the play on words, I thought they were clever.

500|$|The idea of {{a reality}} series {{originated}} when Doherty and Iswarienko were interested in documenting {{the weeks leading up}} to their wedding in a filming and production style similar to [...] and Deadliest Catch. Doherty had previously worked on reality television when she hosted Scare Tactics and Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty and participated on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. She called the project her agreement with Iswarienko to [...] "chronicle this time in our lives and let future brides and future grooms know that [...] not just you and that goes through the stress". According to Doherty, it was a way to celebrate her third marriage: [...] "Can you bring all of those qualities to reality TV? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> that brutally honest, that completely raw, but with the quality of those two shows where you do use different cameras and you do want it to look spectacular?" [...] Doherty planned to develop the idea with her own production company, originally partnering with an unidentified television network. However, the series was picked up by WE tv when Doherty thought that the previous network was making the material too sensational. Miller said that he approved the series after seeing its pitch, and he found Doherty an appealing person to watch on reality television.|$|E
500|$|Wordplay is a {{key element}} in Wodehouse's writing. This can take the form of puns, such as in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, when Bertie is {{released}} after a night in the police cells, and says that he has [...] "a pinched look" [...] about him. Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism, such as in Uncle Dynamite when Constable Potter says he has been [...] "assaulted by the duck pond." [...] In reply, Sir Aylmer, confusing the two meanings of the word [...] "by", asks: [...] "How the devil <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> assaulted by a duck pond?" [...] Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour. Some come through exaggeration, such as Bingo Little's infant child who [...] "not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail", or Wooster's complaint that [...] "the rumpuses that Bobbie Wickham is already starting may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup." [...] Bertie Wooster's half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit Bertie asks Jeeves [...] "Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and... what's the word? Something about cats." [...] Jeeves replies, [...] "Cataclysms, sir?" ...|$|E
