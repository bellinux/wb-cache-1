40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} eleven <b>commercial</b> models of <b>propane</b> combustion traps for catching male and female Phlebotomus papatasi. The traps differed in physical appearance, amount of carbon dioxide produced and released, type and location of capturing device, and the method by which the trap suction fans were powered. The traps tested were the Mosquito Magnet™(MM) -Pro, MM-Liberty, MM-Liberty Plus, MM-Defender, SkeeterVac®(SV) - 35, SV- 27, Mosquito Deleto™(MD) - 2200, MD- 2500, MT 150 -Power Trap, and two models of The Guardian Mosquito Traps (MK- 01 and MK- 12). All trap models except the SV- 35, the SV- 27, the MD- 2500, and the MK- 12 attracted significantly more females than males. The SV- 35 was the most efficient trap, catching significantly more females {{than all the other}} models. The MD- 2200 and MK- 12 models were the least effective in catching either female or male sand flies. These data indicate that several models of propane combustion traps might be suitable substitutes for either CO 2 -baited or unbaited light traps for adult sand fly surveillance tools. One advantageous feature is the traps’ ability to remain operational 24 / 7 for ca. 20 days on a single tank of propane. Additionally, the models that produce their own electricity to power the trap’s fans have an important logistical advantage in field operations over light traps, which require daily battery exchange and charging...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{tests have}} been made of a small burner to meet the {{requirements}} for application to supersonic ram jets. The principal requirements were taken as: (1) efficient combustion in a high-velocity air stream, (2) utilization for combustion of {{only a small fraction of}} the air passing through the unit, (3) low resistance to air flow, (4) simple construction, and (5) light weight. Tests of a small burner were carried to stream velocities of nearly 150 feet per second and fuel rates such that one-eighth to one-fourth of the total air was involved in combustion. <b>Commercial</b> <b>propane</b> was selected as the fuel since its low boiling point facilitated vaporization. Combustion which was 80 percent complete along with low aerodynamic losses was obtained by injecting the fuel evenly, prior to ignition, and allowing it to mix with the air without appreciably disturbing the stream.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{in the research}} described in this thesis was to design and test the use of lean premixed combustion using combustion gas recirculation for gas fuelled Stirling engine combustors. A system using a flame-arrester type of flame-holder to stabilize the flame and an ejector system for the recirculation of combustion gas was designed and tested in the laboratory. The impact of changes in different parameters of the ejector system was examined. Different combinations of recirculation rate and air/fuel ratio were examined regarding their impact on emissions and flame stability. The laboratory combustion system was then adapted to <b>commercial</b> combustors. A <b>propane</b> combustion system for a hybrid sodium heat pipe solar receiver for the SOLO 161 Stirling engine was designed, built and field-tested with good results. Later a natural gas combustor for a SOLO 161 {{combined heat and power}} Stirling engine unit was designed, built and field-tested with good results. The combustor has currently run about 2500 hours in field test. At lambda 1. 4 the NOX emissions are about 15 ppm, with no emissions of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC). Tests have been made with a catalytically coated solar receiver for the V 160 Stirling engine with the objective to use catalytic combustion on the heater surface to supply heat to the Stirling cycle. The results were promising and it was possible to heat the receiver to operating temperature and run the engine for shorter times. However, further research is needed before this type of heater can be used...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} {{nutritional}} quality of barley, maize, oats and wheat after flame roasting at 3 temperatures for each cereal (between 74 and 193 degrees C) in a <b>commercial</b> <b>propane</b> heated roaster at 67, 100 and 133 % of the manufacturer&# 39;s suggested temperatures was studied. A sample of unroasted material was included for each grain. Evaluation as non-ruminant feeds was done using a rooster bioassay. For ruminants, DM and crude protein degradation in the rumen and intestinal digestibility were estimated. Roasting {{had little effect}} on any non-ruminant estimate of utilization but it decreased (P< 0. 05) effective rumen degradation and rumen degradation rates of DM and crude protein for all grains, although the effect was least for maize. Total tract digestibility in ruminants was not affected by roasting, except for oats and wheat, which was reduced at the highest level of roasting. For ruminant diets, heat treatment by roasting of wheat and barley may be beneficial, resulting in a slower release of nutrients in the rumen and allowing more DM and crude protein to escape degradation in the rumen and be digested in the small intestine. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is {{proposed for the}} evolution of temperature, chemical composition, and energy release in bubbles, clouds, and emulsion phase during combustion of gaseous premixtures of air and propane in a bubbling fluidized bed. The analysis begins as the bubbles are formed at the orifices of the distributor, until they explode inside the bed or emerge at the free surface of the bed. The model also considers the freeboard region of the fluidized bed until the propane is thoroughly burned. It is essentially built upon the quasi-global mechanism of Hautman et al. (1981) and the mass and heat transfer equations from the two-phase model of Davidson and Harrison (1963). The focus is not on a new modeling approach, but on combining the classical models of the kinetics and other diffusional aspects to obtain a better insight into the events occurring inside a fluidized bed reactor. Experimental data are obtained to validate the model by testing the combustion of <b>commercial</b> <b>propane,</b> in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed, using four sand particle sizes: 400 – 500, 315 – 400, 250 – 315, and 200 – 250 µm.

40|$|Ozone {{depletion}} {{and global}} warming require replacement of chlorouo-rocarbon refrigerants like R 12. The hydrouorocarbonR 134 a is nonammable, difcult to synthesize, has zero ozone depletion and high global warming. LPG refrigerants are highly ammable, occur naturally, have zero ozone de-pletion and negligible global warming. In Germany, most new refrigerators use R 600 a and many heat pumps and air conditioners now use R 290 with measured energy consumption 10 to 20 % lower than R 12, R 134 a or R 22. LPG mixtures have successfully replaced R 12 and R 134 a in over 100, 000 US car air-conditioners. Abboud (1994) measured the air-conditioner performance of ve popu-lar Australian cars with R 12 and then LPG mixtures in our laboratory. He recommended 60 % by mass <b>commercial</b> <b>propane</b> from Bass Strait and 40 % commercial butane. This gave typically 10 % more cooling than R 12 with satisfactory superheat and typically 8 % higher condenser pressure. Refrigerant property parameters show that R 600 a has half the leakage, pressure loss and condenser pressure and double the heat transfer properties of R 12 and R 134 a. This explains the energy consumption savings of R 600 a refrigerators. Redesign of heat pumps and car air-conditioners for R 600 a could yield greater benets. The insurance risk increment from LPG ammability for domestic re-frigerators is zero. The increment for car air-conditioners is negative {{because of the high}} cost of R 12 and R 134 a repairs. For large systems, ventilation of plantrooms and other LPG safety precautions can make insurance risk incre-ment zero or negative if required...|$|E
40|$|Hydrocarbon {{refrigerants}} are {{environmentally friendly}} and many countries have started using them in refrigeration and air-conditioner systems. Propane, a typical hydrocarbon, does not damage {{the ozone layer}} {{and its effect on}} global warming is very small. Use of propane as a refrigerant is gaining favour, especially in systems designed for R- 22. The main drawback of using propane as a refrigerant is its flammability. To reduce the risk posed by propane, the total mass of propane in the system should be minimized without degrading the system performance. This work deals with how the mass of propane within a capillary tube can be reduced without compromising the system performance. In the first step, the mass flow rate and inlet and outlet conditions of the refrigerant within the capillary tube of a <b>commercial</b> <b>propane</b> air-conditioner under normal working conditions were measured. In the next step, a parametric MATLAB code was developed to determine the required length and volume of the capillary tube, and the velocity and mass of the propane within the capillary tube. The input parameters of the code are the inside diameter, roughness, shape, mass flow rate, and inlet and outlet conditions. The script was run for sixteen common types of capillary tubes, including the one in our laboratory. According to the results, it is possible to considerably reduce the propane mass within the capillary tube using a small inside diameter helical capillary tube with a decreased coil diameter. However, the results should not be extended to an air-conditioner in which the distance between the outlet of the condenser and the inlet of evaporator is fixed and longer than the calculated length. ...|$|E
40|$|This master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis {{outlines}} the project investigating {{the effects of}} oxygenated fuel additives on flame propagation and engine performance. In the first of this two-part investigation, flame speeds, in a straight duct with a curved end section, were examined. The 172 cm straight section {{was followed by a}} 90 ° bend section and a 30 cm straight section. With propane as the fuel and emission zero air as the oxidizer, flame speeds, using equivalence ratios of 0. 8, 1. 0, and 1. 1, were explored. In addition, a <b>commercial</b> <b>propane</b> fuel additive blend was introduced and its flame speed compared to instrument grade propane. The flame propagated through the duct in a fluctuating manner. The first flame inversions are predictable and repeatable. Subsequent flame inversions and pressure fluctuations corresponded to the natural frequencies of the duct. The overall flame speed showed an increase from lean to slightly rich mixtures for the equivalence ratios tested. The fuel blend did not significantly affect the characteristics of the flame propagation in the duct. In {{the second part of the}} investigation, propane, mixed with a fuel additive, and air was introduced to a multi-cylinder engine. Because the fuel blend did not significantly affect the flame propagation characteristics in the duct, the additives were not expected to have an affect on the engine performance. Torque and power curves were successfully obtained, in addition to in-cylinder pressure measurements, to investigate a change in engine performance with fuel additives. Emission testing was preformed to determine the exhaust gas characteristics of propane with this fuel additive. The fuel additives were found not to significantly affect engine performance.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{full scale}} characterization of a turbulent propane jet flame {{has been made}} in terms of temperatures and radiation. Sonic propane gas releases were achieved at steady pressure and near steady flow. <b>Commercial</b> <b>propane</b> was used, consisting of a mixture of propane with very small admixtures of sulphur and methanol. The size of the fire was 13 - 14 MW (average burning rate 0, 3 kg/s). The pressure drop across the horizontally mounted nozzle was 10. 3 barg. The experimental setup was simulated using the CFD-code Kameleon FireEx, and characterizations were made for temperature, radiation and gas velocity. The results from experiments and simulations were compared using interpolation techniques for reducing the errors of measurements, and MatLab for visualization. Both transient and time-averaged values were plotted. The main findings in this work were: • the length of the visible flame was ≈ 5. 5 m, with a lift-off distance of 0. 6 m • the highest temperature region of the jet flame was ≈ 70 % along the visible flame length (i. e not including lift-off). The maximum temperature in the flame was in the region 1200 − 13000 C • up to ≈ 3 m, there was a fuel rich region along the centre trajectory of the flame, where the temperature was ≈ 2000 C less than in the stoichiometric region, 0. 3 m away from the centre line • the radiation fraction along the jet trajectory at positions 25 %, 50 %, 70 %, and 95 % downstream of the visible flame length was 28 %, 57 %, 73 %, and 63 %, respectively • moving outside the flame perpendicular to the jet axis, the radiation fraction gradually increased. At 3 m distance from the centerline, it was equal to the total heat flux. This indicated that the convection fraction was close to zero • the radiation heat flux sensors were extremely sensitive to unclean environment. Even when applying nitrogen for purging, it did not keep the soot and other particles away from the inner surface of the gauge’s restrictor • the CFD-code KFX predicted a correct flame length, but estimated a slightly shorter lift-off distance • the end part of the KFX-flame was more influenced by buoyancy and deviated some from that of the experiment • the measurements showed more irregular shaped temperature fields compared to the simulated • the measurements showed larger fluctuations in the temperature fields compared to the simulated • the maximum measured radiative heat flux inside the flame was 185 kW/m 2. The maximum simulated radiative heat flux was 193 kW/m 2, representing a deviation of 4. 3 % • the maximum measured total heat flux was 256 kW/m 2 A steel cylinder of radius 160 mm was placed at various positions in the jet, and the relative heat transfer was assessed by means of thermocouples placed radially inside the cylinder. This work showed that: • convection is the major contributor to the total heat transfer from a turbulent jet flame to a steel cylinder impinged by the flame • the largest rate of heat transfer is at the side facing the flame, i. e no high levels of turbulence induced thermal loading could be detected at the back • the heat transfer coefficient, h, {{is a function of the}} velocity of the gas flow relative to the impinged object The stability of ignited propane gas jets, discharged from circular cross section outlets of varying diameters and inclinations were examined. This resulted in: • a model, with an accuracy of 0. 89, that predicts the upper and lower blowout limits for propane in gas phase, as well as a critical outlet diameter of 14 mm • no observations were made indicating that the outlet inclination has any effect on the blowout limits The heat attenuation in water spray in a full scale offshore flare situation was examined by applying a known model for calculations and comparing with measurements. The result of this work was: • the model predictions slightly under estimated the capacity of the water curtain. There were, however, uncertainties regarding the water curtain properties, and more detailed measurements are necessary in order to present a verified model for engineering use • for the extreme situations of an underestimate of drop sizes, where the actual drop sizes are 50 % larger than estimated, or where the actual small drop fraction is doubled, calculation errors will be caused in the range - 7 % to + 18 %, in absolute terms • the calculation model is not capable of identifying irregularities within the water curtain. This will have importance relating to maximum allowable radiation limits where people are expose...|$|E
