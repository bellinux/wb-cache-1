Heilmann denied this and had a counter statement published. (According to taz charges were filed due to attempted coercion ("versuchte Nötigung"). Heilmann's counter statement fits to this explanation as he states that the <b>committee</b> on <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> the Bundestag has dealt on October 17 with the matter in question related to short messages he sent to his former room mate.) This matter was reported in Heilmann's Wikipedia article. This claim, as well as claims that he had withheld parts of his Stasi records, were also cited by Heilmann as reasons for his action against Wikimedia Deutschland.|$|R

Members of Parliament are also forbidden from criticising the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and judges.

40|$|Despite high vaccine coverage, {{pertussis}} has re-emerged as {{a public}} health concern in many countries. One hypothesis posed for re-emergence is the waning <b>of</b> <b>immunity.</b> In some disease systems, the process <b>of</b> waning <b>immunity</b> can be non-linear, involving a complex relationship between the duration <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> and subsequent boosting <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> through asymptomatic re-exposure. We present and analyse a model of infectious disease transmission to examine the interplay between infection and immunity. By allowing the duration <b>of</b> infection-acquired <b>immunity</b> to differ from that <b>of</b> vaccine-acquired <b>immunity,</b> we explore the impact of the difference in durations on long-term disease patterns and prevalence of infection. Our model demonstrates that vaccination may induce cyclic behaviour, and its ability to reduce the infection prevalence increases with both the duration <b>of</b> infection-acquired <b>immunity</b> and duration <b>of</b> vaccine-acquired <b>immunity.</b> We find that increasing vaccine coverage, while capable of leading to an increase in overall transmission, always results in a reduction in prevalence of primary infections, with epidemic cycles characterised by a longer interepidemic period and taller peaks. Our results show that the epidemiological patterns of an infectious disease may change considerably when the duration <b>of</b> vaccine-acquired <b>immunity</b> differs from that <b>of</b> infection-acquired <b>immunity.</b> Our study highlights that for any particular disease and associated vaccine, a detailed understanding of the duration of protection and how that duration is influenced by infection prevalence is important as we seek to optimise vaccination strategies.
