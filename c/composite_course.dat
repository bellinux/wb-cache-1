50|$|The 2012 tournament {{was played}} at the <b>Composite</b> <b>Course</b> at Royal Melbourne, the {{championship}} course comprising 12 holes from the West course and six from the East course. The <b>Composite</b> <b>Course</b> {{is considered one of}} the top courses in the world, and was used for the Presidents Cup competitions in 1998 and 2011. Through 2011, a women's professional competition had never been held on it; the 2012 Women's Australian Open was the first. The event was won by Jessica Korda after an historic six-player playoff, only the second in ALPG history. Korda holed a 25 ft birdie putt on the second playoff hole to claim her first LPGA Tour victory.|$|E

The project investigated was an 8 -ply carbon fiber pre-preg lay-up that is typically accomplished in an aviation <b>composites</b> <b>course.</b> Twenty eight students, from a 58 student sample, were randomly assigned into a treatment group. The treatment group was given a six minute video covering the procedures on the written instructions. The remaining 30 students were assigned to the control group which was given written instructions currently being used in the <b>composites</b> <b>course.</b> A Mann-Whitney test was then used to analyze the results. The analysis of these results determined that there was no significant decrease on completion time using video instruction but there was a significant increase in project quality of the projects. ...|$|R

The <b>composite</b> <b>course</b> uses the original 18 holes at Blackwolf Run, which were split between the two courses when the second 18 holes were added. The championship course employs the back nine from the Meadow Valleys course and the first four and last five holes from the River course; in 1998 it was set at par 71 with a length of 6412 yd. The same layout {{was used for the}} 2012 U.S. Women's Open, but extended by over 500 yd and at par 72. The length for 2012 was 6954 yd at an approximate elevation of 650 ft above sea level.|$|E

5000|$|Flynn {{continued}} {{his involvement with}} Merion for 25 years, perfecting the course. He and Wilson had hoped to form a design partnership, but Wilson's failing health prevented it. Instead, Flynn partnered with Howard Toomey just after World War I with Flynn the designer and Toomey handling the engineering side of the work. They started their own golf architectural firm, Toomey & Flynn. William Gordon, Robert Lawrence and Dick Wilson all started out as assistants with the firm of Toomey and Flynn and all later became prominent designers in their own right. Flynn was particularly active around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, producing numerous highly rated courses which {{compete with each other}} for attention. Although his body of work is found around Philadelphia, his most recognizable work is outside the area at places like Cherry Hills Country Club in Denver, The Cascades in Virginia, The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, and Shinnecock Hills on Long Island. [...] In 1927, Flynn added the Primrose nine at The Country Club. Three holes from the Primrose are used on the course's <b>Composite</b> <b>Course</b> for the U.S. Open, but much of Flynn's renovation work at The Country Club goes unnoticed.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{composite}} materials {{are a very}} interesting research field. They show an extraordinary performance due to their high stiffness and low density. They are applied in high advance technology industries such as aerospace or defense. But their use {{is becoming more and}} more popular in energetic industries, particularly in wind and tidal energy their use is increasing because of the concern of the global warming problem. Wind and tidal companies have planed the construction of wind farms in offshore that means that the materials will be exposed to rough environmental conditions. Many studies have remarked the good mechanical performance of composites at low temperatures under static loads but still the behavior of the composites under dynamic conditions is unexplored. The aim of this report is to give a start point for the fatigue characterization of composites under low temperature conditions. To achieve this purpose a FEM has been developed and in parallel some tests have been developed to confirm the model predictions. While working with this project, many difficulties appeared and to solve them it was required to have a background in {{composite materials}} theory as well as basic knowledge of the numerical program used. For this reason a <b>composite</b> <b>course</b> was made and also many hours behind the computer to understand all the numerical convergence problems caused when running simulations. Basically the work focuses on the development of a model capable of predicting the stresses under static and dynamic loads. If the model is able to calculate stress fields and progressive material failure properly, it will be ready for predicting the performance of the material at low temperatures only making a few changes. At least in theory because as it can be seen while reading this report some inconvenients appear while simulating materials at low temperature that invalidate partially the results obtained and require new lines of investigation. That is the contact problem created by changing low temperatures that cannot be solved by the direct cyclic method. But the objective of the work has been achieved and recommendations for further work are established. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study investigates student attitudes in university-level ESL composition classes in both an in-class and an asynchronous on-line setting. Student and teacher interviews, classroom observations, and writing samples {{are used to}} examine group work, peer feedback, attitudes about writing in English, and freewrite activities in the two contexts. Results from this exploration suggest that each context offers unique advantages and disadvantages. An in-class section may offer teachers greater pedagogical flexibilities for group tasks, and it may provide more support for most learners to develop their L 2 language proficiencies {{by allowing them to}} work with sympathetic classmates who are undergoing a similar acculturation process. However, an on-line section may provide teachers greater monitoring abilities during group work, and it may provide a more nurturing environment for the most reticent learners to develop confidence in their L 2 abilities. On-line groups, however, face unique challenges because they are reliant on timely member participation in order to complete assignments. Additionally, in-class sections may enhance writing fluency whereas on-line sections may help students to develop more formal academic writing styles. The study concludes by suggesting that <b>composite</b> writing <b>courses</b> that use a combination of in-class and on-line settings may be the most beneficial scenario...|$|R

40|$|Some {{knowledge}} of composite materials or consent Course Objective: The {{objective of this}} course is to present advanced analysis techniques used to support the design of <b>composite</b> structures. The <b>course</b> covers those topics overlooked during preliminary design courses such as MAE 446. During preliminary design, the material is selected and the structure is roughly sized to carry the loads; many design aspects are delayed for the final design stage (for example, selection of the optimum stacking sequence that minimizes edge effects). Furthermore, many design allowables, such as notched strength, creep rate, and so on, can be determined by advanced modeling techniques of a few candidate materials. These values are then supplied as data for the preliminary design effort. On the other hand, refined computations of deflections, stress, strength, and buckling loads can only be done using finite element analysis.

To what extent should those programs adopt a more holistic curriculum that exposes students to a range of skills beyond research and writing? The Article will begin with a description of what is actually done in first year programs at American law schools. This information was gathered in a Spring 1995 survey of law school research and writing programs, to which representatives of 111 schools responded. It will then address why these definitional questions are so significant. Following that, the Article will provide an analytic sketch of two <b>composite</b> skills <b>courses,</b> beginning with a discussion of a 2 ̆ 2 traditional 2 ̆ 2 legal research and writing program and an evaluation of its strengths and drawbacks.

The article will then propose a compromise plan that attempts, realistically, to incorporate the strengths of both these approaches. Hopefully, this will provide guidance to law schools in reexamining the core identity of their first year skills programs. The Article concludes by positing that these two approaches are not mutually exclusive; it is possible and, indeed, preferable, for schools to design courses that give their students the best of both worlds...|$|R

It was previously shown [1] that this treatment has resulted in drastically increased interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the bulk composites, produced by hot pressing.

In this paper, DSC analysis is applied to further investigate peculiarities of carbon fiber/epoxy systems, exposed to ultrasonic treatment, during isothermal and non-isothermal curing and post-curing. The acceleration of the curing reaction as a consequence of sonication effects was found for all fiber/polymer systems, regardless the surface chemistry of the fibers. The stronger interfacial bond in epoxy sized carbon fiber composites, favored by ultrasound treatment, has also generated differences in thermal behavior of the composites during their degradation followed by TGA/DTG.

These projects allow the students to directly apply the course topics in “hands-on” applications, while also providing the students opportunities to develop group project skills. In the small field of naval architecture little has been written of these projects. This paper presents the details of five courses using this approach in the Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Department (NAOE) at the United States Naval Academy (USNA). The first course is the major’s introductory course for sophomores where after seven weeks each student submits the specification, calculations, lines plan and construction drawings for a towing tank model. These plans are then turned over to another student to build and test. The second course is a junior-level structures course focusing on ship structures. The students design a full midship section. The final three courses are at the senior-level and include an elective in marine fabrication methods and two capstone design courses. In the fabrication course small student groups design, build, perform QA/QC tests and proof-test a series of components in metal, reinforced concrete and <b>composites.</b> This <b>course</b> focuses {{on the benefits of}} design-for-manufacturability and instills this approach through the actual time it takes the students to design, build and document their group projects.

Ironically, founder Henry Ford was a pioneer in the sustainable business realm, experimenting with plant-based fuels during the days of the Model T. Ford Motor Company also shipped the Model A truck in crates that then became the vehicle floorboards at the factory destination. This was a form of upcycling, retaining high quality in a closed-loop industrial cycle.

40|$|A {{technique}} is described for recording {{large numbers of}} individual or single-fibre excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e. p. s. p. s) from single motoneurones by means of spike-triggered averaging. The cable properties of the motoneurones were calculated from the decay time course of a voltage transient in the motoneurone following a current pulse applied to the soma. From this response a theoretical shape index curve was calculated. Most individual or single-fibre e. p. s. p. s elicited by impulses in different Ia fibres had simple decay time courses and shape indices that fitted the theoretical shape index curve of the motoneurone from which they were recorded very well. This suggested that the active terminals of these afferent fibres were located within limited post-synaptic areas. In a few cases the original amplitude, latency and shape of individual e. p. s. p. s changed dramatically when they were re-averaged 40 min later after the membrane potential had decreased, but was still at an acceptable level. E. p. s. p. s with simple decay time courses changed to e. p. s. p. s with <b>composite</b> decay time <b>courses,</b> presumably due to activation of previously silent synapses. The results suggest that impulses conducted in a single afferent fibre from a muscle spindle do not necessarily activate all of the synapses which the fibre forms on a motoneurone, but may repeatedly fail to activate some endings during prolonged periods of spike-triggered averaging, while consistently activating others. Evidence regarding the site of transmission failure and the possible mechanism of its relief is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of graphen-nanotube composites addresses {{a few basic}} problems. First, both partners are good donors and acceptors of electrons, which significantly complicates the intermolecular interaction between them leading to a two-well shape of the ground state energy term. The second problem concerns odd-electron character of the components. Similarly to high aromatics and fullerenes, much larger C-C distances provide a considerable weakening of odd electrons interaction in nanotubes and graphene that necessitates taking the configurational interaction of odd electrons into account. Avoiding a severe complication, the broken spin-symmetry approach makes the problem feasible. Moreover, unrestricted broken-symmetry Hartree-Fock approach possesses a unique sensitivity in revealing enhanced chemical activity of the species caused by their partial radicalization in terms of atomic chemical susceptibility. The chemical susceptibility profiles along the tube and across their body as well as over graphene sheets form the ground of computational synthesis of graphen-nanotube <b>composites</b> in due <b>course</b> of the relevant addition reactions and {{make it possible to}} select two main groups of the composites, conditionally called hammer and cutting-blade structures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in emergency departments (EDs) {{and the development of}} emergency medicine in The Netherlands. In the last decade several policy reports have stated that the quality of emergency care should be improved and that emergency physicians (EPs) play a large role in the quality improvement. The Netherlands Society of Emergency Physicians (NVSHA) has developed an emergency medicine training program, which has been nationally recognized since 2009. Nevertheless, not all EDs are staffed with EPs yet. This study aimed to explore differences between Dutch EDs with EPs and those without EPs. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was performed on data over the year 2008 or 2009 in all 105 Dutch hospitals with an emergency department. We documented which ED-specific courses were attended by physicians working in the ED (list of 3 courses) and which clinical audit activities were implemented (list of 6 activities). The choice of courses and clinical audits was based on those mentioned in published quality reports and in national debates on emergency care. We compared EDs with and without EPs. The final analysis was based on a linear regression analysis, controlling for ED size and having an EP training program. We considered P < 0. 05 significant. RESULTS: Our survey's response rate was 67 %. EPs worked significantly more often in larger EDs. The linear regression analysis shows that the total number of courses attended by physicians was on average 0. 51 higher (P = 0. 000) in EDs with EPs than in EDs without EPs, and the total number of implemented clinical audits was on average 0. 49 higher (P = 0. 008). After controlling for potential confounders, the effect of both the <b>composite</b> number of <b>courses</b> attended (P = 0. 001) and the composite number of implemented clinical activities (P = 0. 032) remained significant. CONCLUSION: This study shows that EPs are significantly more present in larger EDs and in EDs where there is more continuing professional education and where there are more clinical audit activities. Our findings suggest that the presence of emergency physicians is positively associated with the quality of emergency care, but prospective research is required to examine causality...|$|R
40|$|Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) {{has been}} a leading rapid {{prototyping}} process {{but it has been}} mostly limited to use in making prototypes for design verification and functional testing applications. The commercial process can currently fabricate parts only in limited types of thermoplastics such as ABS and Polycarbonate. Very little efforts have been made to increase the range of FDM materials to include metals or metal based composites for wider application domain beyond just design and verification. This thesis presents new research in this direction by developing novel metal based composites for use in FDM technology. The principal objective of this research is to develop new metal/polymer composite materials for direct use in the current Fused Deposition Modelling rapid prototyping platform with long term aim of developing direct rapid tooling on the FDM system. Using such composites, the direct rapid tooling will allow fabrication of injection moulding dies and inserts with desired thermal and mechanical properties suitable for using directly in injection moulding machines for short term or long term production runs. The new metal/polymer composite material developed in this research work involves use of iron particles and copper particles in a polymer matrix of ABS material, which offers much improved thermal, electrical and mechanical properties enabling current Fused Deposition Modelling technique to produce rapid functional parts and tooling. Higher thermal conductivity of the new metal/polymer composite material coupled with implementation of conformal cooling channels enabled by layer-by layer fabrication technology of the Fused Deposition Modelling will result in tremendously improved injection cycles times, and thereby reducing the cost and lead time of injection moulding tooling. Due to highly metal-particulate filled matrix of the new composite material, injection tools and inserts made using this material on Fused Deposition Modelling, demonstrate a higher stiffness comparing to those made out of pure polymeric material resulting in withstanding higher injection moulding pressures. Moreover, metallic filler content of the new composite allows processing of functional parts with electrical conductivity and in case of using ferromagnetic fillers, namely as fine iron powders, it introduces magnetic properties, which will make FDM-built components suitable for electronic applications specifically whereby electro-magnetic shielding is of high interest. In this research project, a full characterization of the newly developed metal/polymer composites including rheological, thermal, mechanical and electrical properties has been investigated. Mathematical models have been employed in order to predict and optimize the viscous behaviour of metal/polymer <b>composite</b> during the <b>course</b> of deposition through the FDM nozzle. In order to predict the main flow parameters of the metal/polymer composites including pressure, temperature, and velocity fields through the FDM liquefier head, 2 -D and 3 -D numerical analysis of melt flow behaviour of acrylonitrile- butadiene-styrene (ABS) and Iron composite as a representative metal/polymer material has been carried out using ANSYS FLOTRAN and ANSYS CFX commercial codes. Results of numerical analysis have been verified by the developed empirical mathematical models. A variety of advanced techniques have been employed to fully characterize the newly developed metal/polymer composites in order to successfully process filaments for fabrication of injection mould tooling inserts. Morphological effects of metallic fillers and surfactants as well as variation of volume fractions of constituents on the viscoelastic properties of the new composite material have also been investigated. Filaments of the filled ABS has been fabricated and characterized to verify the possibility of prototyping and direct tooling using the new material on the current FDM machine. Major contributions of the thesis include: • Development of a new metal/polymer composite material for functional parts and rapid tooling solutions on Fused Deposition Modeling platform. • Development of mathematical models for predicting viscous behavior of three-component composite flow through capillary extrusion process. • Full rheological, thermal, mechanical and electrical characterization of the new metal/polymer composites. • Combining experimental and numerical methodology (tools) to predict melt flow behavior of metal/polymer composite through Fused Deposition Modeling. • Fabrication of stiff and flexible filaments of the metal-polymer composites as feedstock material for direct rapid tooling via Fused Deposition Modeling. • Fabrication of functional parts and inserts of new metal/polymer composites successfully and directly on the FDM 3000 system. • Production of plastic parts using injection moulding tools made by Direct FDM-based Rapid Tooling Process...|$|R
