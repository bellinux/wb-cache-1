25|$|Being {{tough on}} terrorism, {{particularly}} {{the sorts of}} homegrown terrorism that we've seen now in Orlando and San Bernardino, means {{making it harder for}} people who want to kill Americans to get their hands on assault weapons that are capable of killing dozens of innocents as quickly as possible. That's something I'll <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about in the weeks ahead.|$|E
25|$|Chaozhou {{children}} {{are introduced to}} Standard Chinese as early as in kindergarten; however, Chaozhou remains the primary medium of instruction. In {{the early years of}} primary education, Mandarin becomes the sole language of instruction, although students typically <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to one another in Chaozhou. Mandarin is widely understood, however minimally, by most younger Chaozhou speakers, but the elderly usually do not speak Mandarin since teaching was done in the local vernacular in the past.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 2008, Zach is in {{the process}} of looking for Kendall buried under rubble due to a tornado having just struck Pine Valley. He finds Bianca instead, and is {{surprised}} to see that she is pregnant. He later finds an unconscious Kendall. As an ambulance arrives for her, it is stated that there is not enough room for Bianca and Zach to ride along to the hospital. There is, however, enough room for Zach and Kendall's children to ride in the front seat of the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall's fate. They also discuss Bianca's secret that she is pregnant with Zach's child via sperm donation, and Bianca's new lover named Reese. Zach had agreed to father Bianca's child for the couple, but did not know that she had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> Bianca goes into labor. Zach helps deliver the new child into the world.|$|E

25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would wear a hat with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to ramble through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also use this as a prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote on the phone to discuss a Twitter beef with Dwyane Wade, and cut him off at the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the show just so they could cut him off.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 2008, Zach Slater is in {{the process}} of looking for wife Kendall buried under rubble due to a tornado having just struck Pine Valley.

Zach helps deliver the new child into the world. Sometime later at the hospital, she is horrified to discover that Babe has perished in the disaster's aftermath. Reese Williams comes to Pine Valley, not long after the tornado with Miranda. She proposes marriage to Bianca and she accepts. Reese and Bianca have their share of obstacles to overcome as a couple, mainly Bianca's suspicions of Reese's sexuality and friendship with Zach, but they exchange wedding vows on February 13, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{deals with}} the [...] "apprehension of a woman facing the death with after all the {{satisfaction}} to have loved". It mainly talks of sex, death and religion. The lyrics are [...] "slightly disturbing", [...] "sometimes important", {{and there is some}} [...] "humor". About the album content, Farmer said: [...] "I very selfishly <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about me, my shadows, my lights".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2015, the Commonwealth Freedom of Movement Organisation {{proposed}} that the national governments of the [...] United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada should advocate for freedom of movement between citizens of their countries, similar to the current arrangement existing between Australia and New Zealand through the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement. In May 2016, Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Alexander Downer expressed support for [...] "freer movement" [...] between Australia and the United Kingdom, stating: [...] "Over time {{we would like to}} <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the British government about arrangements we could make to liberalise movement between Australia and the UK, if not have completely free movement...".|$|E
2500|$|Jason leaves while Charlie and Gale <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> He {{gets the}} {{impression}} that Gale is making a pass and she reacts accordingly. At her invitation they both enter the doorways into the folly {{to meet in the}} middle. Charlie does so enthusiastically, but Gale sneaks off. Charlie instead meets Marsha, now fully dressed as the clown, [...] "Mr. Chortles". Marsha, who holds Charlie in awe (proof to her that anyone can be famous), asks him to autograph her thigh. Suddenly, as Charlie is removing Marsha's bloomers, two little girls from the party enter with Linzi, closely followed by Gale and Jason. The spell broken, Marsha runs into the folly, leaving Charlie with her bloomers in his hands. Then, emerging from the other door, she sees everyone, turns and runs back in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Barney," [...] rejoined Martin, [...] "since {{you give}} me credit for being a philosopher, I must <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> philosophically. Your botanical friend took a {{microscopic}} view of nature, while you took a telescopic view of it. Each view is good, but both views are better; and I can't help wishing that I were more of a philosopher than I am, especially in reference to botany." ...|$|E

60|$|In Mr. Bernard Shaw's {{brilliant}} play 'The Philanderer,' {{we have a}} vivid {{picture of}} this state of things. Charteris is a man perpetually endeavouring to be a free-lover, which is like endeavouring to be a married bachelor or a white negro. He is wandering in a hungry search for a certain exhilaration which he can only have when he has the courage to cease from wandering. Men knew better than this in old times--in the time, for example, of Shakespeare's heroes. When Shakespeare's men are really celibate they praise the undoubted advantages of celibacy, liberty, irresponsibility, a chance of continual change. But they were not such fools as to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of liberty {{when they were in}} such a condition that they could be made happy or miserable by the moving of someone else's eyebrow. Suckling classes love with debt in his praise of freedom.|$|E
6000|$|The name of Maria Clutterbuck {{had become}} odious to John Eames. As long as Miss Demolines would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about herself he could listen with some amount of gratification. Conversation {{on that subject}} was the natural {{progress}} of the Bayswater romance. And if Madalina would only call her friend by her present name, he had no strong objection to an occasional mention of the lady; but the combined names of Maria Clutterbuck {{had come to be}} absolutely distasteful to him. He did not believe in the Maria Clutterbuck friendship,--either in its past or present existence, as described by Madalina. Indeed, he did not put strong faith in anything that Madalina said to him. In the handsome gentleman with two thousand a year, he did not believe at all. But the handsome gentleman had only been mentioned once {{in the course of his}} acquaintance with Miss Demolines, whereas Maria Clutterbuck had come up so often! [...] "Upon my word I must wish you good-by," [...] he said. [...] "It is going on for eleven o'clock, and I have to start to-morrow at seven." ...|$|E
6000|$|Roden as {{he walked}} home did think more of the little affair than it deserved,--more at least than he would {{acknowledge}} that it deserved. He was angry with himself for bearing it in mind, and yet he did bear it in mind. Could it be that a creature so insignificant as Crocker could annoy him by a mere word or two? But he was annoyed, {{and did not know}} how such annoyance could be made to cease. If the man would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Lord Hampstead there was nothing by which he could be made to hold his tongue. He could not be kicked, or beaten, or turned out of the room. For any purpose of real assistance Mr. Jerningham was useless. As to complaining to the Æolus of the office that a certain clerk would talk about Lord Hampstead, that of course was out of the question. He had already used strong language, calling the man vulgar and ungentlemanlike, but if a man does not regard strong language what further can an angry victim do to him? ...|$|E
50|$|Abba <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about {{a hidden}} history. He keeps {{emphasizing}} the fact, the history {{we were taught}} is fabricated. Hiba Ali first confronted then started accepting the facts.|$|R
60|$|They <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> half nonsense, making {{themselves}} eloquent by quick {{looks and}} gestures, and communion of warm closeness. The ironical tones {{went out of}} Lettie's voice, and they made love.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whoa there!" [...] cried Dave, soothingly. [...] "Whoa, Jerry! Whoa, Bill!" [...] And thus he <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{the team}} while the sleigh bumped along through the deep snow {{and over the}} uneven ground.|$|R
60|$|But Conway Dalrymple,--though now {{and again}} he had got a side glance at her true {{character}} with clear-seeing eyes,--did allow himself to be flattered and deceived. He {{knew that she was}} foolish and ignorant, and that she often talked wonderful nonsense. He knew also that she was continually contradicting herself,--as when she would strenuously beg him to leave her, while she would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him in a strain that prevented the possibility of his going. But, nevertheless, he was flattered, and he did believe that she loved him. As to his love for her,--he knew very well that it amounted to nothing. Now and again, perhaps twice a week, if he saw her as often, he would say something which would imply a declaration of affection. He felt that as much as that was expected from him, and that he ought not to hope to get off cheaper. And now that this little play was going on about Miss Van Siever, he did think that Mrs. Dobbs Broughton was doing her very best to overcome an unfortunate attachment. It is so gratifying to a young man's feelings to suppose that another man's wife has conceived an unfortunate attachment for him! Conway Dalrymple ought not to have been fooled by such a woman; but I fear that he was fooled by her.|$|E

60|$|Though {{he spoke}} with outward politeness, his tone had become more peremptory, less bland, {{and he did not}} await Marguerite's reply before he sat down {{opposite}} <b>to</b> her and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> airily.|$|R
