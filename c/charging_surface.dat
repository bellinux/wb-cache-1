In the present study, we have employed the open-source XOOPIC code [I] to investigate the effects of solar wind conditions and plasma-surface interactions on the electrical environment in PSRs through fully two-dimensional pattic 1 e-in-cell simulations. By direct analogy with current understanding of the global lunar wake (e. g., references) deep, near-terminator, shadowed craters are expected to produce plasma "mini-wakes" just leeward of the crater wall. The present results (e. g., Figure I) are in agreement with previous claims that hot electrons rush into the crater void ahead of the heavier ions, fanning a negative cloud of charge. Charge separation along the initial plasma-vacuum interface gives rise to an ambipolar electric field that subsequently accelerates ions into the void. However, the situation {{is complicated by the}} presence of the dynamic lunar surface, which develops an electric potential in response to local plasma currents (e. g., Figure Ia).

40|$|Wireless power {{transfer}} (WPT) via magnetic induction is an emerging {{technology that is}} a result of the significant advancements in power electronics. Mobiles phones can now be charged wirelessly by placing them on a <b>charging</b> <b>surface.</b> Electric vehicles can charge their batteries while being parked over a certain charging spot. The possible applications of this technology are vast and the potential it has to revolutionise and change the way that we use todayâs application is huge. Wireless {{power transfer}} via magnetic induction, also referred to as inductive power transfer (IPT), does not necessarily aim to replace the cable. It is intended to coexist and operate in conjunction with the cable. Although significant progress has been achieved, it is still far from reaching this aim since many obstacles and design challenges still need to be addressed. Low power efficiencies and limited transfer range are the two main issues for IPT. A tradeoff is usually associated with these two issues. Higher efficiencies are only achieved at very short transmission distances, whereas transferring large amounts of power at large distances is possible but at reduced efficiencies. This thesis addressed the limitations and design challenges in IPT systems such as low efficiency and short transmission range, in addition to poor power regulation and coil displacement and misalignment sensitivity. Novel circuit topologies and design solutions have developed for DC/AC inverters and DC/AC rectifiers that will allow for increased performance, higher efficiencies and reduced sensitivity to coil misalignments and displacements. This thesis contributes in four key areas towards IPT. Firstly, a detailed mathematical analysis has been performed on the electric circuit model of inductively coupled coils. This allows for better understanding on how power is distributed amongst the circuitâs elements. Equivalent circuit representations were presented to simplify the design process of IPT systems. Secondly, a review of the different classes and configurations of DC/AC inverters that can be used as primary coil drivers in IPT systems were presented. Class E DC/AC inverters were mathematically analysed in great detail and their performance as primary coil drivers in IPT systems was investigated. Thirdly, novel electronic tuning methods were presented to allow Class E primary coil drivers to operate at optimum switching conditions regardless of the distance between the coils of an IPT system and the value of the load. The saturable reactor was used as the electronic tunable element. Lastly, Class D and Class E AC/DC rectifiers have been used for the first time in IPT systems. Detailed mathematical analysis and extensive experimental results show their superior performance over the conventional half-wave and full-wave AC/DC rectifiers...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} if the new novel approach of investigating the effects of hydrogen, using a custom made hydrogen permeation cell together with a nanoindenter can give insight into the fundamental mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement. The sample used in this experiment is mainly an Fe 3 %Si sample. Similar work involving in situ nanoindentation and micro-cantilever bending has shown changes in material behavior such as change in pop-in load and crack propagation in the presence of hydrogen. These experiments have been charging the samples by covering the indentation surface with an electrolyte and charging it as a one sided permeation cell. For this experiment the electrolyte is moved to {{the opposite side of the}} indentation surface. By doing so one can remove any contributing effect of the electrolyte on the indentation surface and only measure the effect of the hydrogen by charging the sample with hydrogen while indenting. During the fall of 2016 a custom made electrochemical cell was designed and manufactured for this purpose. In addition to the nanoindentation, two experiments using microindentation is also performed. By indenting deeper the hydrogen concentration should be higher based on the theory of linear hydrogen concentration gradient through the sample during steady state charging. Calculations based on a similar experiment done in 2015 reveal that the concentration at the nanoindentation depths are very low compared to the <b>charging</b> <b>surface</b> and is the main limit of this approach. An other concern is the functionality of the cell. In order {{to determine if the}}re was any hydrogen diffusing through the sample with this cell, a full permeation experiment was also conducted. Neither the nanoindenation nor the microindentation produced any reproducible changes after the hydrogen charging. In addition to this it was found that the pop-in load can vary greatly within one grain, something that raises questing whether or not the pop-in load is a good measure of change due to hydrogen effect for Fe 3 %Si. The full permeation experiment gave inconclusive results about the functionality and requires further work to be determined. Based on this information it has been concluded that the hydrogen concentration at the indentation depths are too low to have an effect which can be measured with this approach, even if the cell should be proven to function. For future work an effort should be made to determine the functionality of the cell, as well as figure out how high the hydrogen concentration should be in order to measure an effect. Based on this specific experimental parameters can be determined (Sample thickness, charging current, electrolyte etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{illustrates}} the behaviour of cellulose ethers during powder processing, compaction and drug release, {{as these are}} frequently employed in the fabrication of compressed hydrophilic matrices. The handling operations can give rise to the electrification of powder particles, which can affect the end productâs quality. Controlling the parameters which can dictate the quality of compressed matrices is an ambition inherent {{in the development of}} pharmaceutical formulations. Thus, the aims and objectives of this thesis were to firstly study the electrostatic, surface adhesion, dissolution and compaction properties of plain polymers and model drugs. Secondly, binary mixtures of fixed drug to polymer ratios were made in order to investigate the effect of polymer concentration and physico-chemical attributes (particle size, chemistry and viscosity) on the tribo-electric <b>charging,</b> <b>surface</b> adhesion (SA), swelling, erosion, drug release kinetics and compaction properties of model drugs. It can be discerned that the both drugs charged negatively, whereas the methylcellulose (MC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) particles charged positively. The physico-chemical properties associated with MC and HPMC, such as particle size, chemical heterogeneity and molecular size of cellulose ethers all {{have a significant effect on}} charging and adhesion behaviour of plain MC and HPMC particles. Moreover, the concentration, particle size, chemical heterogeneity and molecular size of MC/HPMC all significantly affect the charging and SA propensity of the model drugs studied. The swelling and dissolution results confirm that the extent and rate of swelling, swelling exponent, dissolution rate and drug release kinetic parameters were affected by physico-chemical attributes (concentration, particle size, substitution and viscosity) of MC/HPMC and drug solubility. The mechanism of swelling and drug release was found to be anomalous. However, it inclined towards more diffusion-oriented swelling/drug release with higher MC/HPMC levels, viscosity, Hpo/Meo substitution ratios, drug solubility but smaller MC/MC particle size. The matrix erosion results obtained from newly developed phenol-sulphuric acid assay (PSA) method confirmed that the solubility of the drug, and levels of HPMC in a particular matrix tablet, significantly affect the matrix erosion rate and the results were similar to those determined using the much more labour-intensive gravimetric method. Moreover, the combination of conventional UV drug analysis technique and PSA assay can be used to simultaneously quantify the matrix erosion, polymer dissolution and drug release kinetics in a single set of experiments avoiding the need for separate studies. The compaction results confirmed that the FBP has poor compaction as compare to THP. The particle size, substitution ratios and molecular size of MC/HPMC affect the compaction and consolidation behaviour of plain MC/HPMC compacts. Furthermore, it can be noticed that the concentration and physico-chemical attributes (particle size, chemistry and molecular size) of MC/HPMC have a significant influence on the densification and consolidation process of hydrophilic matrices. In summary, the information obtained can be used in the future to develop and adopt strategies for development and further optimization of compressed hydrophilic matrices...|$|E
40|$|Soft x-ray {{absorption}} spectroscopy (XAS) {{is a widely}} used method for probing the electronic structure of materials, yet it suffers from many complications related to the reliable measurement of absorption spectra and the proper theoretical modelling of spectral features. Problems due to different experimental aspects, such as sample <b>charging,</b> <b>surface</b> contamination and saturation effects, often introduce artifacts or distortions into a measured absorption spectrum. Even when measured accurately, the interpretation of absorption spectra {{is complicated by the}} absence of rigorous theoretical methods that properly account for the effect of the core hole on the remaining electronic structure, leading to inaccurate spectral simulations. The limits of the one electron model of core excitation were explored through a high resolution XAS study of the linear polyacenes. When measured at high resolution, the linear polyacenes exhibited a fine structure that could be assigned to excitation of non-equivalent carbon atoms in the molecules. The energies and intensities of these transitions were extracted and compared to transition intensities calculated from density functional theory, where the multi-electronic effects were approximated using a full core hole and half core hole model. The full core hole model was found to better approximate the trends in the spectra for the smaller molecules, but neither model was able to properly calculate the changes in the absorption spectra of the larger molecules. These results demonstrated the deficiencies of the one electron picture of core hole excitation and highlighted the need for incorporating multi-electronic effects into XAS simulations. To extend the capabilities of XAS, the use of partial fluorescence yields (PFY) was explored. One of the primary experimental limitation of XAS is that absorption spectra are measured by monitoring the total yield of electrons or photons from the sample. In both of these methods, a direct relationship between the measured spectra and the linear attenuation coefficient of the sample is not guaranteed. To overcome this drawback, the partial fluorescence yield measurement technique, employing a silicon drift detector, was used. By measuring partial fluorescence yields (PFY), as opposed to total yields, the effects of background fluorescence could be avoided. The inverse of the partial fluorescence yield was also demonstrated to be an effective way of avoiding saturation effects in some samples. The utility of the inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) method was demonstrated in a study of several iron oxide minerals that were not possible to measure using conventional total yield methods. IPFY was also demonstrated for liquid samples where differences between the Fe PFY and IPFY were noted and attributed to resonant scattering effects in the PFY. In both the iron oxide study and the polyacene study, the experimental limitations related to the measurement of XAS were evaluated by comparison to x-ray Raman spectroscopy (XRS). XRS is a hard x-ray based method that probes core excitation in low-Z elements by measuring the energy loss of the scattered photons. Both XRS and XAS involve the same electronic transitions allowing for a direct comparison of spectra measured using the two methods, but the limitations of XAS related to the short penetration depth of soft x-rays are not encountered in XRS. While XRS measurements do not suffer from saturation or surface effects, the experimental resolution and count rates of this technique are limited. This dissertation demonstrated that, while XAS is an established method, there are many aspects of the technique that require additional development. Emerging calculation methods that can incorporate the interaction between the electron and core hole will improve data interpretation capabilities. New detector systems that can measure partial yields with high resolution and can be placed in specific geometries will continue to improve measurement quality and allow for the development of novel techniques, like IPFY. A growing use of XAS and XRS in concert will also improve the general applicability of core level excitation spectroscopies and help to advance our understanding of the materials around us...|$|E

At higher <b>surface</b> <b>charge</b> densities, when adsorbed polyelectrolytes form a three-dimensional adsorbed layer, we use the self-consistent mean-field theory to calculate the layer properties.
