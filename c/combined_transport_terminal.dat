Optimalisation of these processes in AO <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> <b>terminal</b> is presented on the project in contexture on road transport vehicles. Application of GPS is signefied in combined transport providing that all transport units will be followed this way. It is necessary to unify the systems for following in combined transport not only in national standard but also international. To communication between the two relatively separately working systems must be used unified standards. Telematics contribution to dispraise of expenses and escalation efficiency by optimal operational, transport and logistics process control also in combined transport. The main aspect for solving logistics problem is regular and distortionless information about positions of mobile object inclusive their condition. Satellite system rank among modern substance of telematics. Satellite systems enable navigation, monitoring and destination position of mobile objects. Satellite systems escalate degree of garrison and freight security, and enable quicker reverse flows of information. Contribution articulates into two parts. Scopes of satellite systems utilise for combined transport control and demands for these systems are description in forepart. Fundamental characteristic and structure of mathematical model of combined transport is present in second parts...|$|E

Although there may be a certain buffer capacity due to the transhipment process, this buffer is a kind of side effect and a subordinate of the actual main function – the transhipment of goods. Transport logistics hubs usually connect many sources with many sinks. Examples for this type of hub can be found in locations of forwarding companies, <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> <b>terminals,</b> airports and railroad transfer stations [19, 38, 44].|$|R

40|$|Trimodal {{transport}} chains for containerised seaport {{hinterland traffic}} are {{often referred to}} by actors {{in the field of}} inland navigation as a major possibility to increase the transport volume of inland navigation in container traffic and to strengthen the position of inland ports as trimodal hinterland-hubs in container transport chains. However, a sound scientific investigation of the feasibility of trimodal transport chains in relation to alternative transport offers in containerised seaport hinterland traffic has been missing so far. For this purpose, a suitable modelling approach has been developed in this research, which combines the detailed process analysis of trimodal seaport hinterland traffic with the use of geographical information systems (GIS) for intermodal transport. Based on the detailed process analysis of intermodal seaport hinterland traffic, a new typology of <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> <b>terminals</b> in seaports is proposed and, in particular, necessary enhancements of nowadays available GIS in the transport sector with respect to specific infrastructure restrictions of each transport mode are defined in the form of attributes of the road, rail and inland waterway networks. These will allow for a significantly wider use of GIS as a knowldge base for the planning of intermodal transport networks in the future. Furthermore, through the development of calculation schemes for the detailed modelling of process times and costs of combined seaport hinterland traffic, extensive scenarios of trimodal transport chains have been calculated. The results show that for a major part of goods transported in containers, from low-value bulk cargo up to relatively high-value electronic goods, trimodal transport chains are feasible compared to direct rail transport...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Walking {{accessibility}} {{is defined}} as {{how easy it is}} to access public <b>transport</b> <b>terminals</b> by walking. Walking effort instead of walking distance or walking time is used to represent the utility of walking as access mode to public <b>transport</b> <b>terminals</b> (Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations). This effort is expressed by an equivalent walking distance, which consists of actual walking distance and generalized walking effort. The main objective of this research is to develop walking accessibility measure using equivalent walking distance. The probability of walking is introduced to show the acceptable walking distance to public <b>transport</b> <b>terminal.</b> This concept assumes that for every distance to the terminal, there is a probability of walking to access. Eventually, all components of walking route would be converted to equivalent distance. Each type of walking routes to access public transport (i. e. walkways, sidewalks and road crossings) has some elements that influence the effort o...|$|R

40|$|The {{dominance}} of road for hinterland services could be challenged by using rail-road or waterway-road transport because of costs, congestion and growing environmental constraints. A common dynamic {{that is very}} favorable {{to the development of}} <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> is shared among the actors of the transport chain but with different starting positions considering the ports of the Northern Range. But <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> must still demonstrate that it can compete with road transport. Road <b>transport</b> and <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> are not directly comparable because they do not offer the same physical transport service. The organizational patterns of road and <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> are investigated. The example of hinterland services to and from the port of Le Havre to the Paris region is a particularly interesting case because of the very short distance. It is shown that the competitiveness of <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> in terms of price varies greatly according to the way road transport it competes with is organized and that the commercial policy of <b>combined</b> <b>transport</b> operators plays a key role for explaining this competitiveness.
