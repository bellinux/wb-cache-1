5|$|ACAs {{have three}} ports: the OTG port for the {{portable}} device, which {{is required to}} have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the <b>charging</b> <b>port,</b> which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> does not pass data, but does use the D± signals for <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power {{as if there were}} a <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from the <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> transparently.|$|E
5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new port type, the <b>charging</b> <b>port,</b> {{as opposed to}} the {{standard}} downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. Charging ports are divided into 2 further types: the charging downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> (DCP), which does not. Dedicated charging ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and charging USB ports, the charging ports should be labeled as such.|$|E
5|$|Revision 1.2 of the {{specification}} {{was released}} in 2010. Several changes are made and limits are increased including allowing 1.5A on charging downstream ports for unconfigured devices, allowing High Speed communication while having a current up to 1.5A, and allowing a maximum current of 5A. Also, support is removed for <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> detection via resistive mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|A new, {{redesigned}} MacBook {{line was}} launched on March 9, 2015. Available in silver, gold or space grey, it is thinner than the MacBook Air and removes the traditional MagSafe <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> (along {{with all other}} ports, except the headphone jack) {{in favor of the}} multi-purpose USB-C port. It also features a Retina display. On April 19, 2016, Apple updated the 12-inch Retina MacBook with new sixth-generation Intel Core M processors, longer battery life and a rose gold option.|$|E
5|$|Per {{the base}} specification, any device {{attached}} to an SDP must initially be a low-power device, with high-power mode contingent on later USB configuration by the host. Charging ports, however, can immediately supply between 0.5 and 1.5A of current. The <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> may apply current limiting or shut down completely, but must not apply limiting below 0.5A, and must not shut down below 1.5A or before the voltage drops to 2V.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} began including a 30-pin dock connector, allowing for FireWire or USB connectivity. This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, {{as most of}} them did not have FireWire ports at the time. Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire, although the latter was available separately. As of the first-generation iPod Nano and the fifth-generation iPod Classic, Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer (while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device) {{in an attempt to}} reduce cost and form factor. As of the second-generation iPod Touch and the fourth-generation iPod Nano, FireWire charging ability has been removed. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle uses a single 3.5mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack or a USB data and <b>charging</b> <b>port</b> for the dock/cable.|$|E
