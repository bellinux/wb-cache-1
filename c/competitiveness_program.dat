50|$|The Act {{begins on}} 1 July 2012, and {{operates}} on a financial year basis. It {{is administered by}} the Clean Energy Regulator and the responsible Minister. A carbon pollution cap limits the sum of: (a) the total number of auctioned carbon units; and (b) the total number of free carbon units issued in accordance with the Jobs and Competitiveness Program; and (c) the total number of free carbon units issued to coal-fired electricity generators.If a person (including a corporation) is responsible for covered emissions of greenhouse gas from the operation of a facility, the facility's annual emissions are above a threshold, and the person does not surrender one eligible emissions unit for each tonne of carbon dioxide equivalence of the gas, the person is liable to pay unit shortfall charge. The financial years beginning on 1 July 2012, 1 July 2013 and 1 July 2014 are fixed charge years (otherwise known in popular terms as the 'carbon tax'). In a fixed charge year, carbon units will be issued under the Act for a fixed charge. Later financial years are flexible charge years which involve emissions trading. In a flexible charge year, carbon units will be issued under the Act as the result of an auction plus by means of free allocation to coal fired generators and emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) industries. However, in the flexible charge years beginning on 1 July 2015, 1 July 2016 and 1 July 2017, some carbon units may be issued for a fixed charge (to act as a cap). Furthermore, free carbon units will be issued under the Jobs and <b>Competitiveness</b> <b>Program</b> (which deals with emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) activities). Free carbon units will be issued to coal-fired electricity generators. If a carbon unit was not issued for a fixed charge, the unit is transferable.

50|$|The {{institutional}} model {{applied in}} the case of National <b>Competitiveness</b> <b>Programs</b> (NCP) varies from country to country, however, there are some common features. The leadership structure of NCPs relies on strong support from the highest level of political authority. High-level support provides credibility with the appropriate actors in the private sector. Usually, the council or governing body will have a designated public sector leader (president, vice-president or minister) and a co-president drawn from the private sector. Notwithstanding the public sector’s role in strategy formulation, oversight, and implementation, national competition programs should have strong, dynamic leadership from the private sector at all levels - national, local and firm. From the outset, the program must provide a clear diagnostic of the problems facing the economy and a compelling vision that appeals to a broad set of actors who are willing to seek change and implement an outward-oriented growth strategy. Finally, most programs share a common view on the importance of networks of firms or “clusters” as an organizing principal for collective action. Based on a bottom-up approach, programs that support the association among private business leadership, civil society organizations, public institutions and political leadership can better identify barriers to competition develop joint-decisions on strategic policies and investments; and yield better results in implementation.|$|R

This analytical capacity needs to be enhanced with tools capable of dealing with big data sets without making the analytical process a difficult task. Clustering is usually used, as this technique does not require any prior knowledge about the data. However, clustering algorithms usually require one or more input parameters that influence the clustering process and the results that can be obtained.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{electronic}} Coulomb correlations on the vacancy formation energy in paramagnetic alpha-Fe within ab initio dynamical mean-field theory. The calculated value for the formation energy is substantially lower than in standard density-functional calculations and in excellent agreement with experiment. The reduction is caused by an enhancement of electronic correlations at the nearest neighbors of the vacancy. This effect is explained by subtle changes in the corresponding spectral function of the d electrons. The local lattice relaxations around the vacancy are substantially increased by many-body effects.

40|$|Road {{pavements}} {{are very}} important infrastructures for the Society, but they can cause serious environmental impacts during construction, operation and rehabilitation phases. Thus, {{it is essential to}} develop surface paving solutions that promote not only the durability but also a comfortable and safe use. In fact, this work aims to study the properties of new opengraded mixtures for surface layers produced with plastic wastes. First, HDPE and EVA wastes were used as bitumen modifiers, and then another plastic waste (PEX) replaced part of the aggregates. After studying the modified binders, the open-graded mixtures were designed, and then they were tested concerning their particle loss, rutting resistance, surface texture and damping effect. It was concluded that both ways of using the plastic wastes can improve the mechanical and functional properties of the open-graded mixtures related to the pavement performance.

40|$|Road {{traffic noise}} is {{associated}} with several health problems and welfare; such as sleep disturbances and annoyance. Accordingly, it becomes essential to characterize road noise not only based on acoustic indicators, but also based on psychoacoustic indicators. The acoustic indicators are required to assure compliance with European legislation and to define vehicle detection thresholds, the psychoacoustic indicators describe better annoyance rates. In this context, this work aimed to explore tyre-road noise measurements acquired on eight road pavements at eight speeds, {{from the point of}} view of psychoacoustics. In the analysis three psychoacoustic indicators (Loudness, Sharpness, Roughness) and one acoustic indicator (LAmax) were determined on 64 tyre-road noise samples acquired through the Close Proximity Method (CPX).

40|$|The article {{demonstrates}} {{the results of}} the studies which were aimed to identify the relationship between individual values and attitudes towards innovation. 380 respondents, young and adult representatives of the Russian population, took part in the research. The respondents belonged to the younger generation (under 25 years old) or to the adult generation (over 45 years old). This research is {{based on the idea that}} the general predisposition for novelty and innovation can be conditioned by individual values. It has been revealed that values of “Humility”, “Conformity Rules”, “Security”, “Tradition” can interfere with the acceptance of innovation by the adult generation of the Russians. The values of “Self-Direction Thought”, “Stimulation”, “Achievement”, “Power Dominance”, “Power Resource” stimulate people to accept and implement innovations. “Universalism Concern” and “Conformity Interpersonal”, in their turn, impede the acceptance of innovations.

Using a first-principles Green's {{function}} approach we study magnetic properties of the magnetic binary tetradymite chalcogenides Bi 2 Se 3, Bi 2 Te 3, and Sb 2 Te 3. The magnetic coupling between transition-metal impurities is long range, extends beyond a quintuple layer, and decreases with increasing number of d electrons per 3 d atom. We find two main mechanisms for the magnetic interaction in these materials: the indirect exchange interaction mediated by free carriers and the indirect interaction between magnetic moments via chalcogen atoms. The calculated Curie temperatures of these systems are in good agreement with available experimental data. Our results provide deep insight into exchange interactions in magnetic binary tetradymite chalcogenides and open a way to design new materials for promising applications.
