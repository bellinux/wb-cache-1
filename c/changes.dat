40|$|From Integrative Summary: This {{research}} paper comprises {{of three sections}} that include: an evaluation report, a literature review and the research methodology. The first section assesses the management of resistance to <b>change</b> as encountered during the ELIDZ structural re-alignment initiative. The assessment was done after the <b>change</b> initiative had been implemented to see what could be learnt from the exercise, {{in order to be}} better prepared for future <b>change</b> programmes. The implemented <b>change</b> was initiated by the CEO of the ELIDZ but its criticality in terms of purpose, or the need for the <b>change</b> was unclear to many employees at the time of initiation. An examination of the literature on <b>change</b> management highlighted the importance of managing resistance to <b>change</b> as part of a <b>change</b> initiative, so as to ensure a successful transition. The review of the literature on management of resistance to <b>change</b> in section 2 of this paper examines the definition of management of resistance to <b>change</b> and in particular, covers key factors like <b>change</b> readiness, participation in <b>change</b> and <b>change</b> communication. These key concepts underpin effective management of resistance during <b>change.</b> The literature on management of resistance to <b>change</b> with respect to the role of <b>change</b> readiness, participation in <b>change</b> and <b>change</b> communication was used to develop a questionnaire that was used to assess the ELIDZ <b>change</b> initiative. The questionnaire was developed in a Likert Scale format with questions across the spectrum of <b>change</b> readiness, <b>change</b> participation and <b>change</b> communication. Section 3 of this paper describes how the quantitative research was provided to the population sample of employees from the ELIDZ where the questions on <b>change</b> readiness, <b>change</b> participation and <b>change</b> communication was used to assess the effectiveness of management of resistance to <b>change</b> during the ELIDZ <b>change</b> initiative. In addition section 3 provides an explanation of how the results of the research were derived. The results on <b>change</b> readiness suggest that the ELIDZ <b>change</b> initiative did not address <b>change</b> readiness adequately. There is therefore a risk of resistance to <b>change</b> that could manifest. This also indicates that <b>change</b> readiness must be planned more thoroughly in future <b>change</b> endeavours. Most of the population sampled did not feel that they participated in the <b>change</b> initiative, suggesting that the ELIDZ did not address participation in the <b>change</b> initiative adequately. Not enabling employees to actively participate in the <b>change</b> is tantamount to decreasing the potential for acceptance of <b>change</b> and increasing the risk of resistance to <b>change.</b> In order to ensure that future <b>change</b> initiatives are not met with employee resistance to <b>change,</b> the ELIDZ should plan for employee participation throughout the <b>change</b> process. The extent to which <b>change</b> communication was addressed in the ELIDZ <b>change</b> initiative was demonstrated by very poor results. The results from the population sampled suggest that the <b>change</b> was not well communicated to employees. As <b>change</b> communication is known to reduce the potential for resistance to <b>change,</b> it is imperative for the ELIDZ to plan for comprehensive communication strategies to cover the <b>change</b> process for future <b>change</b> action...|$|R

Preparing for <b>change,</b> managing <b>change</b> through resistance management plan and reinforcing <b>change</b> have been identified in the article as the main phrases of <b>change</b> management process that lead to improve the organization performance. Managing resistance to <b>change</b> is important part for success of any <b>change</b> effort in each company.

40|$|Title: Understanding {{resistance}} to organizational change: a cognitive approach Authors: Emmy Morehed & Sara Skoglund Level: Degree thesis, 30 hp Keywords: Organizational <b>change,</b> Resistance to <b>change,</b> Cognitive perception Background: Organizational <b>change</b> is a naturally occurring phenomenon and {{is vital for}} the survival of organizations. However, the majority of organizational <b>change</b> initiatives result in failure. Resistance to <b>change</b> {{has been found to be}} the key reason for this organizational <b>change</b> failure. It is therefore important for <b>change</b> agents to understand and manage the <b>change</b> recipients’ {{resistance to}} <b>change,</b> in order to achieve organizational <b>change</b> success. Research question: What role does the <b>change</b> recipients’ cognitive perception of organizational <b>change</b> have, when assessing their resistance to <b>change?</b> Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop our understanding of the <b>change</b> recipients’ resistance to organizational <b>change,</b> as it is cognitively perceived, in order to enhance the existing knowledge of resistance and how it in turn can be successfully managed by <b>change</b> agents. In this way, our purpose includes contributing with a theoretical development in regards to the <b>change</b> recipients’ cognitive perception of organizational <b>change</b> as well as providing <b>change</b> agents with managerial implications. Method: A qualitative research approach was applied, which included a case study design consisting of multiple cases. Semi-structured interviews and observations were the methods used for collecting the empirical data. The ten respondents were selected from one Swedish company, based on a theoretical sampling method. The data analysis method included both a within-case analysis as well as a cross-case analysis. Theoretical framework: The structure of the theoretical framework is based on three themes. The first theme considers organizational <b>change,</b> where our working definition and theories regarding organizational <b>change</b> are presented. The second theme considers resistance to <b>change,</b> where we define and present the theories regarding resistance to <b>change.</b> The third and last theme considers the <b>change</b> recipient’s cognitive perception of organizational <b>change,</b> where we provide our definitions of, and the theories regarding, the cognitive elements. Findings: The <b>change</b> recipients’ cognitive evaluation of organizational <b>change</b> have an important role, when assessing their resistance to <b>change.</b> In regards to the <b>change</b> process, knowledge required to handle the <b>change</b> is found to be the most important cognitive element. <b>Change</b> usefulness is found to be the second most important one. Advantages and disadvantages, as well as <b>change</b> necessity, are not found to be important cognitive elements...|$|R
