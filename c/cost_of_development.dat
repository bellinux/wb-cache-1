5|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the Rampart Dam project illustrated the growing {{shift in the}} environmental movement during the 1960s. Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving {{the natural beauty of}} a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. National Park Service in the United States {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> as well. Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, Boeing's 747 {{became the}} first {{wide-body}} jetliner to enter service. The 747 was the first passenger jet wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin. Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow-body jets. The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide-bodies. To defray the high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies. This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts {{in return for their}} early participation. The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take-off and landing airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner. At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a T-tail.|$|E

25|$|The Act {{established}} a Nuclear Waste Fund composed of fees levied against electric utilities {{to pay for}} the costs of constructing and operating a permanent repository, and set the fee at one mill per kilowatt-hour of nuclear electricity generated. Utilities were charged a one-time fee for storage of spent fuel created before enactment of the law. Nuclear waste from defense activities was exempted from most provisions of the Act, which required that if military waste were put into a civilian repository, the government would pay its pro rata share of the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>development,</b> construction and operation of the repository. The Act authorized impact assistance payments to states or Indian tribes to offset any costs resulting from location of a waste facility within their borders.|$|E
25|$|The JWST has {{a history}} of major cost overruns and delays which have {{resulted}} from outside factors such as delays in deciding on a launch vehicle and adding extra funding for contingencies. The first budget estimates were that the observatory would cost $1.6 billion and launch in 2011, but NASA has now scheduled the telescope for a 2019 launch on a budget that has grown to $8.8 billion. In 2011, the United States House of Representatives voted to terminate funding, after about $3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production. Funding was restored and capped at $8 billion. , the telescope remained on schedule for a spring 2019 launch and within the 2011 revised budget.

25|$|According to Rod Fergusson, {{the game}} was at one point {{intended}} to be a horror game influenced by Band of Brothers, Resident Evil 4 and Kill Switch. A romance subplot was considered for the game but was eventually dropped. In an interview with Cliff Bleszinski, lead developer for Epic Games, he cites three games that were the primary influences in the game's design, including the pacing and over-the-shoulder third-person perspective from Resident Evil 4 and the tactical-cover system from Kill Switch; Bleszinski also cited Bionic Commandos influence on the cover system, equating the actions of moving from cover to cover as similar to the action of swinging from platform to platform in the latter game. These design choices reflect themselves in the gameplay, as Gears of War focuses mainly on squad team-based and cover-dependent tactics with limited weapons rather than brute force. Bleszinski also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda, including its storytelling and world-building elements, acquiring and mastering of tools, and underground environments. The game's title itself is a homage to Metal Gear, an early formative influence on Bleszinski. The total <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> was $10 million, according to Epic's Mark Rein, and only 20 to 30 people were involved with the development at any time. The game also includes a content filter, which will turn off the blood and gore, and the usage of profanity. However, these figures do not include the proprietary Unreal Engine 3.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} in beta as of December 2013, {{where it had}} over 1,000 testers and the average finish time was 90 minutes. It was planned as an iPad exclusive. The game was {{initially}} released for iOS on April 3, 2014, and the company recouped their <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> within {{the first two weeks}} of release. An Android port went through two beta tests and was later released on May 14, 2014. More levels were in development, as of April 2014.

Wong stated that, with consumer interest, the company would consider porting the game to other platforms. The game's technical director said that the game was [...] "not very difficult to port" [...] since it was written in the Unity game engine.

The idea went through several iterations as Mr. Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have to say, was very romantic). Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up. Accompanied by a B.O.W.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between firms' incentives to learn, communicate {{and to develop}} their product innovation is studied for different settings. Firms learn about their <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> by investing in research. After learning, firms decide what information to reveal, {{and how much to}} invest in <b>development.</b> Two effects <b>of</b> information revelation are central to the analysis. First, a firm's revelation has a strategic effect. It provides its rival with information about the firm's relative cost efficiency in development. When a firm {{is expected to be a}} more efficient investor in development, this discourages its rival's development investments. This effect therefore gives firms an incentive to bias their revelation towards revealing only good news about themselves. The second effect is an informational effect, and conflicts with the strategic effect. When <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> investments are positively correlated, each firm learns about its own <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> investment from his rival's revelation. This gives firms an incentive to only reveal bad news to their rival. Bad news makes rivals pessimistic about their development costs, and discourages development investments. The {{interaction between}} these two conflicting effects determines firms' incentives to acquire, reveal and further build upon information. In this paper the firms' <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>development</b> are perfectly correlated, and therefore the informational effect generically dominates. When firms share revenues this effect is countervailed by free-rider incentives. The relative strength of the two effects determines firm's incentives to invest and reveal information. The verifiability of firms' private information is crucial in determining how much information can and will be revealed between firms. Unverifiable information can never be revealed credibly, while verifiable information results in unravelling for extreme revenue shares only. ...|$|R
