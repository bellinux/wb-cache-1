50|$|The Solinst Waterloo Multilevel {{groundwater}} {{monitoring system}} is a modular MLS designed to collect groundwater data from multiple depths within a single borehole via a series of monitoring ports positioned at specific intervals along 2-inch ID Schedule 80 PVC casing. The various monitoring ports can be connected to a combination of: sampling pumps, transducers, or polyethylene tubes that extend from the ports to the ground surface inside of the PVC casing. The smooth exterior wall of the PVC casing facilitates construction of annular seals between the monitored zones in the borehole via backfilling with alternating layers of sand and bentonite, or using expandable packers manufactured by Solinst. The sections of PVC casing have water-tight joints to prevent hydraulic <b>cross-communication</b> within the well.

40|$|Abstract Background Cells {{coordinate}} their metabolism, proliferation, and cellular communication according to environmental cues through signal transduction. Because signal transduction has a primary role in cellular processes, many experimental techniques and approaches have emerged {{to discover the}} molecular components and dynamics that are dependent on cellular contexts. However, omics approaches based on genome-wide expression analysis data comparing one differing condition (e. g. complex disease patients and normal subjects) did not investigate the dynamics and inter-pathway <b>cross-communication</b> that are dependent on cellular contexts. Therefore, we introduce a new computational omics approach for discovering signal transduction pathways regulated by transcription and transcriptional regulations between pathways in signaling networks that are dependent on cellular contexts, especially focusing on a transcription-mediated mechanism of inter-pathway <b>cross-communication.</b> Results Applied to dendritic cells treated with lipopolysaccharide, our analysis well depicted how dendritic cells respond to the treatment through transcriptional regulations between signal transduction pathways in dendritic cell maturation and T cell activation. Conclusions Our new approach helps to understand the underlying biological phenomenon of expression data (e. g. complex diseases such as cancer) by providing a graphical network which shows transcriptional regulations between signal transduction pathways. The software programs are available upon request. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Edwards Aquifer is a large, complex {{groundwater}} system located throughout Central Texas {{in association}} with the Balcones Fault Zone. The San Antonio and Barton Spring segments of the Edwards Aquifer have been extensively studied in the past because they provide groundwater resources to the largely urbanized areas of San Antonio and Austin, respectively, and smaller communities along the Interstate 35 corridor. Previous research has been conducted on these southern and central portions of the Edwards Aquifer system, which have characterized the structural, hydrogeological and geochemical variations within the highly karsted region. However, the Northern Segment of the Edwards Aquifer primarily consists of undeveloped rural land, and is therefore lacking sufficient studies to fully understand the structural, hydrogeological, and geochemical systems in this region. LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and remote sensing analyses have enabled identification and delineation of spatial distribution of fractures and karstic features visible at the surface, and provided valuable information regarding the understanding of potential <b>cross-communication</b> between aquifer systems. Water quality data from water wells of the Edwards and Trinity aquifers were extracted from the Groundwater Database of the Texas Water Development Board. ArcGIS was utilized to generate geochemical maps for spatial distribution and correlation purposes. Evidence for probable <b>cross-communication</b> between aquifer systems is discernable when examining the directional trend of constituents and comparing them to highly dense areas of lineaments and sinkhole features.

30|$|Our {{computational}} study {{finds that}} calcium waves can be triggered in an idealized morphological setting. If certain geometric and physiological conditions are met, wave propagation is a stable process, {{similar to the}} all-or-nothing properties of electrical action potentials. A minimal ryanodine receptor density is required to guarantee sufficient calcium release from the ER and this density scales inversely with ER surface. We also observed abortive regimes in small parameter regions below thresholds for ER size and ryanodine receptor densities. When considering realistic morphologies, spatial variations in dendritic and ER morphology as well as changes in RyR density are likely to occur, thus, abortive regimes may be important {{when it comes to}} synaptic <b>cross-communication</b> with respect to calcium signals.|$|E

The critical role of NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide generation in this cross-talk mechanism {{is supported by the}} finding that blockade of NADPH oxidase function prevents c-Met trans-phosphorylation and the downstream signalling cascade.

40|$|AbstractThe initial {{steps of}} heat stress in A 431 cells were {{previously}} characterized by ligand-independent EGFR transactivation via an unknown mechanism and concomitant secretion of Hsp 70.

This notion {{is supported by the}} findings that purified Hsp 70 can induce EGFR transactivation and the activation of EGFR-dependent signaling pathways. Both heat stress and pure Hsp 70 stimulate activation of TLR 2 / 4 and their association with EGFR.

The glomerular response to injury displays astonishingly uniform features that include infiltration with professional immune cells, activation and proliferation of resident glomerular cells and matrix expansion. <b>Cross-communication</b> of intrinsic mesangial cells with invading immune cells is crucial for the fate of glomerular injury: progression to glomerulosclerosis or resolution and repair. The formation of free radicals, particularly of nitric oxide and superoxide, are key events that initiate redox-based signal transduction and gene expression.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, it has become {{increasingly}} apparent that signal transduction pathways are not merely linear cascades; they are organized into complex signaling networks that require high levels of regulation to generate precise and unique cell responses. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms by which signaling pathways cross-communicate remain poorly understood. Here we show that the Ras-binding protein Canoe (Cno) /AF- 6, a PDZ protein normally associated with cellular junctions, is a key modulator of Wingless (Wg) /Wnt, Ras-Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) and Notch (N) signaling pathways <b>cross-communication.</b> Our data show a repressive effect of Cno/AF- 6 on these three signaling pathways through physical interactions with Ras, N and the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled (Dsh), a key Wg effector.

Previous research by Milburn and Makemson on Vibrio harveyi suggested that in addition of the known biosynthesis of three well-characterized autoinducers, dozens of unknown molecules are also produced and released to the environment by V. harveyi. This study was performed using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry with the purpose of detection and characterization of the extracellular molecules produced by V. harveyi, and assessment of their relationship to QS.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Malonyl-CoA is the rate-limiting {{precursor}} {{involved in}} the chain elongation reaction {{of a range of}} value-added pharmaceuticals and biofuels. Development of malonyl-CoA responsive sensors holds great promise in overcoming critical pathway limitations and optimizing production titers and yields. By incorporating the Bacillus subtilis trans-regulatory protein FapR and the cis-regulatory element fapO, we constructed a hybrid promoter−regulatory system that responds to a broad range of intracellular malonyl-CoA concentrations (from 0. 1 to 1. 1 nmol/mgDW) in Escherichia coli. Elimination of regulatory protein and nonspecific DNA <b>cross-communication</b> leads to a sensor construct that exhibits malonyl-CoA-dependent linear phase kinetics with increased dynamic response range. The sensors reported in this study could potentially control and optimize carbon flux leading to robust biosynthetic pathways for the production of malonyl-CoA-derived compounds.
