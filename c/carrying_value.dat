40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>Carry</b> <b>Value</b> Transformation (CVT) {{is a model}} of Discrete Deterministic Dynamical System. In this paper, we have studied some {{interesting}} properties of CVT and proved that (1) the addition of any two non-negative integers is same as the sum of their CVT and XOR values. (2) While performing the repeated addition of CVT and XOR of two non-negative integers "a" and "b" (where a >= b), the number of iterations required to get either CVT= 0 or XOR= 0 is at most the length of "a" when both are expressed as binary strings.
