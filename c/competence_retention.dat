40|$|Background Immunization is {{recognized}} as one of the strategies to reduce vaccine preventable diseases. Competency related to immunization are consequently important for medical students and the medical school needs to assure the competence acquisition. Objective To assess competence related to immunization and its retention following lectures with simulations compared to lectures only. Methods A quasi-experimental study was conducted to the 5 th year students of University of Indonesia Medical School during the Child Adolescent Health Module in 2012 - 2013. The intervention group had lectures with simulations and the control group had lectures only. Immunization knowledge was assessed with a 30 multiple choice question (MCA) items performed before and after the module. <b>Competence</b> <b>retention</b> was assessed by MCQ (knowledge) and OSCE (skills) 2 - 6 months afterwards. Results Sixty eight subjects for each group with similar characteristics were analyzed. There was significant difference after module MCQ score between two groups. <b>Competence</b> <b>retention</b> in 2 - 6 months after module completion was better in intervention group, both for the knowledge (median MCQ score of 70. 00 (range 37 - 93) vs. mean score of 58. 01 (SD 12. 22), respectively; P< 0. 001) and skill (OSCE mean scores of 75. 21 (SD 10. 74) vs. 62. 62 (SD 11. 89), respectively; P < 0. 001). Proportion of subjects in the intervention group who passed both the MCQ and OSCE were also significantly greater. Conclusion Lectures with simulations are proved to be more effective in improving medical students’ immunization competence as well as its retention compared to lectures only approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{hallmark}} of sustainability {{is that it}} brings about long-term thinking and for HR portfolio building an establishment as an "employer of choice " is synonymous with sustainability. One of the prime tenets of sustainability is maximizing the positive benefits of a business operation for all stakeholders and precisely it should start with its internal people resources. There is a growing consensus that effective human capital is critical to an organization’s success and that the human resource functions must be strategically sustainable. The very word sustainability is a new and interesting topic for most HR professionals; {{at the same time}} the nexus between sustainability and human resources is an intangible one. In contemporary times human resources is under incredible pressure to ascertain its value, facing intense demands to create a more productive, results-oriented workforce. This review paper will try to revisit the “HR to do list ” and will explore an effectiveness mechanism to address the factors like employee engagement, performance, <b>competence</b> and <b>retention</b> as a powerful engine for propelling sustainability of the domain...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Progress testing is gaining ground rapidly {{after having been}} used almost exclusively in Maastricht and Kansas City. This increased popularity is understandable considering the intuitive appeal longitudinal testing has {{as a way to}} predict future competence and performance. Yet there are also important practicalities. Progress testing is longitudinal assessment in that it is based on subsequent equivalent, yet different, tests. The results of these are combined to determine the growth of functional medical knowledge for each student, enabling more reliable and valid decision making about promotion to a next study phase. The longitudinal integrated assessment approach has a demonstrable positive effect on student learning behaviour by discouraging binge learning. Furthermore, it leads to more reliable decisions as well as good predictive validity for future <b>competence</b> or <b>retention</b> of knowledge. Also, because of its integration and independence of local curricula, it {{can be used in a}} multi-centre collaborative production and administration framework, reducing costs, increasing efficiency and allowing for constant benchmarking. Practicalities include the relative unfamiliarity of faculty with the concept, the fact that remediation for students with a series of poor results is time consuming, the need to embed the instrument carefully into the existing assessment programme and the importance of equating subsequent tests t...|$|R

The COSECSA Oxford Orthopaedic Link (COOL) is a multi-country {{partnership}} programme that has delivered training in trauma management to nine sub-Saharan countries across a wide-cadre of health-workers using {{a model of}} "primary" courses delivered by UK instructors, followed by "cascading" courses led by local faculty. This study examines the impact on knowledge and clinical confidence among health-workers, and compares the performance of "cascading" and "primary" courses delivered in low-resource settings. Data was collated from 1030 candidates (119 Clinical Officers, 540 Doctors, 260 Nurses and 111 Medical Students) trained over 28 courses (9 "primary" and 19 "cascading" courses) in nine sub-Saharan countries between 2012 and 2013. Knowledge and clinical confidence of candidates were assessed using pre- and post-course MCQs and confidence matrix rating of clinical scenarios. Changes were measured in relation to co-variants of gender, job roles and primary versus cascading courses. Multivariate regression modelling and cost analysis was performed to {{examine the impact of}} primary versus cascading courses on candidates' performance. There was a significant improvement in knowledge (58 % to 77 %, p< 0. 05) and clinical confidence (68 % to 90 %, p< 0. 05) post-course. "Non-doctors" demonstrated a greater improvement in knowledge (22 %) and confidence (24 %) following the course (p< 0. 05). The degree of improvement of MCQ scores differed significantly, with the cascading courses (21 %) outperforming primary courses (15 %) (p< 0. 002). This is further supported by multivariate regression modelling where cascading courses are a strong predictor for improvement in MCQ scores (Coef= 4. 83, p< 0. 05). Trauma management training of health-workers plays a pivotal role in tackling the ever-growing trauma burden in Africa. Our study suggests cascading PTC courses may be an effective model in delivering trauma training in low-resource settings, however further studies are required to determine its efficacy in improving clinical <b>competence</b> and <b>retention</b> of knowledge and skills in the long term...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. This study aimed to {{investigate}} {{to what extent}} explicit instruction of vocabulary in collocations, using different techniques, develops collocational awareness in students, and whether such instruction has any enhancing effect on the retention of vocabulary. Eight intact groups of 160 EFL students of upper-intermediate proficiency level {{under the supervision of}} their regular course teachers participated in this study. Four of the groups were assigned as the experimental group and received vocabulary instruction focusing on collocations, while the remaining four were assigned as the control group and received instruction concentrating on single words. For this investigation, a vocabulary retention test, which was administered as the pre-and post-test, three tasks for the three treatment sessions, transcriptions of verbal processes of one of the experimental groups, and retrospective interviews with the participant instructors were used as data collection devices. The analyses of the qualitative data showed that the participants developed awareness {{to the extent that they}} could identify collocations in any text and categorize lexical collocations. The analyses of the quantitative data revealed that vocabulary instruction in collocations yielded far better results in terms of vocabulary retention. In the light of the findings of this study, explicit instruction of vocabulary in collocations, using different techniques, is highly recommended for developing collocational <b>competence</b> and better <b>retention</b> of vocabulary.

40|$|Background As in {{many other}} {{countries}} in sub-Saharan Arica, a shortage of well-trained health workers {{is one of the}} biggest barriers to quality health-care services in Ghana. Human resources for health deficits must therefore be addressed by improving the effectiveness and performance of the existing and future health workers through improved <b>retention,</b> <b>competence</b> and productivity. This PhD project was carried out in the framework of PERFORM, a health human resource management intervention that aimed at improving the performance of health workers by strengthening District Health Management Teams (DHMTs). Attrition and retention, both important factors of performance, were the main focus of this thesis, which were analysed from the management as well as the health workforce perspective. Methods The studies for this thesis were carried out in three districts of the Eastern Region in Ghana by using a mixed-methods approach. Data were collected during three research visits between May 2012 and July 2014 covering 13 months in total. The first study was a qualitative study on DHMT efficiency, which aimed to identify factors resulting in inefficient district health management practices. The second study was an explorative study that investigated current DHMT time use practices by doing daily retrospective time use interviews with all 21 district health managers in the districts over a three-month study period. In order to explore health worker motivation and job satisfaction and their effects on turnover and to also identify how district health managers may improve health workforce retention, 256 clinical health workers from several staff categories (doctors, nursing professionals, allied health workers, and pharmacists) were interviewed for the third study by employing a cross-sectional study design. Given the design of this study with only one measurement in time, turnover intention was used as a proxy of turnover. Results Financial constraints, human resource shortages in the DHMTs, low control over financial and human resources, little authority over district activities, and inadequate managing skills regarding planning and time management were identified as key management problems. However, district health managers have higher authority to allocate resources in their districts and to influence certain human resource aspects relevant for staff retention, such as promotions and study leaves. Managers used most of their working time for data management (16. 6...|$|R
