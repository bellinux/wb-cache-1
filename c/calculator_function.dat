5000|$|Beta mode {{is based}} on 8B/10B (from Gigabit Ethernet, also used for many other protocols). 8B/10B {{encoding}} involves expanding an 8 bit data word into 10 bits, with the extra bits after the 5th and 8th data bits. The partitioned data is sent through a Running Disparity <b>calculator</b> <b>function.</b> The Running Disparity calculator attempts to keep the number of 1s transmitted equal to 0s, thereby assuring a DC-balanced signal. Then, the different partitions are sent through a 5B/6B encoder for the 5 bit partition and a 3B/4B encoder for the 3 bit partition. This gives the packet the ability {{to have at least}} two 1s, ensuring synchronization of the PLL at the receiving end to the correct bit boundaries for reliable transfer. An additional function of the coding scheme is to support the arbitration for bus access and general bus control. This is possible due to the [...] "surplus" [...] symbols afforded by the 8B/10B expansion. (While 8-bit symbols can encode a maximum of 256 values, 10-bit symbols permit the encoding of up to 1024.)

40|$|Control Panel is a {{computer}} program that generates a graphical user interface (GUI) for computational simulation of a rocket-test-stand propellant mixer in which gaseous hydrogen (GH 2) is injected into flowing liquid hydrogen (LH 2) to obtain a combined flow having desired thermodynamic properties. The GUI is {{used in conjunction with}} software that models the mixer as a system having three inputs (the positions of the GH 2 and LH 2 inlet valves and an outlet valve) and three outputs (the pressure inside the mixer and the outlet flow temperature and flow rate). The user can specify valve characteristics and thermodynamic properties of the input fluids via userfriendly dialog boxes. The user can enter temporally varying input values or temporally varying desired output values. The GUI provides (1) a set-point <b>calculator</b> <b>function</b> for determining fixed valve positions that yield desired output values and (2) simulation functions that predict the response of the mixer to variations in the properties of the LH 2 and GH 2 and manual- or feedback-control variations in valve positions.

40|$|Background: The {{phenomenon}} of dust {{is a serious}} environmental problem in dry and semi dry regions. It has a destructive effect for the residents of such regions. Over two-thirds of Iran is in areas of dry and semi-dry climate conditions. Methods: In this research, dust fall measurements were taken in 41 stations across Yazd city using a marble dust collector (MDCO) located {{in different parts of}} the city. Next, the chemical characteristics of dust were determined using the XRF method. Finally, levels of dust fall across the 4 seasons of the year and status of the constituent elements of dust were determined through ArcGIS software and the Kriging technique. The Raster <b>calculator</b> <b>function</b> was used to make determinations of the effects of dust fall at each of the stations over the course of the year. Remote sensing system, along with maps taken from Landsat and the band combination technique were processed using ENVI software to extract vegetation density and building density maps of the studied region. Results: Results showed that spring had the highest level of dust fall with a value of 200 g/cm 2. In total, in 109 km 2 of the studied region had average dust fall of 110 g/m 2 that contributed to 12 057 tons of dust over Yazd city in 2015. The constituent elements of the dust fall according to decreasing amounts were as follows: Si>Ca>Al>C>Mg>Fe>K>Na>S>Ti>Cl>P>Mn>Sr>Zn. Conclusion: These results indicate accuracy of the Kriging technique for application in dust zoning. The factors of vegetation and green space were determined as effective on adsorbing dust. Increased building density and height of buildings also contributed to development of dust fall. Keywords: ArcGIS, ENVI, Remote sensing, Air pollution, Dust fall, Zonin...|$|E

In addition, "thinking process transmutation", discovered during this study, is concluded to be an inevitable and important by-product of calculator programming which significantly improves the user's overall analytic capacity.

40|$|Abstract: The {{presence}} of a city has {{a major impact on}} its local environment in terms of the heat and water balance of the area. In particular, it has been widely observed that the centre of the urban area tends to be of the order of 4 to 6 oC warmer than its rural surroundings (the urban heat island effect). This paper applied remote sensing data to map UHI phenomenon in Enugu urban. The selected area covered Enugu North; Enugu South; and Enugu East with a total area of 18704. 25 hectares. The urban heat island was determined by using the land surface temperature (LST) information from thermal infrared band (Band 6) of landsat image with 120 m pixel resolution. A subset of landsat TM acquired on October, 2008 that covered Enugu city was used in this study. Erdas imagine 8. 5 was the main software for image classification of urban land cover in 2008, while GIS-Grid <b>calculator</b> <b>functions</b> were used to derive land surface temperature. This study demonstrates the spatial variation of land surface temperature (LST) within urban blocks with temperature above 37 o Celsius. Urban impervious areas, highly populated areas, and areas with more anthropogenic activities were recognized to be areas with highest number of UHI- related pixels. The result revealed the effectiveness of remote sensing data application in analyzing UHI- land surface temperature relationship in Enugu...|$|R
