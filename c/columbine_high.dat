5|$|After the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School {{massacre}} on April 20, 1999, {{gun shows}} and background checks became {{a focus of}} national debate in the United States. Weeks after the Columbine shooting, Frank Lautenberg introduced a proposal to close the gun show loophole in federal law. It was passed in the Senate, but did not pass in the House.|$|E
5|$|Keyes' {{supporters}} {{formed a}} new third party, America's Independent Party, for his presidential candidacy. America's Independent Party gained the affiliation of a faction of California's American Independent Party. However, the AIP ticket, which had Brian Rohrbough, {{father of a}} victim of the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre, of Colorado as its vice presidential candidate, was only on the ballot in California, Colorado, and Florida.|$|E
5|$|Light {{guns were}} {{suppressed}} {{for a time}} in the United States after the 1999 <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre and its attendant controversy over video games and gun crime. Since the late 1980s light gun controllers have been generally manufactured to look like toys by painting them in bright colours. In Japan, which lacks the gun crime found in the United States and in which civilians cannot legally own guns, more realistic light guns are widely available.|$|E
50|$|Harlequin is {{the comedian}} and romantic male lead. He is a servant {{and the love}} {{interest}} of <b>Columbine.</b> His everlasting <b>high</b> spirits and cleverness work to save him from difficult situations into which his amoral behaviour leads {{during the course of}} the harlequinade. In some versions of the original Commedia dell'arte, Harlequin is able to perform magic feats. He never holds a grudge or seeks revenge.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1999 <b>Columbine,</b> Colorado <b>High</b> School Massacre, where 12 {{students}} and one teacher were killed and 24 were injured by two senior student shooters, Congressman Rothman authored and had enacted into law [...] "The Secure Our Schools Act," [...] (2000) which provided federal hundreds of millions of matching funds to communities across his district and across the country so that schools could keep weapons and strangers out of schools. Under the Act, towns can apply for funds to be used for school security assessments, security training of personnel and students, and for improved coordination with law enforcement officials as well as to install metal detectors, locks, and improved lighting.|$|R
60|$|Maples and sycamores and oaks were in full foliage, {{and their}} bright greens contrasted softly {{with the dark}} shine of the pines. Through the spaces between brown tree trunks and the white-spotted holes of the sycamores gleamed the amber water of the creek. Always there was murmur of little rills and the musical dash of little rapids. On the surface of still, shady pools trout broke to make ever-widening ripples. Indian paintbrush, so brightly carmine in color, lent touch of fire to the green banks, and under the oaks, in cool dark nooks where mossy bowlders lined the stream, there were stately nodding yellow <b>columbines.</b> And <b>high</b> on the rock ledges shot up the {{wonderful}} mescal stalks, beginning to blossom, some with tints of gold and others with tones of red.|$|R
5|$|On May 4, 1999, {{following}} the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre and increasing news media {{reports on the}} effects on violent films, games, and other media on society, the United States Senate Commerce committee held a hearing about Hollywood's marketing of films to youths. The committee focused specifically on horror films. The opening scene of Scream featuring the murder of Barrymore's character was shown to the committee {{as an example of}} negative media which may be viewed by children.|$|E
5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.|$|E
5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG!, {{abbreviated}} SCMRPG!, is a role-playing {{video game}} created by Danny Ledonne and released in April 2005. The game recreates the 1999 <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School shootings near Littleton, Colorado. Players assume {{the roles of}} gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and act out the massacre, with flashbacks relating parts of Harris and Klebold's past experiences. The game begins {{on the day of}} the shootings and follows Harris and Klebold after their suicides to fictional adventures in perdition.|$|E
60|$|Wade {{was now in}} passionate strife {{with the}} {{encroaching}} mood that was a mocker of his idealism. Many times during the strange, long martyrdom of his penance had he faced this crisis, only {{to go down to}} defeat before elemental instincts. His soul was steeped in gloom, but his intelligence had not yet succumbed to passion. The beauty of Columbine's character and the nobility of Moore's were not illusions to Wade. They were true. These two were of the finest fiber of human nature. They loved. They represented youth and hope--a progress through the ages toward a better race. Wade believed in the good to be, in the future of men. Nevertheless, all that was fine and worthy in Columbine and Moore was to go unrewarded, unfulfilled, because of the selfish pride of an old man and the evil passion of the son. It was a conflict as old as life. Of what avail were <b>Columbine's</b> <b>high</b> sense of duty, Moore's fine manhood, the many victories they had won over the headlong and imperious desires of love? What avail were Wade's good offices, his spiritual teaching, his eternal hope in the order of circumstances working out to good? These beautiful characteristics of virtue were not so strong as the unchangeable passion of old Belllounds and the vicious depravity of his son. Wade could not imagine himself a god, proving that the wages of sin was death. Yet in his life he had often been an impassive destiny, meting out terrible consequences. Here he was incalculably involved. This was the cumulative end of years of mounting plots, tangled and woven into the web of his pain and his remorse and his ideal. But hope was dying. That was his strife-realization against the morbid clairvoyance of his mind. He could not help Jack Belllounds to be a better man. He could not inspire the old rancher to a forgetfulness of selfish and blinded aims. He could not prove to Moore the truth of the reward that came from unflagging hope and unassailable virtue. He could not save Columbine with his ideals.|$|R
40|$|Notwithstanding the {{historical}} {{significance of the}} Columbine shooting, recent attention has shifted to college campuses following high-profile massacres at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University. In this article, the authors compile and discuss the recom-mendations most often put forth by task force reports published {{in the wake of}} these epi-sodes. Although some proposals can increase the security and well-being of the campus community, others may be inappropriate and even carry unacceptable negative conse-quences. The problem rests partly in the implicit assumption that effective strategies for secondary schools will seamlessly translate to a college environment. However, campus shootings are not just <b>Columbine</b> graduated to <b>higher</b> education, as differences in assailant motivation and setting warrant divergent strategies for prevention and response...|$|R
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Eric Harris' mother wakes him on April 20, 1999. Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' {{basement}} to plot {{a series of}} bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> and express rage at those they perceive to be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 1999, <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School {{students}} Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold {{shot dead}} 12 {{students and a}} teacher and wounded 21 others, before committing suicide. In {{the aftermath of the}} school shooting, the band were widely reported to have influenced the killings; early media reports alleged that the shooters were fans, and were wearing the group's T-shirts during the massacre. Although these claims were later proven to be false, speculation in national media and among the public continued to blame Manson's music and imagery for inciting Harris and Klebold. Later reports revealed that the two were not fansâ€”and, in fact, had disliked the band's music. Despite this, Marilyn Manson (as well as other bands and forms of entertainment, such as movies and video games) were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures.|$|E
5|$|Since 1953, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma have {{commissioned}} {{a new work}} for wind band to be premiered at almost every National Intercollegiate Band concert. This program was begun {{to add to the}} wind repertoire under the direction of Grand President Hugh McMillen, and is the longest-running commissioning project in the United States. A number of these commissioned compositions have garnered national acclaim, including Robert Russell Bennett's Symphonic Songs for Band and Karel Husa's Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra. In the years following the start of the national commissioning program, local chapters have begun to commission new band works themselves, such as Frank Ticheli's An American Elegy, commissioned by the Alpha Iota chapter in memory of the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of the boys in the film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of a}} movie-industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E
5|$|Before the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre, {{perpetrator}} Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails songs {{multiple times}} in his journal. Klebold heavily identified with the protagonist of The Downward Spiral {{as a symbol of}} his own depression. On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J. Chaput. Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails' label-mate Marilyn Manson, and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to the environment that made tragedies like Columbine possible. The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry's marketing practices to minors.|$|E
5|$|In 1998â€“99, {{with the}} {{addition}} of the Nashville Predators to the league, the NHL realigned their divisions and the Colorado Avalanche were put in the new Northwest Division. Despite a slow 2â€“6â€“1 start, Colorado finished with a 44â€“28â€“10 record for 98 points, won the Northwest Division and finished second in the Western Conference. Between January 10 and February 7, the Avalanche had their longest winning streak ever with 12 games. Following the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre, Colorado postponed their first two playoff games to a later date; they would wear patches in honor of the Columbine victims on their jerseys during the playoffs. After defeating both the San Jose Sharks and the Detroit Red Wings in six games in the first two rounds, Colorado met the Presidents' Trophy-winning Dallas Stars in the Western Conference Finals, where they lost in seven games. Peter Forsberg, the playoffs leading scorer with 24 points (8 goals and 16 assists), was again elected to the league's first All-Star team and Chris Drury won the Calder Memorial Trophy for the best rookie of the season. Together with Milan Hejduk, both were elected for the NHL All-Rookie Team {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School {{massacre}} was {{a school}} shooting that occurred on April 20, 1999, at <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School in Columbine, an unincorporated area of Jefferson County in the American state of Colorado. In addition to the shootings, the complex and highly planned attack involved a fire bomb to divert firefighters, propane tanks converted to bombs placed in the cafeteria, 99 explosive devices, and car bombs. The perpetrators, senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 12 students and one teacher. They injured 21 additional people, and three more were injured while attempting to escape the school. The pair subsequently committed suicide.|$|E

25|$|On July 20, 2012, not {{far from}} the {{location}} of the aforementioned massacre at <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School, 12 people were killed and 70 people were injured in the 2012 Aurora shooting, when James Eagan Holmes, a former neuroscience doctoral student, walked into an Aurora, Colorado Cinemark movie theater with multiple firearms and tear gas grenades, and started shooting at random at people trying to escape during a midnight Thursday showing of The Dark Knight Rises, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. It was the deadliest shooting in Colorado since the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre and, in terms of both the dead and wounded in the number of casualties, was the largest single mass shooting in U.S. history.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to expressed {{concerns over the}} causes of the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre and other school shootings, some schools have renewed existing anti-bullying policies, in addition to adopting a zero tolerance approach to possession of weapons and threatening behavior by students.|$|E
25|$|The Harris {{family lived}} in rented {{accommodations}} {{for the first three}} years that they lived in the Littleton area. During this time, Eric met Dylan Klebold.

25|$|At 11:10a.m., Harris and Klebold arrived {{separately}} at <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School. Harris {{parked his}} {{vehicle in the}} junior student parking lot, by the south entrance, and Klebold parked in the adjoining senior student parking lot, by the west entrance. The school cafeteria, their primary bomb target, with its long outside window-wall and ground-level doors, was between their parking spots.|$|E
25|$|Clinton {{continued}} to push further regulations of firearms {{in his second}} term, especially after the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre. Little success {{came out of his}} efforts as Republicans controlled congress during this time, and a majority opposed any further gun control. The House voted to overturn the assault weapons ban in 1996, but the Senate failed to take up the issue.|$|E
25|$|There was {{controversy}} {{over whether the}} perpetrators should be memorialized. Some were opposed, saying that it glorified murderers, while others argued that the perpetrators were also victims. Atop a hill near <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School, crosses were erected for Harris and Klebold along with those for the people they killed, but the father of Daniel Rohrbough cut them down, saying that murderers should not be memorialized {{in the same place}} as victims.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of Tuesday, April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold placed a small fire bomb in a field about three miles south of <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School, and two {{miles south of the}} fire station. Set to explode at 11:14a.m., the bomb was {{intended}} as a diversion to draw firefighters and emergency personnel away from the school (it partially detonated and caused a small fire, which was quickly extinguished by the fire department).|$|E
25|$|During the 2000s, Enfield High School has {{restructured}} {{and updated}} its security and discipline policies.

The pair were widely reported as being fans of German bands KMFDM and Rammstein, {{but the majority of}} blame was directed at Marilyn Manson.|$|E
25|$|Duffy {{indicates}} that the screenplay was inspired by personal experience, while living in Los Angeles. Initially {{regarded as one of}} the hottest scripts in Hollywood, the movie had a troubled production and was finally given a limited theatrical release of only five theaters for one week due to the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School massacre. It was met with poor critical reviews; however, the film ultimately grossed about $50 million in domestic video sales and developed a large cult following. The movie was followed by a 2009 sequel, , and a third film is currently in development.|$|E
