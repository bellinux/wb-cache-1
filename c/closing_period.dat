5|$|By the 38th lap, {{drivers who}} made their stops during the safety car period entered into their {{electrical}} energy conservation phase. Andretti chose {{to allow their}} drivers {{to remain on the}} circuit {{for as long as possible}} and their strategy allowed Félix da Costa and Frijns to catch and overtake d'Ambrosio and Turvey for the fifth and sixth positions in the event's <b>closing</b> <b>period.</b> Félix da Costa then attempted to catch the fourth-placed Prost but was unable to get close to him. As the field began the final lap, di Grassi, Heidfeld and Prost had five percent of usage electrical energy remaining and Buemi was unchallenged for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. Di Grassi finished second, ahead of Heidfeld in third. Prost was fourth and Félix da Costa fifth. Frijns, d'Ambrosio, Turvey, Engel and Sarrazin rounded out the top ten points-scoring positions. Piquet, Carroll filled the next two positions. Bird was fast enough to unlap himself by passing the race leaders, despite spinning his tyres at the circuit's low-speed exit turns, and finished in 13th. Duval and Rosenqvist were the last of the classified finishers. It was Buemi's first victory of the season and the seventh of his career. There were three lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Buemi led once for a total of 20 laps, more than any other competitor. Of the two other retirements, Vergne stopped with an overheating battery, and Abt lost all electrical energy in his car after 34 laps.|$|E

25|$|Räikkönen {{was handed}} a {{reprimand}} from the stewards over his late race contact with Magnussen while they elected {{not to take}} any action over the first lap incident between Button and Pérez. Magnussen was adamant that Räikkönen was {{to blame for the}} incident, saying that he drove defensively but that the driver made an overtaking attempt, while Räikkönen admitted following his contact with Chilton earlier in the race, he was willing to attempt aggressive manoeuvres. Pérez blamed Button for his retirement, saying that he was battling his teammate Hülkenberg and did not expect Button to be in the position he placed himself in {{because of the lack of}} space for another car. Button made no comment on the incident. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner reckoned that despite Vettel's turbocharger failing, the driver would not allow his frustrations to get the better of him, and stated Ricciardo's challenge on Hamilton in the event's <b>closing</b> <b>period</b> was an indication that the approach the team used was correct but noted a realistic overtake was not possible unless the challenged driver made an error.|$|E

Unhindered in the final eight laps, Hamilton opened up a healthy {{advantage}} over Vettel and crossed the start/finish line after 60 laps to win the race. Vettel finished second in his best result of the season, 13.534 seconds behind, and successfully held off teammate Ricciardo and Alonso in the race's <b>closing</b> <b>period.</b> Massa finished fifth. Vergne's five-second time penalty did not affect his final finishing position of sixth, and was ahead of Pérez, Räikkönen and Hülkenberg. Magnussen rounded out the top-ten points-scoring positions. Bottas, Maldonado, Grosjean, Kvyat and Ericsson filled the next five places with Marussia teammates Bianchi and Chilton the last of the classified finishers. It was Hamilton's seventh victory of the season, his second in Singapore, and the 29th of his career. There were four lead changes in the race; three drivers reached the front of the field. Hamilton led three times for a total of 58 laps, more than any other driver.|$|E
25|$|Massa {{made his}} pit stop from third on lap 24, and emerged in fifth. Hamilton {{received}} instructions for an engine mode change and Rosberg entered the pit lane from {{the lead on}} the next lap and handed the lead to Hamilton. Bottas made his stop on the same lap and rejoined alongside Vettel on the start/finish straight but was forced wide, allowing Magnussen to pass him. Hamilton took his pit stop on the 26th lap and handed back first place to teammate Rosberg. Bottas also fell behind Pérez but re-passed the latter going into the Rettifilo chicane. Hamilton's race engineer Peter Bonnington told him over the radio to remain at least {{two and a half}} seconds behind teammate Rosberg to gain the slipstream advantage without losing downforce and conserve tyre life for an attack in the race's <b>closing</b> <b>period.</b> Hamilton was aware from previous experience earlier in the season that the method to pass a driver was to do so when tyre grip was optimal otherwise {{it would not have been}} possible to draw close enough to affect a passing manoeuvre. He recorded the fastest lap of the race at that point to move within seven-tenths of a second behind teammate Rosberg by the start of lap 28, causing debate among the Mercedes pit lane members.|$|E

25|$|Entering the event's <b>closing</b> <b>period,</b> Buemi {{had closed}} up to Bird and {{teammate}} Prost; the latter did not defend his position which meant Buemi took over sixth place. Vergne was handed a five-second time penalty for his pit stop release and Buemi responded by allowing Vergne {{to pull away}} slightly. Rosenqvist opened up a two-second lead over di Grassi (who had battery temperature issues). The second Mahindra of Heidfeld had closed up to di Grassi who responded by using FanBoost to defend second place. Rosenqvist maintained the lead {{for the rest of}} the race and crossed the start/finish line after completing 44 laps to secure his (and Mahindra's) first victory in Formula E. Di Grassi finished second, 2.2 seconds behind, with Heidfeld securing his third consecutive third-place finish. López finished fourth, with Buemi fifth on the road. Prost, Abt and Bird were in the next three positions while Vergne's five-second time penalty dropped him from fifth to ninth. Engel was the last of the points-scoring finishers in tenth. Turvey, Sarrazin, Piquet, d'Ambrosio and Carroll filled the next five places with Duval, Félix da Costa and Frijns the last of the classified runners. There was one lead change in the race; two drivers reached the front of the field. Rosenqvist led once for a total of 23 laps, more than any other driver.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasted 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session was delayed by twenty-five minutes following crashes in practice for the Guia Race of Macau and the CTM Touring Car Cup support races. When the session did start, Blomqvist came out on top with a lap of two minutes and 11.922 seconds having held the lead throughout most of qualifying, 0.115 seconds faster than Giovinazzi. Cassidy improved in qualifying's <b>closing</b> <b>period</b> and was the best placed rookie in third, with Auer battling Blomqvist early in the session and ended it fourth. King finished the session in fifth place on his final timed lap while early leader Verstappen secured sixth. Latifi improved late in qualifying to end up seventh in front of Buller. Rosenqvist and Ocon who used two new tyres to begin qualifying rounded out the top ten. Coletti was the fastest driver not {{to reach the top}} ten despite running fifth in the opening minutes of the session. Following him were Gelael, Antonio Fuoco with Santino Ferrucci provisionally joining Fuoco on the grid's seventh row. Félix Serrallés was next up ahead of Pommer, Álex Palou, Kanamaru, Merhi and Gustavo Menezes. The rest of the order was completed by Yamashita, Goddard, Wells, Cao, Calderón, MacLeod, Wing Chung Chang and Takaboshi. The session passed relatively smoothly with only Cao crashing into the barriers at Fisherman's bend and Calderón impacting the wall at Police corner. For missing red light that ordered them to enter the weighbridge during first practice, Ocon and Verstappen were each given two-place grid penalties, and MacLeod was penalised one grid position for illegally crossing the pit exit line.|$|E

40|$|AbstractManaging {{incidental}} losses {{associated with}} liquid slurry applications during <b>closed</b> <b>periods</b> has significant cost and policy implications {{and the environmental}} data required to review such a measure are difficult to capture due to storm dependencies. Over four years (2010 – 2014) in five intensive agricultural catchments, this study used high-resolution total and total reactive phosphorus (TP and TRP), total oxidised nitrogen (TON) and suspended sediment (SS) concentrations with river discharge data to investigate the magnitude and timing of nutrient losses. A large dataset of storm events (defined as 90 th percentile discharges), and associated flow-weighted mean (FWM) nutrient concentrations and TP/SS ratios, was used to indicate when losses were indicative of residual or incidental nutrient transfers. The beginning of the slurry <b>closed</b> <b>period</b> was reflective of incidental and residual transfers with high storm FWM P (TP and TRP) concentrations, with some catchments also showing elevated storm TP:SS ratios. This pattern diminished {{at the end of}} the <b>closed</b> <b>period</b> in all catchments. Total oxidised N behaved similarly to P during storms in the poorly drained catchments and revealed a long lag time in other catchments. Low storm FWM P concentrations and TP:SS ratios during the weeks following the <b>closed</b> <b>period</b> suggests that nutrients either weren't applied during this time (best times chosen) or that they were applied to less risky areas (best places chosen). For other periods such as late autumn and during wet summers, where storm FWM P concentrations and TP:SS ratios were high, it is recommended that an augmentation of farmer knowledge of soil drainage characteristics with local and detailed current and forecast soil moisture conditions will help to strengthen existing regulatory frameworks to avoid storm driven incidental nutrient transfers...|$|R

Piquet felt it was not fair for different punishments to exist for the same penalty and was frustrated, complaining of inconsistency from the stewards. He warned drivers would become quickly disenchanted and believed stewards would not be taken seriously in future races. Piquet advocated for more people to observe the track, install more cameras and fit a GPS system in all cars. D'Ambrosio felt aggrieved over the battle between his teammate Duval in the race's <b>closing</b> <b>period,</b> saying the events were [...] "a {{little bit of a}} pity" [...] and was unsure whether it was a misunderstanding. Duval insisted the battle was firm but fair, saying he gave d'Ambrosio room but would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him: [...] "As you have seen in the past though we have had fights {{and most of the time}} I was really gentle, and this weekend I was in this position where I was competitive and I had less energy available so I fought." [...] Dragon's team principal Jay Penske revealed the drivers were allowed to battle each other cleanly but if one of them eliminated the other from contention, that driver would be required to miss the following race.|$|E
500|$|Both Dragon {{drivers were}} {{informed}} on their radios {{that they had}} to ensure that both cars reached the finish of the race while Duval was told that d'Ambrosio had more electrical energy to use. Duval reduced the time deficit to teammate d'Ambrosio and attempted an overtaking manoeuvre on the latter for sixth place, causing light contact between the two cars and got ahead of his teammate. Turvey lost eighth position when he was overtaken by Abt. On the final lap, Bird was forced wide into the wall by d'Ambrosio, causing him to retire. Despite braking difficulties on his second car which rendered him unable to brake in a straight line, Buemi crossed the finish line after 37 laps to win the race. Vergne finished second, 2.9 seconds behind, with di Grassi in third, Prost fourth, Piquet fifth and Duval sixth. Abt used the rest of his electrical energy to move ahead of d'Ambrosio and claim seventh. Turvey's car was overheating and took ninth with López rounding out the points scoring positions in tenth. Félix da Costa and Sarrazin finished in 11th and 12th. Evans was in a points-scoring position but reduced his pace in the event's <b>closing</b> <b>period,</b> dropping him to 13th.

It was Buemi's third victory of the season, the ninth of his career, and he became the first driver to win three consecutive races in Formula E history.

A shakedown session {{was held on}} the Friday before the event where Buemi recorded the fastest lap time of one minute and 30.152 seconds, one second faster than Rosenqvist and Jean-Éric Vergne in second and third. The first practice session was run in cool weather conditions with low sun because dawn had broken through one hour before the 45-minute period began. Di Grassi used the maximum [...] given to him during a qualifying simulation lap and was fastest {{with a time of}} one minute and 21.923 seconds, almost two-tenths of a second faster than Prost in second. Buemi was third-fastest, ahead of Vergne and Félix da Costa. Jérôme d'Ambrosio, Rosenqvist, Mitch Evans, Piquet, and Stéphane Sarrazin rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The full course yellow flag was necessitated when Loïc Duval stopped his car after five minutes. Evans spun and ran wide at the first turn late in the session, while López damaged his car's suspension after colliding with the turn 11 barrier, causing him to spend most of the session in the pit lane for repairs, but further damage was caused with another hit in the session's <b>closing</b> <b>period.</b> In the second practice session, Buemi was fastest with a lap of one minute and 20.599 seconds; Rosenqvist was second and Vergne third. Oliver Turvey was fourth-fastest, Duval was fifth, and Daniel Abt sixth. Piquet, Félix da Costa, di Grassi and Heidfeld followed in the top ten. The session was ended prematurely with three minutes remaining when Bird lost control of the rear end of his car, slid into the turn eight barrier, which heavily damaged his vehicle's back-end, and stopped on the circuit.|$|E

6000|$|The {{intellectual}} homage of {{more than}} half a century has assigned to Edmund Burke a lofty pre-eminence in the aristocracy of mind, and we may justly assume succeeding ages will confirm the judgment which the Past has thus pronounced. His biographical history is so popularly known, that it is almost superfluous to record it in this brief introduction. It may, however, be summed up in a few sentences. He was born at Dublin in 1730. His father was an attorney in extensive practice, and his mother's maiden name was Nogle, whose family was respectable, and resided near Castletown, Roche, where Burke himself received five years of boyish education under the guidance of a rustic schoolmaster. He was entered at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1746, but only remained there until 1749. In 1753 he became a member of the Middle Temple, and maintained himself chiefly by literary toil. Bristol did itself the honour to elect him for her representative in 1774, and after years of splendid usefulness and mental triumph, as an orator, statesman, and patriot, he retired to his favourite retreat, Beaconsfield, in Buckinghamshire, where he died on July 9th, 1797. He was buried here; and the pilgrim who visits the grave of this illustrious man, when he gazes on the simple tomb which marks the earthly resting?place of himself, brother, son, and widow, may feelingly recall his own pathetic wish uttered some forty years before, in London:--"I would rather sleep in the southern corner of a little country churchyard, than in the tomb of the Capulets. I should like, however, that my dust should mingle with kindred dust. The good old expression, 'family burying?ground,' has something pleasing in it, at least to me." [...] Alluding to his approaching dissolution, he thus speaks, in a letter addressed to a relative of his earliest schoolmaster:--"I have been at Bath these four months for no purpose, and am therefore to be removed to my own house at Beaconsfield to-morrow, to be nearer a habitation more permanent, humbly and fearfully hoping that my better part may find a better mansion." [...] It is a source of deep thankfulness for those who reverence the genius and eloquence of this great man, to state, that Burke's religion was that of the Cross, and to find him speaking of the [...] "Intercession" [...] of our Redeeming Lord, as [...] "what he had long sought with unfeigned anxiety, and to which he looked with trembling hope." [...] The commencing paragraph in his Will also authenticates the genuine character of his personal Christianity. [...] "According to the ancient, good, and laudable custom, of which my heart and understanding recognise the propriety, I BEQUEATH MY SOUL TO GOD, HOPING FOR HIS MERCY ONLY THROUGH THE MERITS OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST. My body I desire to be buried in the church of Beaconsfield, near to the bodies of my dearest brother, and my dearest son, in all humility praying, that as we have lived in perfect unity together, we may together have part in the resurrection of the just." [...] (In the [...] "Epistolary Correspondence of the Right Hon. Edmund Burke and Dr. French Laurence" [...] (Rivingtons, London, 1827), are several touching allusions to that master?grief which threw a mournful shadow over the <b>closing</b> <b>period</b> of Burke's life. In one letter the anxious father says, [...] "The fever continues much as it was. He sleeps in a very uneasy way from time to time?-but his strength decays visibly, and his voice is, in a manner, gone. But God is all?sufficient?-and surely His goodness and his mother's prayers may do much" [...] (page 30). Again, in another communication addressed to his revered correspondent, we find a beautiful allusion to his departed son, which involves his belief in that most soothing doctrine of the Church,--a recognition of souls in the kingdom of the Beatified. [...] "Here I am in the last retreat of hunted infirmity; I am indeed 'aux abois.' But, as through the whole of a various and long life I have been more indebted than thankful to Providence, so I am now singularly so, in being dismissed, as hitherto I appear to be, so gently from life, AND SENT TO FOLLOW THOSE WHO IN COURSE OUGHT TO HAVE FOLLOWED ME, WHOM, I TRUST, I SHALL YET, IN SOME INCONCEIVABLE MANNER, SEE AND KNOW; AND BY WHOM I SHALL BE SEEN AND KNOWN" [...] (pages 53, 54).|$|E
