40|$|Cytological {{parameters}} {{were studied}} in 18 fibroepithelial tumours {{of the breast}} including 8 benign phyllodes, 1 malignant phyllodes, and 9 fibroadenomas between 1999 to 2001. Cytology smears were studied without knowledge of previous <b>cytodiagnosis</b> by 3 different observers. Histopathologic parameters were studied in 18 fibroepithelial tumours by 3 observers. Cyto-histological correlation was carried out. Cytological criteria by Chinoy et al (1999) were utilized to give revised <b>cytodiagnosis.</b> Initial <b>cytodiagnosis</b> and revised <b>cytodiagnosis</b> were correlated with histopathological diagnosis. 8 / 9 cases of fibroadenoma (88 &#x 0025;) studied were correctly diagnosed on FNAC after semiquantitative team approach as opposite to 44 &#x 0025; initial <b>cytodiagnosis.</b> Cytological distinction between benign phyllodes and fibroadenoma was improved after semiquantitative approach to various parameters.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>cytodiagnosis</b> in necropsy practice. METHODS [...] Fifty three focal lesions from 46 necropsies were assessed by direct smears taken from the lesions. The smears were air-dried and stained by a modified Giemsa technique, with two cases having supplementary histochemistry. All of the slides were assessed independently before review of the necropsy histology. RESULTS [...] Of the 35 malignant neoplasms, 34 were correctly identified as malignant and 14 of these were characterised precisely. Three of the four benign neoplasms were recognised as neoplastic. One was characterised precisely. Three of the four infected cases revealed the relevant microorganisms. Seven of the other 10 focal non-neoplastic lesions were correctly diagnosed as non-neoplastic. Only two cases proved unsatisfactory for <b>cytodiagnosis.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Direct smear <b>cytodiagnosis</b> is quick, cheap and technically simple. Tissue autolysis may account for some difficulty in assessing particular tissues, but this should diminish with experience.

40|$|Since Papanicolaou's {{first report}} in 1945, urinary <b>cytodiagnosis</b> has been highly {{evaluated}} {{as one of}} the diagnostic aids of the urinary tract tumors. Clinical application of this method has been naturally limited to the tumors of urothelial origin, but some investigators advocated its usefulness even in renal cell carcinoma and prostatic cancer. Besides, its role in the screening of occupational bladder cancer and in the postoperative follow-up examination of the urinary tract tumors have been mentioned. The author performed cytologic study of urine in 166 patients hospitalized in Urology Department in order to investigate incidence of the pseudonegatives in the tumor group and of the pseudopositives in the non-tumor group. In bladder tumor cases, cytological findings were correlatively studied with duration of symptoms, size and shape of tumor surface, location of tumor, histological malignancy and frequency of <b>cytodiagnosis.</b> Since Papanicolaou's report, over-all pseudopositive rate is 11. 1 %, namely diagnostic accuracy being 98. 9 %, in the non-tumorous diseases; whereas pseudonegative rate is 33 %, diagnostic accuracy being 67 %, in the tumorous diseases. Cytological diagnosis was made on the early morning urine samples of three consequtive days. The patients consisted of 16 non-tumorous (69 %) and 7 tumorous diseases (31 %). Pseudopositive rate was only 0. 3 %. It was a case of essential renal hematuria. Nineteen of 29 bladder tumors showed positive <b>cytodiagnosis</b> (66 %). Duration of symptoms {{had nothing to do with}} the positive rate. Large tumor, sessile tumor, infiltrative tumor, or tumor with necrotic surface gave high incidence of positive <b>cytodiagnosis.</b> Grading of malignancy correlated well with incidence of positive findings. As to location, tumors at the dome or lateral wall showed the higher positive rate than those around the ureteral orifices. Of course, the more extensive was the tumor, the higher rate of positive cytology was noticed. Out of the tumor group, 40 % was positive on all the occasions, 60 % more than twice, and 66 % at least once. Tumors of the renal pelvis and the ureter always showed high frequency of the positive. Value of <b>cytodiagnosis</b> in these two neoplasms was definitely demonstrated. No malignant cells in urine could be detected in renal cell tumor, testicular tumor, and penile cancer. This was the same in carcinoma of the prostate even after the massage. As conclusion, <b>cytodiagnosis</b> of urine is useful especially in the urinary tract tumors located in the areas beyond the reach of cystoscope, namely in the renal pelvis, ureter and diverticulum of the bladder. It is also applicable {{as one of the}} postoperative follow-up methods of the urinary tract tumors...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aspiration of serous {{cavities}} is {{a simple}} and relatively non-invasive technique to achieve diagnosis. Cytologic evaluation of body cavity fluid is diagnostically challenging. METHODS: A total of 150 fluid specimens were examined for conventional cytological smear (CS) and cell block method (CB). Out of 150 fluids, 79 were pleural fluid, 69 were ascitic fluid and 2 pericardial fluid. Each fluid specimen was divided in two equal parts: one part was subjected to conventional smear technique, while the other part was subjected to 10 % alcohol-acetic acid-formalin cell block technique. Overall morphological details, cellularity, architecture, nuclear and cytoplasmic details were studied in both CS and CB techniques. RESULTS: In this study, {{the utility of the}} CB method in the <b>cytodiagnosis</b> of malignant effusions was found to be highly significant as compared to the CS method.

This study investigated the accuracy of FNA cytology of salivary gland lesions by correlation between histology and cytology. MethodsOne hundred and thirty-one archived salivary gland FNA specimens collected between January 1994 and December 2002 from 131 patients were correlated with histopathology findings. The major reasons for false-negative and false-positive results in cytologic diagnosis were determined. ResultsConsidering the results of histopathology as the diagnostic standard, the sensitivity of FNA cytology in diagnosing malignancy was 74 % (17 / 23) after excluding two cases which had a <b>cytodiagnosis</b> of suspicion of malignancy. Excluding eight cases that had a <b>cytodiagnosis</b> of suspicion of malignancy, the diagnostic specificity was 99 % (97 / 98). There were six false-negative and one false-positive cases.

40|$|Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) cytologic {{diagnosis of}} {{acute myeloid leukemia}} involving the kidney has rarely been reported, but acute leukemia with cytologic features suggestive of megakaryocytic differentiation has not been described before. CASE: An 8 -month-old male presented with an abdominal swelling, bilateral cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and enlarged left epididymis. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a space-occupying lesion in the liver and bilateral enlargement of the kidneys. FNA smears from the right kidney and right submandibular lymph node showed numerous blast cells. Since rare blast cells were positive for myeloperoxidase, a <b>cytodiagnosis</b> of involvement by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was made. However, following the hematologic diagnosis of acute megakaryo-blastic leukemia (M 7) from peripheral blood and bone marrow smear examination, FNA smears were reviewed. There were cytoplasmic blebs or protrusions in the blast cells and cytologic features suggestive of their differentiation toward micro-megakaryocytes and mega-karyocytes. There was also evidence of shedding of platelets, including numerous giant platelets. The reviewed FNA <b>cytodiagnosis</b> was suggestive of AML (M 7).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of uterine cancer screening by analyzing the accuracy of cervical and endometrial cytodiagnoses as screening methods. STUDY DESIGN: During the year of April 1, 1991 -March 31, 1992, 186, 161 and 5, 697 women underwent cervical and endometrial cytodiagnoses, respectively, and their cytodiagnostic results were computer registered at the Miyagi Cancer Society. By comparison of these examinees with 753 cancer patients who were registered at the regional cancer registry between 1991 and 1993, 133 individuals who were assumed to be identical between the two systems were selected, and of these cases, 83 patients, including test-positive cases, were found within one year. The sensitivity and specificity of each screening method were investigated. RESULTS: Regarding examinees diagnosed as having cancer by the same month in the following year after diagnosis on screening as false negative, the sensitivity, specificity and false negative rates of cervical <b>cytodiagnosis</b> were 94. 7 %, 98. 9 % and 5. 3 %, respectively, and those of endometrial <b>cytodiagnosis</b> were 83. 3 %, 96. 7 % and 16. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: The cytological {{examinations}} of serous effusions have been well-accepted, {{and a positive}} diagnosis is often considered as a definitive diagnosis. It helps in staging, prognosis {{and management of the}} patients in malignancies and also gives information about various inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. Diagnostic problems arise in everyday practice to differentiate reactive atypical mesothelial cells and malignant cells by the routine conventional smear (CS) method. Aims: To compare the morphological features of the CS method with those of the cell block (CB) method and also to assess the utility and sensitivity of the CB method in the <b>cytodiagnosis</b> of pleural effusions. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in the cytology section of the Department of Pathology. Sixty pleural fluid samples were subjected to diagnostic evaluation for over a period of 20 months. Along with the conventional smears, cell blocks were prepared by using 10 % alcohol-formalin as a fixative agent. Statistical analysis with the ′z test′ was performed to identify the cellularity, using the CS and CB methods. Mc. Naemer′s χ 2 test was used to identify the additional yield for malignancy by the CB method. Results: Cellularity and additional yield for malignancy was 15 % more by the CB method. Conclusions: The CB method provides high cellularity, better architectural patterns, morphological features and an additional yield of malignant cells, and thereby, increases the sensitivity of the <b>cytodiagnosis</b> when compared with the CS method...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cytodiagnosis</b> {{has been}} {{accepted}} {{as one of the}} diagncstic measures of bladder tumor for many years. Its clinical value, however, has not been so highly esteemed in urology as compared with other fields, probably because of easy endoscopy and transurethral biopsy, and obscure criteria of malignancy in transitional cells. Cytological examination is valuable and even necessary for screening of industrial bladder cancers, early diagnosis, follow-up after treatment, diagnosis of carcinoma in situ or cases in which cystoscopy is contraindicated. Cytological examinations were performed as follows. After catheterization with Nelaton's catheter, pumping irrigation was done. Irrigated solution was then spun, and the sediment was smeared, dried, and stained by May-Giemsa's method. Several cases were demonstrated. Case No. 1 : Six weeks prior to the first cystoscopic diagnosis, cytological examination was already positive. Case No. 2 : This was a follow-up case after TUR for bladder tumor. Cytological examination became positive but it was impossible to establish diagnosis by cystoscopy only. Biopsy revealed carcinoma in situ and infiltrating cancer. Case No. 3 : Cystoscopically the findings were those of cystitis, but cytological examination revealed neoplasm of high malignancy. Chromosome analysis of the exfoliated tumor cells obtained by pumping method was performed in a few cases. If chromosome study could be routinely made associated with cytological examination, malignancy of the tumor would be more clearly decided and provide with a helpful information as to treatment and prognosis.

40|$|Objective: During routine fine needle {{aspiration}} <b>cytodiagnosis</b> of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), {{a number}} of cases are diagnosed as suspicious; or it is suggested that PTC or a neoplasm be ruled out by histopathology. Since these diagnostic labels are likely to put the clinicians in a difficult situation while planning the management, this study aims to find out how much the surgeon should read from these reports. Materials and Methods: The patients were divided into two groups. Group A included 38 cases diagnosed as PTC or suspicious of PTC. Group B included 40 cases in which it was suggested that PTC/a neoplasm to be ruled out and non-neoplastic lesions with one or more cytologic features of PTC. The two groups were compared with clinical, imaging and cytomorphologic features. Results: A significant difference was observed with respect to age between Group A and Group B (P < 0. 001). The frequency of the following five cytologic features was significantly higher in Group A: papillary formation (P < 0. 001), psammoma bodies (P = 0. 054), fine nuclear chromatin (P = 0. 010), frequent nuclear grooves (P < 0. 001) and intra-nuclear cytoplasmic inclusion (P < 0. 001).
