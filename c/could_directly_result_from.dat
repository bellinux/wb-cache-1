40|$|Bacteriophage T 7 {{terminator}} T is a class I intrinsic terminator coding for an RNA {{hairpin structure}} immediately followed by oligo(U), {{which has been}} extensively studied {{in terms of its}} transcription terminationmechanism, but little is known about its physiological or regulatory functions. In this study, using a T 7 mutant phage, where a 31 -bp segment of Twas deleted from the genome, we discovered that deletion of T from T 7 reduces the phage burst size but delays lysis timing, both of which are disad-vantageous for the phage. The burst downsizing <b>could</b> <b>directly</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> T deletion-caused upregulation of gene 17. 5, coding for holin, among other T downstream genes, because infection of gp 17. 5 -overproducing Escherichia coli by wild-type T 7 phage showed similar burst downsizing. However, the lysis delay was not associated with cellular levels of holin or lysozyme or with rates of phage adsorption. Instead, when allowed to evolve spontaneously in five independent adaptation experiments, the T-lacking mutant phage, after 27 or 29 passages, recovered both burst size and lysis time reproducibly by deleting early genes 0. 5, 0. 6, and 0. 7 of class I, among other mutations. Deletion of genes 0. 5 to 0. 7 from the T-lacking mutant phage decreased expres-sion of several T downstream genes to levels {{similar to that of the}} wild-type phage. Accordingly, phage T 7 lysis timing is associ-ated with cellular levels of T downstream gene products. This suggests the involvement of unknown factor(s) besides the known lysis proteins, lysozyme and holin, and that T plays a role of optimizing burst size and lysis time during T 7 infection.

40|$|Genetic {{deficiency}} in CD 18 leads to dis-ease characterized by myeloid hyperpla-sia, including profound granulocytosis and splenomegaly. Myeloid hyperplasia <b>could</b> <b>directly</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> {{the disruption of}} CD 18 functions essential to granulopoi-esis or basal leukocyte trafficking. Alter-natively, myeloid hyperplasia could be reactive in nature, due to disruption of essential roles of CD 18 in leukocyte re-sponses to microbial challenge. To distin-guish between these mechanisms, the hematopoietic systems of lethally irradi-ated wild-type (WT) mice were reconsti-tuted with either WT fetal liver cells or CD 18 -deficient fetal liver cells, or an equal mixture of both types of cells. Granulocy-tosis and splenomegaly developed in mice that received CD 18 -deficient fetal liver cells. Splenomegaly was prevented and granulocytosis was inhibited by more than 95 % in mice that had received both CD 18 -deficient and WT fetal liver cells, suggest-ing that myeloid hyperplasia was largely reactive in nature. Consistent with this postulate, the circulating life spans in the blood and the fraction of neutrophils that incorporated BrdU in the bone marrow were not increased for CD 18 -deficient neutrophils compared with the WT. How-ever, these animals did develop mild granulocytosis compared with mice re-constituted with WT cells alone, and {{a higher percentage of}} CD 18 -deficient leu-kocytes were neutrophils compared with the WT leukocytes. These observations suggest that the granulocytosis ob-served in the absence of CD 18 occurs through at least 2 mechanisms: one that is dramatically improved by the pres-ence of WT cells, likely reactive in na-ture, and a second that is independent of the WT hematopoietic cells, involving an alteration in the lineage distribution of blood leukocytes.

40|$|International audienceWhereas the {{existence}} of pronounced orbitally controlled periodicities is a major feature of Earth climate, its impact on landscape dynamics remains poorly understood. We use a Landscape Evolution Model (LEM) to systematically investigate the response of landscapes {{to a range of}} periodic oscillations in precipitation. The resulting sediment-flux evolution displays a pronounced sensitivity to the period of the input precipitation signal, such that, for a given erodibility, a specific periodicity maximizes the amplitude of the response. This optimal period of “resonance” scales as the inverse of the erodibility, but is progressively filtered out of the response when the intensity of hillslope diffusion increases. This frequency-dependent landscape behavior displayed by our model provides a mechanistic perspective on Molnar's (2004) proposition that ubiquitous changes in Late Cenozoic continental denudation <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>directly</b> <b>from</b> modifications in the spectral content of the climatic signal...|$|R
40|$|Tick-borne virus {{transmission}} {{was examined}} using guinea-pigs and hamsters previously infested with ticks. Guinea-pigs developed immunity to Rhipicepha-lus appendiculatus after a single {{exposure to the}} ticks. Nymphal and adult stages that fed on resistant guinea-pigs had increased mortality during feeding, and reduced engorged weights. Egg production from fe-male ticks fed on resistant hosts fell by at least 50 %. Guinea-pigs maintained high levels of immunity to tick infestation for at least 210 days after the initial exposure. In contrast, hamsters did not develop resistance to ticks even after three or four infestations. R. appendiculatus adults infected with Thogoto (THO) virus (donors) were allowed to co-feed with uninfected nymphs (recipients) on either resistant or naive guinea-pigs. The number of recipient icks that acquired virus was significantly reduced on resistant guinea-pigs. In contrast, feeding on pre-infested hamsters did not affect tick-borne transmission of THO virus. Host resistance to tick infestation, if prevalent in nature, may severely limit the spread of tick-borne viruses. Such an effect <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>directly</b> <b>from</b> {{a reduction in the}} number of ticks that acquire virus, or indirectly from poor egg production (in the case of viruses maintained in ticks by vertical transmission) and reduced survival of ticks fed on resistant hosts...|$|R
40|$|Background/aim: Our {{previous}} {{studies showed that}} administration of dexamethasone plus food increased serum leptin levels 100 % more than dexamethasone alone. We hypothesized that this increase in leptin <b>from</b> the meal <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>directly</b> <b>from</b> the provision of fuel metabolites {{rather than from the}} meal-induced rise in insulin. In the current study, we tested the effect of an i. v. lipid fuel source (Intralipid 20 %/heparin) that would incur only a modest increase in insulin. This study was undertaken because the role of lipid in the regulation of human leptin levels has been controver-sial, with differing effects reported: stimulatory, inhibitory, or no effect at all. Methods: In order to evaluate how lipids affect serum leptin in humans, we administered the following to seven lean, healthy, fasting subjects: (i) Intralipid 20 % at 0. 83 ml/kg. h plus heparin (800 IE/h) infused i. v. for 7 h (LIPID), (ii) LIPID with one initial pulse of insulin (0. 09 U/kg) given s. c.

40|$|Several {{amino acids}} {{in the active}} site of family A DNA polymerases {{contribute}} to accurate DNA synthesis. For two of these residues, family B DNA polymerases have conserved tyrosine residues in regions II and III that are suggested to have similar functions. Here we replaced each tyrosine with alanine in the catalytic subunits of yeast DNA polymerases alpha, delta, epsilon, and zeta and examined the consequences in vivo. Strains with the tyrosine substitution in the conserved SL/MYPS/N motif in region II in Pol delta or Pol epsilon are inviable. Strains with same substitution in Rev 3, the catalytic subunit of Pol zeta, are nearly UV immutable, suggesting severe loss of function. A strain with this substitution in Pol alpha (pol 1 -Y 869 A) is viable, but it exhibits slow growth, sensitivity to hydroxyurea, and a spontaneous mutator phenotype for frameshifts and base substitutions. The pol 1 -Y 869 A/pol 1 -Y 869 A diploid exhibits aberrant growth. Thus, this tyrosine is critical for the function of all four eukaryotic family B DNA polymerases. Strains with a tyrosine substitution in the conserved NS/VxYG motif in region III in Pol alpha, -delta, or -epsilon are viable and a strain with the homologous substitution in Rev 3 is UV mutable. The Pol alpha mutant has no obvious phenotype. The Pol epsilon (pol 2 -Y 831 A) mutant is slightly sensitive to hydroxyurea and is a semidominant mutator for spontaneous base substitutions and frameshifts. The Pol delta mutant (pol 3 -Y 708 A) grows slowly, is sensitive to hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate, and is a strong base substitution and frameshift mutator. The pol 3 -Y 708 A/pol 3 -Y 708 A diploid grows slowly and aberrantly. Mutation rates in the Pol alpha, -delta, and -epsilon mutant strains are increased in a locus-specific manner by inactivation of PMS 1 -dependent DNA mismatch repair, suggesting that the mutator effects are due to reduced fidelity of chromosomal DNA replication. This <b>could</b> <b>result</b> <b>directly</b> <b>from</b> relaxed base selectivity of the mutant polymerases due to the amino acid changes in the polymerase active site. In addition, the alanine substitutions may impair catalytic function to allow a different polymerase to compete at the replication fork. This {{is supported by the}} observation that the pol 3 -Y 708 A mutation is recessive and its mutator effect is partially suppressed by disruption of the REV 3 gene...|$|R
