25|$|As robots {{have become}} more {{advanced}} and sophisticated, experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots' behavior, and whether robots {{might be able to}} claim any kind of social, cultural, ethical or legal rights. One scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019. Others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050. Recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated. The social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film <b>called</b> <b>Plug</b> & Pray.|$|R
5000|$|Other [...] lures are {{sometimes}} generically <b>called</b> <b>plugs</b> or wobblers. They {{come in all}} different shapes and sizes. These plugs are usually made by small companies and cost around twenty dollars. Each plug has its own action or has none unless you give it one. Wood plugs usually range from between 3/4 oz. and 4 oz. The different plugs come in a few basic categories. There are surface swimmers, subsurface swimmers, needlefish, poppers, pencil poppers, and darters. they all have their own specific place and time to be fished.|$|R

25|$|A kernel must {{maintain}} {{a list of}} available devices. This list may be known in advance (e.g. on an embedded system where the kernel will be rewritten if the available hardware changes), configured by the user (typical on older PCs and on systems that are not designed for personal use) or detected by the operating system at run time (normally <b>called</b> <b>plug</b> and play). In a plug and play system, a device manager first performs a scan on different hardware buses, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) or Universal Serial Bus (USB), to detect installed devices, then searches for the appropriate drivers.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the main}} {{impediment}} is solid rock, entry may involve {{the use of}} explosive material, {{similar to those used}} to remove stumps on farms, or it may involve the practice of rock shaving, where small holes are drilled in the rock and a gunpowder charge is detonated to spall the rock off in thin layers. A similar technique, <b>called</b> <b>plug</b> and feather, involves driving wedges into lines of small diameter holes that have been drilled in the rock. As the wedges are driven into the holes, a crack forms along the line of holes and the rock is eventually broken.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, the prolific, British {{electronic}} musician Luke Vibert debuted {{a project}} <b>called</b> <b>Plug</b> on seminal UK label Rising High Records, {{where he had}} previously released material under the name Wagon Christ. The Plug material showcased a different side of Vibert's repertoire, foraying into the genres of drum 'n' bass and jungle, which were reaching their peak in the British club scene. Plug began {{with a series of}} 12" [...] EPs, each an anagram of Vibert's name; Visible Crater Funk, Rebuilt Kev and Versatile Crib Funk, the latter of which was moved under Rising High's sub-label, Blue Angel Records.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{agreement}} technologies {{in the planning}} and execution of goods transports is analyzed. We have previously suggested an approach <b>called</b> <b>Plug</b> and Play Transport Chain Management (PnP TCM) that provides agent-based support for key tasks, such as, finding the best sequence of transport services for a particular goods transport, monitoring {{the execution of the}} transport, and managing the interaction between the involved actors. In this paper we analyze five agreement technologies in the context of PnP TCM, i. e., semantics, norms, organizations, argumentation and negotiation, and trust. We conclude that all five technologies {{play a critical role in}} the realization of PnP TCM...|$|R

50|$|They are {{becoming}} increasingly popular for providing entertainment too. For example, Ursula, a female robot, sings, play music, dances, and speaks to her audiences at Universal Studios. Several Disney attractions employ the use of animatrons, robots that look, move, and speak much like human beings, in some of their theme park shows. These animatrons look so realistic {{that it can be}} hard to decipher from a distance whether or not they are actually human. Although they have a realistic look, they have no cognition or physical autonomy. Various humanoid robots and their possible applications in daily life are featured in an independent documentary film <b>called</b> <b>Plug</b> & Pray, which was released in 2010.|$|R

On vacuum tube equipment the pins are normally on the equipment side of the join for safety reasons.|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} for an automatic consistency {{check in the}} development of prototypes in the automotive industry is presented. It is based on the observation that inconsistencies between adjacent parts of the prototype can be located at the plugs connecting these parts. This paper describes the PLUG software system whose idea is to assign intelligence to every plug in the system in order to continuously monitor the consistency of the overall design of the prototype. It has been implemented as a multi agent system where each agent is responsible for supervising a specific property of the parts adjacent to such a plug. The properties are structured according to the so <b>called</b> <b>PLUG</b> structural model which is a simple but powerful set theoretical representation of the interaction between adjacent parts...|$|R
50|$|There {{are about}} thirty iCubs in various {{laboratories}} {{mainly in the}} European Union but also one in the United States, one in Turkey and Japan. These were built {{as part of the}} RobotCub project by Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in Genoa and are used by a small but lively community of scientists that use the iCub to study embodied cognition in artificial systems. Most of the financial support comes from the European Commission's Unit E5 or the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) via the recently created iCub Facility department. The robots are constructed by IIT and cost about €250,000 or $266,186.38 each depending upon the version.The development and construction of iCub at the Italian Institute of Technology is part of an independent documentary film <b>called</b> <b>Plug</b> & Pray which was released in 2010.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a component-oriented programming model and middleware support services for building ubiquitous computing (UbiComp) applications that are composed out of smart objects on demand. Applications are realized as graphs representing smart objects and their services binding. Services are provided through high-level abstractions <b>called</b> <b>plugs</b> with semantically rich interfaces {{that allow them}} to be discovered and invoked dynamically. Our middleware supports the integration of heterogeneous smart objects by implementing a high level interaction model suited to the end-user and providing dynamic discovery, synthesis and binding of services. In this way we can deploy UbiComp applications that adapt to the dynamics of an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environment. A smart home application that employees everyday augmented objects is used to illustrate the approach. We give implementation details with an emphasis to the compositional aspects and provide a scalability analysis for the service discovery process...|$|R
5000|$|Chewing tobacco (North American, European), {{also known}} as chew (or in some Southern US dialects as chaw), is tobacco {{in the form of}} short or long, loose leaf and stem strands (like pipe tobacco or longer), or less {{commonly}} of chopped leaves and stems compressed into blocks <b>called</b> <b>plugs,</b> or even finely ground pieces compressed into pellets. A few brands are cut into much finer loose strands, like cigarette rolling tobacco. Chew is placed between the cheek and the gums, or actively chewed. It causes copious salivation, especially when chewed, and due to its irritant (even nauseating) effect on the esophagus, this [...] "juice" [...] usually requires spitting. Chewing tobacco is a long-established North American form of tobacco (derived from traditional use of raw tobacco leaf by Indigenous peoples of the Americas), and is also legal in the European Union. Chewing tobacco is sometimes flavored, e.g. with wintergreen, apple, or cherry.|$|R

5000|$|Thus, {{this seems}} to be a {{property}} of the main verbs of the sentences, think and say, respectively. After work by Lauri Karttunen, verbs that allow presuppositions to [...] "pass up" [...] to the whole sentence ("project") are called holes, and verbs that block such passing up, or projection of presuppositions are <b>called</b> <b>plugs.</b> Some linguistic environments are intermediate between plugs and holes: They block some presuppositions and allow others to project. These are called filters. An example of such an environment are indicative conditionals ("If-then" [...] clauses). A conditional sentence contains an antecedent and a consequent. The antecedent is the part preceded by the word [...] "if," [...] and the consequent is the part that is (or could be) preceded by [...] "then." [...] If the consequent contains a presupposition trigger, and the triggered presupposition is explicitly stated in the antecedent of the conditional, then the presupposition is blocked. Otherwise, it is allowed to project up to the entire conditional. Here is an example: ...|$|R
