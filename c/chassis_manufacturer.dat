2500|$|In 1997 {{the team}} moved into track racing with {{a sports car}} project, twice failing to win the Le Mans 24 Hours. On 21 January 1999 Toyota {{announced}} its move into Formula One. The company ended its rallying program in order to concentrate on Formula One. On 30 June 2000 the team secured its place as the 12th entry for the 2002 Formula One season. Originally intending to enter F1 in 2001, Toyota forfeited an $11Million deposit by delaying their entry. Unusually, Toyota opted {{to start their own}} works team rather than partner with a specialist race team and <b>chassis</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> The team was also set up away from Formula One's traditional manufacturing centre in [...] "Motorsport Valley" [...] in the United Kingdom. During 2001, Toyota tested with their prototype TF101 (AM01) car and drivers at 11 F1 circuits. The idea was to gain telemetry data for the races, which allowed them to make aerodynamic changes for the TF102, and for the drivers to experience the tracks in the new cars. Finn Mika Salo, who can communicate in Japanese, and Scotsman Allan McNish, who drove the GT-One during the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, were appointed as test drivers.|$|E

2500|$|Kenseth {{was born}} in Cambridge, Wisconsin. He made an {{agreement}} with his father, Roy, that Roy should buy a car and race, and Matt would work on the car until {{he was old enough}} to race. Kenseth began stock car racing in 1988 at the age of 16 at Madison International Speedway. [...] "My dad bought a car when I was 13 and raced it at Madison," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Neither of us knew much and it was a learning experience. He continued to race in 1988 and 1989. My first car– what might be considered a sportsman– was a 1981 Camaro that Todd Kropf had driven to championships at Madison and Columbus 151 Speedway. On the third night out I won a feature. I ran 15 features in 1983 and won two of them." [...] "The first night out in the Kropf car Matt won a heat race," [...] said Kenseth's father Roy. [...] "The third night he won the feature by holding off two of the best drivers at the track, Pete Moore and Dave Phillips, for 20 laps. Matt was smooth. I knew then {{he was going to be}} a racer." [...] He ran for the points title on Saturday nights at Wisconsin Dells in 1989. He finished second in points and won eight features. On Friday nights, he ran about half of the races at Golden Sands Speedway and half at Columbus 151 Speedway. In 1990, he bought a late model from Rich Bickle. In the season-opening race at Slinger Super Speedway, Kenseth inherited the lead and won his only race of the season when track champion Tony Strupp had a flat tire. He finished sixth in season points and won the track's rookie of the year award. Kenseth entered fifteen ARTGO events that season and raced in 40 features that year. After graduating from [...] Cambridge High School that summer, Kenseth worked for four years selling and shipping parts for Left-hander Chassis, a late model racecar <b>chassis</b> <b>manufacturer</b> just south of Wisconsin in Illinois. In 1991 he won the ARTGO race at La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway to become the youngest winner in the series' history. He passed Joe Shear and Steve Holzhausen, and held off Steve and Tom Carlson for the win. 1992 was a difficult year for Kenseth. He won three races and blew up more engines than he could count. He was ready to quit racing after the season. [...] "I felt we were at a standstill", he said. [...] "I wasn't gaining. My dad and I had some major discussions at the end of the year. We had to find the dollars for a good program or I told him I would rather not race." [...] Kipley Performance loaned a motor to Kenseth for the season-final race at La Crosse and the team ran better. Kenseth built a new car for 1993 using a Kipley engine. He used the car at Madison to win eight features and finished second in the points. Mike Butz offered Kenseth the chance to race his late model, and it took some time for the combination to stop struggling before they started winning features. At the end of the season, they won the final short track series race at Madison, La Crosse, and I-70 Speedway.|$|E

50|$|DSR's {{generally}} weigh under 1000 lbs {{with the}} driver and make 200 bhp at 13,000rpm. The relatively low cost of the engines and some new <b>chassis</b> <b>manufacturers</b> led to an explosion in growth of the class between the years 2000 and 2008.

50|$|Starting {{with the}} 2003 season, the series rules were changed to require <b>chassis</b> <b>manufacturers</b> to be {{approved}} by the league before they could build cars. Prior to that, any interested party could build a car, provided it met the rules and was made available to customers at the league-mandated price. In total, four manufacturers have built IndyCar chassis.|$|R
50|$|Formula Ford {{is not a}} one-make championship. It allows {{freedom of}} chassis design, engine build and {{numerous}} technical items of specification on the car.

Only two other professional single seater racing formulae in the world offer the same freedom of chassis and engine build: Formula Three and Formula One.|$|R

50|$|Although ACV owned three <b>chassis</b> <b>manufacturers</b> {{and three}} coachbuilders (Park Royal, Roe and Crossley) {{they did not}} try to tie the hands of customers. Some {{rationalisation}} happened early in that any orders for Park Royal composite bodies were transferred to Roe, and steel-framed bodies were either built by Park Royal or by Roe using Park Royal frames. By the mid-1950s all metal-framed bodies by ACV, regardless of coachbuilder, had a Park Royal outline.|$|R

50|$|The use of {{different}} body and <b>chassis</b> <b>manufacturers</b> can mean one bus can {{have up to}} four identifying badges - the chassis maker and model, and the bodywork maker and model, making non-expert recognition difficult compared to the identification of other vehicles, such as cars.

Several bus companies have changed ownership and name many times, leading to the same bus design receiving many different name badges, most notably Transbus International.|$|R

Manufactures such as March, Lola, and Reynard were the chassis of choice on the open market, with other more exclusive chassis (Penske and Galmer) also experiencing success.|$|R
