Of {{all the families}} in the Caryophyllales, only the <b>Caryophyllaceae</b> (carnation family) and Molluginaceae produce anthocyanins instead of betalains.

25|$|In sporophytic {{self-incompatibility}} (SSI), the SI phenotype of {{the pollen}} {{is determined by}} the diploid genotype of the anther (the sporophyte) in which it was created. This form of SI was identified in the families: Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Convolvulaceae, Betulaceae, <b>Caryophyllaceae,</b> Sterculiaceae and Polemoniaceae.

25|$|Cryptic {{self-incompatibility}} (CSI) {{exists in}} {{a limited number of}} taxa (for example, there is evidence for CSI in Silene vulgaris, <b>Caryophyllaceae).</b> In this mechanism, the simultaneous presence of cross and self pollen on the same stigma, results in higher seed set from cross pollen, relative to self pollen. However, as opposed to 'complete' or 'absolute' SI, in CSI, self-pollination without the presence of competing cross pollen, results in successive fertilization and seed set; in this way, reproduction is assured, {{even in the absence of}} cross-pollination. CSI acts, at least in some species, at the stage of pollen tube elongation, and leads to faster elongation of cross pollen tubes, relative to self pollen tubes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of CSI have not been described.|$|E

60|$|Gartner has {{designated}} by this term a peculiar {{condition of the}} anthers in certain plants, {{in which they are}} shrivelled, or become brown and tough, and contain no good pollen. When in this state they exactly resemble the anthers of the most sterile hybrids. Gartner (18/88. 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss' etc. s. 117 et seq.; Kolreuter 'Zweite Fortsetzung' s. 10, 121; 'Dritte Fortsetzung' s. 57. Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' page 355. Wiegmann 'Ueber die Bastarderzeugung' s. 27.), in his discussion on this subject, has shown that plants of many orders are occasionally thus affected; but the <b>Caryophyllaceae</b> and Liliaceae suffer most, and to these orders, I think, the Ericaceae may be added. Contabescence varies in degree, but on the same plant all the flowers are generally affected to nearly the same extent. The anthers are affected at a very early period in the flower-bud, and remain in the same state (with one recorded exception) during the life of the plant. The affection cannot be cured by any change of treatment, and is propagated by layers, cuttings, etc., and perhaps even by seed. In contabescent plants the female organs are seldom affected, or merely become precocious in their development. The cause of this affection is doubtful, and is different in different cases. Until I read Gartner's discussion I attributed it, as apparently did Herbert, to the unnatural treatment of the plants; but its permanence under changed conditions, and the female organs not being affected, seem incompatible with this view. The fact of several endemic plants becoming contabescent in our gardens seems, at first sight, equally incompatible with this view; but Kolreuter believes that this is the result of their transplantation. The contabescent plants of Dianthus and Verbascum, found wild by Wiegmann, grew on a dry and sterile bank. The fact that exotic plants are eminently liable to this affection also seems to show that it is in some manner caused by their unnatural treatment. In some instances, as with Silene, Gartner's view seems the most probable, namely, that it is caused by an inherent tendency in the species to become dioecious. I can add another cause, namely, the illegitimate unions of heterostyled plants, for I have observed seedlings of three species of Primula and of Lythrum salicaria, which had been raised from plants illegitimately fertilised by their own-form pollen, with some or all their anthers in a contabescent state. There is perhaps an additional cause, namely, self-fertilisation; for many plants of Dianthus and Lobelia, which had been raised from self-fertilised seeds, had their anthers in this state; but these instances are not conclusive, as both genera are liable from other causes to this affection.|$|E

Grevea, although more distant from Montinia than is Kaliphora, can be included in a trigeneric family, Montiniaceae. The ordinal position of Montinia is reviewed in terms of Rosales (Saxifragales) and Myrtales. Resemblances between Montiniaceae and rosalean families are fewer than resemblances between Montiniaceae and myrtalean families. Montiniaceae have (in part) storied wood structure, a feature not found in Rosales or Myrtales sensu stricto. However, storied structure does occur in Thymeleaceae, which have sometimes been placed in or near Myrtales. Both Montiniaceae and Thymeleaceae might be regarded as outliers ofMyrtales, closer to that order than to others. The presence of iridoid compounds in Montinia complicates the task of placement...|$|R
