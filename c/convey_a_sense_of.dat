5|$|Modern scholarship, {{noting the}} way in which similar {{accounts}} were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the power of Jesus in the face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure with the Jewish people. Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Old Testament.|$|E
5|$|Other translators {{have placed}} much greater weight {{on trying to}} <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the poetic forms used by Du Fu. Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English-style rhyme schemes, whereas Keith Holyoak in Facing the Moon approximates the Chinese rhyme scheme; both use end-stopped lines and {{preserve}} some degree of parallelism. In The Selected Poems of Du Fu, Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly, persuading the western reader {{to adapt to the}} poems rather than vice versa. Similarly, he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive annotation.|$|E

5|$|Kurt Harland {{composed}} most of {{the music}} for Soul Reaver; Jim Hedges handled the remaining audio. Harland remarked that, under Amy Hennig's direction, he programmed music to change based on the current gameplay situation—for example, combat or swimming. This variation was accomplished through a custom Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) driver, which altered music based on signals from the game engine. Each vampire tribe had corresponding music; one tribe of vampires {{was associated with a}} slow, thumping theme to <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> working machinery. To further fit the music to the environment, the sound team consulted level designers regarding layout and appearance. Music from both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E

25|$|Artistic {{interpretation}} covers that {{essential element}} of all dance and artistry in general which cannot be quantified or reduced to any set of rules or specific points, but which does concern {{the ability of the}} dancer or performer to <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> feeling, understanding, and appreciation of the art form.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinctive}} {{part of the}} Odissi {{tradition is}} the inclusion of Moksha (or Mokshya) finale in the performance sequence. This the concluding item of a recital. Moksha in Hindu traditions means “spiritual liberation”. This dance movement traditionally attempts to <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> spiritual release and soul liberation, soaring {{into the realm of}} pure aesthetics. Movement and pose merge in a fast pace pure dance climax.|$|E

25|$|To {{increase}} {{the feeling of}} claustrophobia in Sunshine, Boyle refused to cut back to scenes on Earth, a traditional technique in most films about the planet in jeopardy. The director also maintained an atmosphere of confinement in Sunshine by avoiding filming the primary ship, Icarus II, from the outside. There {{are only a few}} outside shots of the ship. He also attempted to avoid filming star field backgrounds, keeping the ship's exterior pitch black, but he was ultimately compelled to show stars outside the spacecraft to help <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the ship's movement.|$|E
25|$|Robots can be {{autonomous}} or semi-autonomous {{and range}} from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous Things {{are expected to}} proliferate in the coming decade, with home robotics and the autonomous car {{as some of the}} main drivers.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} {{trait of}} Argentine rock is its uncompromising stance to only use Spanish language lyrics. Rock music {{is made in}} many languages around the world, {{but in most cases}} it shares the lyrical creative pen with English. The Argentine rock movement {{was one of the first}} non-English forms of rock to be commercially successful overseas. Today it's rare for an Argentine rock band to sing in a foreign language as happens in other nations, even within Latin America and Spain (except to <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> artistic freedom, or in an attempt to isolate their message or aesthetic). Argentine rock today is a blanket term describing a number of rock styles and sub-cultures within Argentina.|$|E

25|$|For {{twenty years}} Vernet lived in Rome, {{producing}} views of seaports, storms, calms, moonlights, and large whales, becoming especially popular with English aristocrats, {{many of whom}} were on the Grand Tour. In 1745 he married an Englishwoman whom he met in the city. In 1753 he was recalled to Paris: there, by royal command, he executed the series of the seaports of France (now in the Louvre and the Musée national de la Marine) by which he is best known. His The Port of Rochefort (1763, Musée national de la Marine) is particularly notable; in the piece Vernet is able to achieve, according to art historian Michael Levey, one of his most 'crystalline and atmospherically sensitive skies'. Vernet has attempted to bring the foreground of his work to life through painting a wide array of figures engaging in a variety of activities, endeavouring to <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the commotion and drama of France's seaports.|$|E
500|$|About 10 July 1890 Van Gogh {{wrote to}} Theo of [...] "vast fields of wheat under troubled skies". Wheatfield with Crows shows the artist's {{state of mind}} in his final days; Hulsker {{describes}} the work as a [...] "doom-filled painting with threatening skies and ill-omened crows". Its dark palette and heavy brushstrokes <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> menace.|$|E
500|$|The game {{world of}} Giants {{is set on}} a fictional [...] "Island" [...] {{traveling}} through space. Its surface comprises grasslands, deserts, and forests, surrounded by azure seas. Players have an unobstructed view of the game world to its horizon; whereas distant objects are slightly blurred to <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> distance. Missions for Meccaryns provide cover to hide behind, large spaces of water for Reapers, and creatures for Kabuto to eat.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, Hansen {{was also}} charged with {{rebuilding}} Christiansborg Palace which had burnt down in 1794. Unfortunately, it burnt down {{once again in}} 1884.

500|$|J. D. Considine of Rolling Stone {{wrote in}} the review of Bobby (1992), [...] "As anyone who saw him swagger through the videos for 'My Prerogative' and 'Every Little Step' can attest, Brown had a phenomenal ability to <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> street {{toughness}} that was utterly without malice or menace, making him credible and likable". The music video was nominated at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Stage Performance in a Video, but lost to the music video of Living Colour's [...] "Cult of Personality". It also charted at number nine on RPM video chart on July 21, 1990.|$|E
500|$|A {{select few}} scenes disrupt the Expressionistic {{style of the}} film, such as in Jane's and Alan's home, which include normal {{backgrounds}} and bourgeois furniture that <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> security and tranquility otherwise absent from the film. Eisner called this a [...] "fatal" [...] continuity error, but John D. Barlow disagrees, arguing {{it is a common}} characteristic for dream narratives to have some normal elements in them, and that the normalcy of Jane's house in particular could represent the feeling of comfort and refuge Francis feels in her presence. Mike Budd argues while the Expressionistic visual style is jarring and off-putting at first, the characters start to blend more harmoniously as the film progresses, and the setting becomes more relegated into the background.|$|E
500|$|Composer John Williams began {{scoring the}} film {{at the end}} of February, and it was {{recorded}} a month later. John Neufeld and Alexander Courage provided the score's orchestrations. Similar to another Spielberg film he scored, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Williams felt he needed to write [...] "pieces that would <b>convey</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> 'awe' and fascination" [...] given it dealt with the [...] "overwhelming happiness and excitement" [...] that would emerge from seeing live dinosaurs. In turn more suspenseful scenes such as the Tyrannosaurus attack earned frightening themes. The first soundtrack album was released on May 25, 1993. For the 20th anniversary of the release of the film, a new soundtrack was issued for digital download on April 9, 2013, including four bonus tracks personally selected by Williams.|$|E
5000|$|Cathedral: The {{paintings}} depict various {{scenes of}} confrontation, child birth and abandonment in compositions involving several moving and gesturing figures <b>conveying</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> tension and {{contrast between the}} figure representing Margaret and the various figures surrounding her with gestures of accusation and condemnation.|$|R
5000|$|Zuckermann (2009) {{mentions}} in {{this context}} the Turkic initial m-segment <b>conveying</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> [...] "and so on" [...] as in the Turkish sentence dergi mergi okumuyor, literally [...] "magazine shmagazine read:NEGATIVE:PRESENT:3rd person singular", i.e. [...] "(He) doesn’t read magazines, journals or anything like that".|$|R
