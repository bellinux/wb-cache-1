He was aware, as he later wrote, that incidents of rape or attempted rape took place [...] "almost every week, {{yet no one}} has ever been taken to court ... on such charges". Some of Berkman's own friendships within the prison became physical. He became intimate with one prisoner, [...] "Johnny", when the two were confined to the dungeon. He discussed homosexuality with another prisoner, [...] "George", a formerly married physician who told Berkman about his own homosexual prison affair.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Rita {{has been well}} received by critics, who praised Benz’s portrayal. Eric Goldman of IGN has said, “Dexter does a solid job of developing {{the roles of the}} supporting cast, with Rita, Deb, Doakes and LaGuerta all getting a good amount of development”. [...] He added, “There were a couple of forced moments in [...] "Popping Cherry", most notably the drug dealer who came to Rita's house, in broad daylight, demanding money for her ex-husband's debts; it was all a bit over the top and cliché. On the other hand, it was interesting to note Dexter's inaction in that scene, making one wonder if perhaps he fears that any public display of physical defense, even for Rita, might result in him going too far and revealing what he is." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post has said, [...] "Rita always felt like the light in that dark show", and [...] "In the beginning Rita was the vessel through which the audience <b>could</b> <b>love</b> Dexter." [...] UGO.com placed Rita Bennett 7th on a list of [...] "Top 11 Girlfriends on TV". Zap2it created a poll entitled [...] "Best Mom" [...] as part of their [...] "Greatest TV Characters" [...] series of polls; Rita was voted 12th on a list of 14 characters.|$|E
500|$|Measure for Measure has {{frequently}} {{been considered a}} [...] "problem play". It was a problem for Hazlitt in that it contains almost no character with whom one can feel complete sympathy. [...] "here is in general a want of passion; the affections are at a stand; our sympathies are reflected and defeated in all directions." [...] Angelo, the Deputy ruler of Vienna, is forgiven by the Duke but draws only Hazlitt's hatred, as [...] "he {{seems to have a}} much greater passion for hypocrisy than for his mistress." [...] "Neither are we enamoured of Isabella's rigid chastity, though she could not act otherwise than she did." [...] Isabella's brother Claudio [...] "is the only person who feels naturally", yet even he does not show well in his pleading for life at the sacrifice of his sister's virginity. There is no easy solution for his plight, and [...] "he is placed in circumstances of distress which almost preclude the wish for his deliverance." [...] Over a century later, commentator R.W. Chambers placed Hazlitt as the first of a long line of notable Shakespearean critics who felt the same way, and he quoted Characters of Shakespear's Plays in establishing his contention (as a basis for arguing his own different view of the play) that Hazlitt was among the first of dozens of distinguished critics who could not comprehend how Mariana <b>could</b> <b>love</b> and plead for someone like Angelo, and in general showed a distaste for much in Measure for Measure.|$|E
500|$|Steven Rosen of The Denver Post wrote [...] "DreamWorks Pictures again proves a name {{to trust}} for imaginative, funny {{animated}} movies that delight kids and adults equally." [...] Susan Stark of The Detroit News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A fat green ogre with a grouchy disposition and worse manners, Shrek {{is the sort of}} unlikely hero that nobody <b>could</b> <b>love</b> -- except just about everyone who sees this hip and hilarious animated delight." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication." [...] Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it [...] "a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of Shrek." [...] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating [...] "We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?' But we loved it. We were afraid it would be too sickeningly cute and, instead, Bill just thought they did a wonderful, witty job of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hippies {{embraced the}} old slogan of free {{love of the}} radical social reformers of other eras; it was {{accordingly}} observed that [...] "Free love made the whole love, marriage, sex, baby package obsolete. Love was no longer limited to one person, you <b>could</b> <b>love</b> anyone you chose. In fact love was something you shared with everyone, not just your sex partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more you share, the more you get! So why reserve your love for a select few? This profound truth {{was one of the}} great hippie revelations." [...] Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors. Others explored the spiritual aspects of sex.|$|E

[...] Part of White’s face was torn away, {{and the rest of his}} features were unrecognizable, blackened by gunpowder. [...] The crowd's initial reaction was one of good cheer, as elaborate party tricks among the upper echelon of New York society were common at the time.

2500|$|Rabbi Mani of Sheab and Rabbi Joshua of Siknin in {{the name}} of Rabbi Levi {{explained}} the origin of [...] Moses prayed on Aaron's behalf, noting that the beginning of Leviticus repeatedly referred to Aaron's sons, barely mentioning Aaron himself.

Moses noted that God honored the olive tree and the vine for the sake of their offspring, teaching that the priests could use all trees' wood for the altar fire except that of the olive and vine. Moses thus asked God whether God might honor Aaron {{for the sake of his}} sons, and God replied that God would reinstate Aaron and honor him above his sons. And thus God said to Moses the words of [...] "Command Aaron and his sons." ...|$|E

Robin enters, claiming to seek advice from Rose about [...] "a friend" [...] who is in love. Rose says that she has such a friend too, but Robin is too shy to take the hint. Rose's devotion to etiquette prevents her from taking the first step, and so they part.|$|E
2500|$|McLane’s biographer, Professor John A.

He was almost sinfully ambitious, as his father had encouraged him to be. He was often meanly suspicious, and life had encouraged him to be ever mindful of his welfare and that of the large family dependent on him. He was easily affronted and held grudges almost with glee against those who crossed him. He was immensely persuasive, {{but in the long run}} he abandoned in disgust each of the successive scenes of his triumphs. It was to Kitty and the children that he was true, and the children learned to admire but not to love this stern, busy, handsome, sensitive man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tynan {{was highly}} {{critical}} {{of what he called}} 'the Loamshire play', a genre of English country house drama which he felt dominated the early 1950s British stage, and was wasting the talents of playwrights and actors. Tynan espoused a new theatrical realism, best exemplified in the works of the playwrights who became known as the [...] "Angry Young Men". There was a significant development in the 1955–56 British theatre season during which John Osborne's Look Back in Anger (and Samuel Beckett's English version of his own Waiting for Godot) premiered. Tynan championed Osborne's play, although he identified some possible flaws, concluding his review with the comment: [...] "I doubt if I <b>could</b> <b>love</b> anyone who did not wish to see Look Back in Anger. It is the best young play of its decade." [...] The theatre historian Dan Rebellato asserts: [...] "it is clear that he is set on confronting his readership, not speaking for them".|$|E

2500|$|Within the series, Maggie's {{relationship}} with Henry soon ends, but {{the character is}} not heavily romantically linked with any other man for months and Maggie's {{relationship with}} Bianca continues to deepen. Hendrickson was perplexed by this aspect. [...] "Maggie was asexual for a long time. It was frustrating, and I was getting confused how I should play it," [...] said Hendrickson. [...] "So I kept it honest: She loved Bianca as a friend. There was a possibility that she <b>could</b> <b>love</b> her more intimately. She still does love her, {{and there was a}} point in time when she might have thought otherwise. But ultimately she likes men." [...] Despite Hendrickson's early views about the character's sexual orientation, the show continued to showcase Maggie sending [...] "mixed signals" [...] to Bianca, with her romantic feelings for Bianca coming through as intense. The character is shown to resort to having sex with good guy and best friend Jamie Martin on several occasions to bury these feelings, though most of her sexual interaction with Jamie takes place offscreen. Maggie's romantic attraction to Bianca finally gets the better of her, and she impulsively kisses her. Maggie panics, however, and tells Bianca it meant nothing. Heartbroken, she finds comfort in Jamie.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929, Hughes' wife, Ella, {{returned}} to Houston and filed for divorce. Hughes dated many famous women, {{many of them}} decades younger, including Billie Dove, Faith Domergue, Bette Davis, Ava Gardner, Olivia de Havilland, Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Janet Leigh, Rita Hayworth, Mamie Van Doren and Gene Tierney. He also proposed to Joan Fontaine several times, according to her autobiography No Bed of Roses. Jean Harlow accompanied him to the premiere of Hell's Angels, but Noah Dietrich wrote many years later that the relationship was strictly professional, as Hughes apparently personally disliked Harlow. In his 1971 book, Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes, Dietrich said that Hughes genuinely liked and respected Jane Russell, but never sought romantic involvement with her. According to Russell's autobiography, however, Hughes once tried to bed her after a party. Russell (who was married at the time) refused him, and Hughes promised it would never happen again. The two maintained a professional and private friendship for many years. Hughes remained good friends with Tierney who, after his failed attempts to seduce her, {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I don't think Howard <b>could</b> <b>love</b> anything that did not have a motor in it." [...] Later, when Tierney's daughter Daria was born deaf and blind and with a severe learning disability because of Tierney's being exposed to rubella during her pregnancy, Hughes saw to it that Daria received the best medical care and paid all expenses.|$|E
