25|$|Swiss citizenship, {{according}} to article 37, is legally {{a consequence of}} cantonal and municipal citizenship, reflecting the three-tiered setup of the Swiss state. Nonetheless, federal law regulates the general rules of acquisition and loss of citizenship, as set forth in article 38. The exact procedure of acquiring citizenship is governed by <b>cantonal</b> <b>law.</b> Some cantons have instituted administrative bodies to process petitions for citizenship, while in others, prospective citizens are vetted, and their petitions voted on, by a municipal citizens' assembly. These procedures are a subject of perennial political controversy between advocates of {{a more or less}} strict immigration policy.|$|E
25|$|Switzerland is {{a federal}} {{republic}} in which {{the sovereignty of the}} constituent states (the cantons) is limited by the enumerated powers delegated to the federal state (the Confederation) through the federal constitution. Consequently, the original authority to levy taxes is vested in the individual cantons of Switzerland through their constitutions. Within the bounds of the authority delegated to them by <b>cantonal</b> <b>law,</b> the municipalities may also levy taxes. The extent of that authority varies from canton to canton. While the formal framework of the most important cantonal direct taxes has been harmonised through the 1990 Federal Tax Harmonisation Law, the cantons (and, as the case may be, the municipalities) remain free to set their tax rates or establish new taxes, except on tax objects already taxed under federal law.|$|E
25|$|Article 9's {{prohibition}} of arbitrary treatment, {{an extension of}} the rule of law, guards individuals against rules or decisions of the state that have no serious, objective reasons, or that are meaning- and pointless. A decision is arbitrary only if its result is obviously untenable or contrary to the facts, or if it blatantly violates the law or the idea of justice. This rule, which is illimitable, permeates the entire legal system. Applied subsidiarily where other rights are unavailable, it features prominently in Supreme Court jurisprudence, which reviews questions of <b>cantonal</b> <b>law</b> that do not involve rules of federal or constitutional law not de novo, but only for arbitrary application of the law. However, the Court applies a narrow rule of standing to independent claims of arbitrary treatment, which has caused wide scholarly criticism. The rule of good faith requires the state to protect people's vested confidence in state actions, such as in governmental informations, and prohibits the abuse of rights by the state, such as through undue delays.|$|E

2500|$|The {{insolvency}} law of Switzerland {{is the law}} governing insolvency, foreclosure, bankruptcy and debt restructuring proceedings in Switzerland. It is principally codified in the Federal Statute on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy ( [...] ; [...] ) of 11 April 1889 (as amended) {{as well as in}} ancillary federal and <b>cantonal</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|R
50|$|Switzerland is {{a federal}} state. Access to federal {{documents}} is governed by the Swiss Federal Act on the Principle of Freedom of Information in Public Administration (and supervised by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner). Access to documents at the cantonal level is governed by <b>cantonal</b> <b>laws,</b> which are mostly similar to the federal law.|$|R
2500|$|In Switzerland, {{official}} language use {{is governed by}} the [...] "territorial principle": <b>Cantonal</b> <b>law</b> determines which of the four national languages enjoys official status in which part of the territory. Only the federal administration is officially quadrilingual. Romansh is an {{official language}} at the federal level, {{one of the three}} official languages of the Canton of Grisons, and is a working language in various districts and numerous municipalities within the canton.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{provisions}} limit the double {{taxation of profits}} at the corporate level and contribute to Switzerland's tax haven status. To begin with, a [...] "participation exemption" [...] is granted to companies who hold 20 {{percent or more of}} the shares of other companies; the amount of tax due on the corresponding profit is reduced in proportion to the percentage of shares held. At the cantonal level only, a [...] "holding privilege" [...] applies to pure holding companies. They are exempt from the cantonal corporate profit tax. Moreover, <b>cantonal</b> <b>law</b> confers a [...] "domicile privilege" [...] on companies who are only administered in Switzerland, but whose business is conducted abroad; including shell corporations. The cantons tax only around 10 percent of the worldwide profits of such companies.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cantonal</b> <b>law</b> {{leaves it}} to the districts and {{municipalities}} to specify their own language of administration and schooling. According to Article 3 of the cantonal constitution however, the municipalities are to [...] "take into consideration the traditional linguistic composition and respect the autochthonous linguistic minorities". This means that the language area of Romansh has never officially been defined, and that any municipality is free to change its official language. In 2003, Romansh was the sole official language in 56 municipalities of Grisons, and 19 were bilingual in their administrative business. In practice, even those municipalities which only recognize Romansh as an official working language, readily offer services in German as well. Additionally, since the working language of the canton is mainly German and many official publications of the canton are available only in German, {{it is virtually impossible}} for a municipal administration to operate only in Romansh.|$|E
50|$|The {{labour law}} of Switzerland covers all {{standards}} governing {{the employment of}} some kind. The regulation of the employment by private employers is largely harmonized at the federal level, while public-sector employment still prevails a variety of <b>cantonal</b> <b>laws.</b> In particular, the civil standardization is distributed {{to a variety of}} laws. Of greater importance, particularly the new Federal Constitution of 1999, the Code of Obligations , the Labour Code {{as well as in the}} public sector, the Federal Personnel Act.|$|R
25|$|Article 37 prohibits {{privileges}} or prejudices {{associated with}} any particular cantonal or municipal citizenship. Still, the Constitution makes allowance for {{the continued existence of}} bourgeoisies and corporations. These are traditional civic associations carried over from the Old Swiss Confederacy, often consisting of formerly aristocratic families, but regulated by <b>cantonal</b> public <b>law.</b>|$|R
50|$|Legislative {{provision}} against {{abuses of}} the truck system appears to be of earlier origin in Switzerland (17th century) than any other European country outside England (15th century). The Federal Labour Law 1877 generally prohibits payment of wages otherwise than in current coin, and provides that no deduction shall be made without an express contract. Some of the <b>cantonal</b> <b>laws</b> go much farther than the British act of 1896 in forbidding certain deductions; e.g. Zurich prohibits any charge for cleaning, warming or lighting workrooms or for hire of machinery. By the Federal law fines may not exceed half a day's wage. Administration of the Labour laws is divided between inspectors appointed by the Federal Government and local authorities, under supervision of the cantonal governments. The Federal Government forms a court of appeal against decisions of the cantonal governments.|$|R

50|$|Law {{enforcement}} in Switzerland is mainly a {{responsibility of the}} 26 cantons of Switzerland, who each operate cantonal police agencies. Some cities also operate municipal police agencies as provided for by <b>cantonal</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Switzerland {{separate}} cantonal legislation {{prepared the}} way for the general Federal labour law of 1877 on which subsequent legislation rests. Such legislation is also cantonal as well as Federal, but in the latter there is only amplification or interpretation of the principles contained in the law of 1877, whereas cantonal legislation covers industries not included under the Federal law, e.g. single workers employed in a trade (m√©tier) and employment in shops, offices and hotels. The Federal law is applied to factories, workshops employing young persons under 18 or more than 10 workers, and workshops in which unhealthy or dangerous processes are carried on. Mines are not included, but are regulated in some respects as regards health and safety by <b>cantonal</b> <b>laws.</b> Further, the Law of Employers' Liability 1881-1887, which requires in all industries precautions against accidents and reports of all serious. accidents to the cantonal governments, applies to mines.|$|R
40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on determining how {{to implement the}} legal framework at different institutional levels in an integrated approach for the planning and management of energy systems in urban areas. There are mainly five levels of decision able to influence the performances of urban zone in a Swiss city, namely the international, national, cantonal, municipal and individual levels. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop an evaluation grid, which will be used to identify the influence of each decision level over the different energy chain levels (primary, intermediate, final, useful energy and energy services). The results showed that beyond the constraints imposed by national and <b>cantonal</b> <b>laws,</b> ambitious energy-climate policies adopted by each level of governance certainly offer a lot of opportunities for the sustainable and energy-efficient development of urban areas. New regulations and associated instruments give to local decision-makers a set of arguments that can be used in a complementary way...|$|R
30|$|As for {{forecasting}} {{based on}} search and matching models, individuals {{will want to}} change to the teaching occupation only if they {{expect it to be}} a better match. However, {{the extent to which a}} higher wage is expected to be part of that better match remains unclear. The reason is first, we do not know the relative position of different jobs regarding the job characteristics and hence non-monetary benefits. Second, the assumption that higher productivity will translate to a higher wage (wage reflects productivity) does not automatically apply in the public sector, where schooling takes place. One feature of vocational schools is that all teachers receive the same wage, depending on age, canton, experience and training, independent of their original occupation. Wages are set by <b>cantonal</b> <b>laws,</b> and schools therefore have no room for maneuver in wage setting. The financial attractiveness of teaching therefore depends essentially on the wage level of the individual‚Äôs original occupation. Therefore, we expect that schools can choose among several candidates for teaching positions from occupations with relatively low wage levels, whereas schools will face difficulties finding suitable candidates from occupations with high compensation levels.|$|R
50|$|Elementary {{students}} {{follow the}} Core Knowledge curriculum {{as well as}} an Italian Section curriculum in liaison with <b>cantonal</b> <b>law.</b> Middle and High School students follow a robust, challenging program which includes English-as-an-Additional-Language (EAL) content courses, Advanced Placement courses, and the International Baccalaureate program.|$|E
50|$|In Switzerland, pardons may {{be granted}} by the Swiss Federal Assembly for crimes prosecuted by the federal authorities. For crimes under cantonal jurisdiction, <b>cantonal</b> <b>law</b> designates the {{authority}} competent to grant pardons (if any). In most cantons, the cantonal parliament may pardon felonies, and the cantonal government may pardon misdemeanors and minor infractions.|$|E
50|$|Each canton {{determines the}} powers and {{responsibilities}} of its municipalities. These may include providing local government services such as education, medical and social services, public transportation, and tax collection. The degree of centralization varies from one canton to another. The federal constitution protects the autonomy of municipalities within the framework set out by <b>cantonal</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{conservative}} {{ballot initiative}} in 1854 failed to reestablish the Landsgemeinde and abolish the districts, while a liberal initiative in 1866, which attempted to expand personal rights, also failed. In the early 1870s, the conservatives gained {{power in the}} cantonal government. In 1874, the Swiss Federal Constitution was completely revised, which created conflicts with the Schwyz cantonal constitution. It was revised in 1876 and accepted by 73% of voters. The new cantonal constitution limited {{the scope of the}} <b>cantonal</b> council <b>laws</b> and extended the requirements for mandatory referendums.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{municipalities}} designate {{themselves as}} [...] "city" [...] (ville or Stadt) or as [...] "village" [...] (Dorf). These designations result from tradition or local preference - for example, several small municipalities designated as cities held city rights in medieval times - and normally do not impact the legal or political rights or obligations of the municipalities under <b>cantonal</b> or federal <b>law.</b>|$|R
50|$|As on {{the federal}} level, all cantons provide for some forms of direct democracy. Citizens may demand a popular vote to amend the <b>cantonal</b> {{constitution}} or <b>laws,</b> or to veto laws or spending bills passed by the parliament. General popular assemblies (Landsgemeinde) are now limited to the cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus. In all other cantons democratic rights are exercised by secret ballot.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} {{described above}} for Swiss federal law applies mutatis mutandis {{to the constitutional}} and legal systems of the individual cantons. However, owing to the derogatory power of federal law, federal courts {{as a matter of}} course exercise judicial review on <b>cantonal</b> <b>law,</b> as well as on federal executive law (ordinances, executive orders etc.).|$|E
50|$|The Cantonal police (Police cantonale, Kantonspolizei, Polizia Chantunala, Polizia cantonale) are the law {{enforcement}} agencies {{for each of the}} 26 Swiss Cantons. Law enforcement in Switzerland is mainly a responsibility of the 26 cantons of Switzerland, which each operate cantonal police agencies. Some cities also operate municipal police agencies as provided for by <b>cantonal</b> <b>law.</b> The federal government provides specialised services and is responsible {{for the protection of the}} Swiss border.|$|E

50|$|Family {{life has}} been {{traditionally}} conservative, following the model of a male breadwinner and a female housewife. In Europe, Switzerland {{was one of the}} last countries to establish gender equality in marriage: married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a referendum, who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving). Adultery was decriminalized in 1989. Divorce laws were also reformed in 2000 and 2005. In 1992, the law was changed to end discrimination against married women with regard to national citizenship.In 2013, further reforms to the civil code followed, removing the remaining discriminatory provisions regarding the spouses' choice of family name and <b>cantonal</b> citizenship <b>law.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Swiss Criminal Code {{is based}} on an initial draft by Carl Stooss in 1893. He {{proposed}} one of the first criminal codes that included both punishment and preemptive, safeguard measures. The original code was approved by the people on 3 July 1938 in a referendum, with 358,438 voting in favor to 312,030 voting against. With its entry into force on 1 January 1942, all federal legislation that contradicted the new Criminal Code was abolished. This especially included the death penalty, which was still in force in some cantons, such as the canton of Valais. Moreover, the competences for substantive law was largely transferred from the cantons of the Confederation. The cantons retain only the competence on the regulations of <b>cantonal</b> procedural <b>law</b> and <b>cantonal</b> tax legislation and violations.|$|R
50|$|Municipalities are {{generally}} governed by an executive council {{headed by a}} president or mayor. Legislative authority is exercised by a town meeting of all citizens, or by a municipal parliament, {{depending on the size}} of the municipality, and on <b>cantonal</b> and municipal <b>law.</b> In some cantons, foreigners who have lived for a certain time in Switzerland are also allowed to participate in municipal politics. As at the cantonal and federal level, citizens enjoy political rights, including direct democratic ones, in their municipality.|$|R
50|$|Under the Swiss Federal Constitution, {{the mode}} of {{election}} to the Council of States is left to the cantons, the proviso being {{that it must be}} a democratic method. All cantons now provide for the Councillors to be chosen by popular election (historically it was typically the cantons' parliaments that elected representatives to Bern), however those eligible to vote varies according to the applicable <b>cantonal</b> <b>law</b> (notable variances are that foreigners may vote in Neuch√¢tel, and the minimum voting age is 16 in Glarus).|$|E
50|$|Shopping {{hours are}} governed by <b>cantonal</b> <b>law</b> and vary accordingly, the only confederally {{mandated}} store holiday being August 1 (the national holiday), as per article 110 III of the Swiss Constitution. Most often, stores will be open from 8 or 9 am to 7 or 8 pm, 9 pm {{one day a week}} (usually a thursday or a friday) depending on the region. On Saturday and the day before public holidays, most stores close at around 4 or 5 pm. Stores are also generally closed on Sundays; see Sunday shopping in Switzerland.|$|E

50|$|After the Reformation, {{the abbey}} {{buildings}} {{were used as}} a grain depot, and during the early 19th century, as a casino. During the 19th century, most of the original structure was lost to significant construction work. The buildings since the 1870s have housed the <b>cantonal</b> court of <b>law</b> (Obergericht), besides the communal wine cellars and a theater. After a fire in 1890, part of the structure was removed, {{and is now a}} parking lot. The cantonal court remains the only occupant of the estate.|$|R
50|$|A 1993 {{ruling by}} the Federal Supreme Court (BGE 119 II 264) allowed for a legal {{procedure}} for the registration of sex changes. In February 2010, in {{an extension of the}} scope of the 1993 Federal Supreme Court ruling, the Federal Office for Civil Registration (EAZW/OFEC/UFSC) of the Federal Department of Justice and Police) advised cantonal executives to legally recognize sex changes {{even in the absence of}} surgery. The EAZW made explicit, with reference to the principle of separation of powers, that the order is binding only for cantonal executive organs and not for <b>cantonal</b> courts of <b>law.</b> The Federal Office for Civil Registration also stated that a marriage can be converted into a registered partnership if one of the partners should register for gender recognition.|$|R
25|$|It is a {{criminal}} offence under <b>cantonal</b> and federal <b>law</b> to wilfully cause one's taxes to be incompletely assessed. The statutes distinguish, however, between tax evasion and tax fraud. Tax evasion is the act of causing a tax to be falsely assessed, such as through the failure to report taxable income. It is classed as a misdemeanour (√úbertretung / contravention) and is punishable by a fine of 33% to 300% {{of the amount of}} tax evaded. Tax fraud, on the other hand, occurs if a tax evasion is committed by using false documents (such as untrue corporate financial reports) for deceptive purposes. It is classed as a crime (Vergehen / crime) and is punishable by additional imprisonment of up to three years or an additional fine of up to 30,000 CHF.|$|R
