5|$|Raël founded Clonaid in March 1997, {{shortly after}} the Dolly the Sheep <b>cloning,</b> believing that the process was {{important}} because the human species had been created by an extraterrestrial <b>cloning</b> project. On a practical level, Raël promoted the practice {{as a way to}} develop more desirable genetics and eventually prolong memories in new bodies. Shortly after Clonaid's launch, Boisselier began publicizing and managing its operations. In 1999, she announced that she had set up <b>cloning</b> laboratories and had hired a team of six scientists. She said she had limited knowledge of <b>cloning</b> but was skilled in selecting experts.|$|E
5|$|After Boisselier {{announced}} that {{no evidence of}} the <b>cloning</b> would be provided, journalists became very skeptical of her story. While discussing Boisselier's management of Clonaid, Palmer notes {{that it is impossible}} to know why she stated that a clone was produced but then refused to provide evidence. She argues that her refusal to provide evidence may have been because she organized a hoax, did not wish to publicize the birth of an unhealthy child, or was taken advantage of by a scientist she had hired. American science journalist Steven S. Hall criticized the media for their coverage of Clonaid, believe that they were inarticulately represented as a credible group. He speculates that the coverage of Boisselier and other <b>cloning</b> adherents galvanized sentiment against <b>cloning,</b> leading to its banning in the U.S.|$|E

40|$|Code <b>clone</b> {{inspection}} is {{an integral}} part of software <b>clone</b> management to assess the quality of <b>clones</b> or the tools reporting them, to decide how to resolve code <b>clone</b> issues, and so on. As <b>clone</b> inspection is a manual process its feasibility is limited especially when working with large numbers of <b>clones.</b> This is rather critical as <b>clone</b> detection tools may return many <b>clones</b> even when applied to medium sized projects. Parameterized <b>Clone</b> Pattern abstracts <b>clones</b> using parameters and merge them into shared “patterns”.

40|$|Abstract—Code <b>clones</b> are {{identical}} or similar code fragments in a code base. A group of code fragments {{that are similar}} to one another forms a <b>clone</b> class. <b>Clone</b> fragments from the same <b>clone</b> class often need to be changed together consistently and thus, they exhibit evolutionary coupling. Evolutionary coupling among <b>clone</b> fragments within a <b>clone</b> class has already been investigated and reported. However, a change to a <b>clone</b> fragment of a <b>clone</b> class may also trigger changes to non-cloned code as well as to <b>clone</b> fragments of other <b>clone</b> classes. Such coupling information is equally important for the proper management of <b>clones</b> during software maintenance. Unfortunately, there are no such studies reported in the literature. In this paper, we describe a large scale empirical study that we conduct to examine whether a <b>clone</b> fragment from a particular <b>clone</b> class exhibits evolutionary coupling with non-clone fragments and/or with <b>clone</b> fragments of other <b>clone</b> classes. Our experimental results on thousands of revisions of six diverse subject systems written in two programming languages indicate the presence of such couplings. We consider both exact and near-miss <b>clones</b> in our study. By analyzing the evolutionary couplings of a particular <b>clone</b> fragment from a particular <b>clone</b> class, we are able to predict its three types of co-change candidates with considerable accuracy in terms of precision and recall. These co-change candidates are: (1) non-clone fragments, (2) <b>clone</b> fragments from <b>clone</b> classes other than its own class, and (3) other <b>clone</b> fragments from its own <b>clone</b> class. Thus, we can improve existing <b>clone</b> tracking techniques so that they can also infer and suggest which non-clone fragments as well as which <b>clone</b> fragments from other <b>clone</b> classes might need to be co-changed correspondingly when modifying a <b>clone</b> fragment from a particular <b>clone</b> class.

5|$|In early 2001, Boisselier {{promised the}} <b>cloning</b> {{of a human}} child within a year, drawing further {{attention}} to her work. A prosecutor in New York began investigating her compliance with local medical laws. Boisselier said that the Food and Drug Administration also surreptitiously investigated her, and Raël claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush was concerned about Clonaid's work. The caretaker of the laboratory that Hunt had rented grew suspicious about their work and contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her <b>cloning</b> work pending legal clarification. After Hunt {{was asked by the}} laboratory's caretaker to shut down the <b>cloning</b> operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at the laboratory. Boisselier then announced that she was moving her <b>cloning</b> operations overseas. Boisselier never faced any legal charges in connection with the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In late 2000, Clonaid {{announced}} that they had received a large donation to fund the <b>cloning</b> of a child, and that Boisselier supervised {{a team of scientists}} at a secret laboratory in the United States who would soon produce a human clone. For the next year, the project received media coverage—and regulatory suspicion—as Boisselier promised the imminent birth of a human clone. In late 2001, she {{announced that}} one had been born and that public evidence would soon be offered. This declaration received significant press coverage in the United States, and Boisselier appeared on many television programs. After a court in Florida launched a child welfare investigation, she stated that the cloned child's parents had withdrawn their offer to provide evidence of the <b>cloning</b> and would have no further public comment. No evidence of the <b>cloning,</b> or subsequent procedures reported by Clonaid, was ever offered, and the announcements were widely perceived to have been a hoax.|$|E

The proliferation of the autoreactive <b>clones</b> stimulated with the inducer <b>clone</b> was blocked by anti-DR monoclonal antibody. Collectively, these findings indicate that the autoreactive <b>clones</b> recognize idiotypic-like determinants on the receptor of the inducer <b>clone</b> in conjunction with DR antigen. The regulatory activity of the autoreactive <b>clones</b> was assayed by co-cultivation with their target inducer <b>clone.</b> The autoreactive <b>clones</b> were not committed to a single program, they could either suppress or enhance the proliferation of the target cells depending on the state of activation of the target cells.

40|$|Abstract—Understanding the {{evolution}} of code <b>clones</b> is im-portant for both developers and researchers to understand the maintenance implications of <b>clones</b> and to design robust <b>clone</b> management systems. Generally, a study of <b>clone</b> evolution starts with extracting <b>clone</b> genealogies across multiple versions of a program and classifying them according to their change patterns. Although these tasks are straightforward for exact <b>clones,</b> extracting the history of near-miss <b>clones</b> and classifying their change patterns automatically is challenging due to the potential diverse variety of <b>clone</b> fragments even in the same <b>clone</b> class. In this tool demonstration paper we describe the design and implementation of a near-miss <b>clone</b> genealogy extractor, gCad, that can extract and classify both exact and near-miss <b>clone</b> genealogies. Developers and researchers can compute {{a wide range of}} popular metrics regarding <b>clone</b> evolution by simply post processing the gCad results. gCad scales well to large subject systems, works for different granularities of <b>clones,</b> and adapts easily to popular <b>clone</b> detection tools.

30|$|For the CP library {{out of the}} <b>clone</b> groups {{affiliated}} with the Bacilli, {{a large number of}} <b>clones</b> were related to Tuberibacillus calidus or Sporolactobacillus laevolacticus (14 <b>clones,</b> 97.0 - 99.0 %), Pullulanibacillus naganoensis (13 <b>clones,</b> 99.4 %), Alicyclobacillus pomorum (4 <b>clones,</b> 98.0 %), and Paenibacillus spp. (7 <b>clones,</b> 90.0 - 95.2 %).

Also, a <b>clone</b> group closely related to Burkholderia terricola in the Betaproteobacteria (6 <b>clones,</b> 97.0 - 99.0 %) was an almost unique dominant group (except for a <b>clone</b> in the BSD library) appearing in the CP library.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Understanding the {{evolution}} of <b>clones</b> is important both for understanding the maintenance implications of <b>clones</b> and building a robust <b>clone</b> management system. To this end, researchers have already conducted {{a number of studies}} to analyze {{the evolution}} of <b>clones,</b> mostly focusing on Type- 1 and Type- 2 <b>clones.</b> However, although there are a significant number of Type- 3 <b>clones</b> in software systems, we know a little how they actually evolve. In this paper, we perform an exploratory study on {{the evolution of}} Type- 1, Type- 2, and Type- 3 <b>clones</b> in six open source software systems written in two different programming languages and compare the result with a previous study to better understand the evolution of Type- 3 <b>clones.</b> Our results show that although Type- 3 <b>clones</b> are more likely to change inconsistently, the absolute number of consistently changed Type- 3 <b>clone</b> classes is higher than that of Type- 1 and Type- 2. Type- 3 <b>clone</b> classes also have a lifespan similar to that of Type- 1 and Type- 2 <b>clones.</b> In addition, a considerable number of Type- 1 and Type- 2 <b>clones</b> convert into Type- 3 <b>clones</b> during evolution. Therefore, it is important to manage type- 3 <b>clones</b> properly to limit their negative impact. However, various automated <b>clone</b> management techniques such as notifying developers about <b>clone</b> changes or linked editing should be chosen carefully due to the inconsistent nature of Type- 3 <b>clones.</b> Index Terms—Type- 3 clones; <b>clone</b> genealogy; <b>clone</b> evolution I...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} broadly assumed that code <b>clones</b> are {{inherently}} bad and that eliminating <b>clones</b> by refactoring would {{solve the problems}} of code <b>clones.</b> To investigate the validity of this assumption, we developed a formal definition of <b>clone</b> evolution and built a <b>clone</b> genealogy tool that automatically extracts the history of code <b>clones</b> from a source code repository. Using our tool we extracted <b>clone</b> genealogy information for two Java open source projects and analyzed their evolution. Our study contradicts some conventional wisdom about <b>clones.</b> In particular, refactoring may not always improve software with respect to <b>clones</b> for two reasons. First, many code <b>clones</b> exist in the system for only a short time; extensive refactoring of such short-lived <b>clones</b> may not be worthwhile if they are likely diverge from one another very soon. Second, many <b>clones,</b> especially long-lived <b>clones</b> that have changed consistently with other elements in the same group, are not easily refactorable due to programming language limitations.

40|$|Code <b>clones</b> are {{identical}} or similar code fragments scattered in a code-base. A group of code fragments {{that are similar}} to one another form a <b>clone</b> group. <b>Clones</b> in a particular group often need to be changed together (i. e., co-changed) consis-tently. However, all <b>clones</b> in a group might not require con-sistent changes, because some <b>clone</b> fragments might evolve independently. Thus, while changing a particular <b>clone</b> frag-ment, it is important for a programmer to know which other <b>clone</b> fragments in the same group should be consistently co-changed with that particular <b>clone</b> fragment. In this research work, we empirically investigate whether we can automatically predict and rank these other <b>clone</b> fragments (i. e., the co-change candidates) from a <b>clone</b> group while making changes to a particular <b>clone</b> fragment in this group. For prediction and ranking we automatically retrieve and infer evolutionary coupling among <b>clones</b> by mining the past <b>clone</b> evolution history. Our experimental result on six subject systems written in two different programming lan-guages (C, and Java) considering both exact and near-miss <b>clones</b> implies that we can automatically predict and rank co-change candidates for <b>clones</b> by analyzing evolutionary coupling.
