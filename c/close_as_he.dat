5|$|Under Boyd's {{captaincy}} Birmingham {{reached the}} semifinals of the 1950–51 FA Cup, {{when they were}} defeated by the powerful Blackpool side of Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen only after a replay. They twice came close to winning promotion, missing out by three points in the 1950–51 season and then on goal average the following year. Boyd's performances were rewarded with selection for England B against Netherlands B, a match played {{in front of a}} crowd of 60,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, but this, and a selection as reserve for a Football League representative team in 1954, was as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> came to full international honours.|$|E
5|$|By 08:00, it {{was clear}} that despite his vessels speed, Stewart's plan was going to fail: the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even {{attempted}} to join his advance, deliberately checking their advance towards the French, falling far behind Windham. Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds, he had no option but to continue the attack: his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate. Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09:30, his shot repeatedly striking Windham as she approached. Stewart did not return fire, instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the inaccuracy of his gunnery. Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly, Stewart absorbed the French fire until he was as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was able before unleashing his guns. The results were disappointing: the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship. The more manoeuvrable Manche now approached Windham at close range, and the two ships fired at one another for over an hour, Stewart still unsupported by his companions, who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range.|$|E
25|$|Gleeson {{grew up in}} Warrnambool, Victoria as {{a member}} of a sports-mad family, with four older {{siblings}} who were all good in their chosen sports of football, basketball and swimming. As a child, Gleeson would sneak as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could to the Melbourne Tigers bench to get a better look at legendary coach Lindsay Gaze and his players during Warrnambool's annual Seaside Basketball tournament every Australia Day weekend. Gleeson was keen on basketball in his youth and w{{as a member of}} Warrnambool's under 14 team which finished third at the Australian championships. In 1985, he graduated from Warrnambool's Emmanuel College.|$|E

25|$|When Ray Illingworth left Yorkshire in 1968 it {{appeared}} that the Test career of the 36-year-old off-spinner was over, but he transferred to Leicestershire and was made captain. Although he had never been captain before his experience and knowledge of the game were widely believed to have helped Yorkshire to their County Championship victories in 1966, 1967 and 1968. The selectors had long regarded Colin Cowdrey as England's natural cricket captain, but he broke an Achilles tendon early in the season and Illingworth was his surprise replacement after only a month as county captain. Illingworth had {{been in and out of}} the national side for years, but had taken 20 wickets (13.30) against India in 1967 and 13 more (22.39) against Australia in 1968. He was originally chosen over his rivals like Brian <b>Close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was not a threat to Cowdrey's long-term captaincy due to his age and inability to establish a regular spot in the Test team. In the Second Test against the West Indies at Lord's in 1969, England collapsed to 61–5, but the new skipper made a forceful 113 out of the last 155 runs and became a hero. He beat both the West Indies and New Zealand 2–0 and was confirmed as captain even when Cowdrey recovered.|$|E
500|$|David Gahr {{took the}} {{gatefold}} photos of Morrison {{surrounded by his}} musicians with {{their wives and children}} at a party for Planet's son, Peter, born from a previous relationship. Morrison dismissed these photos as [...] "rubbish". However, Johnny Rogan commented that the front cover looks far worse; it included a [...] "hilarious" [...] image of Morrison in a full-length kaftan. Morrison complained about the stereotypical front cover as well: [...] "people think you're a hippie because of the long hair and beard. ... I'd bought the kaftan in Woodstock, and that's what people were wearing." [...] Mills agrees that [...] "Van Morrison was never a hippie, but this was as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> came." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1890, Bosbyshell {{deposited}} $4,200 {{of federal}} funds in the Keystone National Bank, which then went bankrupt. [...] Bosbyshell {{was responsible for the}} debt, which was only $300 less than his annual salary, and paid it off by stages, completing the payments in 1894. In August 1890, Bosbyshell was elected colonel of his National Guard regiment; the vote was unexpectedly <b>close,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was disliked by some of his fellow officers. [...] Following the Homestead Riots in July 1892, Pennsylvania Governor Robert E. Pattison ordered militia to the strike-torn town to restore order. [...] Bosbyshell led his guard regiment to Homestead, where the strikers offered no resistance. [...] In August 1893, he resigned from the regiment.|$|E

5000|$|The phrase {{has since}} {{been used by the}} anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba for the title of a song on their album Anarchy.

500|$|Michael Kazin, Bryan's biographer, {{notes the}} many handicaps he faced in his 1896 campaign: [...] "A severe {{economic}} downturn that occurred with Democrats in power, a party deserted by its men of wealth and national prominence, the vehement opposition of most prominent publishers and academics and ministers, and hostility from the nation's largest employers". [...] According to Kazin, [...] "what is remarkable is not that Bryan lost but that he came as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did to winning." [...] Williams believes that Bryan did {{better than any other}} Democrat would have, and comments, [...] "The nominee of a divided and discredited party, he had come remarkably close to winning." [...] Bryan's own explanation was brief: [...] "I have borne the sins of Grover Cleveland." ...|$|E
2500|$|Manga artist Yoichiro Ono {{comments}} {{that although he}} has kept his drawing style as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> could to boys' manga, the story's is aimed at an adult audience and resulted in {{the first volume of}} the manga being [...] "a lot more serious than it ended up being... and more mature".|$|E
2500|$|After a few {{games for}} Hampshire and the {{first-class}} Combined Services team in 1954, Sainsbury {{was a big}} success in his first full season in 1955, taking 102 wickets and scoring 586 runs. He was picked for the MCC [...] "A" [...] tour to Pakistan in 1955-56 and played {{in two of the}} four representative matches. But in an era when England's spin bowling options included Tony Lock, Fred Titmus, Ray Illingworth and Derek Underwood, this was as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> came to Test cricket.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995–96, Messier came as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{had since}} 1991–92 to {{breaking}} the 100-point plateau when, {{at the age}} of 35, he recorded a 99-point season. In 1996–97, former Oilers teammate Wayne Gretzky joined the Rangers, while Messier retained the captaincy and had a respectable 84-point regular season. The two led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were eliminated by the Philadelphia Flyers in five games, as the Rangers could not match the size and strength of Eric Lindros and his [...] "Legion of Doom" [...] linemates. Messier left the club {{at the conclusion of the}} season (see below), ending the brief reunion of Messier and Gretzky being together again on the same team after just one season. It would also turn out to be both players' final playoff appearances.|$|E

60|$|Accordingly, he {{approached}} the doors and beheld it shut <b>closer</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so; yet an open space remained, sufficing for the fair occupant to observe the stranger, without a corresponding display on her part.

60|$|Hare {{felt the}} air growing warmer and <b>closer</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{continued}} the descent.

50|$|With 3:49 {{left in the}} game, Randy White {{recovered}} a Redskins fumble. Roger Staubach only needed three plays to get the Cowboys <b>closer</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> connected with Ron Springs for a 26-yard touchdown.
