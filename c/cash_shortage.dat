25|$|In 1890 Westinghouse's {{company was}} in trouble. The near {{collapse}} of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors {{to call in}} their loans to W.E. The sudden <b>cash</b> <b>shortage</b> forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents.|$|E
25|$|The Army's largest aid to {{the civil}} power role is its cash-in-transit escorts, with over 2000 {{missions}} carried out every year. All large shipments of cash within the State have been provided with armed military escorts since 1978. The Army provides 24-hour armed security at the maximum security Portlaoise Prison and armed escorts for the Prison Service transporting Ireland's most dangerous criminals. The Central Bank of Ireland had the Government put in place contingency plans to provide armed Defence Force security for major Irish banks over public order fears if a <b>cash</b> <b>shortage</b> was triggered {{at the height of}} the 2008/2009 financial crisis.|$|E
25|$|Like many South Korean {{companies}} with construction interests, Tongyang Group companies were often highly leveraged; Tongyang Inc., for instance, had a debt-to-equity ratio of 12-to-1 in June 2013. The group faced a <b>cash</b> <b>shortage</b> in September 2013, leading to doubts about {{its ability to}} repay debts maturing {{at the end of}} the month; NICE Investors Service estimated that it needed to raise ₩800 billion to survive. It was reported that the group would issue securities backed by the assets of key subsidiaries, and then liquidate them. On 30 September 2013, Tongyang Group failed to pay back more than ₩100 billion in debt, and officially filed for court receivership for three of its subsidiaries: Tongyang Corp., Tongyang International, and Tongyang Leisure. The list of subsidiaries in receivership soon expanded to five with the addition of Tongyang Networks and Tongyang Cement.|$|E

5000|$|A {{major element}} of their failure {{was due to}} [...] "Dot-com" [...] {{customers}} who failed to pay their bills, resulting in severe <b>cash</b> <b>shortages.</b> Poor financial control of customer credit worthiness, collections and investment justification contributed to the cash crunch as much as declining demand from customers.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept is}} {{attractive}} to farmers anxious {{to remain in the}} agricultural industry in Suffolk County, but hard-pressed by periodic <b>cash</b> <b>shortages</b> and ever increasing real property taxes, as well as the threat of extensive complications and problems of liquidation upon the death of the farmer.|$|R
25|$|The Hoover Administration {{attempted}} {{to correct the}} economic situation quickly, but was unsuccessful. Throughout Hoover's presidency, businesses were encouraged to keep wage rates high. President Hoover and many academics believed that high wage rates would maintain a steady level of purchasing power, keeping the economy turning. In December 1929, after the beginning phases of the depression had begun, President Hoover continued to promote high wages. It wasn't until 1931 that business owners began reducing wages {{in order to stay}} afloat. Later that year, The Hoover Administration created the Check Tax to generate extra government funding. The tax added a two cent tax to the purchase of all bank checks, directly affecting the common person. This additional cost pushed people away from using checks, so instead {{the majority of the population}} increased their usage of cash. Banks had already closed due to <b>cash</b> <b>shortage,</b> but this reaction to the Check Tax rapidly increased the pace.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years after}} signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near {{collapse}} of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors {{to call in}} their loans to W.E. The sudden <b>cash</b> <b>shortage</b> forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a $15,000 a year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, {{if he did not}} meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to [...] "deal with the bankers" [...] to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse would purchase Tesla's patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison, and Thompson-Houston).|$|E

40|$|The paper gives special {{attention}} to the hyperinflation and <b>cash</b> <b>shortages</b> as well as the possible implications of the measures announced by the Minister of Finance and Economic Development on Tuesday the 29 th of July 2003. An attempt will be made to forecast how well the monetary policy measures are likely to perform given the nature and magnitude of the problems it is meant to address. Whereas the problems bedevilling the economy may have several dimensions, we will not be drawn into argument as to the significance of each of the components since the pre-occupation of this paper is a solution package for the current <b>cash</b> <b>shortages.</b> It is the deliberate intention of this paper to discuss the short-term, implications of the solutions in place by relying on the observation method and a historical comparative approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} a group response-cost {{procedure}} (accompanied by verbal and written instruction) designed to decrease <b>cash</b> <b>shortages</b> in a small business was evaluated with a reversal design. When <b>cash</b> <b>shortages</b> were subtracted from the six employees' salaries on days in which the shortage exceeded 1 % of total daily sales, the magnitude of daily shortages sharply decreased. This response-cost contingency was used only three times throughout the study, with a maximum cost of $ 8. 70 per subject over the 41 -day period. The efficacy of the procedures {{may be due to}} either increased precision in change calculations, a decreased frequency of stealing from the cash register, increased shortchanging of customers, and/or increased incidents of register under-ringing. Ethical questions relative to the utilization of group punishment procedures are raised, and it was concluded that the procedures used were more humane than commonly used alternatives...|$|R
2500|$|Boutwell, an abolitionist, is {{primarily}} {{known for his}} leadership {{in the formation of}} the Republican Party, and his championship of African American citizenship and suffrage rights during Reconstruction. As U.S. Representative, he was instrumental in the construction and passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. As Secretary of Treasury, he made needed reforms in the Treasury Department after the chaos of the American Civil War and the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson. He controversially reduced the national debt by selling Treasury gold and using greenbacks to buy up Treasury bonds, a process that created a <b>cash</b> <b>shortage.</b> Boutwell and President Grant thwarted an attempt to corner the gold market in September 1869 by releasing $4,000,000 of gold into the economy. [...] As U.S. Senator, Boutwell sponsored the Civil Rights Act of 1875.|$|E

50|$|The BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50 stock indices {{fell over}} 6 {{percent on the}} day after the announcement.

5000|$|On 8 November 2016, the Government of India {{announced}} the demonetisation of all [...] and [...] banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series. The government {{claimed that the}} action would curtail the shadow economy and {{crack down on the}} use of illicit and counterfeit cash to fund illegal activity and terrorism. The sudden nature of the announcement—and the prolonged <b>cash</b> <b>shortages</b> in the weeks that followed—created significant disruption throughout the economy, threatening economic output.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cash</b> <b>shortage</b> {{was still}} ongoing {{in the month}} of April 2017, five months after the demonetisation. According to a survey, the {{situation}} was as bad as 83% of people being unable to withdraw money in Hyderabad, while in Pune, the figure was 69%.|$|E
50|$|Unprofitable deals, such as steam yacht Neva {{built in}} Turku in 1904 and four {{submarine}} hulls built in Okhta {{and handed over}} in 1905 caused massive losses to W:m Crichton & C:o. The failed combustion engines caused delays and warranty costs. Moreover, operations had relied on prepayments of new orders and therefore decline of order intake in 1906 led quickly to <b>cash</b> <b>shortage.</b> Ship order intake dropped drastically in 1906 leading to dismissal of hundreds of employees at the Turku yard. By spring 1907 the company was in a serious crisis. In addition to <b>cash</b> <b>shortage</b> the company's machinery and facilities were in poor shape and old fashioned, causing low productivity. The facilities required immediate investments, for which the company had no funds.|$|E
50|$|This dummy {{company was}} set up in May 1933 as a front for {{purchases}} from four German armament manufacturers, Krupp, Siemens, Gutehofnungshütte, and Rheinmetall. The four companies pooled together over 1,000 million Reichsmark where the National Socialist government agreed to repay the money with five-year promissory notes. Soon afterwards, the Nazis discounted the note, basically turning them into a type of currency. When the MEFO notes fell due in 1938, the government discovered a serious <b>cash</b> <b>shortage.</b> To resolve the problem, the Hitler's regime employed “highly dubious methods” where “banks were forced to buy government bonds, and the government took money from savings accounts and insurance companies.” Eventually, the government had to resort to the printing press to help mitigate the <b>cash</b> <b>shortage.</b>|$|E
50|$|DPR {{authorities}} {{have created a}} multi-currency zone in which both the rouble (Russia's currency) and the hryvnia (Ukraine's currency) can be used, and also the Euro and U.S. Dollar. <b>Cash</b> <b>shortages</b> are widespread and, {{due to a lack}} of roubles, the hryvnia is the most-used currency. According to Ukraine's security services in May 2016 alone the Russian government has passed 19 million USD in cash to fund the DPR administration as well as 35,000 blank Russian passports.|$|R
25|$|After Hugo Chávez officially {{took office}} in February 1999, several policy changes {{involving}} the country's oil industry were made to explicitly tie it to the state under his Bolivarian Revolution. Since then, PDVSA has not demonstrated any capability to bring new oil fields onstream since nationalizing heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Petroleum Belt formerly operated by international oil companies ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron and Total.

40|$|The {{motivation}} to countertrade (CT) {{can be attributed}} to many factors including circumventing credit and foreign exchange problems, surmounting barriers to otherwise closed markets, hiding price cuts, or simply the need by exporters to remain competitive. However, CT arrangements essentially constitute packages of buying, selling, and financing contracts.
