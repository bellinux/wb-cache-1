It is widely known {{that the use of}} <b>charge</b> <b>control</b> significantly reduces hysteresis, thus enabling high-accuracy positioning during low speed operations. However, <b>charge</b> <b>control</b> is unable to reduce vibrations that limit the positioning bandwidth. Our main contribution is to overcome this bandwidth limitation by augmenting <b>charge</b> <b>control</b> with inverse feedforward to compensate for vibrations, resulting in a high-bandwidth, highaccuracy positioning system. We apply this integrated method to a piezoelectric tube actuator and experimental results are presented to illustrate the positioning improvements with the proposed integrated approach...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT) technology provide a cost-effective solution to charge wireless devices remotely without disruption to the use. In this paper, we propose an efficient wireless <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> method for exploiting the frequency diversity in multiuser broadband wireless networks, to reduce energy outage and keep the system operating in an efficient and sustainable state. In particular, we first analyze the impact of <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> method to the operating lifetime of a WPT-enabled broadband system. Based on the analysis, we then propose a multi-criteria <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> policy that optimizes the transmit power allocation over frequency by jointly considering the channel state information (CSI) and the battery state information (BSI) of wireless devices. For practical implementation, the proposed scheme is realized by a novel limited CSI estimation mechanism embedded with partial BSI, which significantly reduces the energy cost of CSI and BSI feedback. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed method could significantly increase the network lifetime under stringent transmit power constraint. Reciprocally, it also consumes lower transmit power to achieve near-perpetual network operation than other single-criterion based <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> methods.

30|$|Conversely, if PEV <b>charging</b> can be <b>controlled,</b> wind-integration {{costs can}} be {{decreased}} substantially. Importantly, PEV owners {{do not have}} to ‘hand over’ full <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> to the entity operating the power system. Two hours of <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> is sufficient to achieve much of the cost savings. This is because the benefit of <b>controlled</b> PEV <b>charging</b> is in accommodating errors in estimating wind availability. Wind-forecasting errors tend to smooth out {{over the course of several}} hours. Thus, some limited flexibility in shifting PEV-charging loads around within two hours provides almost as much wind-integration benefit as complete <b>control</b> of PEV <b>charging.</b> We expect that a shorter charging window would deliver less benefits than a two-hour charging window and that a longer charging window would deliver more benefits. Our analysis shows that demand response can be used as an effective means of mitigating wind-integration costs and that PEV charging is a natural source of demand-side flexibility. Moreover, the cost savings achieved by <b>controlling</b> PEV <b>charging</b> could be used to remunerate PEV owners for making <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> available to the power system.|$|R
