40|$|The present paper {{concerns}} the structural behaviour of clad pipes. This {{is a double}} wall <b>pipe,</b> <b>composed</b> by two <b>pipes</b> that are in contact through an appropriate manufacturing procedure; a thick-walled carbon steel "outer pipe", and a thin-walled corrosion-resistant inner pipe, referred to as "liner" pipe. To predict the bending response and the buckling curvature of the thin-walled liner, {{it is necessary to}} account for its contact with the confining thick-walled outer pipe. Because of this confinement, existing numerical solutions or analytical predictions for the bending buckling resistance of unconfined thin-walled tubes are inadequate to predict the buckling resistance of the bent liner. In the present work, the problem is solved numerically, using nonlinear finite elements to simulate the clad pipe, accounting for the interaction between the liner and the outer pipe. First, the manufacturing process of the clad pipe is simulated to determine the liner hoop prestressing. Subsequently, bending curvature is applied (with and without the presence of external pressure). Stresses and strains are monitored throughout the deformation stage with emphasis on possible detachment of the liner from the outer pipe and the formation of local buckling on the liner wall.

The pre-alignment is based on the matching between the branches of three-dimensional skeletons extracted from the two images. We demonstrates that 3 D skeletons can be successfully used to obtain a coarse alignment sufficient to make ICP converge. Moreover, the final ICP is fed only with the matching sub-sets of the two images, thereby alleviating the outliers conditioning. However, ICP is enhanced using the X 84 outliers rejection rule, which makes it more robust. The reconstruction is completed with the fusion of the two images based on the Hoppe-DeRose triangulation.

40|$|After {{a review}} of {{development}} of studies on chaotic motion of fluid particles and fluid mixing by a flow in a curved pipe, numerical results on chaotic motion of fluid particles and fluid mixing by a steady three-dimensional flow through a helix-like circular pipe with periodic variations in curvature and torsion are shown. Studies of chaotic mixing in a curved pipe It is widely known that chaotic mixing is an efficient method for the mixing by laminar flows. Chaotic mixing implies the mixing caused by the chaotic motion of fluids that yields the exponential stretching and folding of fluid elements. Chaotic motion of fluid particles, sometimes called the Lagrangian chaos, has been studied extensively {{on the basis of}} the theory of dynamical systems, as reviewed in [1] and [2]. There are also several studies of chaotic mixing by two-dimensional time-periodic flows or three-dimensional steady flows, as reviewed in [1], [3] and [4]. As a part of such studies, there are studies on the chaotic motion of fluid particles and the enhancement of mixing and heat transfer in steady laminar flows in a curved <b>pipe</b> <b>composed</b> of many segment pipes of constant curvature and zero torsion caused by connecting them with a twist.

50|$|A {{vertical}} {{closed loop}} field is <b>composed</b> of <b>pipes</b> that run vertically in the ground. A hole is bored in the ground, typically 50 to- 400 ft deep. Pipe pairs {{in the hole}} are joined with a U-shaped cross connector {{at the bottom of}} the hole. The borehole is commonly filled with a bentonite grout surrounding the pipe to provide a thermal connection to the surrounding soil or rock to improve the heat transfer. Thermally enhanced grouts are available to improve this heat transfer. Grout also protects the ground water from contamination, and prevents artesian wells from flooding the property. Vertical loop fields are typically used when there is a limited area of land available. Bore holes are spaced at least 5-6 m apart and the depth depends on ground and building characteristics. For illustration, a detached house needing 10 kW (3 ton) of heating capacity might need three boreholes 80 to 110 m deep. (A ton of heat is 12,000 British thermal units per hour (BTU/h) or 3.5 kilowatts.) During the cooling season, the local temperature rise in the bore field is influenced most by the moisture travel in the soil. Reliable heat transfer models have been developed through sample bore holes as well as other tests.|$|R
