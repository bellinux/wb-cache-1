Small, large and very small suppression of Tc have been observed through the Co, Ni and Zn substitution, respectively.

Of 177 neurones tested {{in the presence of}} vasopressin at 1 - 1000 nM, 77 (about 44 %) responded by a reversible increase in firing rate, 12 (about 7 %) were inhibited and the remaining were not affected.

The excitatory effect of vasopressin was postsynaptic, since it was not abolished following synaptic blockade in a low calcium-high magnesium perifusion solution.
