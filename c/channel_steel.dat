A three-dimensional finite element simulation {{was conducted to}} investigate cut end deformation of hat <b>steel</b> <b>channel</b> and its mechanism. When hat <b>steel</b> <b>channel</b> is cut off, the cutting edge will change by the release of residual stress. This change is called cut end deformation. For the <b>steel</b> <b>channel,</b> the top end will close and tail end will open. In contrast, for the hat <b>steel</b> <b>channel,</b> both the top end and the tail end will open.

40|$|Abstract. To {{avoid the}} open {{problems}} of the leading wheel and get a more rational structure, the paper uses PRO / E and the finite element software to analyze the leading wheel of JKM- 3. 25 / 4 multi-rope friction hoist. The results show that in the leading wheel the rib plates between the <b>channel</b> <b>steel</b> and wheel hub are removed or added the same ones will have {{little effect on the}} overall force situation, and only affect the stress of the weld bead. To solve the problem of open weld of rib plates, can consider the rib plates to be removed. When the radial angle between support wheel and drum is bigger than 6 °, the overall force of the leading wheel is affected seriously. But when the radial angle is 5 °, the amplitude of stress fluctuation is the minimum, which can improve the leading wheel working conditions and increase the service life of the leading wheel. Therefore the suggestion is to take the radial angle of 5 ° when to design the new multi-rope hoist. Study conclusions provide the theoretical supports for the leading wheel of multi-rope friction design and technical renovation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Corrugated web girders {{emerged in}} the past two decades. Their main {{advantages}} consists in the possibility to use slender webs avoiding the risk of premature local buckling. Consequently, higher moment capacity might be obtained increasing the beam depth with really thin webs, which are stiffened by the corrugations. Increased interest for this solution was observed for the main frames of single-storey steel buildings and steel bridges. A new solution was proposed at the Politehnica University of Timisoara, in which the beam is composed by a web of trapezoidal steel sheet and flanges of back-to-back lipped <b>channel</b> <b>steel</b> sections. This solution uses self-drilling screws for connecting flanges to the web and to ensure the continuity of the web as seam fasteners. Starting from this new technological solution the paper extends and investigates the use of spot welding as seam fastening to build the web, in order to increase the degree of automation of fabrication. Experimental work of specimens in shear having two or three layers of steel sheets connected by spot welding will be presented. The results will be implemented on a numerical model in order to study the behaviour of the beams presented above...|$|E

Besides, the buckling loads and deformed shapes of the bolted column to I-beam influenced by type of stiffeners have been illustrated.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{numerical}} investigation on the non-linear behaviour and load-carrying capacity of CFRP-strengthened cold-formed steel lipped channel columns - in particular, one studies a total of 16 short and long fixed-ended columns. The fully non-linear numerical analyses are based on shell finite element models, carried out in the code ABAQUS, and adopt an elastic-plastic constitutive law to describe the steel material behaviour. The columns are strengthened with carbon fibre sheets (CFS) glued at different outer surface locations (web, flanges and/or lips) and having fibres oriented either longitudinally or transversally - since the aim of the study is to assess the influence of the CFS on the column structural response, bare steel specimens were also analyzed. The numerical results, which consist of non-linear equilibrium paths (applied load vs. axial shortening) and ultimate strength values (most of them associated with local-plate or distortional failure mechanisms), are subsequently compared with experimental values obtained earlier.

30|$|Cold-formed {{structural}} members {{are being used}} more widely in routine structural design as the world steel industry moves from the production of hot-rolled section and plate to coil and strip, often with galvanized and/or painted coatings. Steel in this form is more easily delivered from the steel mill to the manufacturing plant where it is usually cold-rolled into open and closed section members. In the present experimental study, the use of packing plate at the joints in cold-formed channel sections may increase the load carrying capacity and also reduce the buckling of unconnected cold form <b>channel</b> <b>steel</b> plate at joints. The present study focuses on examining the experimental investigation to use mild steel as a packing plate with cold-formed channel sections by bolted connection at the joints and the connection subjected to axial tension. Series of tests are carried out with increase in the thickness of packing plate and results are observed and analyzed. Total Twelve experimental tests {{have been carried out}} on cold-formed channel tension members fastened with single as well as three numbers of bolts at the connection and from the observations the strength of the joint is increased by increasing the various thicknesses of packing plates and also the buckling of unconnected leg of channel specimen is reduced. It is analyzed by plotting the entire load versus elongation path, so that the behavior of the connection is examined.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} and numerical investigation on the non-linear behaviour and load-carrying capacity of CFRP-strengthened cold-formed steel lipped channel columns, devoting special attention to their local-plate and/or distortional buckling behaviours. A preliminary GBT-based study concerning the column elastic buckling behaviour is performed, focusing on determining the (i) sheet location (web, flanges and/or lips) and (ii) carbon fibre orientation (longitudinal, transverse or inclined) that optimize the strengthening procedure (enhanced buckling behaviour vs. cost). Then, an experimental programme comprising a total of 19 short and long fixed-ended lipped channel columns is described. The columns were strengthened with carbon fibre sheets (CFS) bonded at different outer surface locations (web, flanges or lips) and having the fibres oriented either longitudinally or transversally - since the aim of the study is to assess the influence of the CFS on the column structural response, bare steel specimens were also tested. The experimental results, which consist of non-linear equilibrium paths (applied load vs. axial shortening) and ultimate strength values (most of them associated with local-plate and/or distortional failure mechanisms), are subsequently used to calibrate and validate geometrically and physically non-linear numerical analyses based on shell finite element models and carried out in the code Abaqus.

40|$|Design and {{numerical}} {{investigations of}} cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>channel</b> columns with inclined edge stiffeners {{are presented in}} this paper. The edge stiffeners of the channel sections consisted of simple lips that inclined at different angles both outwards and inwards. Finite el ement analysis {{was used in the}} numerical investigation. A non-linear finite element model was developed and verified against fixed-ended column tests. Geometric and material non-linearities were included in the finite element model. It is shown that the finite element model closely predicted the experimental ultimate loads of the cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>channel</b> columns with inclined edge stiffeners. Hence, the model was used for a parametric study of cross-section geometries. The column strengths predicted by the finite element analysis were compared with the design column strengths calculated using the American and Australian/New Zealand specifications for cold-formed steel structures. The design rules in the American and Australian/New Zealand specifications for designing an edge-stiffened element are mainly based on tests of channels with simple edge stiffeners perpendicular to the flanges. However, these specifications allow the design of inclined edge stiffeners that are purely intuitive. It is shown that the design column strengths calculated from the specifications are generally conservative for cold-formed <b>steel</b> <b>channel</b> columns with inclined edge stiffeners. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{to investigate the}} stiffness and strength enhancement in a structural <b>steel</b> <b>channel</b> section strengthened by six different carbon fiber–reinforced polymer (CFRP) wrapping configurations is described in this paper. An approach of transforming the singly symmetric open section such as a channel section to a closed section by CFRP wrapping {{as a means to}} increase the stiffness and strength is demonstrated. A total of 21 specimens, both CFRP reinforced and bare steel specimens, were tested in four-point bending. Two different CFRPs, unidirectional and bidirectional fabrics, were used in wrapping the specimen. While the unidirectional layers contribute to the stiffness and strength, the bidirectional layer primarily contributes to confining the former in addition to increasing the resistance to lateral torsional buckling (LTB) of the specimens. The results indicate that the CFRP-strengthened closed sections confined by bidirectional fabrics are effective in enhancing the strength and stiffness compared to CFRP skin–strengthened sections (perimeter of bare <b>steel</b> <b>channel</b> sections overlayed with CFRP). The effectiveness of the closed section can be further improved by increasing the unidirectional CFRP layers prior to the final wrapping by bidirectional fibers. The variation in stiffness for all the CFRP configurations from the initial loading of specimens up to the ultimate is also investigated. This paper demonstrates that the strength and stiffness of <b>steel</b> <b>channel</b> sections can be significantly enhanced by means of appropriate CFRP wrapping configuration...|$|R
