40|$|Greenhouse {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on two different alfisols, Bajaura (Loam) and Junga (Sandy loam), that are deficient in boron (B) for cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis). The calcium:boron (Ca:B) ratio in <b>cauliflower</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>with</b> applied B (1 to 3 mg kg− 1 soil) varied from 1276 to 521 in the Bajaura soil with high exchangeable-Ca and no deficiency or toxicity symptoms were evident. In the Junga soil with low exchangeable-Ca, however, the Ca:B ratio varied from 505 to 223 with toxicity symptoms visible when 2 and 3 mg kg− 1 B has been applied. This corresponds to a Ca:B ratio of 256 and 223. Farm yard manure application showed an ameliorating effect on Ca:B ratio with a tendency to decrease a high Ca:B ratio {{in the absence of}} B application and increase a lower Ca:B ratio when incorporated with higher levels of B. The B mobility from leaves to curd decreased with increasing levels of B application and thus provided a circumstantial evidence for B retranslocation under conditions of low B supply i. e. conditional mobility. ...|$|R

2500|$|The bhaajis are {{vegetable}} dishes {{made with}} a particular vegetable or a combination. They {{require the use of}} [...] goda (sweet) masala, essentially consisting of some combination of onion, garlic, ginger, red chilli powder, green chillies and mustard. Depending on the caste or specific religious tradition of a family, onion and garlic may not be used in cooking. A particular variant of bhaaji is the rassa or curry. Vegetarians prepare rassa or curry of potatoes and or <b>cauliflower</b> <b>with</b> tomatoes or fresh coconut kernel and plenty of water to produce a soup-like preparation rather than bhaaji.

40|$|Paintings {{produced}} in Flanders and Holland from the 16 th to the 19 th centuries are useful sources {{for a study}} of the evolution of domesticated crops. They show many types of vegetables, fruits, and ornamentals that are either not described or scantly mentioned in the literature of that period. So we come across "really red" cabbage, which may have been called roosken, and <b>cauliflower</b> <b>with</b> stems some 25 cm long. We further notice many colour variants of grapes, study of which may well provide information on the variation present in the crop at the time. Spikes of wheat and barley were rarely depicted. The few spikes of wheat shown resemble the variety Zeeuwse Witte, a landrace replaced around 1900. Many paintings and illustrations by Flemish and Dutch artists have been distributed all over the world. These works can therefore be investigated in many places for information on the history of domesticated crops...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{conducted}} {{to work out the}} effect of a wide spectrum organophosphorous insecticide, chlorpyriphos (O, O-Diethyl O- 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridyl phosphorothioate) on the morphological features of three commonly grown vegetables in the study area i. e. Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis, Variety: Snowball 16), Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., Variety: Pusa Ruby) and Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L., Variety: Pusa Sawani). Results revealed that on an average, the impact of chlorpyriphos on various morphological parameters of all the three vegetables have been statistically insignificant (using t- Test) except for height of the plants in <b>cauliflower</b> treated <b>with</b> double the recommended dose which exhibited a significant decrease and weight of the head in <b>cauliflower</b> treated <b>with</b> recommended dose of chlorpyriphos which showed a significant increase.

40|$|Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) {{has high}} {{nitrogen}} (N) demand during growing, {{but due to}} its low N use efficiency and N-rich residues, it may cause N losses by leaching after harvest. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of overwintering grass-clover as an intercrop and moderately reduced N fertilization on organic cauliflower yield and risk of nitrate leaching. The experiment tested sole-cropped (S) and intercropped (I) systems using a substitution design and two N fertilizer rates (180 and 230 kg N ha− 1). To investigate the competition between cauliflower and grass-clover, <b>cauliflower</b> grown alone <b>with</b> empty grass-clover rows (Semp) and grass-clover grown alone <b>with</b> empty <b>cauliflower</b> rows (GCemp) were included. The results showed that marketable yield was maintained in the I system compared to in the S system when calculated per meter crop row, and when N fertilization was moderately reduced. The Relative Competition Index (RCI) values in the I system were lower than 0, indicating that cauliflower growth was not interfered in the I system. The ability for aboveground N accumulation in the S and I systems was similar, but the N content of cauliflower residues in the S system was 33 and 23 kg ha− 1 {{higher than in the}} I system in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The S system had 168 kg Ninorg ha− 1 in the soil layer of 0 – 1. 5 m at the start of leaching in 2013, which was 40 kg N ha− 1 higher than the I system. Reduced N fertilizer level led to 22 kg ha− 1 lower soil Ninorg at the end of leaching. However, the effect of system and N level on soil residual Ninorg per unit marketable yield was not significantly different. Intercropping <b>cauliflower</b> <b>with</b> overwintering grass-clover and moderately reduced N fertilization was feasible in organic <b>cauliflower</b> production, <b>with</b> regard to maintaining marketable yield and reducing the risk of nitrate leaching in the agroecosystem...|$|R
