Despite its importance, little {{progress has been made in}} its estimation process, due to the difficulty of producing accurate <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> numbers for the analysis of capital budgeting decisions. This management project details the investigation of the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasts</b> practices and highlights some of the challenges in such <b>forecasts.</b> The <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasts</b> practices have been investigated in an exploratory and explanatory study that has captured qualitative data about the considerations of the practices to improve the level of estimation accuracy. A total of 4 respondents from financial institution, with different levels of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasting</b> experience, participated in the questionnaire study. The results indicate that other than considering the relevant <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> information into <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasts,</b> there are other factors to be considered to experience a higher level of accuracy in such forecasts. The accuracy improves when the financial institution generates detailed <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasts</b> for relatively smaller capital expenditures. In the case of more complex capital expenditure proposals, the financial institution used a range of estimates to evaluate different possible <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> pictures when making capital expenditure decisions. Furthermore, multiple forecasting methods, both quantitative and qualitative forecasting methods are used to incorporate risks and uncertainty in <b>forecasting</b> capital expenditure <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Finally, there are different perceived importance factors, such as financial, marketing and production in the estimation process of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasts.</b> These results suggest that the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasting</b> process or practices are very important in generating accurate <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasts.</b> It is believed that this investigation and other similar studies will help provide the basis to achieve a higher level of accuracy in generating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Inadequate cash {{resources}} resulting from poor <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> {{have been among}} the fundamental causes of construction project failures. Despite the panoply of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasting</b> (CFF) tools, the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> performance of many construction firms have been reported to be poor due weak <b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasting</b> (CFF) process capabilities influenced by a couple of organisational characteristics. Although these organisational characteristics have been reported to significantly influence firms’ CFF process capabilities, the underlying mechanisms of how these organisational features and characteristics exhibit their specific influences on the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecasting</b> capabilities of construction firms still remains underexplored. Therefore, this study aims at empirically exploring the influence of some organisation characteristics on the CFF process capabilities of construction firms. Best practices in CFF identified from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Forecasting</b> (CFF) guide were used to develop an assessment criteria used to assess the CFF capabilities of construction firms.

40|$|Abstract: Cash flows are {{incrementally}} {{useful to}} earnings in security valuation mainly when earnings quality is low. This suggests that when earnings quality decreases, analysts {{will be more}} likely to supplement their earnings forecasts with cash flow estimates. Contrary to this prediction, we find that analysts do not disclose cash flow forecasts when the quality of earnings is low. This is because <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecast</b> accuracy depends on the accuracy of the accrual estimates and the precision of accrual forecasts decreases for firms with low quality earnings. Consequently, as earnings quality decreases, cash flow forecasts become increasingly inaccurate compared to earnings estimates. Cash flow estimates that lack reliability are not useful to investors and, consequently, unlikely to be reported by analysts. This result provides an explanation for why analysts are less likely to report cash flow estimates when earnings quality is low...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on the usefulness of analysts’ cash flow forecasts is unsettled, with Call et al.

Target prices provide a good setting to test the usefulness of cash flow forecasts because they are an ultimate output of an analyst's valuation process to which cash flow forecasts are an input. Moreover, studying the effect of cash flow forecasts on target prices is more relevant for assessing their usefulness than is studying their effect on earnings forecast accuracy, as the accuracy of target prices requires a comparison with market prices, which are less subject to management influence than reported earnings. By improving an analyst's understanding of unexpected accruals and permanent earnings, a <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>forecast</b> can increase an analyst's target price accuracy and signal an analyst's superior forecasting ability. We examine whether, conditional on their earnings forecasts, analysts’ cash flow forecasts improve their target price accuracy. We find that when analysts issue cash flow forecasts, their target price accuracy increases. We also find that this accuracy increases with the accuracy of their cash flow forecasts. Finally, we find that this increased target price accuracy is greater for more challenging-to-value firms.
