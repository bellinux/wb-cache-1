40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} designing energy efficient cloud computing services over non-bypass IP/WDM core networks. We investigate network related factors including the centralization versus distribution of clouds {{and the impact of}} demand, content popularity and access frequency on the clouds placement, and cloud capability factors including the number of servers, switches and routers and amount of storage required in each cloud. We study the optimization of three cloud services: <b>cloud</b> <b>content</b> delivery, storage as a service (StaaS), and virtual machines (VMS) placement for processing applications. First, we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize <b>cloud</b> <b>content</b> delivery services. Our results indicate that replicating content into multiple clouds based on content popularity yields 43 % total saving in power consumption compared to power un-aware centralized content delivery. Based on the model insights, we develop an energy efficient <b>cloud</b> <b>content</b> delivery heuristic, DEER-CD, with comparable power efficiency to the MILP results. Second, we extend the content delivery model to optimize StaaS applications. The results show that migrating content according to its access frequency yields up to 48 % network power savings compared to serving content from a single central location. Third, we optimize the placement of VMs to minimize the total power consumption. Our results show that slicing the VMs into smaller VMs and placing them in proximity to their users saves 25 % of the total power compared to a single virtualized cloud scenario. We also develop a heuristic for real time VM placement (DEER-VM) that achieves comparable power savings...|$|E
40|$|Determining {{the total}} amount of water {{contained}} in an icing cloud necessitates the measurement of both the liquid droplets and ice particles. One commonly accepted method for measuring <b>cloud</b> water <b>content</b> utilizes a hot wire sensing element, which is maintained at a constant temperature. In this approach, the <b>cloud</b> water <b>content</b> is equated with the power required to keep the sense element at a constant temperature. This method inherently assumes that impinging cloud particles remain on the sensing element surface long enough to be evaporated. In the case of ice particles, this assumption requires that the particles do not bounce off the surface after impact. Recent tests aimed at characterizing ice particle impact on a thermally heated wing section, have raised questions about the validity of this assumption. Ice particles were observed to bounce off the heated wing section a very high percentage of the time. This result could have implications for Total Water Content sensors which are designed to capture ice particles, and thus do not account for bouncing or breakup of ice particles. Based on these results, a test was conducted to investigate ice particle impact on the sensing elements of the following hot-wire <b>cloud</b> water <b>content</b> probes: (1) Nevzorov Total Water Content (TWC) /Liquid Water Content (LWC) probe, (2) Science Engineering Associates TWC probe, and (3) Particle Measuring Systems King probe. Close-up video imaging was used to study ice particle impact on the sensing element of each probe. The measured water content from each probe was also determined for each cloud condition. This paper will present results from this investigation and attempt to evaluate the significance of ice particle impact on hot-wire <b>cloud</b> water <b>content</b> measurements...|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{composition}} and characteristics of cloud in guava puree prepared at various heating temperatures. The <b>cloud</b> <b>content</b> in guava puree was initially at 0. 1 % and increased greatly with increased heating temperature due to the polymerization of components (i. e., pectin and protein) in the puree. The <b>cloud</b> <b>content</b> in guava puree was significantly correlated with the change of its turbidity. Guava puree cloud {{was found to be}} composed of 43 - 45 % protein, 25 - 26 % carbohydrate, 5 - 8 % pectin, 3 - 5 % crude fiber, 6. 5 - 9. 3 % ash, and 0. 18 % crude fat. The analyses of protein pattern and amino acid composition showed that the protein in cloud was of a low molecular weight, with a high isoelectric point and a compact structure; thus, it could combine with pectin and become suspended in the guava puree. The amount of divalent cation increased with increasing heating temperature, indicating that divalent cations could promote aggregation of components in puree. Phenolic compounds also contribute to the turbidity and sediment in puree...|$|E

40|$|The subgrid-scale spatial {{variability}} in <b>cloud</b> water <b>content</b> {{can be described}} by a parameter f called the fractional standard deviation. This {{is equal to the}} standard deviation of the <b>cloud</b> water <b>content</b> divided by the mean. This parameter is an input to schemes that calculate the impact of subgrid-scale cloud inhomogeneity on gridbox-mean radiative fluxes and microphysical process rates. A new regime-dependent parametrization of the {{spatial variability}} of <b>cloud</b> water <b>content</b> is derived from CloudSat observations of ice clouds. In addition to the dependencies on horizontal and vertical resolution and cloud fraction included in previous parametrizations, the new parametrization includes an explicit dependence on cloud type. The new parametrization is then implemented in the Global Atmosphere 6 (GA 6) configuration of the Met Office Unified Model and used to model the effects of subgrid variability of both ice and liquid water content on radiative fluxes and autoconversion and accretion rates in three 20 -year atmosphere-only climate simulations. These simulations show the impact of the new regime-dependent parametrization on diagnostic radiation calculations, interactive radiation calculations and both interactive radiation calculations and in a new warm microphysics scheme. The control simulation uses a globally constant f value of 0. 75 to model the effect of <b>cloud</b> water <b>content</b> variability on radiative fluxes. The use of the new regime-dependent parametrization in the model results in a global mean which is higher than the control's fixed value and a global distribution of f which is closer to CloudSat observations. When the new regime-dependent parametrization is used in radiative transfer calculations only, the magnitudes of short-wave and long-wave top of atmosphere cloud radiative forcing are reduced, increasing the existing global mean biases in the control. When also applied in a new warm microphysics scheme, the short-wave global mean bias is reduced...|$|R
