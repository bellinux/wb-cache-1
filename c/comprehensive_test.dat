40|$|Objectives To analyse {{changes in}} testing for sexually {{transmissible}} infections (STI) among gay and bisexual men in Melbourne, Sydney and Queensland, Australia, particularly <b>comprehensive</b> STI <b>testing</b> (at least four tests from different anatomical {{sites in the}} previous year), and the characteristics of men who had such testing. Method Data were analysed from repeated, cross-sectional, community-based surveys conducted during 2003 – 2012. Trends in specific STI <b>tests</b> and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> were assessed and the characteristics of participants who reported <b>comprehensive</b> STI <b>testing</b> were identified using multivariate logistic regression, stratified by HIV status. Results Among HIV-negative and unknown status men (n= 51   009), comprehensive STI and HIV testing increased substantially from 13 % in 2003 to 34 % in 2012. During the same period, <b>comprehensive</b> STI <b>testing</b> (excluding HIV testing) increased from 24 % to 57 % among HIV-positive men (n= 5532). In both HIV status groups, <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> was more commonly reported by men who had unprotected anal intercourse with casual partners, and men with higher numbers of partners. Among HIV-negative/unknown status participants, comprehensive STI and HIV testing was also associated with education level, regional location and finding partners online. Among HIV-positive men, <b>comprehensive</b> STI <b>testing</b> was also associated with free time spent with gay men and illicit drug use. <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> was related to a high annual rate of diagnosis with STIs (20 % of HIV-negative/unknown status men and 38 % of HIV-positive men). Conclusions There has been a substantial improvement {{in the proportion of}} gay and bisexual men in Melbourne, Sydney and Queensland who report <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing.</b> <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> is most likely among men whose practices put them at increased risk of infection, and is associated with a high rate of STI diagnosis. However, opportunities for <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> are still being missed, suggesting a need for its ongoing promotion...|$|R

However, the sides remained at odds over the precise details of verification and talks would permanently disband with the departure of President Jimmy Carter in 1981.|$|E

5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>test</b> ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} for a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>test</b> ban conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests. On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth announced a new US proposal by which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and outer-space tests within detection range. Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on the Richter scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{progress}} accelerated {{towards a}} <b>comprehensive</b> <b>test</b> ban treaty (CTBT).

In September 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect for states not party to the CTBT. The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China. France, Russia, and the UK have ratified the CTBT.

They hypothesized that Philcoxia could be carnivorous, capturing nematodes and possibly soil microbes like Utricularia and Genlisea do. Ultimately, Fritsch's study concluded that while no protease activity was detected, this fact does not rule out the possibility that the genus may be carnivorous in some other way. They note that there are many possibilities, such as seasonal carnivory or the unusual growth form being an adaptation to the heat and sun, and more study is needed before precise conclusions can be reached.|$|E
