There he offered various photographic services, including double and family portraits. When he returned to Batavia in September, he opened another studio, offering portraits and selling prints of landscapes.|$|E

His <b>commercial</b> <b>firm</b> lent 662,000 pesos to the government in copper, receiving payment in silver. He was much attacked for this in the press. He imposed a tax of 3 per 1,000 on rural and urban property and raised the consumption tax 10%. He wanted to amortize the copper coinage through an agreement with the tobacco firms. By these and other measures he greatly improved the situation of the treasury.|$|E

500|$|Due to its {{strategic}} location, currencies from several countries began circulating in Puerto Rico {{and used as}} trade. The government often ordered the collection of these coins in exchange for exchange notes. The first of these took place in 1857, when a royal decree ordered the gathering of macuquina coins. These arrived to Puerto Rico in 1813, originally produced by Spain in Venezuela. Due to Spanish manufacture, the exchange notes issued for the macuquina featured a 12.5% discount, which left a significant deficit in the government's budget. A decade later, coins were brought from the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico. Consequently, the distribution of foreign coins received authorization. In 1879, the circulation of Mexican silver was approved in government and official entities, eventually allowing public distribution in 1881. However, some saw an opportunity for profit in this and bought Mexican pesos outside of Puerto Rico before importing them, in the process gaining a profit of up to 40 centavos per peso. In 1884, {{a number of different}} coins were countermarked with a fleur-de-lis for circulation on Puerto Rico. Spanish 2, 4 and 8 reales, and 5 and 10 centimos, United States' 20 cents, quarters, halves and dollars were all countermarked and used until they were redeemed in 1894. By 1895, the coins circulating in Puerto Rico were mostly Mexican silver, creating a shortage of currency. To resolve this, Spain issued a Royal Decree stating that the Mexican coins were to be replaced by ones minted in Madrid, with special coins created exclusively for Puerto Rico. To execute this move, exchange notes in one-peso denomination were created. Once the exchange concluded in 1896, the provincial coin was already in circulation. Silver 20 centavos and 1 peso coins were introduced in 1895, followed in 1896 by silver 5, 10 and 40 centavos. The 1 peso coins bore the denomination as [...] "1 PESO = 5 P.TAS". These exchanges heavily affected the government's economy. Some years later, Ceredo Millán a <b>commercial</b> <b>firm</b> in San Juan obtained some of the now-obsolete Exchange Notes, which were converted into souvenirs and offered as gifts to their clients.|$|E

40|$|Context: Open Source Software (OSS) {{development}} is a highly distributed and collaborative activity and was initially performed by developers volunteering their time and effort. During the recent years, OSS has transformed to become a more mainstream and commercially viable software development approach. This {{is reflected in the}} increasing involvement from <b>commercial</b> <b>firms.</b> Currently, there exist little or no research literature examining how <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> collaborate across organizational boundaries and how this may affect community-based OSS projects. Objective: This thesis aims to help fill the identified gap by investigating the influence of organizational boundary on team collaboration and project evolution in community-based OSS projects by answering the following research questions: RQ 1 : How do <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> collaborate across organizational boundaries in community-based OSS projects?RQ 2 : How influential is firm awareness in community-based OSS projects?Method: A two-phased case study approach was adopted, compromising exploratory and descriptive analysis. The cases, Wireshark and Samba, were examined in a quantitative and qualitative approach using found documents and conducting interviews with firm-paid developers. Social network and thematic content analysis were applied. Results: This thesis provides the following three contributions:C 1 : Empirical data from two OSS projects providing knowledge related to how <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> collaborate with each others across organizational boundaries in community-based OSS projects. C 2 : A conceptual model illustrating <b>commercial</b> <b>firm?s</b> collaboration patterns across organizational boundaries in community-based OSS projects, extending Crowston?s onion model. C 3 : A set of recommendations to <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> that want to participate and utilize community-based OSS projects. Conclusion: <b>Commercial</b> <b>firms</b> participate and collaborate heavily in community-based OSS projects and are present in all the roles identified in Crowston?s onion model. Furthermore, independently of firm size and degree of involvement, the firms commonly have one person acting as a gatekeeper between the community and firm managing code, communication and/or bug issues. The findings indicate that firm awareness is {{a vital part of the}} firm cross-collaboration and mainly influence the development in a positive manner. </p...|$|R

[...] The rule states that in general, [...] "an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to, an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the insured depository institution, or any related interest of such person ... unless— the transaction is on market terms; {{and if the}} transaction represents more than 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution, the transaction has been approved in advance {{by a majority of}} the members of the board of directors of the insured depository institution who do not have an interest in the transaction." [...] Providing for the regulation of capital, the Volcker Rule says that regulators are required to impose upon institutions capital requirements that are [...] "countercyclical, so that the amount of capital required to be maintained by a company increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction", to ensure the safety and soundness of the organization. The rule also provides that an insured state bank may engage in a derivative transaction only if the law with respect to lending limits of the state in which the insured state bank is chartered takes into consideration credit exposure to derivative transactions.

40|$|During 2005 - 2006, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, {{and several}} other <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> applied to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for {{permission}} to acquire FDIC-insured industrial loan companies (ILCs). Those applications were opposed by business groups, labor unions, community activists, and members of Congress. In January 2007, the FDIC imposed a one-year moratorium on all acquisitions of ILCs by <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> and asked Congress to determine whether such acquisitions should be prohibited. As the FDIC noted, acquisitions of ILCs by <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> raise three important policy issues, which are addressed in this Article. First, commercial ownership of ILCs conflicts with the policy of separating banking and commerce, which has been generally followed in the United States since 1787 and has gained strength over time. Banks have frequently tried to engage in commercial activities, and <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> have often attempted {{to gain control of}} banks. However, federal and state legislators have repeatedly passed laws to separate banking and commerce whenever it appeared that either (i) the involvement of banks in commercial activities threatened their safety and soundness, or (ii) <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> were acquiring large numbers of banks. ILCs represent the last remaining exception to the policy of prohibiting commercial ownership of banks. Second, acquisitions of ILCs by <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> will produce serious risks for our nation 2 ̆ 7 s financial system and economy. Commercially-owned ILCs will extend federal safety net subsidies to the commercial sector, and ILCs will have strong incentives to make loans and investments that benefit their commercial affiliates. Commercial ownership of ILCs therefore creates a competitive imbalance between <b>commercial</b> <b>firms</b> that own ILCs and those that do not. Commercially-owned ILCs are also vulnerable to contagious losses of confidence resulting from problems at their parent companies. Accordingly, federal regulators may feel compelled to arrange too big to fail bailouts of large troubled parent companies of ILCs. Third, the FDIC currently does not have authority to exercise consolidated supervision over commercial owners of ILCs. Any grant of such authority to the FDIC would have adverse consequences. The FDIC does not have the expertise or resources to identify and control the risks presented by commercial owners of ILCs. In addition, mandating FDIC supervision of commercial parent companies would significantly increase the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s interference in the general economy. FDIC supervision of commercial owners could also impair market discipline by causing market participants to expect FDIC support for such owners during financial crises. For all these reasons, Congress should prohibit further acquisitions of ILCs by <b>commercial</b> <b>firms...</b>|$|R
