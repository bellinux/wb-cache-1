He created the Leitz publication Leica Photography in 1932 and continued to publicize the Leica camera. He also patented the FocoSlide, a <b>copying</b> <b>device</b> manufactured by Leitz, which improved the Leica’s performance in copy and macro applications by allowing the photographer to view exactly what the lens would see, without parallax.

It turned out that due to a severe shortage of official development hardware from Nintendo, many game developers had been buying from Bung instead.

However, Chuck's spy life {{interrupts}} when Casey and Sarah inform Chuck {{that he is}} needed for an immediate mission to recover a list of CIA Fulcrum agents that Guy LaFleur had apparently hidden {{in his hotel room}} before being murdered. Jealousy erupts when Jill finally meets Sarah and learns that Chuck and his handler must pose as a couple, especially when she learns that Sarah is posing as a seductively-dressed escort for the mission. Chuck does his best to reassure Jill that his relationship with Sarah is purely business but only finds himself in more trouble when Jill finds Chuck and Sarah in their hotel room in their underwear after trying to wash off a suspected bioweapon. Chuck desperately tries to explain the surreal situation that Jill witnessed, to which Jill responded with curiosity, revealing LaFleur's affinity to puzzles and vague references to safeguard his valuable information. The team recovers a music box in LaFleur's room, deciphering the clue with Jill's assistance, which leads them to the opera, where they recover an encrypted flash drive with the Fulcrum list. Chuck and Jill leave for a romantic getaway, during which Jill is kidnapped by a Fulcrum agent and held hostage in exchange for the list. Chuck agrees to the exchange, but first makes a copy of the list with Morgan's <b>copying</b> <b>device</b> (designed to copy video games, but apparently able to copy anything). Chuck and Jill embark on another romantic getaway, during which Sarah and Casey discover from the recovered list that Jill is a Fulcrum agent herself. The episode ends with Sarah and Casey rushing to Chuck's room only to find his watch and the next scene shows Chuck and Jill driving away with Chuck completely oblivious to her identity.|$|E

40|$|While it {{is known}} that copying a quantum system does not {{increase}} the amount of information obtainable about the originals, it may increase the amount available in practice, when one is restricted to imperfect measurements. We present a detection scheme which using imperfect detectors, and possibly noisy quantum copying machines (that entangle the copies), allows one to extract more information from an incoming signal, than with the imperfect detectors alone. The case of single-photon detection with noisy, inefficient detectors and copiers (single controlled-NOT gates in this case) is investigated in detail. The improvement in distinguishability between a photon and vacuum is found to occur {{for a wide range of}} parameters, and to be quite robust to random noise.

40|$|Information {{processing}} at {{the molecular}} scale is limited by thermal fluctuations. This can cause undesired consequences in copying information since thermal noise can lead to errors that can compromise the functionality of the copy. For example, a high error rate during DNA duplication can lead to cell death. Given the importance of accurate copying {{at the molecular}} scale, it is fundamental to understand its thermodynamic features. In this paper, we derive a universal expression for the copy error {{as a function of}} entropy production and work dissipated by the system during wrong incorporations. Its derivation is based on the second law of thermodynamics, hence its validity is independent of the details of the molecular machinery, be it any polymerase or artificial <b>copying</b> <b>device.</b> Using this expression, we find that information can be copied in three different regimes. In two of them, work is dissipated to either increase or decrease the error. In the third regime, the protocol extracts work while correcting errors, reminiscent of a Maxwell demon. As a case study, we apply our framework to study a copy protocol assisted by kinetic proofreading, and show that it can operate in any of these three regimes. We finally show that, for any effective proofreading scheme, error reduction is limited by the chemical driving of the proofreading reaction. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

5000|$|Device {{mirroring}} (replication) - A common {{solution to}} the problem is constantly maintaining an identical <b>copy</b> of <b>device</b> content on another device (typically of a same type). The downside is that this doubles the storage, and both <b>devices</b> (<b>copies)</b> need to be updated simultaneously with some overhead and possibly some delays. The upside is possible concurrent read of a same data group by two independent processes, which increases performance.
