5|$|As {{a result}} of its target value and vulnerability, {{aircraft}} <b>carriers</b> <b>are</b> always escorted by at least one submarine for protection. The other vessels in the Strike Group provide additional capabilities, such as long range Tomahawk missiles or the Aegis Combat System, and also protect the carrier from attack. A typical Strike Group may include, in addition to an aircraft carrier: up to six surface combatants, including frigates (since retired from USN service), guided missile cruisers and guided missile destroyers (used primarily for anti-aircraft warfare and anti-submarine warfare); one or two attack submarines (for seeking out and destroying hostile surface ships and submarines); and an ammunition, oiler, and supply ship of Military Sealift Command to provide logistical support. The precise structure and numbers of each type of ship can vary between groups depending on the objectives of the deployment.|$|E
5|$|Star Alliance Gold {{status is}} given to {{customers}} who have {{reached a higher level}} of a member airline's frequent-flyer program. Benefits are priority reservations wait-listing, airport stand-by and check-in and baggage handling; an additional checked luggage allowance of 20kg (or one extra piece, where the piece rule applies), and access to designated Star Alliance Gold lounges the day and place of departure with the presentation of a Star Alliance boarding pass. Some airlines also offer preferred seating (an exit seat or a special section of the plane); guaranteed seating on fully booked flights, subject to the booking class code and notice period, and free upgrades {{in the form of a}} voucher, certificate or automatic upgrade at check-in. United restricts US lounge access for their Gold Members to long-haul international passengers; Gold members from other <b>carriers</b> <b>are</b> welcome in US lounges run by United on all itineraries.|$|E

50|$|However, by July 1995 the <b>carrier</b> <b>was</b> {{unable to}} pay its fees {{at the airport and}} sought out an {{alliance}} with Minneapolis-based Great Lakes Aviation to generate additional revenue. In August 1995, the deal with Great Lakes became official and the <b>carrier</b> <b>was</b> rebranded as Arizona Airways Express.

25|$|Photosystem II {{is located}} {{mostly in the}} grana thylakoids, whereas photosystem I and ATP synthase are mostly located in the stroma thylakoids and the outer layers of grana. The {{cytochrome}} b6f complex is distributed evenly throughout thylakoid membranes. Due to the separate location of the two photosystems in the thylakoid membrane system, mobile electron <b>carriers</b> <b>are</b> required to shuttle electrons between them. These <b>carriers</b> <b>are</b> plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Plastoquinone shuttles electrons from photosystem II to the cytochrome b6f complex, whereas plastocyanin carries electrons from the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I.|$|E

50|$|A light {{aircraft}} carrier, or light fleet <b>carrier,</b> <b>is</b> an aircraft <b>carrier</b> that <b>is</b> {{smaller than the}} standard carriers of a navy. The precise definition of the type varies by country; light carriers typically have a complement of aircraft only one-half to two-thirds {{the size of a}} full-sized fleet carrier. A light <b>carrier</b> <b>was</b> similar in concept to an escort carrier in most respects, however light <b>carriers</b> <b>were</b> intended for higher speeds to be deployed alongside fleet carriers, while escort carriers usually defended convoys and provided air support during amphibious operations.|$|R

50|$|A fleet <b>carrier</b> <b>is</b> {{intended}} {{to operate with}} the main fleet and usually provides an offensive capability. These <b>are</b> the largest <b>carriers</b> capable of fast speeds. By comparison, escort <b>carriers</b> <b>were</b> developed to provide defense for convoys of ships. They were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried. Most were built from mercantile hulls or, {{in the case of}} merchant aircraft <b>carriers,</b> <b>were</b> bulk cargo ships with a flight deck added on top. Light aircraft <b>carriers</b> <b>were</b> fast enough to operate with the main fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity. Soviet aircraft carriers now in use by Russia are actually called heavy aviation cruisers; these ships, while sized in the range of large fleet <b>carriers,</b> <b>were</b> designed to deploy alone or with escorts, and provide both strong defensive weaponry and heavy offensive missiles equivalent to a guided missile cruiser, in addition to supporting fighters and helicopters.|$|R

25|$|A {{collecting}} dabbawala, {{usually on}} bicycle, collects dabbas either from a worker's home {{or from the}} dabba makers.

25|$|A fleet carrier is an {{aircraft}} carrier designed to operate with the main fleet of a nation's navy. The term was developed during World War II, to distinguish it from the escort carrier and other lesser types.

25|$|Carrier {{testing for}} Roberts {{syndrome}} requires prior {{identification of the}} disease-causing mutation in the family. Carriers for the disorder are heterozygotes due to the autosomal recessive nature of the disease. <b>Carriers</b> <b>are</b> also not at risk for contracting Roberts syndrome themselves. A prenatal diagnosis of Roberts syndrome requires an ultrasound examination paired with cytogenetic testing or prior identification of the disease-causing ESCO2 mutations in the family.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that heterozygote carriers of the Wilson's disease gene mutation may be potentially more susceptible to elevated copper intake than the general population.
