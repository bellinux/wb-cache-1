Robotic cells can have a linear or a circular layout: most classical results on linear cells cannot be extended to <b>circular</b> <b>cells,</b> {{making it difficult to}} quantify the potential gain brought by the latter configuration. Moreover, though the problem of finding the best one part production cycle is polynomial for linear cells, it is NP-hard for <b>circular</b> <b>cells.</b> We consider the special case of <b>circular</b> balanced <b>cells.</b> We first consider three basic production cycles, and focus on one which is specific to <b>circular</b> <b>cells,</b> for which we establish the expression of the cycle time.

30|$|Due to {{the removal}} of all single <b>circular</b> <b>cells</b> in self-orthogonalizing {{processors}} and redundant single <b>circular</b> <b>cells</b> in referential-orthogonalizing processors of a SPMLS in combining multiple lattice filters, the complexity of a SPMLS reduces from (12 M 2 + 7 M) to (12 M 2 +M). Therefore, the total complexity for the R-CMLF scheme is (12 NM 2 + 2 MN+ 3 M+ 1), whereas it is (12 NM 2 + 5 MN+N) for the D-CMLF scheme. If the convergence of the slower component filters is required to be sped up by transferring {{a part of the}} equivalent reflection coefficients to the reflection coefficients of the component filters, the complexities of the proposed schemes increase due to the transfer term in Eq. (34), and momentum terms in Eqs. (33) and (52), which together amount to an additional complexity of (2 MN+ 5 M−N+ 3). Accordingly, the total complexities for the R-CMLF and D-CMLF schemes with transfer and momentum (t/m) terms become (12 NM 2 + 4 MN+ 8 M−N+ 4) and (12 NM 2 + 7 MN+ 5 M+ 3) respectively.|$|R

50|$|New {{colonies and}} nests are usually founded by an {{association}} of females; female associations {{are responsible for the}} success of 51.5% of new colonies. When constructing these nests, the Polistes versicolor has been identified to engage in consistent behavioral actions. Before beginning the construction, the foundress first makes recognition flights, inspecting the structure to be used for the nest by flying close to the selected area and touching the substratum with its antennae. Once the location for the new colony foundation is established, the construction begins with the peduncle: vegetable material is chewed with saliva and then attached to the substrate in thread form. The first cell is then constructed with a circular format, during which the female constantly touches the cell sides with its antennae. Afterwards, hexagonal outlines are formed as peripheral cells are built around the initial <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> and attached to neighboring cells. As larvae develop in the cells, chewed vegetable fiber is added to the extremities of the cells to elevate their wall height. Throughout the colony cycle, as the colonies grow and the cell numbers increase, the peduncle is further reinforced with additional plant fiber to ensure adequate support for the nest as it enlarges.|$|E

The finite element <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> model consists of axisymmetric triangular and/or quadrilateral ring elements for soil and cylindrical shell elements for the steel cell. To formulate and derive the governing equations for such elements, the Ritz displacement functions and the theorem of minimum potential energy are used. The loadings of the bulkhead system and corresponding displacements are expanded in Fourier series. The soil fill and foundation are assumed to be elastic, isotropic and non-homogeneous materials. It is assumed that there is no slippage in the soil-steel shell interface. The element matrices and the Fourier harmonic analysis are verified by comparing results for several structures for which classical solutions are available. The <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> bulkhead is analyzed for stresses in the soil elements and shell elements and deformations for the isolated filled cell and backfilled cell cases.

40|$|We {{utilized}} a new cell ablation {{strategy to}} ablate specific anther cell types {{involved in the}} dehiscence process. The tobacco TA 56 gene promoter is active within the <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> cluster, stomium, and connective regions of the anther at different developmental stages. We introduced a cytotoxic TA 56 /barnase gene into tobacco plants together with three different anticytotoxic barstar genes. The anticytotoxic barstar genes were used to protect subsets of anther cell types from the cytotoxic effects of the TA 56 /barnase gene. The chimeric barstar genes were fused with (1) the tobacco TP 12 gene promoter that is active at high levels in most anther cell types; (2) the soybean lectin gene promoter that is active earlier in the connective, and at lower levels in the <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> cluster and stomium, than is the TA 56 promoter; and (3) the tobacco TA 20 gene promoter that is active at high levels in most anther cell types but has a different developmental profile than does the TP 12 promoter. Normal anther development and dehiscence occurred in plants containing the TA 56 /barnase and TP 12 /barstar genes, indicating that barstar protects diverse anther cell types from the cytotoxic effects of barnase. Anthers containing the TA 56 /barnase and lectin/barstar genes also developed normally but failed to dehisce because of extensive ablation of the <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> cluster, stomium, and contiguous connective regions. Anthers containing the TA 56 /barnase and TA 20 /barstar genes failed to dehisce as well. However, only the stomium region was ablated in these anthers. The connective, <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> cluster, and adjacent wall regions were protected from ablation by the formation of barnase/barstar complexes. We conclude that anther dehiscence at flower opening depends {{on the presence of}} a functional stomium region and that chimeric barnase and barstar genes containing promoters that are active in several overlapping cell types can be used for targeted cell ablation experiments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} work {{deals with the}} {{simulation}} of fractal growth patterns in electrodeposition (Diffusion limited aggregation) using concept of off lattice random walk. The simulation of electrodeposition under different electric field conditions is implemented to simulate the growth of dendritic patterns in <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> geometry. The DLA growth in <b>circular</b> <b>cell</b> geometry is {{under the influence of}} two main driving forces, namely, the random Brownian motion of the ions and the radial ionic motion due to the applied electric field. In the simulation, the effect of radial movement of ions is superimposed over the zigzag random motion of the ions in the electrolyte. The relative influence of the random motion and radial motion is controlled by introducing a biasing parameter. It is observed that the growth patterns with lower values of bias (corresponding to lower electric field) are less crowded with limited branching and more closely resemble true DLA. As the electric field is increased (higher value of B), the growth tends to be dense and with more crowding of branches. The box counting technique was implemented to calculate the fractal dimensions of the patterns developed. The results are compared with the experimental observations...|$|E

The longitudinal muscle layer consisted of about 20 layers of smooth muscle cells and the extracellular space occupied about 12. 1 % {{of the cross}} sectional area. The circular muscle layer consisted of closely packed muscle bundles arranged side by side. The extracellular space within the bundle represented about 4. 4 % of the cross sectional area. Nexuses were consistently found in the circular muscle layer but {{could not be found}} in the longitudinal muscle layer. Numbers of both mitochondria and microtubules per unit area of smooth muscle cell were larger in the longitudinal than in the <b>circular</b> muscle.

A lower pH fixative (cacodylate, pH 6. 6) gave a better contrast of specimens than other fixatives used, and an organic buffered (PIPES) fixative led to a more regular arrangement of myofilaments.
