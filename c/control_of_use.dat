The development of this tool is justified since the urban growth in most Brazilian cities has promoted sociospatial segregation, marginalization of the poor and degradation of natural environments. To elaborate the conceptual model of the SEA, the present study has selected socio environmental indicators and, also, has used parameters of environmental law and land use. For each indicator was determined a value that is measured by a checklist procedure and for the analysis of the legislation and crossed with the city’s basemap. Thus, it was made a connection between the characterizations of the environment versus the type of work in viability, resulting in a graph which allowed measuring the significant environmental impact.

40|$|Cannabis is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used illicit drug worldwide. With debate surrounding the legalization and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> investigating its health risks has become a pressing area of research. One established association is that between cannabis use and schizophrenia, a debilitating psychiatric disorder affecting ~ 1 % of the population over their lifetime. Although considerable evidence implicates cannabis use as a component cause of schizophrenia, it remains unclear whether this is entirely due to cannabis directly raising risk of psychosis, or whether the same genes that increases psychosis risk may also increase risk of cannabis use. In a sample of 2082 healthy individuals, we show an association between an individual’s burden of schizophrenia risk alleles and use of cannabis. This was significant both for comparing those who have ever versus never used cannabis (P = 2. 6 × 10 − 4), and for quantity of use within users (P = 3. 0 × 10 − 3). Although directly predicting only a small amount of the variance in cannabis use, these findings suggest that part of the association between schizophrenia and cannabis is due to a shared genetic aetiology. This form of gene–environment correlation is an important consideration when calculating the impact of environmental risk factors, including cannabis use.

40|$|Abstract: Craving {{is closely}} {{interconnected}} with substance addiction. Its precise role of mediator or indicator is frequently discussed, {{although it has}} also been identified as a relevant factor in continued substance use and relapse after stopping. The assessment of craving is particularly complex because different theories adopt different methodologies and measures. Desire to use and the loss of <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> are frequently adopted as constructs within instruments. The control of substance use can conceptually be developed in Coping self-efficacy, defined as ability to resist substance use in high-risk situations. There is strong evidence in literature about craving as an important factor that supports remission and reduces relapse risk. More specifically, a high sense of coping self-efficacy to resist substance use at treatment intake, during treatment, and/or after treatment discharge, is a stable predictor of better results in alcohol and substance use. The Self-efficacy scale and desire (SAD) is an Italian language self-report instrument with 27 items assessing desire for a specific substance of abuse (heroin, cocaine) and the perceived ability to resist use (Coping self-efficacy). It is possible to calculate a score for Desire scale and for Coping self-efficacy scale and a score for three sub-scales: Positive emotions and social situations, Negative emotions and potentially critical situations, Habit and abstinence, each with nine items. Results of validation process highlight an excellent internal consistency measured by Cronbach coefficient for both scales. Split-half reliability and convergent validity with Visual Analogue Scale for craving measurement were also explored. Structural Equation Modelling with inductive/confirmative validation approach showed an excellent data adjustment...|$|E

It affects 1 in every 2000 to 4000 individuals with personal, social and familiar significant repercussions. The treatment of narcolepsy is mainly {{based on the}} use of stimulants for the control of the diurnal excessive sleepiness, in conjunction with behavioral measures and sleep hygiene. Among the stimulants, modafinil has presently been the drug of choice for the treatment of the diurnal excessive sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy.

40|$|Participatory {{modelling}} {{is increasing}} steadily in importance because {{of opportunities to}} obtain new; kinds of information, perspectives on validation and implementation of social learning. The concept of participation is spreading towards modelling processes. It uses {{a wide range of}} approaches, however, differing notably in relation to timing and involvement of stakeholders in the design process. The inclusion of stakeholders in the design process might alter the usual notion of authorship as well as ownership or appropriation of these models. In this paper we address the issue of ownership of participatory-designed models through examples that have been investigated in the FIRMA project, and through discussion on timing and level of involvement of stakeholders in the design process. The issue of ownership of models itself has to be explained because it is made up of several property regimes. As far as models are concerned these various facets of ownership are: authorship, allowance of use, permission to modify, responsibility for content, responsibility for use, control of access, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> and defining the proper use of models. If these facets of ownership are not properly defined, this may generate several types of conflict or under-use of the model. Technological control and legal control are the current ways of dealing with this issue of ownership through passwords, licenses, software agreements, specific interfaces, etc. Their translation to participatory-designed models may not be easy since there is a required dispersal of the model among participants, and any form of appropriation of the result by only one party of the participatory process might be difficult to justify.

40|$|With {{the entry}} into force of the Second Tobacco Products Directive 1 (hereinafter TPD), new {{labelling}} requirements for tobacco products are being introduced for ensuring greater protection of public health. Notably, the TPD harmonises minimum requirements of the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and its Guidelines, consisting of pictorial warnings and information about {{the harmful effects of}} smoking (Article 9 and 10 TPD), covering 65 % of the tobacco package 2, but also provides the possibility for Member States to introduce further more stringent measures (Article 24 (2) TPD). Only brand names in a standard font are allowed to be displayed on a package with neutral colour without any trademarks. 3 This thesis is specifically concerned with the effect of the TPD’s new labelling requirements (plain packaging) on the intellectual property rights (trademark rights) of the tobacco manufacturers. The justifications for the new limitations are considered from a broader EU perspective and from an Intellectual Property law one. The paper reflects on the character of protection that there is no deprivation nor expropriation of property, but a mere <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and that the right conferred upon registration of a mark is ius excludenti alios and not a right to use. These justifications are based on examination of case law, legislation provisions and it is relied on the surveys approved by the WHO and made post-implementation of plain packaging in Australia. However, it is suggested that the use of trademarks has become an indispensable part of the economic reality and through plain packaging the trademark proprietors’ interests are being undermined. Consequently, it is argued that the new regime is oppressive towards the interests of the trademark proprietors and is not the most effective for attaining the public health objective, by drawing upon sociological and economical research. Finally, the thesis criticises a plain packaging regime as being detrimental to trademark owners and its potential spillover effect to other industries, the risk of increase of illicit trade and counterfeits, which will cause a whole area of intellectual property to become redundant...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to utilise {{qualitative}} data from {{investigation of the}} screening tool ASSIST Version 3. 0 with pregnant women to help determine its appropriateness for this cohort, thus informing potential innovations to enhance the questionnaire׳s utility. Design: pregnant women were co-administered the ASSIST Version 3. 0 and three established substance use questionnaires (the T-ACE for alcohol, the Timeline FollowBack for cannabis and the Revised Fagerstrom Questionnaire for tobacco). Setting: antenatal clinics and the antenatal ward of the Women׳s and Children׳s Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia. Participants: 104 pregnant substance-users. Measurements and findings: {{as well as the}} quantitative date (reported elsewhere), rich {{qualitative data}} documenting participants’ perspectives and experiences in antenatal care were thematically analysed. Women constantly reported friends and family urging them to stop use. Although care providers also advocated cessation or curtailment of use, this advice was reported as unpredictable, with only some providers strongly attuned to such recommendations. Some women voiced suggestions for the appropriate level of provider advice. While pregnancy was often reported as a motivator for changing substance-using behaviour, others reported continued attachment to use which was clearly linked to dependence. Those who reported successful <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> were in contrast to others who were more pragmatic, sceptical in relation to attributable harms, and disinterested in change. There were limited reports of experiences of discrimination directed to pregnant substance users. However, those instances were clearly linked with subsequent lack of honest discussions with care providers, resulting in an absence of appropriate support. Key conclusions: current absence of universal screening for substance use has the potential for less than optimal consequences for both mother and baby. Implications for practice: appropriate screening accompanied by honest, non-judgmental dialogue can guide the necessary interventions to achieve better outcomes. The recent development of the more concise and easier to administer ASSIST-LITE was partly informed by this investigation. Elizabeth D. Hotham, Robert L. Ali, Jason M. Whit...|$|E
40|$|A coordinated {{research}} {{effort was}} undertaken {{to investigate the}} impact of secondary-treated effluents from the Wahiawa and Whitmore Sewage Treatment Plants on the Wahiawa Reservoir and to evaluate alternatives to the present mode of effluent disposal. The research for the Department of Public Works, City and County of Honolulu, consisted of studies of the historical and institutional background of the reservoir, water and sediment quality, algal growth potential, fish toxicity of the secondary effluent, and reservoir and waste water management alternatives. Evaluation of the water quality data indicates {{a high level of}} nitrogen and phosphorus in the Wahiawa Reservoir waters as compared to upstream control points, such as the Ku Tree Reservoir. Sediment quality indicates a definite eutrophic condition downstream of the treatment plant discharges. Algal growth studies show that nitrogen may be the limiting growth factor for near-surface waters and phosphorus for deeper waters downstream of the treatment plant discharges and that phosphorus may be limiting upstream from those points. As expected, highest growth potential occurred with the sewage effluent or at the points of its discharge into the reservoir. The fish bioassays resulted in a 96 -hr TLm at about 0. 24 to 0. 47 mg/l combined chlorine residual in continuous flow studies for tilapia, 0. 28 mg/l for mosquito fish, and 0. 05 mg/l for mollies. A number of management alternatives were evaluated and the most feasible of these alternatives appears to be secondary effluent reuse for sugarcane irrigation or tertiary waste water treatment. Although these warrant further detailed evaluation, both as to system design, costs and institutional constraints, preliminary estimates of costs and benefits derived favor the tertiary treatment alternative. The recommendation for management of the Wahiawa and Whitmore Village Sewage Treatment Plant effluents is the application of tertiary treatment, particularly for phosphorus removal. This level of treatment should only be necessary during the low flow period of the year, and the dilution and assimilation capacity of the reservoir waters can be utilized at higher reservoir water levels with the present secondary level of treatment. It is emphasized that the decision to implement tertiary treatment should not be a unilateral one, but should be made in consultation with all agencies involved in management and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of the reservoir waters so that the final management scheme is {{in the best interests of}} all.

The WEAI is an aggregate index, reported at the country or regional level, based on individual-level data collected by interviewing men and women within the same households. The WEAI comprises two subindexes. The first assesses the degree to which women are empowered in five domains of empowerment (5 DE) in agriculture.

These domains are (1) decisions about agricultural production, (2) access to and decision-making power about productive resources, (3) <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of income, (4) leadership in the community, and (5) time allocation. The second subindex (the Gender Parity Index [GPI]) measures gender parity. The GPI reflects the percentage of women who are empowered or whose achievements are at least as high as the men in their households. For those households that have not achieved gender parity, the GPI shows the empowerment gap that needs to be closed for women to reach the same level of empowerment as men. This technical paper documents the development of the WEAI and presents pilot data from Bangladesh, Guatemala, and Uganda, so that researchers and practitioners seeking to use the index in their own work would understand how the survey questionnaires were developed and piloted, how the qualitative case studies were undertaken, how the index was constructed, how various indicators were validated, and how it can be used in other settings.
