5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|The new Order {{was again}} struck {{down by the}} Divisional Court and Court of Appeal before {{proceeding}} to the House of Lords where it was heard by Lords Hoffmann, Bingham, Rodger, Carswell and Mance between 30 June and 3 July 2008. In their judgment, issued on 22 October 2008, the Lords decided by a 3-2 majority to uphold the new Order in Council, stating that it was valid and, although judicial review actions <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Orders in Council, the national security and foreign relations issues in the case barred them from doing so. In addition, Cook's statement had not been clear and unambiguous enough to provide legitimate expectation.|$|E

25|$|Lectors {{were well}} {{respected}} and often highly educated. Most <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> text written in English or Italian {{and read it}} aloud in Spanish, {{the language of the}} factories. The lectors were hired and fired by the tabaqueros, not the factory owners. Their salary was paid directly by the workers through a small deduction from everyone’s weekly earnings. Despite the cost, the tabaqueros enthusiastically sustained the lector tradition.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{character}} recognition (OCR) {{is preferable to}} rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a Linotype-composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, Google Book Search) and promises more for the future.|$|E
25|$|During the investigation, the Committee {{heard the}} testimonies of two {{flotilla}} passengers and two Israeli human rights activists. The Committee requested {{the assistance of}} the Turkish Embassy in Israel in finding the Captain of the Mavi Marmara so he could be invited to testify. The request was denied, with the response being that the Committee <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the testimony of the Captain contained in the Turkish report. The Committee also issued an open invitation to all passengers and crew to testify, and requested assistance from the Turkish Embassy in Israel in building a list of prospective witnesses, but received no immediate reply. The Committee also heard the testimonies of three politicians including the Prime Minister, three IDF officials (one testified twice), two government bureaucrats, and a Prison official.|$|E

25|$|Underwater World and Dolphin Lagoon was an {{oceanarium}} {{located on}} {{the western part of}} Sentosa at Siloso Point. Opened in 1991, the living museum had more than 2,500 marine and fresh-water animals of 250 species from different regions of the world. The oceanarium was underground and included an 83-metre long travelator that moved visitors along a submerged, glass-windowed tunnel from which they <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> an array of marine life including a coral reef, stingrays, moray eels, turtles, sharks, and other fishes. In the 'Dive with the Sharks' programme, visitors could scuba dive in the large oceanarium, even if they are not scuba qualified. Underwater World also included a Dolphin Lagoon which is home to some Indo-Pacific Humpback dolphins, also known as the Pink dolphins. For some time the aquarium {{was also one of the}} few places in the world to display captive dugong. The Underwater World Monorail Station of the now-defunct Sentosa Monorail once connected visiting tourists to the western half of the island, but it no longer does as the monorail was discontinued in March 2005. Because of competition from the new aquarium attraction, S.E.A. Aquarium, which is integrated with the transportation and boardwalk, Underwater World closed on 26 June 2016.|$|E
25|$|Penniman {{had more}} than the {{ordinary}} intellectual endowment; bold, striking, and original in her conceptions, and of singular facility and clearness in her expression. She was educated from early life to disbelieve in the capacity or general intelligence of the masses for efficient self-government. All her prejudices were nurtured {{in favor of the}} British Constitution as developed by Magna Charta, and administered by a king and ministers responsible to the nation; which form of government she believed to be above all comparison the best in the world. Yet, in spite of all these deeply-rooted prejudices, with a grasp of thought that <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> and examine questions of inherent right, on their original basis—with the abiding principles of the Christian faith to serve as a guide in judging of human duty in governments, and with the daily recurring practical examples of the conflicts of opinion between the Colonies and the mother country, which the American Revolution presented, she saw and acknowledged the wrongs inflicted on the Colonies—the justice of that cause in which they had, at length, banded for a higher measure of liberty, and the growing capacity of the people to maintain those rights. She was thus made an intellectual convert to the doctrines of the Revolution, and became a most useful and capable counsellor to Allen, in the subsequent critical periods of his life. Her mind was, indeed, a counterpart, in its boldness and originality, to that of her husband, whose intuitive mode of reaching conclusions enabled him to put into the shape of acts, what it might have sorely puzzled him sometimes to reason out; and what, indeed, if he could have reasoned ever so well, his bold and fiery zeal, and crushing rapidity of action, put him out of all temper to submit to the slow process of ratiocination. He also felt the happy influences of manners, opinions, and sentiments at once dignified and frank, yet mild and persuasive.|$|E
500|$|For her, {{feminism}} meant {{a completely}} new point of view: [...] "Feminism isn't an employment agency for women; it's an alternative way of ordering the social space, in which women are the prototype rather than men. It is based on collaboration rather than competition. As a youngster, I still remember my feeling of joy that one <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the earth differently. That's feminism; everything is differently oriented. Seeing the same world with different eyes." ...|$|E

500|$|Poole was {{inspired}} to make the film after he went with some friends to see a film called Highway Hustler. After watching the film, he said to a friend, [...] "This is the worst, ugliest movie I've ever seen! Somebody oughta {{be able to do}} something better than this." [...] Poole was convinced that he was that somebody; [...] "I wanted [...] a film that gay people <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> and say, 'I don't mind being gay - it's beautiful to see those people do what they're doing.'" [...] Having enlisted the help of his lover, Peter Fisk, and another man, Poole first shot a ten-minute segment entitled Bayside.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{composed}} {{this song}} {{in the form of}} a 12-bar blues. In the sleeve notes of Freewheelin, Dylan explained to Nat Hentoff: [...] "What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. And in that way, they had them beat." [...] Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in Perugia: [...] "My baby took my heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end is a little bit of growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and your faith. If people <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{gave him}} my hand. After a moment of suspense, I went and kissed my mother: she kissed me, patted me gently on the shoulder, and sat down again to her work.

2500|$|Einstein (also {{known as}} the EINSTEIN Program) was {{originally}} an intrusion detection system that monitors the network gateways of government departments and agencies in the United States for unauthorized traffic.

2500|$|One {{example is}} the {{drinking}} of seal blood.

[...] After the consumption of seal blood and meat, one <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> their veins in the wrist for proof of the strength that Inuit food provides. Borré states that [...] "seal blood is seen as fortifying human blood by replacing depleted nutrients and rejuvenating the blood supply, it is considered {{a necessary part of}} the Inuit diet." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a member}} of the State House of Representatives, Djou had one term in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 2000 to 2002 and was the Minority Floor Leader. Djou {{launched}} a successful campaign to open the State Budget worksheets to the public after being told he <b>could</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the budget worksheets in the committee room but was not allowed to take any notes or make copies of them.

He opposed the state [...] "van cam" [...] program launched in 2002 to catch speeders using automated cameras instead of police officers, and successfully campaigned for its elimination.|$|E
2500|$|Moses also {{figures in}} several of Jesus' messages.

In the sixth chapter, Jesus responded to the people's claim that Moses provided them manna in the wilderness by saying that it was not Moses, but God, who provided. Calling himself the [...] "bread of life", Jesus stated that He was provided to feed God's people.|$|E
