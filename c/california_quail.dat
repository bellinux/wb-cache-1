5000|$|Live Oak Park sits {{along both}} sides of Codornices Creek like a narrow green belt in 1301 Shattuck Avenue, at Berryman Street between Shattuck Avenue and Oxford Street. Walnut Street runs {{through the middle of}} the park as Codornices Creek meanders through its grove of native oaks, accented here and there with big, old {{specimen}} trees originally planted in the original gardens that preceded the park.Live Oak Park is situated here because of the many little creeks that flow from the Berkeley Hills the short way down to San Francisco Bay. These little creeks are more powerful than they look. As rising sea level filled the current Bay {{at the end of the}} last Ice Age, the creeks basically built what are now the flatlands, by carrying rock and soil eroded from the earthquake-riven, still-rising hills. Codornices Creek is one of these original creeks which run out of the Berkeley Hills in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. In its upper stretch, it passes entirely within the city limits of Berkeley and further downstream, it marks the city limit to the adjacent city of Albany in its lower section. The name of the creek derives from the Spanish word [...] "codornices", meaning [...] "quails". <b>California</b> valley <b>quail</b> were once common in the area. The name was given by one of the family Peralta, once owners of the vast Rancho San Antonio.|$|R
50|$|Steven Rinella is {{the host}} of MeatEater, a weekly half-hour series that airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on The Sportsman Channel and Netflix. The show is based on Rinella's hunting adventures in such {{locations}} as Montana (deer, elk); Alaska (waterfowl, mountain goat, Dall sheep, caribou, black bear); Mexico (wild turkey, buffalo); New Zealand (tahr, chamois, red stag); Arizona (mountain lion, Coues deer); Wisconsin (white-tailed deer, rabbit); and <b>California</b> (wild pigs, <b>quail,</b> and turkey.) The show offers a defense of the hunting lifestyle, and makes the case that hunters are obligated to be stewards of the land and protectors of their chosen prey species. The episodes include rudimentary food preparations after the hunt. Examples include a deer's heart wrapped in caul fat and roasted over a fire, javelina meat boiled inside the animal's own stomach, as well as more common preparations. The series premiered on January 1, 2012, and has completed its sixth season.|$|R
