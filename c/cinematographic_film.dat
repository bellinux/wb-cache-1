40|$|The Federal Government {{is to be}} congratulated on {{introducing}} the Copyright Amendment (Film Directors' Rights) Bill 2005 (Cth) into Parliament. The reforms are long overdue. This submission is sympathetic to {{the situation of the}} Federal Government. It notes that the debate over film directors' copyright has been an exhaustive process, with much special pleading by all sides. The various stakeholders have all had ample opportunities {{in the past six years}} in which to address this issue. There certainly has been a comprehensive consultation about film directors' copyright. The particular issue of retransmission royalties for film directors arose during the debate over the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Act 2000 (Cth). The matter was deferred for further policy deliberations. The Attorney General's Department and the Department of Communications, Information Technology, and the Arts co-ordinated a policy review of film directors' copyright. Seventeen submissions were received from directors, producers and other interests in the Australian film and television industries. Submissions addressed the issue of whether, and if so, how, the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) should be amended to include directors as owners of copyright in film. The current bill before Parliament was based upon a consideration of the responses to this inquiry. This submission is divided into three parts. First of all, it considers the history of authorship in <b>cinematographic</b> <b>films</b> under Anglo-Australian laws. It notes that initially <b>cinematographic</b> <b>films</b> were protected as either dramatic works or as artistic works in the form of individual photographs. Such a categorisation was awkward - many significant audio-visual works, such as documentaries, did not fit into the subject matter of dramatic works. This submission considers the creation under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) of the special category of <b>cinematographic</b> <b>films</b> and the award of ownership to producers. It argues that the policy justifications in the Gregory Report and the Spicer Report for the treatment of <b>cinematographic</b> <b>films</b> as entrepreneurial ventures are weak and implausible. The submission notes the expansion of the category of cinematograph films to include new technologies. It therefore observes that any decision will also implicate subject matter, such as animation and multi-media. This submission also considers the legal developments in 2000 - namely, the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Act 2000 (Cth) and the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Act 2000 (Cth). It observes that the current copyright regime lacks simplicity and symmetry. Second, this submission considers the range of options available in respect of film directors' copyright in <b>cinematographic</b> <b>films.</b> It rejects Option 1 - namely, the protection of the status quo. This submission is supportive of Option 2. It maintains that joint authorship of the economic rights of <b>cinematographic</b> <b>films</b> should be shared between the director, the producer, and even the screenwriter. Alternatively, this submission supports Option 3. However, it notes that the operation of presumptions as to ownership could prove to be inflexible. This submission raises concerns about Options 4 and 5. It argues that it is inconsistent and anomalous to consider the film director an author for the purposes of statutory licensing schemes and retransmission royalties, but not for the sake of economic rights in <b>cinematographic</b> <b>films.</b> Third, this submission conducts an international survey of authorship in audio-visual works. It observes that the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works treats <b>cinematographic</b> <b>films</b> as literary and artistic works. This submission notes that other Commonwealth countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, are struggling to deal with the division of economic and moral rights in cinematographs. As a result of European Union Directives, the United Kingdom has had to recognise that principal directors are authors of <b>cinematographic</b> <b>films.</b> This should be taken into account, given that British law is the original model for the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). This submission considers United States law on joint authorship of audio-visual works, and ownership of works made for hire. It stresses the need to develop indicia to determine joint authorship. This submission also notes recent legal developments in Israel, with the recognition of film directors' copyright...|$|R

50|$|The {{problem of}} the {{direction}} of time arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal invariant; if a <b>cinematographic</b> <b>film</b> were taken of any process describable {{by means of the}} aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the macroscopic level, is not time-reversal invariant. Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables.

50|$|In 1903, Eichengrün co-developed {{the first}} soluble form of {{cellulose}} acetate with Theodore Becker.

During World War I his relatively non-inflammable synthetic cellulose acetate lacquers were important in the aircraft industry. He also pioneered the influential technique of injection moulding. In 1904, He created and patented the first safety film with Becker, (cellulose diacetate) from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. It was used to manufacture cellulose diacetate <b>cinematographic</b> <b>film,</b> which Eastman Kodak and the Pathé Fréres began to use in 1909.

40|$|Film archivists have {{expressed}} concern regarding the aerial release of fungal spores during inspection of mouldy <b>cinematographic</b> <b>film.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate this and identify of the contaminants causing this concern, and then to make recommendations to archivists regarding safe handling of such film. Eighteen films donated to the North West Film Archive, in Manchester, UK, were examined. During a simulated inspection procedure, spore release ranged from zero to several thousand spores per m' (i. e. above numbers considered 'safe'), with films that were the most visibly mouldy usually yielding the highest numbers of colonies. Predominant contaminants were Aspergillus and Penicillium. A. versicolor was the most common species isolated (8 / 15 isolates identified by CABI), and gelatinase assays indicated that this was also the most gelatinolytic species, perhaps explaining its high frequency of isolation, and indicating risk to film. No overtly pathogenic species were isolated, so the risk to archivists may be considered low. Thus, informed recommendations for safe handling could be made. Wiping of lightly contaminated reels may remove superficial surface mould growth but cleaning of heavily contaminated reels is not recommended, because hyphal growth is likely to have penetrated the gelatine emulsion layer. In addition, high numbers of spores released could pose a health risk to archivists. Although the contamination of some film was no longer viable, actively growing mould may cause further deterioration if reels are not stored in conditions not favourable to growth. Currently, assessment of viability is by culture, a method not usually available to archivists. An alternative method was explored by analysing microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) released from fungi isolated from mouldy reels, using headspace solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), to determine whether any compounds were common to isolates. Over 150 volatile compounds were detected from 16 fungal isolates, with 3 VOCs being the most common: l-octen-Jol from 13 isolates, 3 -octanone from 10 of the isolates and 3 - octanol from 4 isolates. These three key chemical markers are indicative of viable fungal growth on <b>cinematographic</b> <b>film,</b> thus their detection would preclude the need for traditional microbiology laboratory culture methods. Development of 'one-shot' screen printed sensors coupled with a hand held device proved possible, enabling in-can indication of viable mould, thus enabling films to be stored appropriately to halt further growth.
