John Conover, General Manager of the winery, announced at the Napa Valley Wine Auction that half (150 cases) of PlumpJack's 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon would be available upon release with a Stelvin screwcap closure, and that those bottles would cost $10 USD more {{than those in the}} 150 <b>cases</b> <b>closed</b> with cork.
