5|$|The {{so-called}} 'social revolutions' {{following the}} independence proclamation were {{challenges to the}} Dutch-established Indonesian social order, {{and to some extent}} a result of the resentment against Japanese-imposed policies. Across the <b>country,</b> <b>people</b> rose up against traditional aristocrats and village heads and attempted to exert popular ownership of land and other resources. The majority of the social revolutions ended quickly; in most cases the challenges to the social order were quashed.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} defended in medieval times by Bristol Castle, a Norman {{fortification}} {{built on the}} site of a wooden predecessor. The castle {{played a key role in}} the civil wars that followed the death of Henry I. Stephen of Blois reconnoitred Bristol in 1138 and claimed that the town was impregnable. After Stephen's capture, in 1141, he was imprisoned in the castle. The castle was later taken into royal hands, and Henry III spent lavishly on it, adding a barbican before the main west gate, a gate tower, and a magnificent hall. By the 16th century, the castle had fallen into disuse, but the city authorities had no control over royal property, and so the castle became a refuge for lawbreakers. In 1630, the city purchased the castle; Oliver Cromwell ordered its destruction in 1656. An area outside the castle, known as Old Market, was used as a mustering point for troops. It later became a market for the <b>country</b> <b>people</b> to set up stalls and sell their wares. Old Market was also the site of an autumn fair. The market may have existed as early as the 12th century, and was the site of the first suburb outside the city walls. It had side roads which could accommodate the traffic on market days.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{has seen}} very little {{gerrymandering}} of electoral boundaries, relevant {{only for the}} House of Representatives and State Legislative Assemblies, which have nearly always been drawn up by public servants or independent boundary commissioners. But Australia has seen systematic malapportionment of electorates. All colonial legislatures before Federation, and the federal parliament after it, allocated more representation to rural districts than their populations merited. This was justified on several grounds, such as that <b>country</b> <b>people</b> {{had to contend with}} greater distances and hardships, that <b>country</b> <b>people</b> (and specifically farmers) produced most of the nation's real wealth, and that greater country representation was necessary to balance the radical tendencies of the urban population.|$|E

25|$|Southland was a {{scene of}} early {{extended}} contact between Europeans and Maori, notably whalers and missionaries – Wohlers at Ruapuke. In 1853, Walter Mantell purchased Murihiku from local Maori iwi, claiming the land for European settlement.

25|$|Believing that Jamaica's {{strength}} lay in its agriculture, Christopher Hills co-founded the Jamaica Agriculture & Industrial Party (AIP) as {{an alternative}} to the two major political parties: Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and People's National Party (PNP), both of which he felt were too busy warring with each other to look out for the middle class and the <b>country</b> <b>people</b> who were the backbone of Jamaica's rural economy. Despite competing vigorously in the polls, the Hills couple were nevertheless close friends with JLP leader Sir Alexander Bustamante and Norman Manley, head of the PNP, who both served as Jamaican Prime Ministers. Norman Manley in fact had been best man at the Hills' wedding.|$|E

25|$|The Greek nymphs were spirits {{invariably}} {{bound to}} places, {{not unlike the}} Latin genius loci, {{and the difficulty of}} transferring their cult may be seen in the complicated myth that brought Arethusa to Sicily. In the works of the Greek-educated Latin poets, the nymphs gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous Italian divinities of springs and streams (Juturna, Egeria, Carmentis, Fontus), while the Lymphae (originally Lumpae), Italian water-goddesses, owing to the accidental similarity of their names, could be identified with the Greek Nymphae. The mythologies of classicizing Roman poets were unlikely to have affected the rites and cult of individual nymphs venerated by <b>country</b> <b>people</b> in the springs and clefts of Latium. Among the Roman literate class, their sphere of influence was restricted, and they appear almost exclusively as divinities of the watery element.|$|E
25|$|Fearing that Napoleon {{would offer}} battle near Nogent, Schwarzenberg asked his {{colleague}} Blücher to send Kleist's corps south to help. Obligingly, the Prussian field marshal ordered Kleist, Kaptzevich and Olsufiev to converge on Sézanne on 10 February. Riding with Kleist and Kaptzevich, Blücher led them south from Vertus toward Fère-Champenoise, planning to turn west {{from there to}} Sézanne. After days of rain, the roads were swamped, but the French <b>country</b> <b>people</b> assisted the army in dragging Napoleon's cannons through the mud. The French army fell on Olsufiev's small corps with crushing force in the Battle of Champaubert on 10 February. With only 5,000 men and 24 guns, the Russian general unwisely held his ground; Olsufiev ended the day as a French prisoner and his corps was nearly destroyed. The 1,500 survivors were formed into three or four ad hoc battalions.|$|E
25|$|After the ascendency of Christianity in the Roman Empire, the {{consular}} processions in Constantinople retained {{their religious}} character, now proceeding to Hagia Sophia, where prayers and offerings were made; but in Rome, where Christianity {{was not so}} widely spread among the upper classes, at first the tendency was to convert the procession into a purely civil function, omitting the pagan rites and prayers, without substituting Christian ones Only after Theodosius did the processions become a religious event, replete with icons, crosses, and banners. There were other local processions connected with the primitive worship of the <b>country</b> <b>people,</b> which remained unchanged, but they were eventually overshadowed by the popular piety of the Church. Such were those of the Ambarvalia, Robigalia, which were essentially rustic festivals, lustrations of the fields, consisting in a procession round the spot to be purified, leading the sacrificial victims with prayers, hymns, and ceremonies to protect the young crops from evil influence.|$|E
