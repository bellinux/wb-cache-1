5000|$|Sanding {{is carried}} out before {{finishing}} to remove defects from the wood surface that will affect the appearance and performance of finishes that are subsequently applied to the wood. These defects include <b>cutter</b> <b>marks</b> and burns, scratches and indentations, small glue spots and raised grain. Sanding {{should not be used}} to eliminate larger defects such as gouges, and various forms of discolouration. Other techniques are used to remove these defects (see below). The key to preparing a defect free surface is to develop a sanding schedule that will quickly eliminate defects and leave the surface smooth enough so that tiny scratches produced by sanding cannot be seen when the wood is finished. A sanding schedule usually begins with sandpaper that is coarse enough to remove larger defects (typically 80 or 100 grit, but sometimes higher if the surface is already quite smooth), and progresses through a series of sandpaper grades that gradually remove the sanding scratches created by the previous sanding steps. A typical sanding schedule prior to wood finishing might involve sanding wood along the grain with the following grades of sandpaper, 80, 100, 120, 150 and finishing with 180 and sometimes 220 grit. The precise sanding schedule is a matter of trial and error because the appearance of a sanded surface depends on the wood you are sanding and the finish that will subsequently be applied to the wood. According to Nagyszalanczy, coarse grained woods with large pores such as oak hide sanding scratches better than fine grained wood and hence with such species {{it may be possible to}} use 180 or even 150 grit sandpaper as the final step in the sanding schedule. Conversely, sanding scratches are more easily seen in finer grained, harder woods and also end-grain, and hence, they require finer sandpaper (220 grit) during the final sanding stage. The sandpaper selected for the final sanding stage affects the colour of stained wood, and therefore when staining is part of finishing avoid sanding the wood to a very smooth finish. On the other hand, according to Nagyszalanczy if you are using an oil-based finish, it is desirable to sand the wood using higher grit sandpaper (400 grit) because oil tends to highlight sanding scratches. Sanding is very good at removing defects at wood surfaces, but it creates a surface that contains minute scratches in the form of microscopic valleys and ridges, and also slivers of wood cell wall material that are attached to the underlying wood. These sanding ridges and slivers of wood swell and spring-up, respectively, when sanded wood is finished with water-based finishes, creating a rough fuzzy surface. This defect is known as grain raising. It can be eliminated by wetting the surface with water, leaving the wood to dry and then lightly sanding the wood to remove the ‘raised grain’.|$|E

Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Cutter</b> <b>marks</b> on machmed wood surfaces are generated by the plamng and mouldmg wood machming process. Cutter mark defect {{is referred to as}} inconsistency of widths and heights of the cutter mark waves, which IS cntical m some sectors of the woodworkmg industry. Machining speeds m the woodworkmg mdustry are remarkably high In order {{to meet the demands of}} high efficiency and high quality, mprocess measurement of <b>cutter</b> <b>marks</b> on machmed wood surfaces is highly desirable. Machme visiOn technology IS bemg widely used m various quality control applications due to Its advantages of non-contact and high data rates. Clearly, machme visiOn IS also highly smtable for m-process measurement of wood surfaces This research focuses on usmg machme vision techniques to measure <b>cutter</b> <b>marks</b> on planed wood surfaces Before machme vision methods are mvestigated, a laser profilometer IS mvestigated for its feasibility of measunng <b>cutter</b> <b>marks</b> on wood surfaces Although the profilometer cannot be used for m-process applications, it provides a good reference for other methods. Three maJor machme vision methods and their vanatwns are investigated They are the Light Sectionmg method and the Differential Light Sectwmng method, the Shadow Analysis method and the Multi-Angle Shadow Analysis method, the twoImage Photometric Stereo method and the one-Image Shape From Shadmg method Nme samples, made of three species of wood - beech, oak and ramin, with cutter mark widths of l. Smm, 2 mm and 2 Smm generated on the samples of each species, are tested. Surface profiles measured with all the machme visiOn methods are compared to the reference profiles measured with the laser profilometer. Expenments mdiCate that the Light Sectwmng method and the Shadow Analysis method both work to some extent, the Differential Light Sectwmng method and the Multi-Angle Shadow Analysis method are not practiCal; the two-Image Photometnc Stereo method IS the most reliable machine vision method among all the methods mvestigated; and the one-Image Shape From Shadmg method needs further studies...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral milling {{is a very}} {{important}} procedure in terms of work piece shaping by cutting in wood industry. Because of the kinematic principle of this procedure a more or less wavy structure on the cutting area of the work piece appears, the so called <b>cutter</b> <b>marks.</b> That is why in many cases after cutting, expensive extra finishing procedures like sanding must be applied to smoothen the work piece surface. An approach to improve this situation is given by an actuator controlled motion of the tool spindle position to realize a linear cutting motion during the edge approach to the work piece. A control strategy was created and first experiments with a test setup using magnetic bearings have been done successfully...|$|E

It is also {{available}} at: [URL] paper describes a two-image photometric stereo (PS) method for analysis of surface waviness on planed wood products. This method {{is based on an}} assumption that the wood surface is a Lambertian surface. In addition, owing to the fact that surface waviness on planed wood is mainly composed of <b>cutter</b> <b>marks,</b> which fluctuate only in one dimension, three-dimensional surface topography can reasonably be represented by a two-dimensional surface profile. Accordingly, a surface waviness profile can be extracted from two images of the surface under specifically arranged illumination. Measurement results from the two-image PS method are compared with those from a laser profilometer. Comparison indicates a high correlation between the two methods...|$|E

50|$|In 1982, Jeff Cocks came in {{as manager}} and P J Wilson began {{to coach the}} squad as Astroturf hockey came to the fore. Wales went to Colorado Springs for the Rocky Mountain tournament at the US Olympic Training Centre, where they played USA, Canada and Chile before later playing at QPR in the {{televised}} 4 nation event with Spain, England and France. Matches with USA, Gibraltar and the Netherlands (two televised games in Swansea) saw further newcomers in David <b>Cutter,</b> <b>Mark</b> Lewis and Steve Cronin gain experience ahead of the 1983 European Championships in Amsterdam. After finishing 2nd in the 1983 Home Internationals, Wales disappointed in Amsterdam despite reasonable pool results against England, France and Austria. 1-0 defeats to Poland and Austria in the play-offs consigned the squad to 12th. Bob Cattrall was absent from this squad due to playing commitments in Australia, whilst Howie Williams also missed Amsterdam. Cattrall did gain GB Olympic selection for Los Angeles where he won the bronze medal, but GB training was otherwise restricted to keeper Ashcroft, defender Cutter and winger Lewis.|$|R

5000|$|Nicole was {{the first}} to read the map, and made several errors. Mark {{attempted}} to correct them, but the team was running out of time. Having noticed that the bomb had several colored wires, and a pair of wire <b>cutters</b> were provided, <b>Mark</b> reasoned that the clue would tell them which wire(s) to cut. On that assumption, the team deduced that the only two colors that could be made from the letters they found were [...] "red" [...] and [...] "blue". However, they did not have the correct letters for the word [...] "wire", so were unsure if they should cut two wires, red and blue, or cut the purple wire. In the end, the team cut the purple wire, which was correct, and added the money to the pot with 21 seconds to spare.|$|R

500|$|... 19 September was a {{busy day}} for Division 11 in the Gulf of Thailand with [...] encountering a junk that fired on her and when unable to escape tried to ram the cutter. The Viet Cong crew jumped {{overboard}} and Point Glover disabled the junk's engine with machine gun fire. A boarding party from Point Glover boarded the sinking junk and did a quick search of the vessel, finding arms and ammunition. Unable to stop the junk from sinking, she was beached in shallow water while , and [...] went searching for the missing junk crew; however, only one crew member was captured. Later that night Point Marone attempted to stop an unlit junk near the coastal town of Ha Tien but the junk ignored a warning shot across her bow and attempted to evade boarding while firing at the cutter and throwing hand grenades. Point Glover was nearby and assisted Point Marone in engaging the junk with machine gun fire. The junk caught fire and started sinking. Unable to keep the junk afloat the <b>cutter</b> crews <b>marked</b> it with a buoy and let it sink in shallow water. Salvage operations conducted later found rifles, ammunition, hand grenades, documents and money. Eleven Viet Cong {{were killed in the}} action and one badly wounded crewman was captured ashore.|$|R
5000|$|On October 11, 2011, Aubrey {{finds out}} from police {{commissioner}} Bo Buchanan that Cutter lied about turning over Rex's {{gun to the}} police and breaks up with Cutter after coming to the conclusion that he will never change his grifting ways. Cutter then heads back to the hospital in Kentucky and tells Kim that Aubrey broke up with him because he lied about what he did with Rex's gun, and blamed Kim for the break-up. Cutter also wanted to revert to being a grifter by blackmailing Kim to give him the forged documents that Echo signed Rex's signature on that will give Clint back his fortune, or he will tell everyone in Llanview that Stacy is still alive with her sister Gigi Morasco's face! Cutter then asks Kim if she was sure if the woman in the hospital room is really Stacy. Kim confessed to Cutter that Stacy survived drowning in that frozen lake {{a year and a half}} ago, and that she got plastic surgery in South America to look like Gigi so that she could take over her life! Kim also said that she tried to stop Stacy by following her to Llanview to stop her scheme against her sister. Kim then discovered that Stacy was trapped in the basement of a rental house that was leaking carbon monoxide along with her dead sister Gigi. Cutter then told Kim that he believed her about what she told him about Stacy. Kim also let her brother have the forged documents on the condition that he could give her some of the money that he'll extort to pay for Stacy's hospital bills. On October 14, 2011, Cutter met up with Rama at an arranged meeting at the Spotted Pony where Rama revealed what happened that night several years ago at the strip club. When Rama try to track down Kim at the club to get try to get the money she stole from her to pay for her plastic surgery, she saw her brother Cutter kneeling over a dead body named Mr. Berger, who was a rich guy that was a patron at the club who was <b>Cutter</b> and Kim's <b>mark.</b> <b>Cutter</b> enlisted Kim to seduce Mr. Berger for his money by working as a stripper at the club. Cutter then sneaked in too much [...] "mickey" [...] in Mr. Berger's drink, which caused him to pass out and die. Rama said she had proof of the incident with a picture she took on her cell phone of Cutter and the dead guy, and she still wanted to blackmail Cutter for the crime. Cutter then convinced Rama to conspire with him to let Kim take the fall for the crime, or they will both lose everything they want in their respective scams. Cutter and Rama then set up Kim to have her arrested for the murder of Mr. Berger. Before Kim was sent to jail, she tells Cutter to help take care of Stacy for her while she's gone. Cutter then goes to the hospital and finds out that she woke up from her coma.|$|R
5000|$|These two present-day flags {{had their}} origins in a flag that {{designed}} by Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott {{for use by}} the Revenue Cutter Service in August 1799. On August 1, 1799, Secretary of the Treasury, Oliver Wolcott, issued an order announcing that in pursuance of authority from the President, the distinguishing ensign and pennant for the Cutter Service would consist of, [...] "16 perpendicular stripes, alternate red and white, the union of the ensign to be the arms of the United States in a dark blue on a white field." [...] From 1799 onwards, this flag was used as the national ensign in Revenue Cutters and at the same time, was also flown over Customs Houses ashore. In June 1910, however, President William H. Taft ordered that the plain ensign continue to be flown over Customs Houses ashore, and ordered that the Revenue Cutter Service add their department's emblem to the fly of the ensign in order to distinguish between the differing two branches. The order said: [...] "By virtue of the authority vested in me under the provisions of Sec. 2764 of the revised Statutes, I hereby prescribe that the distinguishing flag now used by vessels of the Revenue <b>Cutter</b> Service be <b>marked</b> by the distinctive emblem of that service, in blue and white, placed on a line with the lower edge of the union, and over the center of the seventh vertical red stripe from the mast of said flag, the emblem to cover a horizontal space of three stripes. This change to be made as soon as practicable." ...|$|R
