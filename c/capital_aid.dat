The portions they received will enable them to fulfill their basic needs and conduct economic activities. One of the distribution instruments of zakat institutions is in form of loan-free capital assistance. The objective of capital assistance programs is to increase the income of the recipients through entrepreneurships. Zakat institutions have also initiated various programs such as offering training as well as giving business and marketing guidance, so that the recipients would become self-reliant and own a formal business.

Along with that change, the authority and institution of family planning program have also been transferred to the regency or city government. These changes have risen various perceptions in term of the institutional, roles, and functions of that institute. Other important changes include that (1) the family planning coordination board organization on regency level did not change but the echelon was decreased; or (2) the family planning coordination board organization on regency level was merged to other institution; or (3) the family planning coordination board activity on regency level is only a little part of the other instance. All of those changes have caused some problems of coordination from family planning coordination board on province level to regency level, and it has given a negative impact to the family planning program achievement. The objectives {{of this study are}} to investigate (1) the perception of the family program field worker to the existence of family planning program in the decentralization era; (2) the perception of the family planning fieldworkers to the realization of duties in the decentralization era; (3) the perception of the provider to the existence of family planning program in the decentralization era; (4) the perception of the eligible couple to the existence of family planning program in the decentralization era; and (5) the perception of the interrelated decision makers to the existence of family planning program in the decentralization era. This study was carried out in the Regency of Karangasem with total respondent of 153 persons, that consist of 46 fieldworkers; 89 eligible couples, 12 providers, and 6 interrelated decision makers. Some sampling techniques used in this study are; simple random sampling for family planning fieldworker, stratified random sampling for eligible couple, and purposive sampling for the provider and the interrelated decision maker.

40|$|Social {{capital is}} often {{associated}} with desirable political and economic outcomes. This paper connects a growing literature on the "dark side" of social capital with institutional change. We examine the downfall of democracy in interwar Germany. Using new data on Nazi Party entry in a cross-section of cities, we show that dense networks of civic associations such as bowling clubs, choirs, and animal breeders went hand-in-hand with a more rapid rise of the Nazi Party. Towns with one standard deviation higher association density saw at least one-third faster entry. All types of associations – veteran associations and non-military clubs, "bridging" and "bonding" associations – positively predict NS Party entry. Party membership, in turn, predicts electoral success. These results suggest that social <b>capital</b> <b>aided</b> the rise of the Nazi movement that ultimately destroyed Germany's first democracy.
