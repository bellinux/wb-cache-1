40|$|To {{study the}} genetic basis of tick burden and milk {{production}} and their interrelationship, we collected {{a sample of}} 1961 cattle with multiple tick counts from northern Australia of which 973 had dairy production data in the Australian Dairy Herd Information Service database. We calculated heritabilities, genetic and phenotypic correlations for these traits and showed a negative relationship between tick counts and milk and milk <b>component</b> <b>yield.</b> Tests of polymorphisms of four genes associated with milk yield, ABCG 2, DGAT 1, GHR and PRLR, showed no statistically significant effect on tick burden but highly significant associations to milk <b>component</b> <b>yield</b> in these data and we confirmed separate effects for GHR and PRLR on bovine chromosome 20. To begin to identify some of the molecular genetic bases for these traits, we genotyped a sample of 189 of these cattle for 7397 single nucleotide polymorphisms in a genome-wide association study. Although the allele effects for adjusted milk fat and protein yield were highly correlated (r = 0. 66), the correlations of allele effects of these milk component yields and tick burden were small (|r| <= 0. 10). These results agree in general with the phenotypic correlations between tick counts and milk <b>component</b> <b>yield</b> and suggest that selection on markers for tick burden or milk <b>component</b> <b>yield</b> may have no undesirable effect on the other trait...|$|E

The measurements were carried out on samples either shortly adapted to the dark (‘Fo conditions’) or treated to reduce Qa (‘Fm conditions’). Bi-exponential fitting of decay kinetics was applied to distinguish two components one of them related to energy trapping (fast component) {{and the other to}} charge stabilization and recombination in PS 2 reaction centers (slow component). It was found that the slow <b>component</b> <b>yield</b> increased by 2. 0 and 1. 2 times when measured under ‘Fo’ and ‘Fm conditions’, respectively, in sulfur deprived cells as compared to control ones. An additional rapid rise of the slow <b>component</b> <b>yield</b> was observed when incubation was carried out in a sealed bioreactor and cell culture turned to anaerobic conditions.

40|$|Grain yield in {{any given}} {{environment}} is determined by <b>yield</b> <b>components</b> developed at different phenophases. <b>Yield</b> <b>components</b> {{are influenced by the}} environmental conditions the plant experiences during the respective phases. The final yield of a given cultivar depends on the interaction between genotype and its responses to environmental conditions. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the plasticity in <b>yield</b> <b>components</b> formation while selecting genotype for a given environment. For this, we conducted field trials comprising 10 upland rice genotypes representing a large share of genetic variation, with two sowing dates in two consecutive years in three altitudinal locations creating 12 environments in Madagascar. Crop duration, grain <b>yield</b> and <b>yield</b> <b>components</b> (tillers per hill, panicles per tiller, grains per panicle, sterility, grain weight) were strongly affected by sowing dates, location, year and genotypes. Sowing date and years resulted in comparatively more variable environments in high and low altitudes than in mid altitude. Yield stability across environments reflected the target environments the genotypes were originally selected for. Variation in grain yield among planting dates within altitudes was not mainly due to temperature but rather to the combinations of abiotic factors the genotypes experienced during the different phenological stages during which the different <b>yield</b> <b>components</b> were formed. <b>Yield</b> <b>components</b> and their contribution to environmentally induced yield penalties were analyzed in detail.

Phenotypic variations of <b>yield</b> <b>components</b> (kernel number, kernel weight, spike number and grain filling duration) were evaluated as indicators of heat tolerance / susceptibility. Most of the phenotypic variations of <b>yield</b> <b>components</b> exhibited a normally distributed pattern in response to heat stress treatments. This suggests that the <b>yield</b> <b>component</b> responses to high temperature stress are likely quantitatively inherited. A transgressive segregation pattern compared to the two parents was observed in several yield traits.

The Pearson correlation coefficients revealed significant correlations between <b>yield</b> <b>components.</b> This suggests the probability of co-segregation of genes controlling each <b>yield</b> <b>components.</b> The ANOVA also revealed a significant genotype x environment effect on individual <b>yield</b> <b>components</b> in response to reproductive stage high temperature stress.

Liquid egg products (LEP) are the one area of the commercial egg industry that has exhibited growth as per capita shell egg consumption decreases.

The increase in yield is locally regulated within the gland; however the mechanism for the increase in yield is unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to demonstrate a difference in milk and <b>component</b> <b>yield,</b> both during the IMF period and throughout the remainder of lactation, and examine potential local mechanisms driving the increase in production. Eight multiparous dairy cows were assigned to unilateral frequent milking [UFM; 2 X left udder half and 4 -times-daily milking (4 Χ) right udder half] for the first 21 days of lactation. Both udder halves were milked 2 X for the remainder of lactation. Early lactation IMF significantly increased milk, fat, and protein yields in the right udder halves by 2. 27 kg/d, 73. 5 g/d, and 68 g/d respectively through the first 210 DIM (P < 0. 001). At d 21, the right udder halves had a significant increase in activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT 5), as well as a reduction in activated Akt (P ≤ 0. 05). There was no difference in STAT 3 expression at d 21. There was no significant difference in gene expression of prolactin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{decomposition}} of an arbitrary Petri net into open nets. This means that shared places {{can be seen}} as message channels between components. We show that there exists a unique decomposition into atomic components which can be efficiently computed. We further show that every composition of <b>components</b> <b>yields</b> a <b>component</b> and that every component can be built from atomic components. Finally, we briefly discuss potential applications. ...|$|R

40|$|Five {{polypeptide}} components {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} eggshell (chorion) of a silkmoth. Two are homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectric focusing gels, and three contain predominantly two proteins each. Amino acid analyses show that all five components are similar to each other. These proteins have been sequenced from the amino terminus. Homogeneous <b>components</b> <b>yielded</b> single sequences; heterogeneous <b>components</b> <b>yielded</b> two residues at some positions, consistent with their containing two major electrophoretic components. Striking similarities are apparent among all these sequences. These similarities can be increased dramatically by separating {{each of the three}} protein mixtures into two sequences and introducing a small number of gaps or insertions. This {{is due in part to}} bringing into register a portion that contains short repeating subunits found in all sequences. All proteins are also characterized by a region of high cysteine content near the amino terminus followed by a longer low-cysteine region. The data suggest that these proteins share a common evolutionary origin and are encoded by a multigene family...|$|R
