40|$|Abstract — A modulation-transfer-function (MTF) {{measurement}} method {{that uses a}} bar-pattern image for medical displays such as liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) and <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> (<b>CRTs)</b> has been investigated.

The MTF was calculated from the amplitudes of the fundamental-frequency components, which were extracted from the profile data across the bar patterns by using Fourier analysis. Actual comparisons with the conventional line tech-nique were performed for a medical CRT. The adequate accuracy and excellent reproducibility of the method were confirmed. Furthermore, unlike the line method, an advantageous feature which can use an input signal with sufficient amplitude was theoretically proved. Horizontal and vertical MTFs at the central position of the display area were measured up to the Nyquist frequency for several medical displays. From these measurements, this method has the capability to detect slight differences between the displays measured.

40|$|Display {{systems are}} key {{components}} of the digital radiology department. Current display systems for medical imaging are based on <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> (<b>CRTs)</b> or active-matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs). The CRT is a cathodoluminescent display: Light is generated by exciting a luminescent material with energetic electrons. AMLCDs are light-modulating devices that form the image in the screen by controlling the transparency of individual display pixels. Many image quality aspects of CRTs {{are determined by the}} way the pixel luminance is generated in the cathodoluminescent screen. The resolution properties of AMLCDs are much better than those of CRTs. In CRT devices, phosphor granularity and raster scanning patterns are the main components of spatial noise. In AMLCDs, the most notable feature of the noise characteristic is the subpixel structure of complex pixel designs used in medical displays. The small-spot contrast of CRTs is dominated mainly by veiling glare and reflections of ambient illumination. In addition to display reflectance, the contrast of medical AMLCDs is affected by crosstalk and by variations of the luminance at off-normal viewing angles.

40|$|Abstract—Phosphor persistence, video bandwidth, DC {{restoration}} and high-voltage regulation affect {{the appearance of}} images presented on <b>cathode-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> (<b>CRTs),</b> potentially resulting in differences between nominal and actual stimuli. We illustrate these effects by measuring physical parameters of horizontal and vertical static and counter-phase � ickering gratings, and we illustrate problems for vision research by measuring contrast sensitivity to these gratings. We also measured {{the extent to which}} calibration protocols actually result in the monitor being calibrated over its entire area regardless of image size. The results of our physical measurements indicate substantial differences between gratings that nominally differ only as to orientation. Consistent with these differences, our psychophysical measurements indicate different sensitivities when the bars of the gratings are parallel or orthogonal to raster lines, regardless of the retinal orientation of the gratings. The results of our calibration check show that only a small region around the target area of calibration can be regarded as effectively linearized, and only if the size of the test image used during the check is similar {{to the size of the}} calibration patch. Overall, our results indicate potentially severe problems with the use of CRTs in vision research, and we discuss some published results that are likely to have been affected by these problems. 1...|$|R

The electrons' speed (and therefore energy, and therefore illuminating effect) is proportional to the current in the coil at the time the electrons pass through it. Hence, to implement an anti-aliasing scheme one controls pixel intensity by varying CRT neck coil current in accordance with the scheme. The result is to provide variable illumination intensity for each pixel, so that the pixels closest to the trajectory of the data points on the screen are made brighter, and those farther away, dimmer. The procedure improves the appearance of the display by providing a continuous-appearing and non-jumping waveform.|$|E

Even though systems vary in complexity, they are all composed of three functional components.

40|$|<b>Cathode-ray</b> <b>tubes</b> (<b>CRT)</b> {{have been}} used for the last 70 years and are {{expected}} to be incorporated in television sets for a further 15 years. The oxide cathode, located within the CRT, generates electrons which are focused and scanned across a phosphorescent screen to produce an image. The oxide cathode consists of a porous BaO/SrO spray layer deposited on a Ni alloy base. During operation, the Ni cap is heated. Activators (alloying additions, such as A 1 and Mg) reduce BaO to 'free' Ba, which migrates to the emissive oxide surface, reducing the work function. It has been postulated for sometime that an interfacial layer forms between the nickel and emissive layer, leading to a decrease in the performance during life. Early work suggested that the interfacial layer inhibits diffusion of activating elements to the reaction area and reduces the electron flux drawn from the cathode surface. This work examines lifetime tested commercial cathodes using modern surface and interfacial analysis techniques. The results obtained are used to provide information on interfacial reactions, the role of activators, interface layer formation and the reasons for degradation in cathode performance. The nickel-emissive oxide interface has been studied after stripping off the emissive oxide. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) /energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis show the presence of an interfacial layer (composed of Ba, Sr, A 1 and O) on cathodes (activated and aged) with no operational lifetime and those operated for 1000 and 2000 hours. Cross-sections of cathodes after varying operation times have also been examined. Cracks can be observed in the nickel cap and these cracks grow with increasing operational lifetime. There is a significant enrichment of Mg in the cracks. Focused ion beam (FIB) sections of samples exposed for 0, 1000 and 2000 hours have been prepared. Results from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies on these samples will be presented and clarify that the reaction products that form in the oxide cathode are composed of MgO and (Ba,Sr) Al 204. Time of flight-secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) has also been used to acquire depth profiles from the underlying Ni cap and crack regions. These results are used as the basis of a model of the interactions occurring at the nickel/emissive oxide interface as a function of operational lifetime...|$|R

Photomultiplier tubes or avalanche photodiodes convert the light into separate red, green and blue electrical signals for further electronic processing. This can be accomplished in “real time”, 24 frames per second (or in some cases faster). Rank Precision-Cintel introduced the “Mark” series of FSS telecines.
