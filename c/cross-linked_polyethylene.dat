25|$|Various {{methods can}} used to prepare <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (PE-X) from {{thermoplastic}} polyethylene (PE-LD, PE-LLD or PE-HD). By crosslinking low-temperature impact strength, abrasion resistance and environmental stress cracking resistance {{can be increased}} significantly, whereas hardness and rigidity are somewhat reduced. PE-X does not melt anymore (analogous to elastomers) and is thermally resistant (over longer periods of up to 120°C, for short periods without mechanical load up to 250°C). With increasing crosslinking density also the maximum shear modulus increases (even at higher temperatures). PE-X has significantly enhanced properties compared with ordinary PE. As PE-X is infusible, always the final pre-products or the mold part are cross-linked.|$|E

25|$|Regarding the {{organization}} of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The example given, paraffin wax, {{is a member of}} a family of hydrocarbon molecules of differing chain lengths, with high-density polyethylene at the long-chain end of the series. High-density polyethylene can be a strong material: when the hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, the resulting fibers rival the strength of steel. The covalent bonds in this material form extended structures, but do not form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from <b>Cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylene,</b> to rigid thermosetting resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids, to vitreous carbon, diamond-like carbons, and ultimately to diamond itself. As this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and network covalent solids.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Highly <b>cross-linked</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> (PE) {{have been}} {{developed}} with encouraging results in terms of wear. Another body of the literature has indicated potential catastrophic failures related to reduced fatigue properties and oxidation. Each PE available on the market has its own processing characteristics. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the minimum five-year wear properties of an original highly cross-linked PE in a consecutive series of primary THAs. METHODS: Between August 2005 and December 2007, 80 patients {{with a mean age}} of 62. 7 years were included. All patients had a 28 -mm CoCr femoral head articulating with a highly cross-linked insert (Highcross®, Medacta SA) that was 100 Mrads gamma radiated, remelted at 150 °C, and ethylene oxide sterilized. The primary criterion for evaluation was the femoral head penetration, as measured by Hip Analysis Suite software. The steady state wear was also calculated. Functional results were evaluated according to the WOMAC score. RESULTS: Complete data were available for analysis in 67 patients at a mean follow-up of 5. 5 years. The mean femoral head penetration was 0. 128 [*]±[*] 0. 62 mm and the steady state wear was- 0. 025 [*]±[*] 0. 22 mm/year. The WOMAC score significantly decreased from 16. 5 [*]±[*] 5. 93 pre-operatively to 4. 12 [*]±[*] 5. 5 at the latest follow-up (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The minimal five-year results of this retrospective study indicate that this particular highly <b>cross-linked</b> and remelted <b>polyethylene</b> had a low wear rate. Longer-term results are needed to warrant that these mid-term data will generate less osteolysis and resultant aseptic loosening...|$|R

30|$|This work {{describes}} the synthesis {{and the study}} of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) PHEMA hydrogels, <b>cross-linked</b> by <b>poly(ethylene</b> oxide)(PEO) chains containing the Gly-Gly-Leu tripeptide. This sequence was selected for its ability to be cleaved by subtilisin, a bacterial protease. The cross-linker was synthesized by coupling the peptide with two amino-terminated PEO chains of Mw= 3400 g/mol. The resulting polymer was characterized by size exclusion chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopy, and was shown to be readily cleaved by subtilisin. Its esterification of the hydroxyl end groups into methacrylate afforded a macromonomer that was used as a degradable cross-linker and copolymerized with hydroxyethylmethacrylate to form hydrogels. The swelling ratio of the gels increases when the PEO cross-linker/polyHEMA ratio increases. Incubation of these gels with the enzyme led to the total degradation of the gels. These assays show that these gels can be used as drug-delivery systems where the release is triggered by the presence of proteases.|$|R

The two cross-linking processes were examined by evaluating the performance of the end product and the production costs. The performance of the final product was assessed through experimental tests, which consisted in the evaluation of some peculiar properties of the material such as gel fraction, thermal modifications under heat fluxes, modulus of elasticity at 150 °C, elongation parameters. Costs were analyzed by considering both direct and indirect costs. It seems that, notwithstanding the elevated costs of installation, the electron-beam irradiation method is preferable because it allows for a product of superior characteristics with the lowest production costs...|$|R

An HDPE content as low as 1 wt % is found to introduce a small population of thicker crystalline lamellae, which are finely distributed throughout the material.

This article reports the coating of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MIONPs) with covalently <b>cross-linked</b> biofunctional <b>polyethylene</b> glycol (PEG) hydrogel. Silanized MIONPs were derivatized with eosin Y, and the covalently cross-linked biofunctional PEG hydrogel coating was achieved via surface-initiated photopolymerization of PEG diacrylate in aqueous solution. The thickness of the PEG hydrogel coating, between 23 and 126 nm, was tuned with laser exposure time. PEG hydrogel-coated MIONPs were further functionalized with the fibronectin-derived arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (RGDS) sequence, in order to achieve a biofunctional PEG hydrogel layer around the nanoparticles. RGDS-bound PEG hydrogel-coated MIONPs showed a 17 -fold higher uptake by the human cervical cancer HeLa cell line than that of amine-coated MIONPs. This novel method allows for the coating of MIONPs with nano-thin biofunctional hydrogel layers that may prevent undesirable cell and protein adhesion and may allow for cellular uptake in target tissues in a specific manner. These findings indicate that the further biofunctional PEG hydrogel coating of MIONPs is a promising platform for enhanced specific cell targeting in biomedical imaging and cancer therapy...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cross-linked polymer networks, {{irrespective}} of the method of cross-linking, contain a fraction of unattached polymer (sol macromolecules). During swelling in a solvent of low molecular weight, the sol macromolecules participate in the swelling process as an athermal solvent. Also, sol macromolecules begin to diffuse out of the swollen polymer into the surrounding solvent bath until equilibrium is reached between the sol macromolecules within the polymer specimen and the molecules in the surrounding bath. Thus, a partially cross-linked polymer during swelling {{should be treated as}} a ternary system consisting of polymer network, a high molecular weight solvent, and a low molecular weight solvent. On the basis of the Flory-Rehner theory, a first model has been developed to predict the swelling behavior of such ternary system. Transient states are considered as quasi-steady state, and the final condition of equilibrium is evaluated. The effect of polymer molecules in the surrounding solvent bath on the swelling behavior was also studied.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} novel active fasteners developed to significantly lower disassembly costs during reconditioning, remanufacturing, and recycling of products. In the initial stage of the fastener development process, the applicability of distinct trigger signals for active disassembly (AD) is evaluated. Based on this evaluation, the high robustness of using a pressure increase or decrease as a nondestructive trigger for AD is demonstrated. Since previously proposed pressure-sensitive fasteners face considerable drawbacks upon implementation in electronic products due to the ongoing trend of miniaturization, a second generation of pressure-based active fasteners is developed. Evaluation of these fasteners by means of axiomatic design techniques and prototyping demonstrates that the presented snap-fits, which make use of a closed-cell elastomer foam, are most robust. Subsequently, the contraction forces that closed-celled foams can exert {{as a function of}} an increase in ambient air pressure are experimentally determined. Furthermore, the implementation of pressure-sensitive foam-based snap-fits in both a modem and a payment terminal is described. Results of these experiments demonstrate that the contraction force of a <b>cross-linked</b> metallocene <b>polyethylene</b> closed-cell foams can reach up to 6 N/cm 2 at an overpressure of 2 bar and that the foam-based snap-fits can be released at a pressure increase of 2 bar. status: publishe...|$|R
