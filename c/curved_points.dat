The mathematical description of anti-de Sitter space generalizes the idea of curvature. In the mathematical description, curvature is a property of a particular point and can be divorced from some invisible surface to which <b>curved</b> <b>points</b> in spacetime meld themselves. So, for example, concepts like singularities (the most widely known of which in general relativity is the black hole) which cannot be expressed completely in a real world geometry, can correspond to particular states of a mathematical equation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} new {{hardware}} realization of fast elliptic <b>curve</b> Multi-Scalar <b>Point</b> Multiplication (MSPM) using {{the sum of}} products expansion of the scalars. In Elliptic <b>curve</b> <b>point</b> Multiplication latency depends {{on the number of}} one’s (Hamming Weight) in the binary representation of the scalar multiplier. By reducing the effective number of one’s in the multiplier, the multiplication speed is automatically increased. Therefore we describe a new method of effectively reducing the Hamming weight of the scalar multipliers thereby reduces the number of Point Adders when multi scalar multiplication is needed. The increase in speed achieved outweighs the hardware cost and complexity.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare the {{computational}} complexity of two parallel scalar multiplication {{methods used to}} speed up scalar multiplications for Elliptic Curve Cryptography applications. Pre-computations are advantageous only when the elliptic <b>curve</b> <b>point</b> is fixed. However, during secure communication sessions using either public keys or digital signatures, the elliptic <b>curve</b> <b>point</b> depends on the public key of the communicating entities and is therefore session dependent. Hence, a second method that replaces pre-computations with some post-computations, allows the pre-computation overhead to be distributed amongst parallel processors. Thus scalar multiplication can be computed more efficiently using the post-computation method in the more typical case where the elliptic <b>curve</b> <b>point</b> is variable...|$|R

Tate pairing is a bilinear map used in identity based cryptography schemes. In a typical elliptic curve cryptosystem, elliptic <b>curve</b> <b>point</b> multiplication is the most computationally expensive component. Similarly, Tate pairing is also quite computationally expensive. Therefore, it is more attractive to implement the ECC and Tate pairing using hardware than using software. The bases of both ECC and Tate pairing are Galois field arithmetic units. In this thesis, I propose the FPGA implementations of the elliptic <b>curve</b> <b>point</b> multiplication in GF (2283) as well as Tate pairing computation on supersingular elliptic curve in GF (2283).
