50|$|There {{was little}} standardisation, {{well into the}} 19th century, in British service, {{virtually}} every calibre had its own time fuze. For example, seven different fuses were used with spherical cased shot until 1850. However, in 1829 metal fuzes were adopted by the Royal Navy instead of wooden ones. At this time fuzes were used with shrapnel, common shell (filled with explosive) and grenades. All British fuzes were prepared by <b>cutting</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> or boring into the bottom from below. The problem was that this left the powder unsupported and fuze failures were common. The indefatigable Colonel Boxer suggested a better way : wooden fuze cones with a central powder channel and holes drilled every 2/10th of an inch. There were white and black painted fuzes for odd and even tenths, clay prevented the powder spilling out. In 1853 these were combined into a single fuze with dual channels, 2 inches long for howitzers and common shell, 1 inch for shrapnel.|$|E
50|$|Slip-on flanges are slipped {{over the}} pipe and welded to provide {{strength}} and prevent leakage.

50|$|The chief {{advantage}} of these connectors {{is that they can}} be installed after <b>cutting</b> the pipe <b>to</b> <b>length</b> in the field. This can save time and considerable expense compared to flange connections, which must be factory- or field-welded to pipe segments. However, mechanically fastened joints are sensitive to residual and thickness stresses caused by dissimilar metals and temperature changes.|$|R
50|$|Push-to-pull, push-to-connect, push-in, push-fit, or instant {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} easily removed {{compression fitting}} or quick connect fitting that allows an air (or water) line to be attached, nominally {{without the use of}} tools (a tool is still usually required for <b>cutting</b> tubing <b>to</b> <b>length</b> and removal). These fittings act similar to the way regular compression fittings work, but use a resilient O-ring for sealing, and a grip ring to hold the (possibly grooved) tube in place. With metal tubing, a groove is needed to hold the tube in place. With PTFE tubing, the tube deforms around the grip ring.|$|R

50|$|Roll forming lines {{can be set}} up with {{multiple}} configurations to punch and cut off parts in a continuous operation. For <b>cutting</b> a part <b>to</b> <b>length,</b> the lines {{can be set up}} to use a pre-cut die where a single blank runs through the roll mill, or a post-cut die where the profile is cutoff after the roll forming process. Features may be added in a hole, notch, embossment, or shear form by punching in a roll forming line. These part features can be done in a pre-punch application (before roll forming starts), in a mid-line punching application (in the middle of a roll forming line/process) or a post punching application (after roll forming is done). Some roll forming lines incorporate only one of the above punch or cutoff applications, others incorporate {{some or all of the}} applications in one line.|$|R
50|$|It {{was during}} this period {{that part of the}} arm was taken out of use and filled in. This led to the canal {{terminating}} just before the Chiltern Main Line, <b>cutting</b> its <b>length</b> <b>to</b> approximately 440 metres. The former canal bed is virtually untraceable, having been built over with houses and offices. All that remains is a well hidden bridge next to a car park. This led, in 1982, to the formation of the Saltisford Canal Trust which spent the next six years restoring the remainder of the route to its former glories. Further work was done in 2007, helped by a £2,000 grant from the Inland Waterways Association. The arm now houses several permanent boats, on which families live, as well as playing host to many travelling vessels and hiring out two boats for public use.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} accurate strategy for estimation of cutting coefficients for ball-end milling of free form surfaces in 3 - and 5 -axis operations. Since the cutting coefficients are not constant along the tool axis in the ball part of the cutter, the tool is considered by dividing the ball region into thin disks. In order to find the contribution of each disk <b>to</b> resultant <b>cutting</b> force, an experimental setup is designed to cut the workpiece while only that disk is in engaged with the workpiece. It is shown that this method is more efficient than common methods of mechanistic identification of cutting constants that are available in literature. The derivations are improved by considering the helix angle and <b>cutting</b> edge <b>length</b> <b>to</b> enhance {{the accuracy of the}} estimated cutting coefficients. Validation of the proposed strategy is demonstrated experimentally by simulation of cutting forces and comparing the results with conventional methods of identification of cutting coefficients that have been proposed in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{high cost}} {{associated}} with the training of forestry machine operators {{has led to the}} development of a computerized training environment for this task. Since the emphasis is on training instead of computer graphics, the degree of realism with which we present a forest scene, for example, must be balanced by the available computing power so that the operator's gestures may be reflected, in real time, as changes in the behavior of the simulated machine. Introduction Forestry is Canada's most important industry in terms of net contribution to the economy, number of people employed, and socio-economic importance [1]. Most modern Canadian forestry machines for wood harvesting are diesel-powered hydraulic construction equipment retrofitted with special end effector tools (also called "attachments") and operator controls to manipulate trees and logs instead of earth, in order to perform the felling, delimbing, and <b>cutting</b> <b>to</b> <b>length.</b> While North-American wood harvesting machines are well ad [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Environmental impacts {{associated}} with the life-cycle of forest resource activities were assessed for the Southeastern U. S. and Pacific Northwest supply regions {{as a component of}} a broad analysis of life-cycle inventory data on wood products produced in these regions. The assessment included all of the inputs to establish a forest stand (seedlings, site preparation, and planting), to treat that stand through harvest maturity (thinning and fertilization) and to harvest the merchantable logs from the stand. To provide a region-wide representation under different management strategies, three forest management scenarios were structured for both the Southeastern U. S. and Pacific Northwest regions. Within each region, three combinations of management intensity and site productivity were allocated to acreages corresponding to the U. S. Forest Service RPA allocation and then merged into a single estimate of yield and the corresponding harvesting impacts. This allocation of acreage to management intensity/site productivity class provided a representative base case for each region. A more intensive management alternative was created for each region by reallocating acres to higher management intensity classes. Harvesting activities were segmented into five stages to allow development of all inputs and outputs: (1) felling, (2) processing (bucking, limbing, <b>cutting</b> <b>to</b> <b>length),</b> (3) secondar...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This article compares 2 {{variants}} of logging technologies at the motor-manual level: variant A – cutting and delimbing {{by means of}} a petrol chainsaw, skidding {{with the use of a}} cable winch mounted on a tractor (67 – 74 kW); variant B – cutting {{by means of a}} petrol chainsaw, skidding, debranching and <b>cutting</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> by means of a processor aggregated with a farm tractor (61 kW). Material and Methods: Direct dosimetry and non-parametric (moving block bootstrap) methods were used in order to specify the characteristics of the collected sets. Results: Bootstrap average values show that the average CO concentration at a skidding tractor operator’s station during early thinning was 2. 54 mg×m– 3. At processor operator’s station it amounted to 10. 35 mg×m– 3. Such results allow to conclude that a higher CO concentration at the above-mentioned 2 work stations was observed during early thinning. In the case of a petrol chainsaw operator, it was observed that the permissible exposure limit (23 mg×m– 3) was exceeded and the short-term permissible exposure limit (117 mg×m– 3) was not. The average concentration value for a chainsaw operator working individually during late thinning interventions was substantially lower (15. 01 mg×m– 3), which results from the lack of technological pressure that can be observed while cooperating with a processor operator. Conclusions: The risk increases along with conditions that generate the concentration of exhaust produced by 2 -stroke petrol chainsaw engines...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the break-even price at a 6 percent and 10 percent real interest rate for "intensive " and "minimally managed" scenarios for managing eucalypt energy plantations. The break-even price {{is greater than the}} average stumpage price reported for firewood and chipwood by the State Board of Equalization. However, a conversion surplus approach shows that eucalypt firewood plantations are profitable for both the intensive and minimally managed scenario. For plantations producing chips for energy, only the minimally managed scenario, with yields greater than 58 dry tons per acre at harvest, appears to be profitable, assuming delivered chip prices of $ 35 per bone dry ton. The benefit-cost ratio for a commercial planting of eucalypts at the Concord Naval Weapons Station, California, showed that a return of at least 10 percent on establishment costs was highly probable with proper choice of species. An evaluation of the economic feasibility of investment in a eucalypt energy plantation must involve an assessment of the costs of the various cultural practices (planting, weed control, irrigation), the costs of processing the standing tree into a usable form (logging costs, transportation costs, chipping, <b>cutting</b> <b>to</b> firewood <b>length)</b> and the returns expected from the sale of the processed product (firewood, chips), all compounded or discounted to a constant point in time at an interest rate {{selected on the basis of}} management objectives. Presented below are two different analyses of eucalypt energy plantations. First, two possible management scenarios are presented, drawn from a survey of planting and cultural practices throughout California, and a "break-even " price is calculated. This break-even price is the necessary return on a cord of firewood or ton of chips, to earn a given rate of return on money invested in the plantation. The second analysis calculates a benefit-cost ratio from an actual case study of a commercial planting of eucalypts at the U. S...|$|R

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was to develop and implement methods to improve the performance and the efficiency of construction processes prior to and during the construction phase in Design-Bid-Build (DBB) projects. In order to accomplish these goals, the three methods Lean, Green, and Six-Sigma were implemented in two different scenarios and validated by different case studies. First, a framework was developed that integrated the three methods Lean, Green, and Six-Sigma with an overall layout of the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) improvement model. The framework was then validated via a construction process of installation of pile caps for an educational institute during the construction phase in Pittsburgh. The framework highlighted two issues with the pile caps construction process. First, disparate quantities of materials (purchased and installed) were determined. Second, the pile caps construction process took a total time of 54 business days while it could have been completed in 30 business days. Using life cycle assessment, environmental impacts of the pile cap construction process were analyzed and results showed that major environmental impacts including global warming potential, release of carcinogenics, negative respiratory effects, ozone depletion, and ecotoxcity could result from the materials used for the process. Next, the root causes behind waste generation were determined via developing and administrating a questionnaire to a local construction company. Second, the previously developed framework was further validated and applied to a residential development project in Saudi Arabia. The construction sector has been growing rapidly in Saudi Arabia; however, the quality of Saudi Arabian construction is decreasing, resulting in excess waste generation and associated environmental impacts. This case study examined a project with 53 residential units overall but only 10 units acceptable at final inspection. The largest quality issue was determined to be exterior paint blistering. Using the developed framework, defective units were investigated through a field examination, narrowing down the causes of the blistering applying the Pareto method as follows: Inadequate method, untrained workers, weather, and others. Next, the Process improvement tool was applied to reduce the blistering causes and to improve the current process. A new method designed and applied to a separate residential unit for validation. The modified method showed a great improvement and in the end the unit was able to pass inspection. Finally, building on the previous case studies, the framework was later refined with the goal of applying it earlier in a project, prior to construction, to further reduce potential waste generation and associated environmental impacts. Using Lean Green, and Six-Sigma (LG 6) and adopting the same improvement model, DMAIC, the owner can evaluate all steps separately in the process, addressing all resources consumed and analyzing environmental impacts which might be generated; this highlights potential waste and so can help the owner avoid waste occurrence by indicating where the process needs to be amended to create less environmental impact and more efficiency. For this research, the model was used to help evaluate the construction process for the installation of 160 woodpiles. The model identified that four steps out of eight were considered as non-adding value steps or waste. Three steps out of four non-adding value steps were involved with moving down, moving around, and setting up the equipment. The remaining wasteful step was <b>cutting</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> all installed woodpiles. The model showed that if these steps were replaced, eliminated or planned well, environmental impacts would be reduced by 9...|$|E
