5|$|If two <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> {{the same}} type meet in this phase, they cross-fertilise to a diploid zygote through the fusion of protoplasms and nuclei. The {{conditions}} which trigger this are not known. The diploid zygote becomes a multinucleated plasmodium through multiple nuclear divisions without further cell division. If the resulting cells were peritrichous, they change their shape before the fusion from the peritrichous form to the myxamoeba. For {{the production of a}} zygote, <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> different mating types (heterothallic) are required.|$|E

5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E
5|$|L.gigas is {{very often}} parasitized by protists of the phylum Apicomplexa, which are common mollusk parasites. Those coccidian parasites, which are spore-forming, {{single-celled}} microorganisms, initially establish themselves in large vacuolated <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the host's digestive gland, where they reproduce freely. The infestation may {{proceed to the}} secretory <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the same organ. The entire life cycle of the parasite typically occurs within a single host and tissue.|$|E
5|$|Most viral {{vaccines}} {{are based}} on live attenuated viruses, while many bacterial vaccines {{are based on}} acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the innate immune system and maximize immunogenicity.|$|E

40|$|Single {{mitochondria}} <b>of</b> contracting myocardial <b>cells</b> were irradiated with an {{argon laser}} microbeam and the contractility changes <b>of</b> the <b>cells</b> were noted. Four series of irradiation experiments were conducted: (i) one <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> a two-cell group was killed, (ii) one <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> a multicell group was killed, (iii) one <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> a two-cell group was damaged, (iv) one <b>cell</b> <b>of</b> a multicell group was damaged. In series (i) and (ii) a majority <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> first fibrillated and then either returned to rhythmic contraction rate, or stopped contracting. In series (iii) and (iv) the individual contractility pattern following irradiation was quite variable, but by 30 min post irradiation a majority <b>of</b> the <b>cells</b> {{had returned to}} a rhythmic contraction rate. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of using the laser microbeam to investigate cell-cell interactions, and factors involved in regulating myocardial cell contractility...|$|R
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is at the}} centre of each adrenal gland, and is {{surrounded}} by the adrenal cortex. The chromaffin <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the medulla are the body's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla. Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the {{adaptive}} immune system are special types of leukocytes, called lymphocytes. B cells and T cells are the major types of lymphocytes and are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. B cells {{are involved in the}} humoral immune response, whereas T cells are involved in cell-mediated immune response.|$|E

5|$|When foraging, the blackmouth {{catshark}} swings its {{head from side}} to side to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, and less on smell. As in most sharks, its visual acuity is greatest along the median horizontal plane. The lens and cone <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> its eyes are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> its eyes are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited by most of the organisms it hunts. For electroreception, the {{blackmouth catshark}} has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged, which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast-moving prey.|$|E

5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.|$|E
