5000|$|The term {{dates to}} the French {{language}} verb couper, translating as cut, referring {{to the fact that}} the body is separated by a <b>cut-off</b> <b>wheel,</b> or [...] "cut in half". The coupé was developed from the berline by removing the rear-facing front passenger seats and shortening the passenger enclosure by a corresponding amount. The resulting shortened berline was called halbberline in Germany and berlingot or berline coupé in France. The term [...] "berline coupé" [...] was later shortened to [...] "coupé". Normally, a coupé had a fixed glass window in the front of the passenger compartment. The coupé was considered to be an ideal vehicle for women to use to go shopping or to make social visits.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{analysis}} of problems of diamond cut-off wheels used in slot grinding of ceramics at present, a brazed diamond <b>cut-off</b> <b>wheel</b> was produced and analyzed. Two typical advanced ceramics, alumina and silicon nitride, were used as the workpiece materials. In the experiments of slot grinding of ceramics, grinding ratio, wear process of the wheel and grinding quality of the work were studied. Experimental {{results showed that the}} brazed diamond <b>cut-off</b> <b>wheel</b> obtained good grinding ratio and abrasive resistance. The surface roughness of ground silicon nitride was better than that of alumina...|$|E
40|$|Examination {{revealed}} that holes {{observed in the}} trays were not caused by gradual loss of material or by fracture. Evidences suggest that the holes were created deliberately by using abrasive <b>cut-off</b> <b>wheel.</b> This has been further substantiated through microstructural study wherein material flow and deformation was observed at the hole-surfaces. Based on this, inference is drawn that the holes were created either during installation of the distillation column or during subsequent maintenance. However, {{it has to be}} established why and when the holes were created. The material of the tray was found to conform to the design specification...|$|E

50|$|A {{concrete}} saw (also {{known as a}} consaw, road saw, cut-off saw or quick cut) is a power tool used for cutting concrete, masonry, brick, asphalt, tile, and other solid materials. It can be a small hand-held cut-off saw, a big walk-behind saw or other styles, {{and it may be}} powered by gasoline, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure, or electric motors. The saw blades used on {{concrete saw}}s are often diamond saw blades to cut concrete, asphalt, stone, etc. Abrasive <b>cut-off</b> <b>wheels</b> can also be used on cut-off saws to cut stone and steel. The significant friction generated in cutting hard substances like concrete usually requires the blades to be cooled to prolong their life and reduce dust.|$|R
50|$|Tyrolit was co-founded on the 13th of February 1919 by Daniel Swarovski to {{manufacture}} grinding wheels {{for the production}} of Swarovski-Crystals. During World War I, the Swarovski Group was cut off from supplies of grinding wheels and was forced to develop and produce its own grinding wheels. After the war, it was decided to commercialize this activity and to start a separate company: Tyrolit was born.In 1950, the company relocated from the Swarovski Headquarters in Wattens to a new location in Schwaz. One of the largest drivers of growth of the company was the market launch of the glass fibre reinforced <b>cut-off</b> and grinding <b>wheel</b> SECUR in 1952. The glass fibre reinforcement greatly improved the security of the tools against centrifugal breakage.In 1991 Tyrolit acquired the US company Diamond Products and the Swiss company Hydrostress. These acquisitions added significant presence in the market for concrete drilling and sawing systems.Further major acquisitions took place in 2004 with the purchasing of the Czech company Carborundum Electrite, in 2009 with the purchasing of the US company Radiac and in 2014 with the purchasing of the South African company Grinding Techniques.|$|R
