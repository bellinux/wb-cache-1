40|$|This review {{poses the}} question, is it {{possible}} to prevent the development of anxiety disorders through selective interventions? The article begins with a review of the major psychosocial risk factors for anxiety disorders. Evidence is reviewed to support the role of inhibited temperament, parent anxiety, environmental support of avoidant coping, and vicarious and instructional learning of avoidance as risks for anxiety. It is argued that the central focus of these risks is an inhibited temperament and that the other risk factors are likely to be both moderated and mediated by this temperamental style. Thus, a <b>clear</b> <b>option</b> for prevention would be to modify early inhibition. Some preliminary data are presented from the Macquarie University Preschool Intervention Project, a longitudinal study of a brief parent education program for the reduction of inhibited temperament in preschool children. Although there remains considerable room for stronger effects, preliminary results show clear promise that {{it may be possible to}} modify early risk for anxiety disorders. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of digital radiobroadcast {{standards and the}} advantages related to it (optimization of video, audio and applications transmission and services) makes indispensable the study of its technical characteristics, due to the definition, over common parameters, {{of the advantages of}} each standard by itself and in comparison to others. In this paper the basic technical characteristics of two terrestrial digital radiobroadcasting standards are shown: on one hand, the so called “In-Band-On-Channel” (IBOC) and, on the other, the “Digital Audio Broadcast” (DAB) standard. The analysis compares the data management procedures of the standards and its relation with the open systems interconnection model – OSI, that opens the possibility to make a real comparison between them. At the end it is concluded that, technologically, the possibility for radio stations to use their actual infrastructure without capital modifications and / or enhancements, makes IBOC a <b>clear</b> <b>option</b> of implementation for digital radiobroadcasting in countries like Mexico...|$|E

Many of them are even implemented for the use on multiprocessor machines. Well known packages include UMFPACK [7], PARDISO [8], MUMPS [9], WSMP [10], or the HSL collection (for example, HSL_MA 78 [11]) to name a few. In view of possibly many right hand sides they are a <b>clear</b> <b>option,</b> {{despite the fact that}} for the size and type of problems considered in industrial practice, the storage demands are so high that they typically can only work in an out-of-core setting, that is, the matrix factors are stored on hard disk instead of main memory. Another difficulty is that a new factorization has to be computed for every frequency or every modification in the optimization loop. Finally also the bad scaling {{and the fact that the}} problems get increasingly ill-conditioned for large frequencies presents a real challenge, because the desired solution accuracy may not be realizable. Some of the packages provide specialized routines for complex symmetric systems, which have the potential to half the storage and computational requirements, but may also increase the complexity of pivoting strategies.|$|E
40|$|The {{exercise}} of the political regime established by the 1991 Romanian Constitution generated various constitutional conflicts and political tensions. The very essence of these political tensions is of institutional nature and resides within the Constitutional provisions. According to the Constitution, the President of Romania is designated on grounds of general direct elections, but the presidential function is empowered with rather limited constitutional prerogatives which allow him to implement the presidential political programme. The Prime-Minister is invested with stronger executive powers and prerogatives, although he is not directly elected by the citizens. This leads to a conflict between the direct democratic legitimacy and formal constitutional prerogatives of the President, on the one hand, and the substantial constitutional powers of the Prime-Minister, {{in spite of the}} indirect democratic legitimacy of this position, on the other hand. The solution of this conflict could be the expression of a <b>clear</b> <b>option</b> for an accurate political regime within a future Constitutional revision procedure. Romania could choose between a presidential political regime, a parliamentary political regime or a real semi-presidential political regime (as in France). In our opinion, the solution of establishing an accurate semi-presidential political regime, approaching the French model, is the most feasible one. This option enfolds a great advantage: the harmonization of the conflict between direct democratic legitimacy and the constitutional prerogatives of the elected President. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} several {{advanced}} magnetic resonance (MR) techniques for quantitative measurements in parenchymal liver disease are studied. In particular, certain important hallmarks of liver disease such as steatosis, fibrosis, iron overload and inflammation are studied. Steatosis or fatty liver disease can be ascertained invasively—with biopsy—but is preferable assessed non-invasively, for example with MR techniques. This thesis shows that both MR imaging and spectroscopy are preferable over {{qualitative and quantitative}} (invasive) histological assessment in terms of correlation with biochemically determined liver fat content. Moreover, MR spectroscopy derived fat signal fractions can be confidently converted to fat mass fractions, allowing easier interpretation and comparison with biochemical analyses. MR elastography {{can be used for}} MR-based fibrosis assessment and is shown to have very good interobserver agreement, supporting its use as non-invasive screening tool for liver fibrosis. For liver iron content assessment MRI offers several options. This work shows that in terms of success rates, the Gandon and R 2 * methods are preferable over the R 2 method. Moreover, as the R 2 * has better interobserver agreement, requires fewer breath holds and can distinguish a wider range of liver iron levels, it is the method of choice. For inflammation assessment, MR has no single, <b>clear</b> <b>option</b> yet. 31 P MR spectroscopy is one of the possible methods and allows probing of phosphorus-containing liver metabolites.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{when people}} in intergroup conflicts will display universal versus parochial cooperation (serving one’s own group, potentially {{at a cost}} to rivalling other groups). We specifically investigate how cues from a person’s personality (intrapersonal), cues from other members of the own group (intragroup), and cues about the relation between the groups (intergroup) direct an individual towards each form of cooperation. Seven experiments are reported using two different paradigms. The first three empirical chapters employ negotiation paradigms. In negotiations, searching for a mutually beneficial agreement and making concessions reflects universal cooperation while refusing to concede and forcing the other party into concessions reflects parochial cooperation. The last empirical chapter employs an experimental game paradigm, where individual and group outcomes depend on individuals’ and (opposing) group members’ contributions to their own group (parochial) or the collective of both parties (universal). Our results show that individuals, especially pro-socials, are inclined to show parochial cooperation. However, they are sensitive to intragroup factors such as constituencies’ preferences and approval. Representatives will increase their universal cooperation when their constituency communicates either a clear preference for cooperation towards the out-group, or emotional approval of a cooperative first offer towards the out-group. They are also influenced by intergroup factors, such that their universal cooperation increases when parochial cooperation comes at the cost of the other party- But only when there is a <b>clear</b> <b>option</b> accessible for mutual gain. Thus, their parochial cooperation efforts can be redirected to more universal cooperation with potentially value creating outcomes...|$|E
