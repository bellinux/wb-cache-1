30|$|In our opinion, small (< 5  cm), asymptomatic, intraosseous <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>lesions</b> of long bones with {{absence of}} {{radiological}} and MRI signs of local aggressiveness should be observed as benign enchondroma, and no surgery or further investigations other than serial radiological follow-up are indicated.|$|R
30|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of intraosseous <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>lesions</b> {{is based on}} imaging or clinical examination findings. Chondroma is a benign variant, characterized by the formation of mature hyaline cartilage without atypia, while chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that produces atypical cartilage matrix and features an infiltrative growth pattern in the medullary and cortical bone tissue.|$|R
30|$|PET–CT {{can be used}} as an {{objective}} and quantitative method of differentiating between chondromas and chondrosarcomas located within the long bones. It represents a complementary examination to standard imaging (X-Ray, scintigraphy, CT and MRI) and pathological exams.

30|$|Chondrosarcoma (CS) is {{the second}} most {{frequent}} primary malignant bone tumor after osteosarcoma. Central CS may grow primarily in the medullary canal of healthy bone or may be secondary to pre-existing benign enchondroma [1]. The prognosis of central CS is directly correlated with the histological grade of malignancy, which is assessed following the criteria described by Evans et al., considering cellularity, tumor matrix characteristics, nuclear features, and mitotic rate [2]. Histologic evaluation of cartilaginous tumors represents a challenging task for the pathologist, and consistent interobserver variability, concerning grading and the distinction between benign and malignant lesions, was observed [3, 4]. Moreover, in the past the concept of “borderline” lesion was introduced, with the aim of indicating a <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>lesion</b> more active than a benign enchondroma but less atypical than a grade  1 chondrosarcoma [5]. Other definitions were used to indicate borderline lesions, such as “atypical enchondroma,” “grade  0 chondrosarcoma,” and “cartilaginous lesion with unknown malignant potential” (CLUMP) [6, 7], but finally there was no common agreement on the adequacy and usefulness of these definitions, which have now generally been abandoned.|$|E
30|$|The {{variability}} in histological grading {{and the consequent}} bias, which impacts on every work on this subject, {{is more difficult to}} overcome. Different imaging techniques or clinical patterns have been tested and proposed to support the diagnosis, but no conclusive data are currently available. In fact, a variable spectrum of imaging patterns can be associated with grade  1 CS, ranging from apparently benign asymptomatic enchondroma to clearly aggressive symptomatic malignant <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>lesion.</b> Lesion dimensions were argued to be indicative of malignancy, but this was not confirmed by recent investigations [14]. Cortical bone alterations such as endosteal scalloping, thinning, thickening, bone enlargement, and cortical interruptions or periosteal reaction were considered signs of malignancy, and computed tomography (CT) scan is the best option to evaluate cortical bone modifications. Bone enlargement and cortical thinning were found to be significant signs of malignancy in a recent report, and the authors suggested wide resection as surgical treatment when these imaging features are observed [14]. The presence of soft tissue mass represents another important sign of malignancy; in a recent investigation about MRI findings in these tumors, the authors concluded that soft tissue mass was indicative of high-grade lesion whereas the presence of entrapped fat within the tumoral tissue was consistent with low-grade tumors [26]. Dynamic MRI was found useful in differential diagnosis between benign and malignant cartilaginous lesions; early uptake of gadolinium with an exponential curve was associated with malignant cartilaginous tumors [27]. Recently, the role of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in differential diagnosis of cartilaginous tumors was investigated: the standard uptake value resulted to be correlated to the grade of malignancy, with a cutoff value between benign and malignant lesions ranging from 2 to 2.3 in two different reports, with statistical significance in only one of them [28, 29].|$|E
40|$|The growing {{precision}} of diagnostic techniques (MRI, arthrography, arthroscopy) {{and the consequent}} increase of the diagnosis of <b>cartilaginous</b> and ligamentous <b>lesions</b> of the wrist led us to undertake a detailed anatomical study of the carpus and to extend this study {{to the search for}} correlations between these lesions and the radio-ulnar index. Fifty one cadaveric wrists were dissected from an elderly population (mean age of 76 years). <b>Cartilaginous</b> <b>lesions</b> were found in two-thirds of radioulnar joints of the wrist with a marked predominance for the lunate bone (43 %). The triangular cartilage of the fibrocartilaginous complex (TFCC) was perforated in 23 wrists (46 %). We established a correlation between the radio-ulnar index and perforations of the TFCC (p < 0. 05), as well as the thickness of this structure (p < 0. 05). The relationship between age and rupture of intrinsic ligaments (p < 0. 05), and the radio-ulnar index (p < 0. 05) and age was also established. We present our figures, discuss the clinical implications, and draw the following conclusions from this study. 1) The carpus is a complex joint which is subject to age-related degeneration. 2) The large number of <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>lesions</b> observed in this study {{must be taken into account}} in the interpretation of MRI and the "over" precise results of arthroscopy. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Treatment for chondromas is {{different}} from that for chondrosarcomas. Benign <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>lesions</b> can be treated conservatively. When we face a chondrosarcoma, the curettage plus cryotherapy and cementation or wide resection would be the most frequent options of treatment. We have to consider the possibility of the progression of the cancer cells inside the medullary canal and destruction of the cortical bone reaching the soft tissue, with a chance of progressing to the extra-cortical compartment and invading the soft tissue as well as metastasizing to the lungs. Early diagnosis of chondrosarcoma is important in oncological practice.|$|R
30|$|Unique {{properties}} of cartilage (e.g., small cellularity, very {{low rate of}} mitosis, high quantities of chondroid matrix and inactive extracellular matrix, poor vascularization and anaerobic glycolysis) contribute to low SUV values.

30|$|In our protocol, biopsy was omitted in <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>lesions</b> without {{radiographic}} aggressive behavior, and definitive histologic {{diagnosis was}} made on the entire tissue obtained by curettage. When an aggressive imaging pattern was evident, biopsy was performed to confirm diagnosis before resection. Since definitive diagnosis is possible only after examination of the complete specimen, the chance of inadvertent curettage of grade  2 CS must be considered, but after secondary appropriate treatment with wide resection, no adverse influence on outcome was reported [30]. Our personal therapeutic opinion was validated {{by the results of}} the present study: in our series, by accurate selection of patients based on imaging criteria, no inadvertent curettage of grade  2 CS was observed. Nonetheless, this possibility should always be considered, and adequate surgical exposure and technique must always be adopted to make a second procedure of wide resection feasible.|$|R
40|$|Malignant {{melanoma}} {{can present}} {{a variety of}} histopathological patterns. Cartilaginous change {{in the absence of}} osteogenic differentiation is extremely rare in malignant melanoma, being among the least frequent of the wide range of melanoma histologic patterns.

Histopathological examination of the lesion led to a diagnosis of malignant melanoma with cartilaginous differentiation devoid of concomitant osseous areas. It would appear that this unusual form of melanoma has a predilection for acral location, particularly the subungual region.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of chondroid lesions requires full integration of clinical, radiographic, and pathological data; tumour typing {{is often a}} challenge for the diagnostic pathologist. Although a variety of chromosomal abnormalities have been documented in chondroid lesions, the potential usefulness of cytogenetic analysis remains unclear. This study has critically reviewed and analysed 117 karyotyped samples from 100 patients with cartilaginous and chordoid tumours. Cases were selected based on successful chromosomal analysis and adequacy of clinical, radiographic, and pathological information. To ensure objective evaluation, the cytogenetic results were correlated in a double-blind setting with consensus diagnoses independently determined on each case, after complete review of the histological, radiographic, and clinical findings. Karyotypic aberrations were identified in 41 / 92 cartilaginous tumours (5 / 11 osteochondromas, 2 / 3 chondromyxoid fibromas, 0 / 4 chondroblastomas, 11 / 29 chondromas, 0 / 3 chondroid tumours of undetermined malignant potential, 22 / 40 chondrosarcomas and 1 / 2 miscellaneous <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>lesions)</b> and 5 / 8 chordomas. Complex karyotypic changes were a feature of malignant tumours (chondrosarcoma and chordoma) and of chondrosarcoma among cartilaginous tumours, where they correlated with high tumour grade. Among primary well-differentiated <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>lesions</b> of bone, the finding of an abnormal karyotype was consistently associated with a grade 1 chondrosarcoma diagnosis. Among karyotypically abnormal cartilaginous tumours, loss of distal 8 q was associated with osteochondroma, + 5 with synovial chondroma/chondromatosis and parosteal or soft tissue chondroma, alterations of chromosome arm 6 q with chondromyxoid fibroma, + 7 with bone chondrosarcoma, and 17 p 1 alterations with grade 3 chondrosarcoma. Alterations involving 12 q 13 characterized synovial chondroma/chondromatosis in the chondroma group and myxoid chondrosarcoma of bone in the chondrosarcoma group. In conclusion, cytogenetic abnormalities in chondroid lesions are common and are not randomly distributed. They are associated with malignancy/tumour grade {{as well as with}} specific diagnoses in many cases, and can therefore be of potential value for tumour typing. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Morbus Ollier is {{characterized}} by the presence of multiple enchondromas, i. e. benign intraosseous <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>lesions.</b> Although their manifestation in the limb bones is well described, only few cases with ENT involvement, primarily arising from the skull, have been reported. The malignant transformation toward slowly growing low-grade chondrosarcomas is the most severe form of progression. Methods: We report a unique case of a 54 -year-old Ollier disease patient with an extensive nasal enchondroma apparently eroding the middle nasal concha and expanding to the lateral nasal wall that raised suspicion of malignant transformation. Results: Radiological and histological features of enchondromas can be controversial and appear to have limited sensitivity to exclude low-grade malignancy. The clinical symptoms play a decisive role in differentiation between enchondromas and low-grade chondrosarcomas.
