5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide.</b> Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, (Ln,Th)PO4, which usually contains all the rare earths, {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid, but <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> is insoluble in HNO3 and hence precipitates out. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter.|$|E

40|$|Synergy for low {{temperature}} Hg 0 oxidation under {{selective catalytic reduction}} (SCR) atmosphere was achieved when copper <b>oxides</b> and <b>cerium</b> <b>oxides</b> were combined in a CuO-CeO 2 /TiO 2 (CuCeTi) catalyst. Hg 0 oxidation efficiency as high as 99. 0 % was observed on the CuCeTi catalyst at 200 °C, even the gas hourly space velocity was extremely high. To analyze the synergistic effect, comparisons of catalyst performance {{in the presence of}} different SCR reaction gases were systematically conducted over CuO/TiO 2 (CuTi), CeO 2 /TiO 2 (CeTi) and CuCeTi catalysts prepared by sol-gel method. The interactions between copper <b>oxides</b> and <b>cerium</b> <b>oxides</b> in CuCeTi catalyst yielded more surface chemisorbed oxygen, and facilitated the conversion of gas-phase O 2 to surface oxygen, which are favorable for Hg 0 oxidation. Copper oxides in the combination interacted with NO forming more chemisorbed oxygen for Hg 0 oxidation in the absence of gas-phase O 2. <b>Cerium</b> <b>oxides</b> in the combination promoted Hg 0 oxidation through enhancing the transformations of NO to NO 2. In the absence of NO, NH 3 exhibited no inhibitive effect on Hg 0 oxidation, because enough Lewis acid sites due to the combination of copper <b>oxides</b> and <b>cerium</b> <b>oxides</b> scavenged the competitive adsorption between NH 3 and Hg 0. In the presence of NO, although NH 3 lowered Hg 0 oxidation rate through inducing reduction of oxidized mercury, complete recovery of Hg 0 oxidation activity over the CuCeTi catalyst was quickly achieved after cutting off NH 3. This study revealed the synergistic effect of the combination of copper <b>oxides</b> and <b>cerium</b> <b>oxides</b> on Hg 0 oxidation, and explored the involved mechanisms. Such knowledge would help obtaining maximum Hg 0 oxidation co-benefit from SCR units in coal-fired power plants...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{manganese}} and <b>cerium</b> <b>oxides</b> supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) catalysts for low-temperature NH 3 {{selective catalytic reduction}} (SCR) of NOx were prepared by the pore volume impregnation method. The SCR activity of Mn-Ce/MWCNTs catalysts was {{compared with that of}} Mn/MWCNTs catalyst The effects of Ce were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, N- 2 adsorption-desorption, H- 2 temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. The results show that the addition of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxides</b> could improve the SCR activity of Mn/MWCNTs catalysts. Mn-Ce/MWCNTs catalyst with a Ce/Mn ratio of 0. 6 was found to have the highest activity. The addition of <b>cerium</b> <b>oxides</b> enhanced the dispersion of metal oxides on the MWCNTs. It could also increase the specific surface area and total pore volume, and decrease the average pore size of the catalysts. Ce would improve the concentration of oxygen and the valence of manganese. Furthermore, from the XRD results, it was obvious that the crystalline MnOx disappeared because of the introduction of Ce to the catalyst. MnOx mainly existed in an amorphous state or microcrystal structure in the Mn-Ce/MWCNTs catalysts. CeO 2 was found to be the main phase for CeOx.

2500|$|A notable exception, {{discovered}} in the early 19th century, {{is the use of}} a gas mantle mounted above the wick on a kerosene lamp. Looking like a delicate woven bag above the woven cotton wick, the mantle is a residue of mineral materials (mostly thorium dioxide), heated to incandescence by the flame from the wick. The thorium and <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> combination produces both a whiter light and a greater fraction of the energy in the form of visible light than a black body at the same temperature would. [...] These types of lamps are still in use today in areas of the world without electricity, because they give a much better light than a simple wick-type lamp does.

2500|$|Typically, a full tumble polish from rough rock {{to polish}} takes between 3–5 weeks, and {{is done in}} a minimum of 3 steps. Initially, the rocks are {{smoothed}} with a coarse grit (such as 60-90 mesh). The idea behind {{the first step is}} to take rough rock or stone and grind it (tumble it) down into a form which is indistinguishable (in shape) from the final product. [...] This is followed by washing and then a stage of finer grits (120-220 then 400-600 mesh), before the (optional) use of a pre-polishing compound (1200 grit), a washing cycle with detergent to remove any grit on the stones. [...] The final step is a polishing stage using powdered polish, (such as <b>cerium</b> <b>oxide</b> or tin oxide), water, and often small plastic pellets that are designed to cushion the stones as they tumble (so as not to cause chipping) and carry the polish evenly across the stones.|$|E

The catalysts were characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, and temperature-programmed hydrogen reduction (H- 2 -TPR) and ammonia desorption (NH 3 -TPD) techniques. The experimental results showed that <b>cerium</b> <b>oxides</b> and manganese oxides affected each other, and their catalystic activities improved both at low and high temperatures.

It was suggested that the mobility of oxygen species enhanced through the sandwiched structure sic-Mn-O-Ce (sic represents the oxygen vacancy), leading to the enhancement of the NOx conversion over Ce-Mn/TiO 2 significantly. Moreover, the Ce and Mn codoping improved the acid concentration with both medium acid sites and strong acid sites.
