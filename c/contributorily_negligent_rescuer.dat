50|$|The {{defendant}} {{moved to}} dismiss the complaint on the ground, among others, that violation of the statutory rule constitutes contributory negligence {{as a matter of}} law. The trial judge left to the jury the question whether failure to observe the statutory rule was a proximate cause of the accident. The trial judge found for P, which the appellate division affirmed. On this appeal, D argues the pedestrians were <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent</b> {{as a matter of law}} for violating the statute.|$|R
50|$|Plaintiff sued both {{defendants}} {{for personal}} injuries. At trial it was established {{that each of}} two pellets had caused the injuries to plaintiff's lip and eye, respectively, and both might have been discharged from a single weapon (defendant) or each defendant may have contributed one of the injuring pellets. The trial court found that the defendants were negligent (i.e., that when they discharged their weapons {{they did not do}} so with ordinary prudence), and that the plaintiff was not <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent.</b> The defendants appealed.|$|R
50|$|In Canada the {{doctrine}} of res ipsa loquitur has been largely overturned by the Supreme Court. In case of Fontaine v. British Columbia (Official Administrator) the Court rejected the use of res ipsa loquitur and instead proposed the rule that once the plaintiff has proven that the harm was under exclusive control of the defendant {{and that they were}} not <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent</b> a tactical burden is placed on the defendant in which the judge has the discretion to infer negligence unless the defendant can produce evidence to the contrary.|$|R
50|$|In {{an opinion}} written by Benjamin N. Cardozo, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the Appellate Division's {{ruling that the}} trial judge's jury {{instruction}} was erroneous. The trial judge had instructed the jury to consider the plaintiff's statutory violation when determining whether the plaintiff was <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent.</b> The Court of Appeals held {{that the question of}} contributory negligence should not have been submitted to the jury. The plaintiff's violation of the statute was not mere evidence of negligence to be considered by the fact-finder; it was negligence as a matter of law.|$|R
25|$|Contributory {{negligence}} is a mitigatory defence, whereby a claimant's damages {{are reduced}} {{in accordance with}} the percentage of contribution made by the claimant to the loss or damage suffered. Thus, in evaluating a collision between two vehicles, for example, if the wronged driver were not wearing a seatbelt, he would most likely be <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent.</b> The court will then quantify the damages for the actual loss or damage sustained, and then reduce the amount paid to the claimant by 20%. Contributory negligence can also function as a full defence, when it is assessed at 100%, as in Jayes v IMI Kynoch.|$|R

Soon after he was employed, Mr Plenty was approached by Leslie Rose, at the time a 13-year-old boy, who asked if he could help the employee on his rounds. This was agreed upon, and Rose engaged in collecting money and delivering milk during Mr Plenty's rounds. He was paid a small wage for this help on several occasions, before he was injured due to the negligent driving of Mr Plenty, suffering a fractured leg. At first instance, Plenty was adjudged 75% <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent,</b> and recovery from the employer was barred altogether, the judge stating that it was not in the scope of Mr Plenty's employment to take on a child as a subordinate.|$|R
40|$|In tort law, the {{doctrine}} of contributory negligence captures conduct by the plaintiff that falls below the standard to which he should conform for his own protection. Whether one has been <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent</b> is determined by an objective standard of reasonableness under the circumstances. This Article, for the first time, applies contributory negligence principles to trade secret law. It draws upon this doctrine to frame and analyze a challenge posed by modem technology. The very technological tools in use today that increase the efficiency with which companies do business also create challenges for trade secret protection. What {{might have been a}} 2 ̆ 2 reasonable 2 ̆ 2 precaution ten years ago to protect a trade secret is not necessarily reasonable today in light of the changed circumstances created by technology. These changes increase the risk of trade secret misappropriation, and trade secret owners must be mindful to have adequate security measures, both technical and process-based, to deal with these enhanced risks...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of which party should {{bear the burden}} of proof on a given factual issue {{remains one of the most}} important and problematic in evidence and procedure. This paper approaches the question from a relatively unstudied perspective, viewing litigation as a device for influencing primary activity behavior rather than as a standalone search for truth. Its main finding is as follows: when a given evidentiary contest concerns the primary activity behavior of one of the parties, placing the burden of proof on the other party maximizes the incentive impact of that contest. Though counterintuitive, the finding accords with a striking regularity in existing law. The adversary of the incentive target typically does {{bear the burden of}} proof with regard to the target 2 ̆ 7 s primary activity behavior. Thus, in tort, the plaintiff bears the burden on the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s negligence, but the defendant typically bears the burden on the defense that the plaintiff was <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent.</b> And in contract the plaintiff bears the burden on the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s nonperformance, while the defendant bears the burden of proof on his defense that the plaintiff failed to perform.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{evidence}} production game in adversarial litigation, wherein litigating parties choose {{how much to}} spend amassing evidence for their side. The payoff structure of this game is such that one party strategically complements (i. e. mimics her opponent 2 ̆ 7 s advances and retreats) while the other strategically substitutes (i. e., does the opposite of her opponent). Which party plays which role depends on how litigation is structured. The question thus arises: should litigation be designed to induce the plaintiff to complement and the defendant to substitute, or vice versa? The paper argues that the answer depends on whether and whose primary activity incentives are being set by the particular evidentiary contest in question. Within each subsidiary evidentiary contest, the 2 ̆ 2 incentive target 2 ̆ 2 should be induced to complement and her adversary to substitute. In some cases the defendant will be the incentive target, as when {{the issue is the}} defendant 2 ̆ 7 s negligence or contractual breach. In other cases, the plaintiff will be the target, as when the defendant defends by claiming that the plaintiff has been 2 ̆ 2 <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent</b> 2 ̆ 2 or has herself failed to meet a prior contractual obligation. These results resonate with current law. (A companion paper A Primary Activity Approach to Proof Burdens applies these results to the problem of allocating the burden of proof.)

5000|$|Martin (P) {{was driving}} his buggy {{on the night}} of August 21, 1915. P was killed in a {{collision}} between his buggy and Herzog's (D) car. It was dark when the accident occurred. P was driving without lights and D did not keep {{to the right of the}} center of the highway. P alleged that D was driving on the wrong side of the road. D claimed that P was <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent</b> for driving without headlights as required under the law. In the body of the charge the trial judge said that the jury could consider the absence of light [...] "in determining whether the plaintiff's intestate was guilty of contributory negligence in failing to have a light upon the buggy as provided by law. I do not mean to say that the absence of light necessarily makes him negligent, but it is a fact for your consideration." [...] D requested a ruling that the absence of a light on the plaintiff's vehicle was [...] "prima facie evidence of contributory negligence." [...] This request was refused, and the jury were again instructed that they might consider the absence of lights as some evidence of negligence, but that it was not conclusive evidence. P then requested a charge that [...] "the fact that the plaintiff's intestate was driving without a light is not negligence in itself," [...] and to this the court acceded. The jury was instructed that they were at liberty to treat the omission of the lights either as innocent or as culpable. The jury gave the verdict to P. The Appellate Division reversed that verdict. P appealed to the Court of Appeals.|$|R
40|$|In England, an {{interesting}} and important Act called "Congenital Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act" came into force on July 22, 1976. Although the Act passed the Parliament as being a provisional step (interim measure) pending more comprehensive legislation, it may, at the present stage, {{be considered as a}} definite criterion whereby the litigious conflicts between the injured child born disabled or with disabilities and the negligent person who has produced an effect on the child en ventre sa mere would be decided. The gists of the provisions in the Act are as follows: (i) A child born alive with a disability caused by someone's fault, either before or {{at the time of its}} birth, or before conception, should be entitled to sue in respect of that disability-Sec. (1) & (2). (Only a child of the first generation is entitled to sue.) In relation to pre-concepetion occurances, the defendant, provided he is not the father, is not liable to the child if either or both of the parents knew of the risk of the child being born disabled as a result of such occurances-Sec. 1 (4). (ii) A child so born can not sue its mother if her conduct was the cause of its disability-Sec. 1 (1), except when that disability was a result of her negligent driving of a motor vehicle whilst pregnant with it-Sec. 2. (There is no such limitation on the child's right to sue its father.) (iii) A defendant is not liable in respect of a disabled birth if the advice or treatment given by him in a professional capacity is in accordance with "then received professional opinion. " The mere fact of a departure from such an opinion does not necessarily involve liability-Sec. 1 (5). (This is a reflection of rules of the Common Law and is included in order to avoid doubt.) (iv) The fact that the mother is volenti, enters into a contract whereby a third party's liability was excluded or limited, or is <b>contributorily</b> <b>negligent,</b> will adversely affect any action by the child when born alive-Sec. 1 (6) & (7). However, a parent's predecease, failure to take action or inability to take action because he or she suffered no actionable injury, will not debar the action of the child-Sec. 1 (3). (v) The compensation provisions of the Section 7 to 11 of the Nuclear Installations Act, 1965, is to be applied, where damage results from a nuclear incident, and a child is born subsequently with disabilities which are attributable to the incident-Sec. 3 (1) -(3). And in such a case, the contributory fault of the plaintiff is regarded as the contributory fault of person under the Section 13 (6) of the aforesaid Act-Sec. 3 (4). (vi) Damages for loss of expectation of life can not be recovered unless the child lives for at least 48 hours-Sec. 4 (4). In these provisions, there are several problematic points of view whereof we have to take notice carefully. For instance, the liability under this Act is said to be called "derivative liability", because "just as in life injuries to the child may be ascribed to an event involving the parent, so in law liability to the child is derived from liability to the parent" (cf. Mr. R. Carter, H. C. vol. 904, col. 1592). As regards such a kind of civil liability, here remains a certain kind of ambiguity or obscurity, as is expressly mentioned by the Law Commission that there were "technical" difficulties in stating a general rule (Law Com. Report, Para. 45 - 52 & 75). And for instance, it is said that Section 1 (6) of the said Act created a new exception to the doctrine of "privity of contract" (cf. M. D. A. Freeman's annotations of this Act). And again for instance, it is said that the said Act effects, regardless of the attitude of common law, or contrary to the way of thinking of common law, a revival of that notorious doctrine of "Identification" (cf. P. J. Pace, M. L. R. vol. 40, No. 2, p. 157). To his regret, the present writer could hardly realize these difficult points completely. Still more, there stand a good many Common Law rules or doctrines all of which are hard nuts to crack for him, -for example, a well-known legal maxim of "Actio personalis moritur cum persona [A personal action dies with the person]," or "Damnum sine injuria esse potest [There may be damage or loss inflicted without any act being done which the law deems an injury]," or "Volenti non fit injuria [That to which a man consents cannot be considered an injury]," etc. And more, "neighbour principle" in the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson as to the duty of care in the law of torts, or "sine qua non [without which nothing] rule" as to the proving a causal nexus between the defendant's wrongful act and the plaintiff's defective condition on birth, or "last opportunity doctrine" as to the contributory negligence, and so on. All these profound rules, doctrines, or principles above, are, in the writer's view, too complicated to understand, and still ought to be searched and studied in order to deeply comprehend this Act in the context of Common Law tradition. At any rate, it would be the fact that this Parliamentary Act considering the protection and/or remedy (albeit they means only "compensation") of children who are injured owing to "some person's fault" as in the Thalidmide or Minamat types of cases, established the progressive or one-step advanced principle, by which the conventional rules of Common Law would get to be shaken or shocked. Thus, these traditional rules are sure to be re-examined in compliance with the "Zeitgeist" of this age. Now, the present author brings to his mind the seemingly well-worn proverbs, "Hard cases make bad law," as well as "Hard cases make good law. " Didn't we Japanese, feel those tragic cases of Thalidmide and Minamat litigations as "hard cases"? And shall we think of this Act in England, as "a bad law" or "a good law"? If it be bad or good, the author considers, we Japanese, especially members of Legislature, seriously have to watch the application and effect of this noteworthy Act, with eyes wide-open and with keen interest...|$|R
