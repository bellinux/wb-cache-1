5|$|Unable {{to leave}} the premises, Nick starts using heroin again but cannot feed his drug {{addiction}} and asks Dot to obtain drugs for him. Dot purchases the heroin but Fatboy catches her and urges her to cut ties with Nick. Dot urges Nick to confess to the police, but when he tells her he does not feel remorse for Ronnie's injuries, she gives him the drugs and storms out. Dot later finds Nick unconscious, having had a bad reaction to the drugs. When it is clear Nick is dying, Nick confesses various past misdemeanours, including the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton). Nick seeks his mother's forgiveness and she cradles him as he dies, ultimately deciding not to <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance</b> to attempt to save his life. Dot, seeking punishment for this, decides to confess {{to the police and}} is arrested and imprisoned. Dot initially decides to plead guilty, believing she should atone for her sins in prison, but when Jim dies, she attends his funeral and realises how much her family needs her. She changes her plea and is cleared of murder at the court hearing; however, she is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to prison for 14 months.|$|E

40|$|Background: Demand for pre-hospital {{emergency}} care is increasing in Australia {{as in many}} other countries. Using posthoc criteria such as triage, diagnosis and admission status, some authors view a considerable number of these as "inappropriate". Yet, <b>calling</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance</b> at the time of emergency is rarely studied from the patients’ or their carers’ perspective. This study interviewed patients about the decision, circumstances surrounding and reasons for <b>calling</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance</b> in Queensland, Australia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of patients attending a sample of eight public hospital emergency departments in Queensland was undertaken between March and May 2011. In total, 911 questionnaires were collected (response rate: 67...|$|R

Jude leaves just as the ambulance arrives, with a new plan in mind. Sephy makes Minerva lie about her injuries.|$|E
500|$|For {{several days}} after 1 November, Litvinenko {{experienced}} severe diarrhea and vomiting. At one point, he could not walk without assistance. As the pain intensified, Litvinenko asked his wife to <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance</b> for assistance. For several weeks, Litvinenko's condition worsened as doctors searched {{for the cause of}} the illness. Surrounded by friends, Litvinenko became physically weak, and spent periods unconscious. A photograph was taken of Litvinenko on his deathbed and released to the public. [...] "I want the world to see what they did to me," [...] Litvinenko said.|$|E
500|$|On {{the ninth}} {{birthday}} of the severely ill Tamsin, parents Graham and Jan struggle with a camcorder and blow up balloons. A charity called WishmakerUK has arranged for pop star Frankie J Parsons to visit Tamsin. Frankie arrives, {{much to the}} excitement of Jan, accompanied by his personal assistant Si and WishmakerUK representative Sally. Frankie visits Tamsin in her bedroom, and blows up a purple balloon for her. He begins to struggle for breath and then collapses from an intracranial aneurysm. Later, Graham makes tea for Jan and Sally. Jan is upset about Frankie's death. Si says {{that no one can}} touch anything or <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance</b> until Frankie's manager arrives. Tamsin, sitting in her wheelchair, holds the balloon; and Graham and Si realise that it may be valuable. Si takes the balloon from Tamsin, and Graham ties it. Sally takes a call from her boss, but does not mention Frankie's death. She makes excuses to have a colleague cover for her on her next assignment so that she can stay at the house. Graham and Si argue over the balloon, and Graham gives it to Sally, as he considers her [...] "a neutral". He looks online to work out how much the balloon and accompanying footage may be worth.|$|E

500|$|Scully goes to warn Fellig that he {{is about}} to be charged for murder, and accuses him of {{profiting}} from people's deaths. In his darkroom, Fellig shows Scully a photo of a dead woman with an odd fuzzy shape around her head, which the photographer claims is Death. When asked why he bothers to try to photograph Death, Fellig says that it is so he can look Death in the face and finally die. He claims to be 149 years old, and says he cannot kill himself. Scully points out that most people would like to live forever, but Fellig says that he has experienced everything, and that even love does not last forever. Suddenly, he notices that Scully is gray, and says, [...] "Count your blessings." [...] When she asks about the science of his immortality, he says he was meant to die of yellow fever, but he refused to look Death in the face, so instead Death took the kind nurse who had taken care of him. [...] Fellig takes a photo just as Ritter enters and shoots. The bullet passes right through the camera and through Fellig into Scully, who collapses. While Ritter rushes to <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance,</b> Fellig asks Scully whether she saw Death and begs her to close her eyes. He covers her hand with his own. The color returns to Scully's hand as Fellig's turns gray. Looking up, he dies.|$|E

2500|$|Twelve {{years after}} Murray's induced birth, his mother miscarried and, after the doctor failed to <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance,</b> died. Literary critic Lawrence Bourke writes that [...] "Murray, linking his {{birth to her}} death, traces his poetic {{vocation}} from these traumatic events, seeing in them the relegation of the rural poor by urban élites. Dispossession, relegation, and independence become major preoccupations of his poetry". Beyond this, though, his poetry is generally seen to have a nationalistic bent. The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature writes that: The continuing themes of much of his poetry are those inherent in that traditional nationalistic identity – respect, even reverence, for the pioneers; {{the importance of the}} land and its shaping influence on the Australian character, down-to-earth, ... and based on such Bush-bred qualities as egalitarianism, practicality, straight-forwardness and independence; special respect for that Australian character in action in wartime ... and a brook-no-argument preference for the rural life over the sterile and corrupting urban environment. Of his literary journalism, Bourke writes that [...] "In a lively, frequently polemic prose style he promotes republicanism, patronage, Gaelic bardic poetry, warrior virtu, mysticism, and Aboriginal models, and attacks modernism and feminism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Refusing {{to listen}} to John's warnings, Amanda shoots Lynn in the back just as Jeff arrives. He retaliates by {{shooting}} Amanda in the neck with a gun provided by John during his tests. As Amanda slowly dies, John reveals that Lynn's test was actually hers: aware of her modus operandi, and unwilling to allow a murderer to inherit his legacy, he decided to test [...] "her will to keep someone alive"; to this end, he told her nothing about Jeff and Lynn, including their marriage. John then addresses Jeff, offering to <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance</b> for Lynn if he accepts one final test: he can choose to kill John or forgive him. Jeff tells John he forgives him, but then slashes his throat with a power saw. The door to the sickroom seals itself as a dying John plays a final tape, which tells Jeff that he has failed his test by killing John, {{the only person who}} knows the whereabouts of his daughter; to save her, Jeff must play another game. The tape ends as John dies, and the collar promptly detonates and kills Lynn, leaving a screaming Jeff trapped in the sickroom with the three corpses.|$|E
2500|$|Maddux {{has been}} {{credited}} {{by many of}} his teammates with a superior ability to outthink his opponents and anticipate results. Braves catcher Eddie Pérez {{tells the story of}} Maddux intentionally allowing a home run to the Astros's Jeff Bagwell, in anticipation of facing Bagwell in the playoffs months later. Maddux felt Bagwell would instinctively be looking for the same pitch again, which Maddux would then refuse to throw. On another occasion while sitting on the bench, Maddux once told his teammates, [...] "Watch this, we might need to <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance</b> for the first base coach." [...] The batter, Los Angeles' José Hernández, drove the next pitch into the chest of the Dodgers' first base coach. Maddux had noticed that Hernández, who'd been pitched inside by Braves pitching during the series, had shifted his batting stance slightly. On another occasion, a former teammate, outfielder Marquis Grissom, recalled a game in 1996 when Maddux was having trouble spotting his fastball. Between innings, he told Grissom, [...] "Gary Sheffield is coming up next inning. I am going to throw him a slider and make him just miss it so he hits it to the warning track." [...] The at-bat went as Maddux had predicted.|$|E

2500|$|Following the melee, the sitdowners and {{supporters}} (who promptly {{arrived on the}} scene) marched back to the East End, smashing {{the windows of the}} Woodward's and Spencer's department stores and other targets en route, causing $35,000 damage. As in 1935, the Ukrainian Labour Temple served as a makeshift hospital for protesters with the assistance of volunteer doctors and medical supplies that had been collected as an aid package destined for China. Steve Brodie was targeted for particularly brutal treatment by the police and was left with a permanent eye injury. Another man, former militia sergeant Arthur Redseth, slipped on the post office floor during the fracas. [...] "Little Mike", a fellow Serb, managed to drag Redseth out of the building to safety through the flailing police clubs but only after Redseth's eye was knocked out of its socket under the gauntlet of police clubs. Redseth was later rejected for military service in the Second World War because of his injury, after which he became despondent and committed suicide in 1942. Little Mike had only required five stitches to his jaw from an injury he received after asking a police officer to <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance</b> for his friend. He died the same year as Redseth at Dieppe.|$|E
2500|$|Eddie and Jake {{give their}} {{statements}} at police headquarters. Jake learns that Eddie {{wanted to be}} a policeman like his father. But he lost an eye in a training accident, and having a glass eye means he cannot now join the force. The two go to Eddie's place and start having sex. [...] Jake handcuffs Eddie to his bed and goes in search of condoms. As he's returning, the killer stabs him and leaves him for dead. Eddie hears the struggle and calls out. As the killer approaches and Eddie struggles with the cuffs, Jake hits the killer from behind with a baseball bat. Eddie slips a hand out of the cuffs, tends to Jake's wound and heads off to <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance,</b> but the killer wakes and disables the phone. Eddie runs to the kitchen. He finds a knife but also finds the heads of Joey, Chaz, and Tobey in a closet. Eddie evades the killer and retreats to his bedroom, locking Jake and himself in. As the killer chops at the door, Eddie retrieves his father's gun and some bullets. Eddie pushes Jake out onto the fire escape and loads the gun. The killer breaks down the door and attacks Eddie again, knocking him out the window and over the fire escape railing. As Eddie dangles from the fire escape, the killer turns toward Jake. Eddie fires the gun, grazing Jake (as Eddie lacks the stereoscopic vision and depth perception to aim well). Eddie fires again, hitting the killer in the forehead.|$|E

[...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and <b>call</b> <b>an</b> <b>ambulance.</b> I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E
