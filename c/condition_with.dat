40|$|Metastatic variant sublines of the murine large-cell {{lymphoma}} {{cell line}} RAW 117 were tested for their growth and migration properties in vitro in medium conditioned by soluble factors released from syngeneic mouse liver-, lung-, and brain-derived microvessel endothelial cells. Medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells stimulated {{the growth of}} highly liver-colonising (RAW 117 -H 10) and highly liver- and lung-colonising (RAW 117 -L 17) sublines at higher rates than the poorly metastatic parental line (RAW 117 -P) (H 10 greater than L 17 greater than P). Medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> lung microvessel endothelial cells selectively stimulated {{the growth of the}} lung-colonising RAW 117 -L 17 subline. Medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> brain microvessel endothelial cells showed no growth selectivity, and equivalently stimulated the growth of various RAW 117 cell sublines. Medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells preferentially promoted the migration of the liver-colonising H 10 and L 17 sublines, and medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> lung endothelial cells differentially stimulated the migration of the lung-colonising L 17 subline; whereas medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> brain endothelial cells only slightly stimulated the migration of L 17, but not H 10 or P cells. Fractionation of medium <b>conditioned</b> <b>with</b> hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells by DEAE Sephacel anion exchange chromatography revealed that the growth-stimulating activities were clearly separable from migration-stimulating activities. The growth- and migration-stimulating activities released from organ microvessel endothelial cells may be important in determining the ability of RAW 117 cells to selectively form metastatic colonies in particular organs...|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic <b>condition</b> <b>with</b> periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Von Willebrand's {{disease is}} a {{hereditary}} bleeding disorder found in both dogs and humans. It {{is caused by a}} lack of von Willebrand factor which plays a role in the clotting process of blood. This can cause abnormal platelet function and prolonged bleeding times. Affected dogs can be prone to nose bleeds, and increased bleeding following trauma or surgery. There are three types of this <b>condition</b> <b>with</b> Type I being the most common, while Type II and III being rarer, but more severe. Type I von Willebrand's disease is relatively common in the Scottish Terrier.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her <b>condition</b> <b>with</b> the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E

5|$|On 22 May, the fleet—now {{reduced to}} only two ships—rounded the Cape of Good Hope. They arrived in Beseguiche (now Dakar, located near Cape Verde) on 2 June.

Another Portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in Beseguiche. After Manuel I had been told of the discovery of what is now Brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it. One of its navigators was Amerigo Vespucci (for whom the Americas would be named), who told Cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, the VPAF Command {{was ordered}} to prepare for an {{operation}} in South Vietnam, so a group of pilots from the 4th Squadron of the VPAF 923rd Fighter Regiment was selected to undertake conversion training in Da Nang and form a new squadron for the operation. The selected group was led by Upper Captain Nguyen Van Luc along with Tu De, Tran Cao Thang, Han Van Quang and Hoang Mai Vuong. Together with former Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots Trung and On, the group would form the Quyet Thang ("Determined to Win") Squadron.

5|$|Severely damaged, Tripoli {{struck her}} colors to {{indicate}} surrender. As Enterprise moved towards the vessel to accept its surrender, the Tripolitans hoisted their flag and fired upon Enterprise. The Tripolitans again attempted {{to board the}} American schooner, but were repelled by Enterprise broadsides and musketry. After another exchange of fire, the Tripolitans struck their colors a second time. Sterett once more ceased firing and moved closer to Tripoli. In response, Rous again raised his colors and attempted to board Enterprise. Enterprise accurate gunnery once more forced Tripoli to veer off. As the action continued, Rous perfidiously feigned a third surrender {{in an attempt to}} draw the American schooner within grappling range. This time, Sterett kept his distance, and ordered Enterprise guns to be lowered to aim at the polacca's waterline, a tactic that threatened to sink the enemy ship. The next American broadsides struck their target, causing massive damage, dismasting her mizzen-mast, and reducing her to a sinking <b>condition.</b> <b>With</b> most of his crew dead or wounded, the injured Admiral Rous finally threw the Tripolitan flag into the sea to convince Sterett to end the action.|$|E

5|$|When {{emergency}} services arrived, they were initially {{unable to provide}} assistance as the high temperatures of the molten steel prevented them from entering the area {{and they had to}} wait for the steel to cool.

According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable <b>condition,</b> <b>with</b> the others listed as critical. They were said to be of risk of contracting infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published conflicting information, saying that the thirty-two deceased represented everyone in the room at the time, and that only two people were injured - the operators of the ladle. The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the ladle fell on workers below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fair}} closed, the {{question}} remained {{what to do}} with the some 4,600,000 half dollars which had not been sold. Organizers did not wish them to be issued, to preserve the premium price paid by purchasers. Those remaining in the Company's hands were redeemed by the Mint, which melted them; the fee for this service was forgiven by act of Congress. The coins which had been impounded by the Treasury were offered for sale at face value beginning in October 1894; when there were few takers, they were released into circulation. A million coins held by the Chicago banks were also placed in circulation. Although 2,501,700 half dollars were melted (all dated 1893), this still left a like number of Columbians in public hands. Coin dealer and numismatic historian Q. David Bowers recalls that when he began collecting coins as a boy in the 1950s, the Columbians were among the most common 19th-century pieces remaining in circulation. It was not until the 1930s that the pieces, in uncirculated condition, commanded the original price of $1. Prices began to rise as silver coins were replaced by base metal ones in the 1960s. In the 2012 version of Yeoman's catalog, both pieces are listed at under $20 in almost uncirculated (AU-50) <b>condition,</b> <b>with</b> specimens in near-pristine MS-66 selling for over a thousand dollars.|$|E
5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this <b>condition,</b> <b>with</b> the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging teenage pregnancy and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E
