This paper examines the linkages in futures price, return and volatility of a <b>commodity</b> across <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{with the help of}} three models – (a) Price – Co-integration methodology and Error Correction Mechanism Model (b) Return and Volatility – Modified GARCH model (c) Return and Volatility – ARMA-GARCH in mean model (Innovations Model). The study indicates that there are strong linkages in price, return and volatility of futures contracts traded across <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges</b> of India and their corresponding international <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Given the level of linkages, the study argues against the imposition of Commodity Transaction Tax (CTT) on sellers at the time of trading in agri-processed and energy commodities. The tax would lead to lower trading volumes thereby defeating the purpose of price discovery via <b>commodity</b> <b>exchanges...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1864, in the United States, wheat, corn, cattle, {{and pigs}} were widely traded using {{standard}} instruments on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the world's oldest futures and options exchange. Other food commodities {{were added to}} the <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange</b> Act and traded through CBOT in the 1930s and 1940s, expanding the list from grains to include rice, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Irish potatoes and soybeans. Successful commodity markets require broad consensus on product variations to make each commodity acceptable for trading, such as the purity of gold in bullion. Classical civilizations built complex global markets trading gold or silver for spices, cloth, wood and weapons, most of which had standards of quality and timeliness.|$|E

25|$|Cultural {{globalization}} {{refers to}} the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values {{around the world in}} such a way as to extend and intensify social relations. This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, popular culture media, and international travel. This has added to processes of <b>commodity</b> <b>exchange</b> and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.|$|E

25|$|As a {{young man}} the Utrecht-born artist Hendrick de Keyser was apprenticed to master Cornelis Bloemaert the elder. At the age of 26 he {{followed}} Bloemaert to Amsterdam. Soon he set to work as an independent artist. When his talent became generally appreciated he was appointed city stonemason and sculptor. In fact his duties included all of the tasks now associated with the job of city architect. De Keyser is famous {{for a number of}} important buildings which belong to the core of Dutch historic sites. Today the Zuiderkerk (1603-1611) and accompanying tower (1614), the Delft Town Hall (1618-1620), the Westerkerk (1620-1631) and Westertoren (built in 1638 but in a modified version) are among the historic buildings which provide important insights into De Keyser’s work. His <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange</b> of 1608-1613 was pulled down in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Capitalism, {{which would}} become the {{dominant}} philosophy for Canadian economic development, evolved from the economic activity of the colonial business elite. One {{of the most important}} manifestations of this ideology was the creation of an indigenous financial system. One of Canada's first banks, the Canada Banking Company was founded in Montreal in 1792. This was followed by others including the Bank of Montreal, in 1817, the Bank of New Brunswick in 1820 and the Bank of Upper Canada in 1821. By 1886, 38 banks had been chartered. The pace of this financial activity was marked by the newly formed Government of Canada with the passing of the Bank Act in 1871. Insurance companies, including, Sun Life, 1865, Mutual Life, 1870, Confederation Life, 1871 and London Life, 1874, were also founded during these years. Markets for the exchange of investments came to Canada as well, with the establishment of the Montreal Stock Exchange in 1832, the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1861 and the Winnipeg <b>Commodity</b> <b>Exchange</b> in 1904. The repeal of the Corn Laws by the Parliament of Britain in 1846, terminated colonial trading preferences and marked the symbolic end of mercantilism in Canada while ushering in the new era of capitalism.|$|E
