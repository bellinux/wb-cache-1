50|$|The {{first use}} of {{continuous}} <b>caudal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> in a laboring woman was on January 6, 1942, when {{the wife of a}} United States Coast Guard sailor was brought into the Marine Hospital for an emergency Caesarean section. Because the woman suffered from rheumatic heart disease (heart failure following an episode of rheumatic fever during childhood), her doctors believed that she would not survive the stress of labor but they also felt that she would not tolerate general anesthesia due to her heart failure.

Hingson and Edwards studied the caudal region to determine where a needle could be placed to deliver anesthetic agents safely to the spinal nerves without injecting them into the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesCaudal {{epidural}} anesthesia is {{the most}} popular regional anesthesia technique used in children. With advanced age, only the relative difficulty in localizing the sacral hiatus limits its use. However, in adults this technique has been widely used to control chronic pain by adjuvant use of fluoroscopy. Thus, the ability to locate the hiatus and define anatomical variations is the main determinant of the success and safety of <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia.</b> In this context, the use of the ultrasound in <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia</b> has been increasing. The objective of this review was to determine the role of the ultrasound in <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia</b> and to demonstrate that this technique, widely used in children, is also useful and can be used in adults. ContentA review of the literature on sacral anatomy and the anesthetic technique necessary to perform <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia</b> was undertaken. Recent studies in ultrasound-guided <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia</b> both in children and adults were also included. ConclusionsDespite its limitations, the ultrasound can be a useful tool to position the needle in the caudal space. It allows prompt identification of the sacral anatomy and real-time visualization of the injection. Considering it is portable, non-invasive, and free of radiation exposure, it is an attractive technique in the operating room especially in difficult cases. However, since its use in neuroaxis anesthesia is very primitive, more studies are necessary to make it a routine technique in anesthetic practice...|$|R

5000|$|In 1943, Perrotta and Dr. H. Koster {{published}} the clinical study [...] "Elective Painless Rapid Childbirth Anticipating Labour ( [...] by procaine spinal anesthesia)". The study demonstrated that neuraxial anesthesia could be safely used {{to alleviate the}} pain of childbirth [...] In 1943, spinal anesthesia was not the standard of care and was widely considered dangerous for pregnant women. Present day obstetrics shows that the opposite is true, and <b>caudal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> is presently {{the most common and}} safest modality for anesthesia in pregnant women. Early recognition of the technique was met with resistance. While spinal anesthesia would go on to be indispensable in the world of obstetrics, manual cervical dilation would fall out of favor in the years since the study. Perrotta and Koster originally employed the combined procedures to facilitate delivery in cases of cervical dystocia, while also eliminating pain from the event. The study showed that a healthy full term fetus could be delivered comfortably, before labor, in less than 40 minutes. Spinal anesthesia is now implemented routinely in labor and cesarean section as it provides a rapid onset of sensory motor block and excellent pain control. The techniques of spinal and epidural anesthesia became common practice as they were shown to be safer for the mother and newborn than sedatives and opioids.|$|E

40|$|Context: Sacral hiatus is {{used for}} {{administration}} of caudal epidural block. A frequent problem in this is needle placement as {{it is difficult to}} determine the location of sacral hiatus. The knowledge of anatomy of sacral hiatus plays a major role in the success of needle placement. Aim: To study the anatomy of sacral hiatus from point of view of <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia.</b> Materials and Methods: The sacral hiatus of 300 sacra was studied. Parameters of sacral hiatus such as shape, level of apex and base, length, anteroposterior (AP) diameter at apex, and intercornual distance along with distance between superolateral sacral crests and their distance from apex of sacral hiatus were studied. Results: Inverted "U" shape (46. 33 %) was most commonly encountered. Apex and base of the hiatus were most commonly seen at the level of S 4 and S 5 respectively. Length of sacral hiatus ranged between 8. 8 mm and 45. 7 mm. AP diameter at apex of sacra and intercornual distance were seen most commonly in the range 4 – 6 mm and 11 – 15 mm respectively. Conclusion: The study of these sacra indicated the type of variations in shape and size of sacral hiatus in population of state of Maharashtra in India. While absent sacral hiatus leads to poor outcome of the <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia,</b> dorsal agenesis of the sacrum would lead to only partial anesthesia.

Methods: Seventy-two geriatric patients scheduled for elective total hip replacement under ultrasound guided <b>caudal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> were randomized blindly into two groups: Group BD received caudal isobaric bupivacaine 0. 25 % (20  ml) and dexamethasone 8  mg (2  ml) and Group BS received caudal isobaric bupivacaine 0. 25 % (20  ml) and normal saline (2  ml). Postoperative analgesia was assessed by recording time to first rescue analgesia and the analgesic doses (paracetamol and meperidine hydrochloride) required during the first 24  h postoperatively as a primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were the time taken to the onset of sensory analgesia at T 10, time to the onset of complete motor block, VAS pain score at rest and on movement at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24  h, and postoperative adverse events.

40|$|Background: The {{reliability}} {{and success of}} <b>caudal</b> epidural <b>anesthesia</b> depends on anatomic variations of sacral hiatus (SH) as observed by various authors. SH is an important landmark during caudal epidural block (CEB). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to clarify the morphometric characteristics of the SH in human Egyptian dry sacra and pelvic radiographs and identification of nearest ony landmarks to permit correct and uncomplicated caudal epidural accesses. Methods: The present study was done on 46 human adult Egyptian dry sacra. The maximum height, midventral curved length, and maximum breadth of each sacrum were measured and sacral and curvature indices were calculated. According to sacral indices, sacra were divided into 2 groups (22 male and 24 female sacra). SH was evaluated in each sacrum according to its shape, level of its apex, and base according to sacral and coccygeal vertebrae, length, anteroposterior (AP) diameter at its apex, and transverse width at its base. Linear distances were measured between the apex of SH and second sacral foramina, right and left superolateral sacral crests. The distance between the 2 superolateral sacral crests also was measured. Results: The most common types of SH were the inverted U and inverted V (in male) and inverted V and dumbbell shaped (in female). Absent SH was observed in male group only. The most common location of SH apex was at the level of S 4 in all groups of dry sacra and S 3 in all groups of lumbosacral spine radiographs, whereas S 5 was the common level of its base. The mean SH length, transverse width of its base, and AP diameter of its apex were 2. 1 ± 0. 80, 1. 7 ± 0. 26, and 0. 48 ± 0. 19 cm. Female sacra showed narrower SH apex than male.

Bupivacaine (Marcaine®), {{homologue}} of mepivacaine, chemically {{related to}} lidocaine, {{is used as}} a local anesthetic for local infiltration, peripheral nerve block, retrobulbar block, symphathetic block, and <b>caudal</b> and epidural <b>anesthesia.</b> The aim of this investigation was to determine and to compare clinical parameters of the local anesthetic effects of bupivacaine applied with and without a vasoconstrictor. Methods. This investigation included a total of 30 randomly selected patients, who ranged in age from 30 − 60 years, with partial or total anodontia in the molar region of the mandible. These patients with total or partial edentulous molar part of the mandible, scheduled for dental implantation placement, were asked to participate in the study. In {{the first phase of the}} investigation, the patients were subjected to local anesthesia with 3. 5 cm 3 of 0. 5 % bupivacaine with a vasoconstrictor (adrenalin, 1 : 200 000) in the right side of the mandible. After administering local anesthesia, the placement of blade, cylindrical, transdental (B. C. T.) implants was performed. In the second stage of the investigation, in 7 − 10 days period after the first oral surgery, the patients were subjected to local anesthesia with 3. 5 cm 3 of 0. 5 % bupivacaine, but without a vasoconstrictor, in the left side of the mandible. After administering local anesthesia, the placement of B. C. T. implants was performed. During the performance of both oral surgery procedures, the following clinical parameters of the local anesthetic effects were monitored: latent period, duration and the potency of anesthesia, and the evaluation of the postoperative pain level. Results. The latent period under local anesthesia with 3. 5 cm 3 of 0. 5 % bupivacaine and vasoconstrictor was statistically significantly shorter than without vasoconstrictor. The duration of local anesthesia was longer without vasoconstrictor. There was no difference in the potency of anesthesia with or without a vasoconstrictor, while the lowest level of postoperative pain was found after administering bupivacaine without a vasoconstrictor use. Conclusion. The results of this investigation show that bupivacaine without a vasoconstrictor is efficient when used for local anesthesia in placing dental implants since it provides better blood circulation required for good dental implant osseointegration. ...|$|R

Methods: Forty boys in Ali-Ebne-Abitaleb Hospital of Zahedan undergoing hyspospadias repair were randomly allocated in two groups to receive bupivacaine 1. 5 mg/kg from sacral route in one group and from sacral hiatus route in the control group. Postoperative pain and sedation scores were assessed for 12 hr after operation. Results: The time of first requiring of additional analgesia {{did not differ significantly}} between two groups (365 ± 40 min in sacral group vs 390 ± 35 min in trans-sacral-hiatus group) (P value= 0. 17). Side effects were not seen in any patients. Two groups were comparable with regards pain scores and sedation scores at 1 and 7 h (P> 0. 05). Conclusions: We concluded that the trans-sacral route is an acceptable, safe and easy method for performing caudal block, but total duration of analgesia did not differ with these two methods...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background Orthopaedic surgeons frequently encounter patients with ankylosing spondylitis who {{would benefit from}} various types of lower limb operations; however, some of these patients present challenges for anesthesiologists. Case Description We report {{the case of a}} 65 -year-old patient with a fractured femoral component 30 years after a cemented THA. The patient had severe tracheal stenosis and ankylosing spondylitis making general endotracheal and conventional neuraxial anesthesia nearly impossible. Literature Review Possible alternative anesthetic approaches described in the literature include awake fiberoptic bronchoscopic guided intubation, laryngeal mask airway, and <b>caudal</b> <b>anesthesia.</b> Purposes and Clinical Relevance We achieved successful anesthesia using spinal laminotomy with the patient under local anesthesia followed by insertion of a spinal catheter and injection of an anesthetic agent. The loosened component was revised to a cementless THA.

Patients and methodsThis randomized double-blind controlled trial was done in department of anesthesia, Cairo University hospitals, and 40 patients with ASA physical status classification I–II, aged 2 – 7 years were enrolled in this study and randomly assigned into 2 groups; group L received caudal levobupivacaine 1 ml/kg with concentration of 0. 25 % and group LN received caudal 0. 125 % levobupivacaine with volume of 1 ml/kg plus 0. 2 mg/kg nalbuphine. Pain was evaluated immediately after emergence (FLACC 0 h), after 1 h in the PACU, after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 h by the FLACC pain score (Face, Leg, Activity, Crying, Consolability). First time of rescue analgesic, total dose of rescue analgesic and side effects were observed for 12 h. ResultsFLACC pain scores were much less in LN group compared to L group (p value 0. 001). The total dose of postoperative supplementary analgesia (intravenous paracetamol infusion) in the first 12 h was significantly lower in LN group (200. 5 ± 65. 5 mg) in comparison with L group (355. 25 ± 69. 9 mg) (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsCombining <b>caudal</b> <b>anesthesia</b> using levobupivacaine and nalbuphine provided prolonged time of analgesia with no reported side effects...|$|E
