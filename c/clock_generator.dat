40|$|Abstract—A {{possible}} idea {{is presented}} here for deal-ing with clock skew problems on synchronous digital sys-tems. Nakao et al. recently reported that independent neu-ral oscillators can be synchronized by applying temporal random impulses to the oscillators [1]. We regard neural oscillators as independent clock sources on LSIs; i. e., clock sources are distributed on LSIs, {{and they are}} forced to syn-chronize through the use of random noises. We designed neuron-based <b>clock</b> <b>generators</b> operating at sub-RF region (< 1 GHz) by modifying the original neuron model to a new model that is suitable for CMOS implementation with 0. 25 -µm CMOS parameters. Through circuit simulations, we demonstrate that the <b>clock</b> <b>generators</b> are certainly syn-chronized by pseudo-random noises. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Substrate {{noise is}} {{the major source of}} {{performance}} limitation in mixed-signal integrated circuits. This paper studies substrate noise effects on the performance of delay-locked loops (DLLs). Due to their robust noise performance, the delay-locked-loops are widely used as <b>clock</b> <b>generators</b> of microprocessors. Although exploiting advanced circuit techniques reduces the tim-ing jitter induced by the substrate noise to a large extent, the hos-tile noisy digital section in a mixed-signal VLSI circuit can still cause a large substrate noise and hence a non-negligible timing jitter in DLL <b>clock</b> <b>generators.</b> In this paper a new stochastic model for the substrate noise is proposed. This model is then uti-lized to derive the phase noise of the voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL) inside the loop. The DLL timing jitter is predicted in response to the VCDL phase noise. A comparison between the results obtained by our mathematical model and those obtained using HSPICE verifies our proposed model. 1...|$|R
