2500|$|Missiles {{typically}} {{do not have}} a preferred plane or direction of maneuver and thus have symmetric airfoils. [...] Since the center of pressure for symmetric airfoils is relatively constant for small angle of attack, missile engineers typically speak of the complete center of pressure of the entire vehicle for stability and <b>control</b> <b>analysis.</b> [...] In missile analysis, the center of pressure is typically defined as the center of the additional pressure field due to a change in the angle of attack off of the trim angle of attack.|$|E
2500|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States {{spent more}} {{on health care}} per capita ($7,146), and more on health care as {{percentage}} of its GDP (15.2%), than any other nation in 2008. In 2010, 49.9 million residents or 16.3% of the population reported not carrying health insurance to the U.S. Census. Of that number 18.3 million had annual household incomes at or greater than $50,000, 9.5 million had household incomes of $75,000 or higher, 16.2 million had household incomes of less than $25,000, 27.2 million were under age 35, and 9.7 million were non-citizens. The Census has stated that its surveys likely underreport insurance coverage. For example, a quality <b>control</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed that 16.9% of those enrolled in Medicaid incorrectly reported being uninsured. [...] Analyses have also shown that millions of uninsured are eligible for coverage through programs like Medicaid but have not signed up or have let their enrollments expire. According to Physicians for a National Health Program, this lack of insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths per year. The group's methodology has been criticized by John C. Goodman for not looking at cause of death or tracking insurance status changes over time, including the time of death. A 2009 study by former Clinton policy adviser Richard Kronick found no increased mortality from being uninsured after certain risk factors were controlled for.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} novel <b>control</b> flow <b>analysis</b> for higher-order {{functional}} programs, {{based on a}} reduction to higher-order model check-ing. The distinguished features of our <b>control</b> flow <b>analysis</b> are that, un-like most of the control flow analyses like k-CFA, it is exact for simply-typed λ-calculus with recursion and finite base types, and that, unlike Mossin’s exact flow analysis, it is indeed runnable in practice, at least for small programs. Furthermore, under certain (arguably strong) assump-tions, our <b>control</b> flow <b>analysis</b> runs in time cubic {{in the size of}} a program. We formalize the reduction of <b>control</b> flow <b>analysis</b> to higher-order model checking, prove the correctness, and report preliminary experiments. ...|$|R

40|$|Coupling {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) with a <b>controls</b> <b>analysis</b> tool elegantly allows for high accuracy predictions {{of the interaction between}} sloshing liquid propellants and th e control system of a launch vehicle. Instead of relying on mechanical analogs which are not valid during aU stages of flight, this method allows for a direct link between the vehicle dynamic environments calculated by the solver in the <b>controls</b> <b>analysis</b> tool to the fluid flow equations solved by the CFD code. This paper describes such a coupling methodology, presents the results of a series of test cases, and compares said results against equivalent results from extensively validated tools.

By the mid-1980s the central ideas of metabolic <b>control</b> <b>analysis</b> laid out in this paper were becoming far more widely accepted. Further experimental methods based on the theories laid out in the paper were used to help in the understanding of metabolic regulation and molecular evolution, and to show how metabolic <b>control</b> <b>analysis</b> could be applied to problems in medicine and biotechnology. Another paper published in 1984 showed how the idea of evolution by natural selection could be applied in a constructive way to provide models for the evolution of enzyme catalysis.|$|E
