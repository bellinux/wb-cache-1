40|$|In recent papers, {{the problem}} of {{estimating}} optical <b>constants</b> (<b>thickness,</b> refractive index and absorption coecient) of thin lms using only transmission data has been addressed by means of optimization techniques. Models were proposed for solving this problem using linearly constrained optimization and unconstrained optimization. However, the optical parameters of thin" lms could not be recovered with methods that are successful in other situations. Here we introduce an optimization technique {{that seems to be}} ecient for recovering the parameters of very thin lms.

25|$|Just {{like the}} {{cornified}} layer of epidermis and of any mammalian nail, the hoof capsule is created only from epidermis, the outer living {{layer of the}} skin. From a microscopic point of view, epidermis is a multi-layered, specialised cornifying epithelium. It overlays the dermis, and it is separated from it by a basal lamina. It has no blood vessels and living cells acquire their oxygen and nutrients by fluid exchanges and molecular diffusion, from underlying dermis, flowing into microscopical spaces among individual cells. Products of metabolism are cleared by a reverse of this process. Epidermis growth take place by mitotic activity in its deepest layer, into the basal layer, with slow outward migration and maturation of cells. As these cells approach the surface, special proteins accumulate into their cytoplasm, then the cells die and 'dry', into microscopic, tightly-connected individual layers, composed mainly of keratin. The resulting 'dead' superficial layer serves a protective function, saving underlying living tissues from injury, from dehydration and from fungal and bacterial attack. The <b>constant</b> <b>thickness</b> of the cornified layer results most commonly from regular superficial exfoliation. When a specialised cornified structure has a particular toughness, as in nails and hair, little or no exfoliation occurs and the cornified structures must slowly migrate away from their original position.|$|E

The biggest changes were the mounting of the bulk of the secondary armament in turrets, rather than Iénas casemates, and the <b>constant</b> <b>thickness</b> of the waterline belt armour compared to Iénas belt which thinned towards the ends of the ship.
