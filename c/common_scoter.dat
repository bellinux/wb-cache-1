25|$|Twenty-one {{species of}} seabird are {{reported}} as regularly nesting on beaches or cliffs around the Irish Sea. Huge {{populations of the}} sea duck, <b>common</b> <b>scoter,</b> spend winters feeding in shallow waters off eastern Ireland, Lancashire and North Wales.|$|E
25|$|These {{areas of}} water are {{inhabited}} by Eurasian beaver, which had disappeared {{some years ago}} due to intensive hunting, but which have now recovered their original population. Besides this, it is mostly a richness of birds that distinguishes the park's wetlands. It constitutes the southernmost extent in Sweden of the nesting area of many species, such as the greater scaup, the oldsquaw, the <b>common</b> <b>scoter,</b> and also a focus of important populations of red-necked phalarope, ruff, common greenshank and wood sandpiper. One also finds sometimes the Eurasian curlew, which is considered an endangered species.|$|E

50|$|It was {{formerly}} {{considered to be}} conspecific with the velvet scoter, and some taxonomists still regard it as so. These two species, and the surf scoter, are placed in the subgenus Melanitta, distinct from the subgenus Oidemia, black and <b>common</b> <b>scoters.</b> The subspecies stejnegeri has been suggested to be a full species, {{according to a new}} study.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of {{the wind}} farm was objected by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. [...] A large {{population}} of <b>common</b> <b>scoters</b> (sea duck) was found near the site. [...] This cause the relocation of site in 2005 more close to Fleetwood. [...] However, the new site was in addition to BAE Systems and the Ministry of Defence also objected by the Blackpool International Airport and local fishermen.|$|R
5000|$|The {{surf scoter}} (Melanitta perspicillata) {{is a large}} sea duck, which breeds in Canada and Alaska. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek melas [...] "black" [...] and netta [...] "duck". The species name is from the Latin perspicillatus, [...] " [...] spectacled", in turn derived from perspicere, [...] "to see through". It {{is placed in the}} {{subgenus}} Melanitta, along with the velvet and white-winged scoters, distinct from the subgenus Oidemia, black and <b>common</b> <b>scoters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>scoter</b> {{is one of}} {{the species}} to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.|$|E
50|$|Grey {{seal and}} common seal are {{frequently}} seen off-shore, as are seabirds such as gannet, little auk, <b>common</b> <b>scoter,</b> razorbill and guillemot.|$|E
50|$|In {{parts of}} France, {{in the nineteenth}} century and earlier, the <b>common</b> <b>scoter</b> was {{accepted}} by the Roman Catholic Church as a substitute for fish during the Friday Fast.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the area}} of the dam nest Northern wheatears. There are greater scaups, mainly velvet scooters, long-tailed ducks or <b>common</b> <b>scoters</b> and red-throated loons and black-throated loons. In Eastern part of the {{reservoir}} in the more densely reeds and willow thickets there are three species of grebes, little bitterns, spotted crakes and Western marsh harriers, and to the end of April there are Savi's warblers species of bird. Various species also rest in the area and are the Eurasian curlews, Northern lapwings, grey plovers and dunlins and curlew sandpipers. There are also ruddy turnstones, Eurasian oystercatchers and red-necked phalarope.|$|R
40|$|Human {{offshore}} activities are increasingly threatening waterbird conservation interests. The impacts of disturbance by high-speed ferries on Common Eiders Somateria mollissima and <b>Common</b> <b>Scoters</b> Melanitta nigra were studied at a wintering {{site in the}} Kattegat Sea, Denmark. Spatial patterns of winter site use, close-range distribution patterns relative to ferry passages and escape distances were examined using aerial surveys and ferry-based observations. For Common Eiders, there was a suggestion of major disturbance impacts, i. e. birds displacing {{in response to the}} passage of ferries, within 500 – 1, 000 m of the ferry route: a considerable proportion of flocks (> 10 %) located within 400 m took flight in response to a passing ferry, and distributional impacts, including birds responding by swimming, were occasionally suggested within a distance of 500 – 1, 000 m. Although distributional impacts could not be demonstrated with statistical significance within the Hjelm area (partly because of an apparently limited food supply in the area around the ferry route), it is concluded that high-speed ferry disturbance, had the potential to reduce significantly habitat use within 500 m of the ferry route. <b>Common</b> <b>Scoters</b> tended to take flight further from the ferry route than Common Eiders, however, data were limited and no conclusions could be made on displacement distances or possible impacts on habitat use. The results show that high-speed ferries may be an important source of disturbance that should be given due attention when the cumulative effects of {{offshore activities}} on site use by sea ducks are considered...|$|R
500|$|Large {{numbers of}} ducks winter on the reserve, {{including}} many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, and smaller counts of goldeneyes and northern pintails. Offshore, {{there may be}} large [...] "rafts" [...] of <b>common</b> <b>scoters,</b> and smaller numbers of common eiders, long-tailed ducks, velvet scoters and red-throated divers. Brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae, and hundreds of European golden plovers may roost on the reserve at high tide. In the evenings, large flocks of pink-footed geese fly over Titchwell {{on their way to}} roost, and barn owls and hen harriers quarter the marshes. This is the season for flocks of lesser redpolls, sometimes accompanied by a rarer common redpoll, and snow buntings are to be found on the beach.|$|R
50|$|This {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from other scoters, apart from <b>common</b> <b>scoter,</b> {{by the lack of}} white anywhere on the drake, and the more extensive pale areas on the female.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the area}} {{includes}} the <b>common</b> <b>scoter,</b> the velvet scoter, the Eider duck, the wigeon, the long-tailed duck, the red-breasted merganser, the great northern diver and the Slavonian grebe.|$|E
50|$|In {{and around}} the lakes {{there are plenty of}} Anatinae, such as long-tailed duck, Eurasian teal and <b>common</b> <b>scoter</b> as well as many waders, which include red-necked phalarope, ruff, Temminck's stint and common redshank.|$|E
50|$|Bird species {{recorded}} in the harbor are Pelagic cormorant, pigeon guillemot, horned puffin, <b>common</b> eider, black <b>scoter,</b> Arctic terns, glaucous gulls and White wagtails.|$|R
500|$|The Point juts {{into the}} sea on a north-facing coast, which means that migrant birds {{may be found in}} spring and autumn, {{sometimes}} in huge numbers when the weather conditions force them towards land. Numbers are relatively low in spring, but autumn can produce large [...] "falls", such as the hundreds of European robins on 1 October 1951 or more than 400 common redstarts, on 18 September 1995. The common birds are regularly accompanied by scarcer species like greenish warblers, great grey shrikes or Richard's pipits. Seabirds may be sighted passing the Point, and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year. Vagrant rarities have turned up when the weather is appropriate, including a Fea's or Zino's petrel in 1997, a trumpeter finch in 2008, and an alder flycatcher in 2010. Ornithologist and pioneering bird photographer Emma Turner started ringing common terns on the Point in 1909, and the use of this technique for migration studies has continued since. A notable recovery was a Sandwich tern killed for food in Angola, and a Radde's warbler trapped for ringing in 1961 was only the second British record of this species at that time. In the winter, the marshes hold golden plovers and wildfowl including common shelduck, Eurasian wigeon, brent geese and common teal, while <b>common</b> <b>scoters,</b> <b>common</b> eiders, common goldeneyes and red-breasted mergansers swim offshore.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of floating seaweed patches {{on the distribution}} and behaviour of seabirds was investigated using the European Seabirds At Sea database (ESAS). The percentage of observations that seabirds were observed with floating seaweed differed among species, depending on the mode of foraging. The results indicate that surface feeding species that make shallow dives (terns and Red-breasted Mergansers Mergus serrator) benefit most from the presence of floating seaweeds and their associated macro- and ichthyofauna. Species hunting for pelagic and bottom-dwelling prey (divers, Guillemots Uria aalge, Razorbills Alca torda, Puffins Fratercula arctica, Gannets Sula bassana and Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo), and especially benthos feeders (<b>Common</b> <b>Scoters</b> Melanitta nigra and Eiders Somateria mollissima) were frequently seen in association with floating seaweeds, while opportunists and scavengers like gulls and skuas were recorded on few occasions. Petrels and shearwaters (surface-seizing, pursuit-plunging, pursuit-diving) were seldomly seen in association with floating seaweeds. The most common behavioural activities of the birds associated with floating seaweed {{were found to be}} surface pecking, actively searching, and pursuit plunging...|$|R

50|$|At {{the third}} {{steering}} group {{meeting of the}} UK <b>Common</b> <b>Scoter</b> Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), {{the population in the}} Shell Flat area was put at 16,500 wintering scoter and 5,000 moulting birds, of which 4,000 used the footprint area of the proposed wind farm.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>common</b> <b>scoter</b> is {{a winter}} {{visitor to the}} UK, there are some {{breeding}} pairs {{in the north of}} Scotland. The species has been placed on the RSPB conservation Red List because of a greater than 50% decline in the UK breeding population. In 1998, the UK Government agreed to a biodiversity action plan (BAP) for the <b>common</b> <b>scoter</b> to increase the breeding population to 100 pairs by 2008. The Northern Irish population, which had reached a peak of 150-200 pairs in the 1970s, crashed disastrously in the 1990s and by 2010 there were no confirmed reports of breeding. However, 100 pairs were recorded in the south of Ireland in a 1995 survey. UK breeding pairs have declined to 35 as of 2015 and attempts are being made to research why.|$|E
5000|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew {{sandpipers}} and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to refuel, others staying for the winter. This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.Large numbers of ducks winter on the reserve, including many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, and smaller counts of goldeneyes and northern pintails.

40|$|Offshore {{wind farms}} may affect bird populations through {{collision}} mortality and displacement. Given the pressures to develop offshore wind farms, {{there is an}} urgent need to assess population-level impacts on protected marine birds. Here we refine an approach to assess aspects of their ecology that influence population vulnerability to wind farm impacts, also {{taking into account the}} conservation importance of each species. Flight height appears to be a key factor influencing collision mortality risk but improved data on flight heights of marine birds are needed. Collision index calculations identify populations of gulls, white-tailed eagles, northern gannets and skuas as of particularly high concern in Scottish waters. Displacement index calculations identify populations of divers and <b>common</b> <b>scoters</b> as most vulnerable to population-level impacts of displacement, but these are likely to be less evident than impacts of collision mortality. The collision and displacement indices developed here for Scottish marine bird populations could be applied to populations elsewhere, and this approach will help in identifying likely impacts of future offshore wind farms on marine birds and prioritising monitoring programmes, at least until data on macro-avoidance rates become available...|$|R
50|$|In 2003, a {{previously}} unknown wintering population of 50,000+ {{was found on}} Shell Flat in the north west of England by Cirrus Energy whilst surveying the area for a new wind farm.

40|$|Abstract Background Systematic {{pathological}} investigations {{to assess}} the health status of seabirds and coastal birds in Germany were performed. The investigation was conducted to obtain data on possible causes of decline in seabird and coastal bird populations. Methods 48 individuals of 11 different species of seabirds and coastal birds were collected by the stranding network along the entire German North Sea coast from 1997 to 2008, including mainly waders such as Eurasian oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus) and red knots (Calidris canutus) as well as seabirds such as northern fulmars (Fulmaris glacialis) and <b>common</b> <b>scoters</b> (Melanitta nigra). For most birds (n[*]=[*] 31) found dead along the shore no obvious {{cause of death was}} evident, while 17 individuals were killed by collisions with lighthouses. Results Overall, the nutritional status of the investigated birds was very poor, and the body mass in most cases was significantly lower compared to masses of living birds caught during the same periods of the year. This is partly linked to chronic parasitic or bacterial infections in different organs or to septicaemia. In some cases infections with zoonotic tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium spp. were found. Avian influenza was not found in any of the collected birds. Conclusion The presented data contribute to the evaluation of the health status of birds in the German North Sea. Moreover, they present an important tool for the assessment of potential pathogens with an impact on the health status of seabirds and coastal birds. </p...|$|R
50|$|Cape St. Mary's Ecological Reserve is an {{ecological}} reserve located near Cape St. Mary's on the Cape Shore, on the southwestern Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland. It {{is home to}} one of Newfoundland's largest seabird colonies. The government of Newfoundland and Labrador estimates that the site is home to 24,000 northern gannets, 20,000 black-legged kittiwakes, 20,000 common murres, and 2,000 thick-billed murres, as well as dozens or hundreds of razorbill, and black guillemot breeding pairs. The ocean waters off the reserve also provides winter habitat for harlequin ducks, <b>common</b> eiders, <b>scoters,</b> and long-tailed ducks. The reserve has been designated an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.|$|R
50|$|Winter {{residents}} include large {{flocks of}} ducks, geese, and swans {{winter in the}} Sound. In West Haven, Connecticut 8,000 scaup (also called broadbills or bluebills) were regularly counted in the 1970s. Greater scaup, black ducks, mallards, and Canada geese are the most abundant wintering birds. There are also significant populations of red-breasted mergansers, <b>common</b> goldeneyes, buffleheads, <b>scoters,</b> American wigeons (also sometimes called baldpate), canvasbacks, oldsquaws and mute swans. Others (less abundant) include gadwalls, northern pintails, green-winged teal, northern shovelers (also sometimes called broadbill), ruddy ducks, redheads, ring-necked ducks, snow geese, and brant.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>common</b> <b>scoter</b> (Melanitta nigra) {{is a large}} sea duck, 43 - 54 cm in length, which breeds {{over the}} far north of Europe and Asia east to the Olenyok River. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek melas, [...] "black", and netta, [...] "duck". The species name is from Latin niger [...] "shining black". The black scoter (M. americana) of North America and eastern Siberia is {{sometimes}} considered a subspecies of M. nigra.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the rich}} avafauna that have {{primarily}} {{been responsible for}} the designations of IBA and SPA. Part of this IBA is a recognized international IBA. A variety of pelagic birds as well as terrestrial birds find their homes at Kullaberg. The preserve is a significant wintering and passage area for a number of seabirds and seaduck, including common eider (Somateria mollissima), <b>common</b> <b>scoter</b> (Melanita nigra), velvet scoter (Melanita fusca), common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), and black guillemot (Cepphus grylle).|$|E
50|$|The {{most visible}} {{effect of the}} spill {{was seen in the}} large number of birds covered in oil that were shown on {{television}} and in newspapers. Amongst the birds affected were guillemots, razorbills and the worst affected bird, the <b>common</b> <b>scoter</b> duck. 83% of the birds affected were <b>common</b> <b>scoter</b> birds, and it is estimated that 5,000 of the 15,000 population in the area were killed. The RSPB set up a temporary bird hospital in Milford Haven to try to treat as many birds as possible. This centre is now a storage area but {{in the aftermath of the}} Sea Empress disaster it became a hive of activity where many birds were showered and cleaned as best as possible. Unfortunately the life expectancy of a cleaned Guillemot or Razorbill that was oiled once it was let back into the sea was a very short 9 days. Members of the public also helped rescue the birds. It was later revealed in a study by the British Trust for Ornithology that the average survival time for a rescued oiled Auk (Razorbill or Guillemot) was seven days.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to fish, the lake provides habitat {{for a wide}} variety of bird species. From the Forest Service campgrounds along the lake shore, birdwatchers can view waterfowl, songbirds, and birds of prey. Common waterfowl include red-necked grebes, Pacific loons, common loons, hooded mergansers, red-breasted mergansers, lesser scaup, surf <b>scoters,</b> white-winged <b>scoters,</b> <b>common</b> goldeneyes, and Barrow's goldeneyes. The lake also attracts birds of prey such as red-tailed hawk, osprey and bald eagles. Both the osprey and eagles normally stay well into the fall to feed on brown trout and kokanee salmon that spawn in Link Creek, between Suttle and Blue lakes.|$|R
50|$|Long-tailed ducks, white-winged <b>scoter,</b> <b>common</b> loon and horned grebe spend winter off {{the refuge}} shore, while shorebirds, songbirds and raptors are present during spring and fall.
