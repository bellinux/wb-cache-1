25|$|Materials {{are limited}} to ductile {{materials}} because the threads are <b>cold</b> <b>formed.</b> However, this increases the thread's yield strength, surface finish, hardness, and wear resistance. Also, materials with good deformation characteristics are necessary for rolling; these materials include softer (more ductile) metals and exclude brittle materials, such as cast iron. Tolerances are typically ±0.001in. (±0.025mm), but tolerances as tight as ±0.0006in (±0.015mm) are achievable. Surface finishes range from 6 to 32 micro-inches.|$|E

The principal advantage of <b>cold</b> <b>form</b> foil blisters is that the use of aluminum offers a near complete barrier for water and oxygen, allowing an extended product expiry date.

In particular, initial powder characteristics and processing, including <b>cold</b> <b>forming</b> and sintering, have a strong impact on the mechanical properties of the components as they may generate a defect population (microcracks, density gradients, pores, agglomerates) within the green and sintered compounds.
