The optimized procedure has a response time of 6. 5 minutes. In order to monitor samples whose SSL concentration is between 0 and 10 ppm, a long path length, dual beam, flow through colorimeter was developed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{theory and}} ways of {{applying}} a new electroanalytical detectior method were developed. The method, called galvanovoltammetry, consists of the measurement of current from the bipolar electrode of a three electrode cell which consists of a working electrode and a counter electrode, between which a constant current is applied, and a bipolar electrode which forms a galvanic cell with the working electrode. The theory was developed by interpreting i -V plots for the three electrodes of a flow cell, {{which could be used}} as a galvanovoltammetry cell. An equivalent model circuit for a galvanovoltammetry cell was proposed and used in discussions pertaining to the theory of cell operation. The effects which various cell and sample parameters have on the operation of a galvanovoltammetry cell were investigated and the results utilized to discuss how parameter values are chosen for any particular application. The galvanovoltammetry method was then specifically applied to the continuous analysis of a liquid stream for chlorine. A low cost electronic instrument to automate the application, but which may also, with certain modifications, be used with other electroanalytical detectors, was designed and constructed with emphasis on the use of recently developed integrated circuits.

40|$|Adsorption using solid sorbents is {{recognized}} to be attractive to complement or replace the current absorption technology for CO 2 capture {{due to its}} low energy requirement. However, {{the development of new}} highly specific CO 2 adsorbent is necessary: a solution is represented by fine materials, whose properties can be tuned at a molecular level by means of functionalization processes to tailor their CO 2 capture performance. Another point to be addressed is the adoption of an adequate reactor configuration, which can, on one hand, fully exploit the potential and properties of these new-concept adsorbent materials by maximizing the contact between the CO 2 molecules and the adsorbent particles, and, on the other hand, improve the heat transfer. In this respect, a fluidized bed could be a good solution, due to larger gas-solid contact efficiency, higher rate of mass and heat transfer and lower pressure drops. In particular, a more suitable reactor configuration is a sound assisted fluidized bed, namely provided with a system for the generation of acoustic vibrations to overcome the high interparticles forces characterizing fine powders. On these bases, the present PhD thesis focuses on the CO 2 capture process by temperature swing adsorption on fine porous materials in a sound assisted fluidized bed. In order to perform adsorption/desorption tests, a laboratory scale sound assisted fluidized bed experimental rig has been set up. It is equipped with a system for the sound generation and with a <b>continuous</b> <b>analyzer</b> for the CO 2 concentration measurement in the effluent gas stream. For the regeneration tests the reactor is externally heated by an ad-hoc designed heating jacket, provided with a window to allow the fluidization quality to be visually assessed. Both common adsorbent materials, two activated carbons, zeolite HZSM- 5 and zeolite 13 X, and a highly specific adsorbent material, a metal organic framework HKUST- 1, were used. The experimental results show that the application of the sound can improve the fluidization quality as well as the adsorption efficiency (by maximizing the gas-solid contact) of all the selected adsorbent materials in terms of remarkably higher breakthrough time, adsorption capacity, fraction of bed utilized until breakthrough and adsorption rate. The experimental campaign has been also carried out, at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, in order to highlight the effect of some operating variables on the adsorption performances, i. e. sound intensity (120 - 140 dB) and frequency (20 - 300 Hz), CO 2 partial pressure (0. 05 - 0. 15 atm) and fluidization velocity (0. 1 - 4. 5 cm/s). In particular, increasing sound intensities yield better adsorption performances, whereas, sound frequency has a not monotone effect on the fluidization quality and adsorption efficiency. The CO 2 capture capacity increases with CO 2 partial pressure, coherently with the partial pressure being the thermodynamic driving force of the adsorption process. Finally, the dependence of the breakthrough time on the contact time is linear for the tests performed in ordinary conditions, whereas, it is not monotone for the sound assisted tests. At the end of the experimental campaign, all the investigated adsorbent materials have been compared and their different adsorption behaviours explained {{on the basis of their}} textural properties. In particular, it has been found that there is a specific pore size range, 8 - 12 Å, which is the key factor affecting the adsorption capacity of the studied materials under the investigated operating conditions. Desorption tests have been performed on the materials characterized by the best adsorption performances, the HKUST- 1 and one activated carbon at atmospheric pressure. In particular, an extra-situ regeneration strategy (150 °C under a vacuum of 50 mbar) has been developed to study the stability of HKUST- 1 to cyclic adsorption/desorption operations, since HKUST- 1 presents problems of thermal stability, limiting the desorption temperature to be used in a temperature swing adsorption process. The results show that HKUST- 1 is very stable, keeping its adsorption performances over 10 adsorption/desorption cycles. As regards the activated carbon, two strategy of temperature swing adsorption have been tested in the sound assisted fluidized bed. The first regeneration strategy is an isothermal purge consisting in combining the effect of increasing temperature and decreasing CO 2 partial pressure. The second regeneration strategy, heating and purge, consists in separating the thermal effect from the purging one. The application of the sound makes it possible, from one hand, to remarkably increase the desorption rate and, on the other, to significantly enrich the recovered CO 2 stream. CO 2 recovery and purity have opposing trends: higher desorption times yield a higher CO 2 recovery, but lead to a lower CO 2 purity of the desorbing stream. The desorption rate is positively affected by both desorption temperature (25 - 150 °C) and N 2 purge flow rate (45. 2 - 90. 4 Nl h- 1). The purity of the recovered CO 2 stream is increased by increasing desorption temperatures, whereas, it is not affected by change of the N 2 purge flow rate since dilution does not depend on the purge flow rate but only on the purge volume. The results obtained show that heating is very effective since 80 % of the captured CO 2 can be can be recovered with a 100 % purity at a bland desorption temperature of 130 °C. It is worth noting that for each desorption temperature the heating and purge strategy always makes it possible to enrich the stream of CO 2 recovered with respect to the standard purge strategy, the CO 2 recovery level being the same. The possibility to use the activated carbon in a cyclic operation has been also assessed: it is very stable, keeping its adsorption performances over 16 adsorption/desorption cycle. Finally, considerations about the energy cost and scale-up of the proposed technology for CO 2 capture by temperature swing adsorption have also been reported...|$|E

This work is concerned with a comparative study of two types of light-duty vehicular fuels presently used in Brazil - namely gasohol (a mixture 22 - 24 % of anhydrous ethanol in gasoline) and hydrated ethanol (95 % v/v) - as potential precursors for ozone formation in the atmosphere of urban cities. The experiments were conducted during {{the spring and summer of}} 2001 / 2002. In each one, two Teflon chambers were filled, respectively, with each fuel, at high initial [VOC] to ratios and exposed to the sunlight. Ozone formation, as well as NOx concentration profiles were measured directly using ozone and NO/NO 2 /NOx <b>continuous</b> <b>analyzers.</b> The results showed that, for the same initial volumes of the two fuels into the bags, the ozone peak concentrations are in average 28 % higher for alcohol than for gasohol.

40|$|Catalytic autothermal {{reforming}} {{of methane}} was studied over a commercial rhodium catalyst {{as a function}} of feed flow rate, feed composition and oven temperature. The process is carried out in a catalytic fixed bed reactor inserted in a tubular oven. Temperature profile of the catalyst bed was measured by IR thermography and product composition was measured with a <b>continuous</b> gas <b>analyzer.</b> The effect of water addition at fixed flow rate on catalyst temperature profile was investigated in two ways. In one case, upon water addition, an equivalent amount of nitrogen was removed from the feed in order to keep oxygen and methane concentrations constant. With this protocol nitrogen to oxygen ratio varies {{as a function of}} amount of water in the feed. In the other case, upon water addition, nitrogen, oxygen and methane were all reduced to keep total flow rate constant, thus keeping both oxygen to methane and nitrogen to oxygen ratios constant. The effect of water addition on product composition was investigated as a function of reactor thermal level, regulated by acting on oven temperature...|$|R

A series of concentrations of 3350 molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) solutions are used as a calibration sequence for the pulse mode system using a network analyzer and high frequency oscilloscope. The operation of the pulse mode system is then compared to the <b>continuous</b> wave network <b>analyzer</b> by showing a sequence of deposition and removal of a model mass layer of palmitoyl-oleoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (POPC) vesicles. This experimental apparatus {{has the potential for}} making many hundreds of measurements a minute and so allowing the dynamics of fast interactions to be observed...|$|R
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 58 – 67 Studies of {{chemical}} speciation and phase fractionation of atmospheric inorganic compounds of N, S and Cl have been {{undertaken in the}} atmosphere of the Reconcavo Baiano. The objectives were to determine the enrichment of the clean air masses coming from the Atlantic by different chemical species resulting from NO 2 SO 2, HCl and NH 3 emissions from the industrial areas at the Reconcavo and to estimate the changes in air quality regarding between 2008 and 2010. The following sampling devices were used: passive samplers (PS) and <b>continuous</b> <b>analyzers</b> for NO 2 and SO 2; diffusion tubes coated with citric acid for ammonia and NaF for strong acids (HCl, HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4), the latter in a thermodiffusion system with a back-up filter for collection of the thermically stable (140 °C) ammonium salts and other particles 14. 9 μm). The analytical methodology for the discontinuous measures included ion chromatography (SO 2 as SO 42 − in the PS, anions of the PM and as representants of the acids in the gas phase) and molecular spectrophotometry using the Griess–Saltzman method (λ = 540 nm) and indophenol method (λ = 630 nm) for determination of NO 2 and NH 3, respectively. Clean air masses from the Atlantic (13 nmol m− 3 HCl, 2. 9 nmol m− 3 HNO 3, 1. 6 nmol m− 3 H 2 SO 4, 9. 8 nmol m− 3 SO 2, 16 nmol m− 3 NO 2 and 84 nmol m− 3 NH 3) are slighted enriched in the gas and particulate phase with respect to HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4, respectively, by emissions of the industrial complex. However, enrichment occurs for HCl, SO 2, NO 2 and NH 3. In the area of industrial complex influence hydrochloric acid predominates over the other two strong acids, as expected, due to its direct emission from the petrochemical waste incinerator. Ammonium chloride is the predominant gas to particle transformations. During the period of 2008 – 2010 a decrease varying between 18 and 49 % is observed on the levels of almost all compounds in Lamarão do Passé, downwind from an oil refinery but not in Camaçari, downwind from the industrial complex, where all other compounds presented an increased in their concentrations with the exception of HNO 3 and HCl...|$|R
