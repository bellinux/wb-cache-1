5000|$|Thompson criticised many of Gresleys practices, but {{equivalent}} comment can be {{made about}} many of Thompsons designs. Upon taking up his post, Thompson tried to convince the LNER hierarchy {{of the need to}} rebuild the Gresley Pacific and Mikado classes. The Directors of the LNER, having witnessed a Gresley A4 take the World Speed Record for steam, were sceptical about this, so Thompson researched as many middle big-end bearing failures on the LNER as he could find, attributing them to the design of the conjugated motion, even garnering outside opinion from the LMS. Despite roundly criticizing the Gresley motion, his Pacific rebuilds were not the best designs. They retained three cylinders, but with divided drive and 3 independent sets of Walschaerts valve gear. Thompson attached great importance to having the connecting rods equal in length, which was in fact unnecessary. As a result, the outside cylinders were placed behind the front bogie with the inside cylinder well forward. This gave the engine an unnecessarily long wheelbase, created long exhaust channels, generated vibration and encouraged flexing and fracture of the locomotive frames. All of his Pacifics were particularly prone to wheel slip owing to the high power output of the engine in relation to the adhesion factor. The engines were effective, and the design had materially less maintenance demand on the <b>centre</b> <b>valve</b> gear than the conjugated locomotives, but the positives were outweighed by the problems, which were of such significance that Thompsons engines were withdrawn and scrapped before many of their Gresley-designed forerunners. The Thompson Pacifics were ultimately more maintenance-intensive overall than the Gresley engines. Thompson omitted the [...] "banjo dome" [...] that had featured on the Gresley Pacifics since 1928. However, Thompsons successor, Arthur Peppercorn, revived the feature on the remaining batches of LNER Pacifics.|$|E

These three-cylinder Pacifics, although capable of hauling heavy loads at high speed, had proved to be relatively maintenance-intensive, {{particularly with regard to}} the servicing of the valve gear and motion for their third (inside) cylinder. The Gresley conjugated valve gear, driven from the valve spindles of the outside cylinder piston valves, was prone to heat expansion and wear, causing timing difficulties, and required dismantling and removal whenever the <b>centre</b> cylinder <b>valve</b> required service.|$|R

5000|$|The {{function}} of the valve is to improve efficiency when running light, with the regulator closed, such as when descending hills. The valve consists of the usual parts of a piston valve: two valve pistons with sealing rings, carried on a valve spindle driven by the valve gear. The difference with a Trofimoff valve is that the piston heads are free to slide on the spindle. When steam pressure is applied, under normal operating conditions, steam is admitted to the <b>centre</b> of the <b>valve</b> chest. This forces the valve heads apart against end stops on the spindle and into their normal working position. The valvegear works as usual.|$|R

The 138 cc (bore 50 mm, stroke 70 mm) single cylinder engine with a surface carburettor produced 0.5 HP at an engine speed of 1500 RPM, a remarkably high speed for the time.

In this paper, the planktonic diatom Thalassiosira delicatula Ostenfeld emend. Hasle, originally isolated and cultured (in f/ 2 medium, a light-darkness cycle of 12 : 12, and at temperature of 20 °C ± 2 °C) from material obtained from the tropical, southern Mexican Pacific, was studied by LM, SEM and TEM. General morphology of the species agrees well with previous descriptions, including the formation of chains and colonies embedded in mucilage, the chitin threads connecting cells in the chain, the shape of the cells (in girdle view rectangular with a concavity in the <b>valve</b> <b>centre),</b> and processes (with a large rimoportula between valve face and mantle, a marginal ring of occluded ones, and two or three marginal rings of fultoportulae) and areolae arrangement. However the shape and distribution of chloroplasts and threads produced by marginal fultoportulae in living cells, and the presence of more than one central fultoportula, close to a larger areola (two and three fultoportulae were detected in this study) had never been described. Urn-shaped marginal fultoportulae were also very common in most specimens studied, whereas in the literature this character was found only once for the species.

40|$|Passive {{selective}} catalyst reduction (SCR) {{systems can}} be used as aftertreatment systems for lean burn spark ignition (SI) -engines. Their operation is based on the interaction between the engine, an ammonia formation catalyst (AFC), and an SCR catalyst. Under rich conditions the AFC forms ammonia, which is stored in the SCR catalyst. Under lean conditions, the SCR catalyst reduces the engine out NOx using the stored NH 3. This study compared the ammonia production and response times of a standard three way catalyst (TWC) and a Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst under realistic engine operating conditions. In addition, the relationships between selected engine operating parameters and ammonia formation over a TWC were investigated, considering the influence of both the chosen load point and the engine settings. Tests at the loadpoint of 1500 rpm/ 2. 63 bar break mean effective pressure (BMEP) showed that most ammonia was formed over a TWC at a lambda of 0. 93 with a 50 % mass fraction burned (MFB) at 3 crank angle degrees (CAD) after top dead <b>centre</b> (aTDC), when <b>valve</b> overlap was minimised. The response time of the TWC during transitions from rich to lean operation was evaluated at various loadpoints, showing that the TWC responded most rapidly at higher loadpoints, mainly due to the higher flow through the catalyst. Furthermore it was noted that at 1750 rpm/ 8. 00 bar BMEP, ammonia formation decreased over time due to high in-catalyst temperatures. A comparison between the TWC and Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst showed that the latter produced ammonia faster than the TWC catalyst at 1500 rpm/ 2. 63 bar BMEP. Furthermore the yield was more than 50 % lower compared to the TWC...|$|R
40|$|Edge {{drilling}} is {{a strategy}} used by some gastropod predators when feeding on bivalve or brachiopod prey in which the bore-hole is positioned at the valve margin. This strategy can poten-tially reduce drilling times {{by a factor of}} two to three as compared with wall drilling (i. e. drilling near the thicker <b>centre</b> of the <b>valve),</b> the typical default drilling behaviour (Dietl & Herbert, 2005). Dietl, Herbert & Vermeij (2004) showed that, at least for muricid predators, edge drilling is expressed more fre-quently when drillers are exposed to intense competition risk. They speculated that the reduction in drilling time achieved by edge-drilling snails may be advantageous, allowing a predator to achieve either a higher net energy gain per unit time or reduced exposure to their own predators. There are few reports of edge-drilling behaviour by species of the gastropod family Naticidae, however, and the extent of its use across the family has never been investigated systematically, either in field studies or in experimental settings. A review of the literature on drilling studies indicates that gas-tropods of the family Naticidae employ multiple modes of preda-tion when attacking bivalve prey (Table 1; Vermeij, 1980; Ansell & Morton, 1985, 1987). Drilling is most prevalent, but other methods include feeding through the open gape of bivalves that cannot tightly shut their valves (Edwards, 1974) or suffocat-ing prey by enveloping them within the foot (Vermeij, 1980; Hutchings & Herbert, 2013; Visaggi, Dietl & Kelley, 2013). Wall drills are {{the most common type of}} drilling employed, par-ticularly by naticid species outside the tropics (Kitchell et al., 1986; Ansell & Morton, 1987).

40|$|During {{a survey}} of benthic diatoms sampled in {{watercourses}} from Mainland Portugal, several Achnanthidium populations morphologically ascribable to the A. minutissimum complex have been found. They clearly belong to the genus Achnanthidium {{on the basis of}} the valve outline, radiate striae, uniseriate, wider spaced striae in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>valve</b> and cells shallow‐V‐shaped in girdle view. The raphe valve has a straight central raphe hardly expanding at the centre and a row of elongated areolae in the mantle. Within the genus Achnanthidium these morphotypes belong to the complex of A. minutissimum (Kützing) Czarnecki, due to their straight terminal raphe fissures, in opposition to the species with terminal raphe fissures clearly deflected on the same side of the valve. Since these individuals were abundant in numerous sites, especially in the Centre and North of Portugal, a more detailed examination was performed by means of light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, the examination of the environmental characteristics of the sites where they have been sampled allowed us to gather sufficient information on the ecological preferences of the different taxa. The main features that allow the separation of these taxa among each other and from all the other known Achnanthidium species are the different valve outline and dimensions, the size and shape of the central area, the apices shape and the density of the striae throughout the valve and near the apices. The LM and SEM analyses of the type materials of Achnanthidium microcephalum Kützing, Achnanthes minutissima Kützing and A. minutissima var. cryptocephala Grunow in Van Heurck have been done in order to help to clarify the taxonomy of this group. A comparison with the literature on Achnanthidium minutissimum species complex was performed, but the new Portuguese Achnanthidium taxa present a set of distinct morphological and ecological features that separate them well from all other similar species.

40|$|Abstract Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) is increasingly {{used to assess}} patients with mitral regurgitation. Its advantages include quantitative determination of ventricular volumes and function and the mitral regurgitant fraction, and in ischemic mitral regurgitation, regional myocardial function and viability. In addition to these, identification of leaflet prolapse or restriction is necessary when valve repair is contemplated. We describe a systematic approach to the evaluation of mitral regurgitation using CMR which we have used in 149 patients with varying etiologies and severity of regurgitation over a 15 month period. Following standard ventricular cine acquisitions, including 2, 3 and 4 chamber long axis views and a short axis stack for biventricular function, we image movements of {{all parts of the}} mitral leaflets using a contiguous stack of oblique long axis cines aligned orthogonal to {{the central part of the}} line of coaptation. The 8 – 10 slices in the stack, orientated approximately parallel to a 3 -chamber view, are acquired sequentially from the superior (antero-lateral) mitral commissure to the inferior (postero-medial) commissure, visualising each apposing pair of anterior and posterior leaflet scallops in turn (A 1 -P 1, A 2 -P 2 and A 3 -P 3). We use balanced steady state free precession imaging at 1. 5 Tesla, slice thickness 5 mm, with no inter-slice gaps. Where the para-commissural coaptation lines curve relative to the central region, two further oblique cines are acquired orthogonal to the line of coaptation adjacent to each commissure. To quantify mitral regurgitation, we use phase contrast velocity mapping to measure aortic outflow, subtracting this from the left ventricular stroke volume to calculate the mitral regurgitant volume which, when divided by the left ventricular stroke volume, gives the mitral regurgitant fraction. In patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation, we further assess regional left ventricular function and, with late gadolinium enhancement, myocardial viability. Comprehensive assessment of mitral regurgitation using CMR is feasible and enables determination of mitral regurgitation severity, associated leaflet prolapse or restriction, ventricular function and viability in a single examination and is now routinely performed at our <b>centre.</b> The mitral <b>valve</b> stack of images is particularly useful and easy to acquire. </p...|$|R
50|$|The p-V diagam is a {{simplified}} and idealised {{representation of the}} events involved in a Diesel engine cycle, arranged to illustrate the similarity with a Carnot cycle. Starting at 1, the piston is at bottom dead <b>centre</b> and both <b>valves</b> are closed {{at the start of}} the compression stroke; the cylinder contains air at atmospheric pressure. Between 1 and 2 the air is compressed adiabatically—that is without heat transfer to or from the environment—by the rising piston. (This is only approximately true since there will be some heat exchange with the cylinder walls.) During this compression, the volume is reduced, the pressure and temperature both rise. At or slightly before 2 (TDC) fuel is injected and burns in the compressed hot air. Chemical energy is released and this constitutes an injection of thermal energy (heat) into the compressed gas. Combustion and heating occur between 2 and 3. In this interval the pressure remains constant since the piston descends, and the volume increases; the temperature rises as a consequence of the energy of combustion. At 3 fuel injection and combustion are complete, and the cylinder contains gas at a higher temperature than at 2. Between 3 and 4 this hot gas expands, again approximately adiabatically. Work is done on the system to which the engine is connected. During this expansion phase the volume of the gas rises, and its temperature and pressure both fall. At 4 the exhaust valve opens, and the pressure falls abruptly to atmospheric (approximately). This is unresisted expansion and no useful work is done by it. Ideally the adiabatic expansion should continue, extending the line 3-4 to the right until the pressure falls to that of the surrounding air, but the loss of efficiency caused by this unresisted expansion is justified by the practical difficulties involved in recovering it (the engine would have to be much larger). After the opening of the exhaust valve, the exhaust stroke follows, but this (and the following induction stroke) are not shown on the diagram. If shown, they would be represented by a low-pressure loop at the bottom of the diagram. At 1 it is assumed that the exhaust and induction strokes have been completed, and the cylinder is again filled with air. The piston-cylinder system absorbs energy between 1 and 2—this is the work needed to compress the air in the cylinder, and is provided by mechanical kinetic energy stored in the flywheel of the engine. Work output is done by the piston-cylinder combination between 2 and 4. The difference between these two increments of work is the indicated work output per cycle, and is represented by the area enclosed by the p-V loop. The adiabatic expansion is in a higher pressure range than that of the compression because the gas in the cylinder is hotter during expansion than during compression. It is for this reason that the loop has a finite area, and the net output of work during a cycle is positive.|$|R
