40|$|Two-dimensional elastic {{plates with}} {{symmetric}} hyperbolic notches in their sides {{and subjected to}} transverse tension are treated. By drawing on the classical work of Neuber, a formal statement of this class problems can be made and a closed-form expression for attendant stress <b>concentration</b> <b>factors</b> obtained. By varying notch acuity, stress <b>concentration</b> <b>factors</b> ranging from just less than 3 to just greater than 90 are produced. These configurations are subjected to finite element analysis with four-node quadrilateral elements. The elements are arranged in structured meshes that are uniform in elliptic-hyperbolic coordinates. Element sides are successively halved to examine convergence, the finest resulting mesh having about three hundred thousand elements. For all problems so analyzed, converging results are obtained for respective stress <b>concentration</b> <b>factors.</b> For the smaller stress <b>concentration</b> <b>factors</b> (3, 9), results have also converged well (within 0. 2 %).

50|$|For example, {{imagine a}} square glass sheet (or stack) 200 mm on a side, 5 mm thick. Its input area (e.g. {{the surface of}} one single face of the sheet {{oriented}} toward the energy source) is 10 {{times greater than the}} output area (e.g. the surface of four open sides) - 40000 square mm (200x200) as compared to 4000 square mm (200x5x4). To a first approximation, the <b>concentration</b> <b>factor</b> of such an LSC is proportional to the area of the input surfaces divided by the area of the edges multiplied by the efficiency of diversion of incoming light towards the output area. Suppose that the glass sheet could divert incoming light from the face towards the edges with an efficiency of 50%.

40|$|In {{the study}} of {{fracture}} processes in composite materials, the interactions between broken and intact fibres are of critical importance. Indeed, the redistribution of stress from a failed fibre to its unfailed adjacent neighbours, and the stress concentration induced in these, {{determine the extent to}} which a break in one fibre will cause more breaks in neighbouring fibres. The overall failure pattern is a direct function of the stress <b>concentration</b> <b>factors.</b> In this paper we use laser micro-Raman spectroscopy to study the extent of stress transfer and redistribution caused by fibre fracture in two-dimensional Kevlar 149 based microcomposites. The strain along the fibres was mapped at different levels of load, and specimens with different inter-fibre distances were used to study the fibre content effect. The experimental stress <b>concentration</b> <b>factors</b> were compared with values predicted from various theoretical models. The stress <b>concentration</b> <b>factors</b> generally agreed with those literature models that include interfibre distance and matrix effects. The overall failure pattern was found not to be a direct function of the stress <b>concentration</b> <b>factors</b> in this system, as fracture propagates from fibre to fibre even at large interfibre distances, and is apparently accompanied by relatively low values of the stress <b>concentration</b> <b>factors.</b> The ‘critical cluster size’, beyond which final fracture of the composite occurs in a catastrophic manner, was found to be larger than five adjacent fibre breaks in the present system, for all interfibre distances studied...|$|R
