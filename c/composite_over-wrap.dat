40|$|A {{graphical}} {{method is}} presented for comparing different tank technologies and evaluating scalability, over wide ranges of volume and pressure. Mass contours are plotted on log-log graphs of pressure versus volume, using either theory or data points representing hardware. The simple theoretical case for infinitely scaleable tanks {{made of a}} single isotropic material has a constant value of PV/m over the entire plot, and results in straight diagonal mass contours. The contours become more complicated {{as a result of}} practical considerations. The latter include minimum wall thickness limits and non-pressure structural loads, as well as minimum thicknesses for the liner and <b>composite</b> <b>over-wrap</b> of multi-layered tank walls. Given a requirement for a tank at a particular volume and pressure, a set of plots representing different technologies can be used to estimate tank masses and select one or more technologies that would meet the need...|$|E
40|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>Over-Wrap</b> Vessels {{are widely}} used in the {{aerospace}} community. They are made of thin-walled bottles that are over wrapped with high strength fibers embedded in a matrix material. There is a strong drive to reduce the weight of space borne vehicles and thus pushes designers to adopt COPVs that are over wrapped with graphite fibers embedded in its epoxy matrix. Unfortunately, this same fiber-matrix configuration is more susceptible to impact damage than others and to make matters worse; there is a regime where impacts that damage the over wrap leave no visible scar on the COPV surface. In this paper FBG sensors are presented {{as a means of}} monitoring and detecting these types of damage. The FBG sensors are surface mounted to the COPVs and optically interrogated to explore the structural properties of these composite pressure vessels. These gratings optically inscribed into the core of a single mode fiber are used as a tool to monitor the stress strain relation in the composite matrix. The response of these fiber-optic sensors is investigated by pressurizing the cylinder up to its burst pressure of around 4500 psi. A Fiber Optic Demodulation System built by Blue Road Research, is used for interrogation of the Bragg gratings...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} present an {{overview}} of efforts to investigate the application of Raman spectroscopy for the characterization of Kevlar materials. Raman spectroscopy is a laser technique that is sensitive to molecular interactions in materials such as Kevlar, graphite and carbon used in composite materials. The overall goal of this research reported here is to evaluate Raman spectroscopy as a potential nondestructive evaluation (NDE) tool {{for the detection of}} stress rupture in Kevlar <b>composite</b> <b>over-wrapped</b> pressure vessels (COPVs). Characterization of the Raman spectra of Kevlar yarn and strands will be presented and compared with analytical models provided in the literature.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{non-traditional}} general methodology for {{the prediction of}} breakdown of engineering structures, based on a global top-down monitoring of {{the health of the}} structure modelled by the theory of critical rupture. The new Acceptance Test Plan integrating the resulting Predictive Acoustic Emission procedure has been successfully applied to the prediction of the breakdown of <b>composite</b> <b>over-wrapped</b> high pressure vessels which are currently produced for the Ariane 5 launcher by EADS Launch Vehicles. This new approach should be an efficient tool more generally in Structural Health Monitoring service, especially for the prediction of the residual margins and lifetimes of heterogeneous structures which constitutes the main issue of SHM in civil infrastructures.

40|$|The Space Shuttle Orbiter has well {{exceeded}} {{its original}} design life of 10 years or 100 missions. The Orbiter Project Office (OPO) has sponsored several activities to address aging vehicle concerns, including a Corrosion Control Review Board (CCRB), a mid-life certification program, {{and most recently}} {{the formation of the}} Aging Orbiter Working Group (AOWG). The AOWG was chartered in 2004 as a proactive group which provides the OPO oversight for aging issues such as corrosion, non-destructive inspection, non-metallics, wiring and subsystems. The core team consists of mainly representatives from the Materials and Processes Problem Resolution Team (M&P PRT) and Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA). Subsystem engineers and subject matter experts are called in as required. The AOWG has functioned by forming issues based sub-teams. Examples of completed sub-teams include adhesives, wiring and wing leading edge metallic materials.

40|$|The {{conservation}} of weight and space are major challenges for launch vehicles, especially upper stages. Upper-stage launch vehicles are confined by {{the space of}} the payload fairing of the first stage {{and it is difficult to}} stack fuel and oxidizer tanks end-to-end. Toroidal tanks have been studied as a way to help solve this problem. A toroidal tank concept would allow a portion of another tank, or part of an engine, to pass through its center opening. A toroidal tank assembly would be especially beneficial if it could somehow handle structural loads of the vehicle. Marshall Space Flight Center, along with ATK Thiokol Propulsion, is designing and fabricating a toroidal tank composed of individual conformal segments. Each conformal segment will be a metal-lined <b>composite</b> <b>over-wrapped</b> vessel. This paper will demonstrate unique materials and processing approaches that are overcoming hurdles for the fabrication of this vessel...|$|R
40|$|Researchers have {{accomplished}} great advances in pressure vessel technology by applying high-performance composite materials as an over-wrap to metal-lined pressure vessels. These <b>composite</b> <b>over-wrapped</b> pressure vessels (COPVs) {{are used in}} many areas, from air tanks for firefighters and compressed natural gas tanks for automobiles, to pressurant tanks for aerospace launch vehicles and propellant tanks for satellites and deep-space exploration vehicles. NASA and commercial industry are continually striving {{to find new ways}} to make high-performance pressure vessels safer and more reliable. While COPVs are much lighter than all-metal pressure vessels, the composite material, typically graphite fibers with an epoxy matrix resin, is vulnerable to impact damage. Carbon fiber is most frequently used for the high-performance COPV applications because of its high strength-to-weight characteristics. Other fibers have been used, but with limitations. For example, fiberglass is inexpensive but much heavier than carbon. Aramid fibers are impact resistant but have less strength than carbon and their performance tends to deteriorate...|$|R

This thesis presents the results of an investigation of the Raman scattering effects of aging Kevlar composite strands. The goal of this research is to investigate the potential application of Raman spectroscopy as a nondestructive evaluation tool for the detection of aging effects of in-service composite materials. Kevlar <b>composites</b> used as <b>over-wrapping</b> of metal-lined <b>composite</b> <b>over-wrapped</b> pressure vessels (COPVs) have been analyzed. Raman spectra produced from the Kevlar fibers and the effects of resin materials, utilized to bind the fibers into strands to provide composite behavior, have been investigated. A series of Kevlar / epoxy strands exposed to elevated temperatures and sustained loading have been evaluated. It was found that this exposure had an effect on the width and intensity of certain bands in the Raman spectra of Kevlar. The potential application of these findings to the nondestructive evaluation of Kevlar composites is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Onboard any space-launch vehicle, <b>composite</b> <b>over-wrapped</b> {{pressure}} vessels (COPVs) may be utilized by propulsion or environmental control systems. The {{failure of a}} COPV {{has the potential to}} be catastrophic, resulting in the loss of vehicle, crew or mission. The latest COPV designs have reduced the wall-thickness of the metallic liner to the point where the material strains plastically during operation. At this time, the only method to determine the damage tolerance lifetime (safe-life) of a plastically responding metallic liner is through full-scale COPV testing. Conducting tests costs substantially more and can be far more time consuming than performing an analysis. As a result of this cost, there is a need to establish a qualifying process through the use of a crack growth analysis tool. This paper will discuss fracture analyses of plastically responding metallic liners in COPVs. Uni-axial strain tests have been completed on laboratory specimens to collect elastic-plastic crack growth data. This data has been modeled with the crack growth analysis tool, NASGRO 6. 20 to predict the response of laboratory specimens and subsequently the complexity of a COPV...|$|R
40|$|It was {{demonstrated}} {{by way of}} experiment that <b>Composite</b> <b>Over-wrapped</b> Pressure Vessel (COPV) Ti- 6 Al- 4 V liner material can sustain the expected service loads and cycles. The experiments were performed as part of investigations on the residual life of COPV tanks being used in Space Shuttle Orbiters. Measured properties included tensile strength, compressive strength, reversed loading cycles to simulate liner proof strains, and cyclic fatigue loading to demonstrate the ability to sustain 1000 cycles after liner buckling. The liner material came from a salvaged 40 in. Columbia (orbiter 102) tank (SN 029), and tensile strength measurements were made on both boss-transition (thick) and membrane regions (thin). The average measured yield strength was 131 ksi in the boss-transition and membrane regions, in good agreement with measurements made on 1970 s vintage forged plate stock. However, Young s modulus was 17. 4 +/- 0. 3 Msi, somewhat higher than typical handbook values (approx. 16 Msi). The fracture toughness, as estimated from a failed fatigue specimen, was 74 ksi/sq in, in reasonable agreement with standardized measurements made on 1970 s vintage forged plate stock. Low cycle fatigue of a buckled test specimen implied that as-imprinted liners can sustain over 4000 load cycles...|$|R

The goal of this research is to examine the potential of Raman spectroscopy as a method of condition assessment for carbon fiber composite materials. Carbon fiber composites are used in high performance situations such as overwrapping of <b>composite</b> <b>over-wrapped</b> pressure vessels (COPVs) in aerospace applications and hydrogen and natural-gas transportation systems. The composites will play a larger role in the future due to the materials high strength to mass ratio. There are currently limited nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies to evaluate these composite materials in-situ. NDE technologies will be critical for analyzing environmentally caused degradation that can reduce strength and service life of the materials. Variations in elastic strain in the composite material can manifest from degradation or damage, and can be analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. The characterization of active Raman bands and the strain sensitivity of these bands for commercially available carbon fibers are reported. Additionally carbon fiber/epoxy matrix strands and burst COPV samples are investigated. These results indicate that Raman spectroscopy has some ability to make strain measurements in commercially available carbon fibers. Such measurements have the potential {{to be used as a}} tool for NDE in inspections and reliability assessment of carbon fiber composite materials...|$|R
40|$|This {{viewgraph}} presentation {{includes the}} following main concepts. Goal: To evaluate Raman spectroscopy as a potential NDE tool {{for the detection of}} stress rupture in Kevlar. Objective: Test a series of strand samples that have been aged under various conditions and evaluate differences and trends in the Raman response. Hypothesis: Reduction in strength associated with stress rupture may manifest from changes in the polymer at a molecular level. If so, than these changes may effect the vibrational characteristics of the material, and consequently the Raman spectra produced from the material. Problem Statement: Kevlar <b>composite</b> <b>over-wrapped</b> pressure vessels (COPVs) on the space shuttles are greater than 25 years old. Stress rupture phenomena is not well understood for COPVs. Other COPVs are planned for hydrogen-fueled vehicles using Carbon composite material. Raman spectroscopy is being explored as an non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique to predict the onset of stress rupture in Kevlar composite materials. Test aged Kevlar strands to discover trends in the Raman response. Strength reduction in Kevlar polymer will manifest itself on the Raman spectra. Conclusions: Raman spectroscopy has shown relative changes in the intensity and FWHM of the ~ 1613 cm(exp - 1) peak. Reduction in relative intensity for creep, fleet leader, and SIM specimens compared to the virgin strands. Increase in FWHM has been observed for the creep and fleet leader specimens compared to the virgin strands. Changes in the Raman spectra may result from redistributing loads within the material due to the disruption of hydrogen bonding between crystallites or defects in the crystallites from aging the Kevlar strands. Peak shifting has not been observed to date. Analysis is ongoing. Stress measurements may provide a tool in the short term...|$|R
