40|$|Introduction: New Zealand’s {{bilateral}} relationship with South Korea {{is founded on}} strong political, economic and security links that {{date back to the}} Korean War. New Zealand responded to the United Nations Security Council’s call for members of the United Nations to assist South Korea in 1950 with a substantial commitment of Defence personnel that on a per capita basis exceeded that, for example, of Australia. Not only did this response signal New Zealand’s support for the United Nations, it was also to realise the objective of securing a security commitment from the United States in the event of further aggression from Japan. That commitment was embodied in the ANZUS Treaty signed in June 1951. How times have changed. New Zealand has a wide-ranging relationship with Japan that, whaling apart, is close and friendly. New Zealand did not recognise the People’s Republic of China {{at the time of the}} Korean War, but our relationship has rapidly developed to the point where China is now vital to our economic prosperity. We are no longer a full alliance partner of the United States, although the signature in June 2012 of the Washington Declaration on Defence Cooperation between the United States and New Zealand will undoubtedly have <b>created</b> <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> Washington, and in some other capitals, of support from New Zealand, particularly in respect of Asia/Pacific security challenges. This paper examines recent developments on the Korean Peninsula, including the responses of China and the United States, and considers the implications for New Zealand. It then proposes a way ahead. But before doing so it provides some background comment on the Armistice, the United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission known as UNCMAC, and the Six Party Talks...|$|R
40|$|When a {{child is}} hospitalized, it is usually {{more than one person}} who needs {{attention}} – i. e. the child as well as its parents. The emergency ward environment and surgery rooms are unfamiliar and the parents feel anxious, insecure and uncertain about how to act. They are expected to participate in the child’s care, cope with their own anxiety and simultaneously convey a sense of security and stability to the child. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate parents' experiences related to this situation. Data was collected by interviewing thirteen consecutively sampled parents. Qualitative content analysis showed that parents' previous experiences <b>created</b> <b>expectations,</b> which <b>in</b> turn influenced their perceptions of the present episode. Participation was perceived as an offer and/or a requirement from parents as well as from the staff. For parents, it sometimes meant an additional effort since it demanded their involvement in caring for the child/in the child’s care. They experienced that their presence could be a threat as well as an asset for the hospital staff. The parents described that the level of accessibility, participation, relief, shared responsibility and adequate information determined the level of perceived security and safety toward medicine and hospital staff.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} perceptual effects of single-microphone noise {{reduction}} in hearing aids. Twenty subjects with moderate {{sensorineural hearing loss}} listened to speech in babble noise processed via noise reduction from three different linearly fitted hearing aids. Subjects performed (a) speech-intelligibility tests, (b) listening-effort ratings, and (c) paired-comparison ratings on noise annoyance, speech naturalness, and overall preference. The perceptual effects of noise reduction differ between hearing aids. The results agree well with those of normal-hearing listeners in a previous study. None of the noise-reduction algorithms improved speech intelligibility, but all reduced the annoyance of noise. The noise reduction that scored best with respect to noise annoyance and preference had the worst intelligibility scores. The trade-off between intelligibility and listening comfort shows that preference measurements might be useful in addition to intelligibility measurements {{in the selection of}} noise reduction.

Although there is a clear tension between the two quotations, both are nonetheless true. On the one hand, the law must offer certainty and constancy so that individuals can direct their actions accordingly. For this purpose laws are established and binding decisions are taken, and since these laws and decisions <b>create</b> legitimate <b>expectations</b> <b>in</b> the minds of individuals they cannot arbitrarily be amended or repealed later on. On the other hand, the law cannot be static because it has to give shape to a concept such as justice in a rapidly changing society. Our society expects government to pursue an ambitious environmental policy, to take far-reaching measures to combat unemployment, and to ensure that the EMU criteria are fulfilled. These wishes require continuous adjustment of the law...|$|R

The bentonite clays were treated with sodium carbonate at concentrations of 75, 100, 125, 150 and 175 mEq/ 100 g of dry clay, to transform them from polycationic to sodium form. For the technological characterization, drilling fluids were prepared according to the standards of Petrobras.

Although substantial {{variation in the}} implementation of these practices exists, it is always the aim to improve teaching efficiency by creating homogeneous groups of students in terms of capabilities and performances as well as expected pathways. If students’ expected pathways (university, graduate school, or working) are in line with the goals of tracking, one might presume that these expectations are rather homogeneous within tracks and heterogeneous between tracks. In Flanders (the northern region of Belgium), the educational system consists of four tracks. Many students start out in the most prestigious, academic track. If they fail to gain the necessary credentials, they move to the less esteemed technical and vocational tracks. Therefore, the educational system has been called a 'cascade system'.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to expand the understanding of the undergraduate mechanical engineering experience as it relates to having a formal mentoring program. To assess this relationship, qualitative analysis was used to derive themes and define variables that contribute {{to the success of the}} student. Using a 17 -item Likert survey, the undergraduate mechanical engineering student population was assessed based on their attitudes and impressions on each of the variables. Using the data acquired from this survey, descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized to identify significant relationships between the formal mentoring groups, Center for Women in Technology (CWIT), Meyerhoff Scholars and non-programmed, and the variables. The data show that factors other than academics play a role in a student`s decision to be involved in mechanical engineering. It is evident that the formal mentoring group has encouraged different attitudes in their students in comparison to non-programmed students. Meryerhoff students are significantly more motivated by mentor influences than CWIT and non-programmed. Non-programmed students feel significantly less inclusive and are more motivated by parent influence. Both the formal mentoring programs have a higher perception of the importance of professional and interpersonal skills in comparison to non-programmed students.

Many observers have predicted an uptake of combined PV/battery units which could ultimately disconnect from the grid and lead to autonomous homes or micro-grids. However, most of the comments in social media, blogs or press articles lack proper cost evaluation and realistic simulations. We aim to bridge this gap by simulating self-consumption in various EU countries, for various household profiles, with or without battery. Results indicate that (1) self-consumption is a non-linear, almost asymptotic function of PV and battery sizes. Achieving 100 % self-consumption (i. e. allowing for full off-grid operation) is not realistic for the studied countries without excessively oversizing the PV system and/or the battery; (2) although falling fast, the cost of domestic Li-Ion storage is most likely still too high for a large-scale market uptake in Europe; (3) home battery profitability and future uptake depend mainly on the indirect subsidies for self-consumption provided by the structure of retail prices; (4) the self-sufficiency rate varies widely between households. For a given household, the volume of self-consumption cannot be predicted in a deterministic way. Along with these results, this study also provides a database of synthetic household profiles, a simulation tool for the prediction of self-consumption and a method for the optimal sizing of such systems...|$|R
