5|$|In January and February 1943, {{while under}} the overall command of Major Pavle Đurišić, Captain Lukačević and his Chetniks participated in several massacres of the Muslim {{population}} of Bosnia, Herzegovina and the Sandžak. Immediately after this, Lukačević and his Chetniks participated {{in one of the}} largest Axis anti-Partisan operations of the war, Case White, where they fought alongside Italian, German and Croatian (NDH) troops. The following November, Lukačević concluded a formal <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Germans and participated in a further anti-Partisan offensive, Operation Kugelblitz.|$|E
5|$|In September, it {{was placed}} {{under the command of}} the newly formed XV Mountain Corps led by Lüters. That month, the {{division}} concluded a <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreement</b> with the 260-strong Chetnik detachment of Mane Rokvić, who was in control of an area which included parts of both western Bosnia and Lika. The division utilised the Chetniks to protect railway lines and key industries in their area, as well as for scouting against the Partisans and attacks on the rear of Partisan formations. Desertions worsened particularly after the capitulation of Italy in early September 1943. For example, during October 1943, 334 men deserted from the division. It handled thousands of Italian prisoners {{in the aftermath of the}} surrender, feeding them and marching them under guard towards the Reich.|$|E

25|$|Hutchison {{increasingly}} {{concentrated on}} defence {{issues in the}} late 1950s, and also urged more investment in atomic research. He pressed in December 1957 for the United Kingdom to join the European Nuclear Energy Agency. His efforts saw success in May 1958 when the Government announced that a technical <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreement</b> with Euratom would be negotiated. The agreement was signed in February 1959.

25|$|In 1947, AB Atomenergi (AE) {{was founded}} under {{initiative}} of the Atom Committee {{with the goal of}} building experimental reactors and developing methods to extract uranium from low-grade Swedish deposits for both civilian and military needs. Since 1948, a division of functions occurred between FOA and AB Atomenergi. AE focused on developing methods to separate plutonium from uranium and fission products (reprocessing) in order to allow the plutonium to be used as fuel in the reactors (plutonium recycling). This procedure would enable a more efficient use of the natural uranium. While FOA's uranium activities were carried out, a <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreement</b> was drawn up (with final approval by the Government in 1950) to make sure that military research could benefit from the recently launched civilian nuclear activities.|$|E

Rather than merge Briarcliff with Pace, the trustees attempted to reach a <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreement</b> with Bennett College, a junior women's college in nearby Millbrook which was also struggling with low enrollment. The plan did not work, however, and Briarcliff College was sold to Pace in April 1977 for $5.2 million ($ in [...] ) after both Briarcliff and Bennett entered bankruptcy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} Silja Line {{can be traced}} back to 1904 when two Finnish {{shipping}} companies, Finland Steamship Company (Finska Ångfartygs Aktiebolaget, FÅA for short) and Steamship Company Bore, started collaborating on Finland–Sweden traffic. The initial <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreement</b> was terminated in 1909, but re-established in 1910. After World War I in 1918 a new agreement was made that also included the Swedish Rederi AB Svea. Originally the <b>collaboration</b> <b>agreement</b> applied only on service between Turku and Stockholm, but was also applied to the Helsinki–Stockholm in 1928. As a precursor to the policies later adopted by Silja Line, each of the three companies ordered a near-identical ship for Helsinki–Stockholm service to coincide with the 1952 Summer Olympics, held in Helsinki. Eventually only Finland SS Co.'s [...] was ready in time for the olympics. At this time the city of Helsinki constructed the Olympia Terminal in Helsinki's South Harbour, that Silja Line's ships still use.|$|E
