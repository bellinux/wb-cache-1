Fungi are {{an important component of}} soil biota with capacity to affect pathogen inoculum levels and their disease causing potential. Very {{little is known about the}} soil fungal community structure and management effects in Australian cotton soils. We analysed surface soils from ongoing field experiments monitoring cotton performance and disease incidence in three <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>regions,</b> collected prior to 2013 planting, for the genetic diversity and abundance as influenced by soil type, environment and management practices and link it with disease incidence and suppression. Results from the 28 S LSU rRNA sequencing based analysis indicated a total of 370 fungal genera in all the cotton soils and the top 25 genera in abundance accounted for the major portion of total fungal community. There were significant differences in the composition and genetic diversity of soil fungi between the different field sites from the three <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>regions.</b> Results for diversity indices showed significantly greater diversity in the long-term crop rotation experiment at Narrabri (F 6 E) and experiments at Cowan and Goondiwindi compared to the Biofumigation and D 1 field experiments at ACRI, Narrabri. Diversity was lowest in the soils under brassica crop rotation in Biofumigation experiment. Overall, the diversity and abundance of soil fungal community varied significantly in the three <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>regions</b> indicating soil type and environmental effects.

40|$|Farmer suicides {{were first}} {{reported}} in Vidharbha, eastern Maharashtra, a prominent <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>region</b> in India in 2005. Similar farm crises {{that came to}} light in other cotton regions and rainfed India shocked the sensibilities of the policymakers and public alike. Simultaneously, in 2002, genetically modified (GM) cotton or Bt (Baccilus Thurigenesis) cotton, produced by agro-transnational corporation Monsanto, was introduced and adopted widely in Vidharbha and India's cotton belt. Even before their official release, “illegal” GM seeds were found growing in the central-western state of Gujarat, another prominent <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>region</b> in 1998. GM cotton and GM crops are proposed to increase agricultural productivity and usher in a “second Green Revolution” or Gene Revolution in Indian agriculture. The 1960 s Green Revolution is widely {{considered to be an}} important milestone in changing the face of Indian agriculture as it helped raise agricultural yields, increased agricultural incomes, and saved India from a food crisis. The Gene Revolution is posited to be that imperative sequel to the 1960 s Green Revolution that will transform the state of agriculture in rainfed areas. What were the effects of the Green Revolution in Vidharbha and in rainfed areas of India? What impacts does the introduction of GM cotton have on farmers‟ livelihoods in Vidharbha? Will the use of GM cotton lead to positive gains in Vidharbha just as the use of Green Revolution technology did in irrigated areas of the country? In reality, the Green Revolution failed to raise the incomes of farmers in Vidharbha and in rainfed areas of India. By comparing the process of gains that farmers made during the Green Revolution with the Gene Revolution, this dissertation argues that first compared to the winners of the Green Revolution, the economic and ecological capabilities of cotton farmers adopting GM crops in Vidharbha are poor. Second, a supportive ―policy and institutional‖ infrastructure does not exist for the adoption of GM technology in Vidharbha. Such state support allowed the agricultural production process to become safe and profitable only for rich and middle class farmers during the Green Revolution. Third, post trade liberalization, the increasing exposure of the domestic economy to trends in the international trade of raw cotton and textiles, can affect cotton farmers‘ income negatively. As a consequence, GM cotton or the Gene Revolution will be unable to alleviate the crisis condition of cotton farmers. Government intervention is needed to provide cheaper or alternative technologies, such as introducing public sector Bt cotton, Integrated Pest Management or organic farming practices, as well as encouraging food farming and creating opportunities for non-farm employment...|$|E

With the conversion from hand picking to mechanical harvesting in China, plant densities are increased, and more compact plants are required, leading {{to the need to}} reconsider MC application schedules. Experiments were carried out in 2009 and 2010 to identify optimal use schedules of MC at four plant densities: 3. 0, 4. 5, 6. 0 and 7. 5 plants m- 2. Eleven MC schedules were compared with respect to their effect on cotton yield and quality. Application of MC at squaring stage or at both squaring and flowering stages significantly improved cotton quality parameters: fiber length (by 1. 7 %) and fiber strength (by 2. 8 %) at all tested plant densities without significant loss of yields. However, average lint yield of all MC treatments over all densities and years was decreased by 4. 6 % due to a decrease in boll density and lint percentage which was only partly offset by an increase in boll weight. No effects on yield were also observed if MC applications were started at flowering stage, but such later starting application schedules only slightly improved fiber quality. The results suggest that use of MC at squaring or at both squaring and flowering stages is a viable strategy to improve cotton architecture, productivity and quality at high plant density in mechanized cotton production in the Yellow River <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>region</b> in China...|$|E
40|$|Several boll weevils, Anthonomus grandis Boheman, were {{captured}} in pheromone traps in 2004 near Tlahualilo, Durango, Mexico, {{an area where}} none had been reported for ≈ 10 yr. It is possible that they were from an endemic population normally too low in numbers to be detected but that increased in response to more favorable rainfall conditions in 2004. Alternatively, they may represent an influx of migrants or the immediate descendents of migrants. To identify the most likely origin of the boll weevils captured in this area, we characterized microsatellite variation of the Tlahualilo weevils and compared it with the variation from three other populations in northern Mexico and from one in southern Texas. Measures of gene flow and individual assignment tests suggest that the boll weevils captured near Tlahualilo were primarily from an endemic low-level population, but that this area also is receiving immigrants from a <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>region</b> ≈ 200 km to the north, near Rosales, Chihuahua, which is currently under a boll weevil eradication program. Similarly, Rosales is receiving immigrants from Tlahualilo. This study shows that microsatellite markers and population assignment techniques will be practical tools for determining the most likely origins of boll weevils reintroduced to eradication zones in the United States and Mexico. Population assignment strategies based on genetic markers hold promise for replacing conventional, but spatially constrained, mark-recapture studies of insect dispersal.

To evaluate the efficacy of closed systems in preventing worker exposure in the developing world, a cross sectional study was conducted at rural crop dusting airports in the <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>region</b> of Nicaragua. Worker exposure was evaluated by measuring the activity of erythrocyte cholinesterase in the field with a new design battery operated colorimeter. The 10 mixer loaders at four airstrips with closed systems were compared with the 16 mixer loaders at four airstrips where pesticides were hand poured. Paradoxically, cholinesterase activity was 1. 1 IU/ml blood (95 % Cl 0. 49 - 1. 8) lower (inhibited) among workers in airstrips with closed systems than among workers hand pouring insecticides, after adjusting for weight of organophosphates sprayed in the past 14 days, and for prior training in safe use of pesticides. Mixer loaders with prior training had cholinesterase activity 0. 83 IU (95 % Cl 0. 30 - 1. 4) higher than untrained workers, and the weight of organophosphates sprayed was also a statistically significant predictor in the model. Unfortunately, management viewed the closed systems primarily as a production tool, rather than as a way to protect workers. Airstrips with closed systems were able to apply an average of 3250 lb organophosphates per worker in the 14 days before the survey compared with 849 lb per worker in airstrips without closed systems. Only three of 10 mixer-loaders at airstrips with closed systems had received formal training in safer use of pesticides.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{phosphorus}} nutrition in cotton cultivars derived from Pakistan with particular reference to phosphatase activity. Cultivars used were Qalandri, Rehmani, Reshami and TH- 3 / 83; Qalandri was used {{for most of the}} phosphatase characteristic studies, since this cultivar exhibited the highest germination percentage and seedling establishment. Investigations of soil parameters from <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>region</b> of Pakistan were also carried out. Soil pH was above 8. 0 in all sites studied. Soil organic component levels were very variable between sites and within sites at different depths. Soil potassium was found to be at levels regarded as being sufficient for sustaining plant growth at all sites. However, levels of combined nitrogen and inorganic phosphate were in the range of values which could be regarded as being limiting to plant growth. The importance of phosphatase in the mobilization of organic phosphorus was therefore apparent. Phosphomonoesterase (PMEase) activity, assayed using two substrates p- nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and 4 -methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4 -MUP), was investigated and was found associated with roots of hydroponically-grown seedlings. Staining studies indicated that the enzymes were present in the cell wall. Phosphodiesterase activity was also detected in roots, using bis-pNPP as the substrate. PMEase activity was found to have its greatest activity at pH values between 4. 0 and 6. 0 for all cultivars. In cv Qalandri the optimum pH for PMEase activity was 5. 5 and the optimum temperature was 55 C when assays were incubated over a 1 h period using pNPP or 4 -MUP as the substrate. Levels of activity were higher using pNPP than with 4 -MUP, but an absolute direct comparison could not be made since the concentrations of the individual substrates used were different. Plants grown in phosphate-limitation conditions showed enhanced PMEase activity. Enhancement of PMEase activity was associated with the levels of phosphate in the plant growth nutrient solution rather than with those in the plant itself This activity was highest in 19 -day old seedlings, under the conditions of growth employed here. A comparison between cultivars showed some differences in the level of PMEase activity and in the specific pH optimum for enzyme activity. Limitation of combined nitrogen to seedling also resulted m enhanced PMEase even when plants were under phosphate-sufficient conditions. A similar effect of potassium-limitation was also found and this was associated with reduced uptake of phosphate into the seedlings. No effect of magnesium-limitation on PMEase activity was found. A comparison was also made with other plants; cotton. Primula farinosa, rice, wheat and algae. All had associated phosphatase activity, with cotton showing significantly higher root acid phosphatase activity than the other higher plant species.

This was accomplished by developing a single-pest, dual-toxin biological model simulating bollworm resistance to the Bt toxin and synthetic pyrethroids, followed by formulating profit functions for Bt and non-Bt cotton for a representative producer in each region. Profits received in subsequent periods were considered in the regulatory model in order to choose a refuge constraint (static problem) or a sequence of refuge policies (dynamic problem) for each region that maximize discounted profits received over 15 years, subject to various economic and biological constraints. Dynamic solutions for the regulatory problem were derived for each region using the Bellman equation. Results suggested that South Indian farmers {{do not need to}} grow a refuge, but farmers in the North and Central regions do. Results also suggested that planting sprayed refugia might be more profitable than planting unsprayed refugia. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the refuge requirements were sensitive to the initial Bt resistance level, relative proportion of CBWs in natural refuges, and proportions of heterozygous and homozygous fitnesses in all of the three regions.

40|$|According {{to several}} {{scientific}} reports, climate change {{will have an}} impact on water provision and thus agriculture, which depends on soil moisture for plant survival. India is a country that is heavily dependent on agriculture as a source of income. One of the country’s future challenges is securing water for irrigation. Cotton in India is an important cash crop which is grown under high evapotranspirative demand, using about 15 % of the national water resources, making the crop vulnerable to changes in water availability. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the resilience of cotton production with regards to water availability and pesticide use in Punjab and Andhra Pradesh. Three aspects of resilience: latitude, resistance and precariousness has been used to analyse three variables, precipitation, irrigation and pesticide in order to understand how these <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> systems are going to be affected by climate change. By bringing together existing data from several scientific reports and governmental websites, assumptions could be made whether these systems are resilient or if they are reaching a threshold. The results show that the <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>regions</b> of Punjab are highly vulnerable when it comes to water provision in the region and that they might be reaching a threshold. Changes in climate are predicted to affect precipitation and temperature in the area, which in time might ultimately affect water resources in the region. Groundwater depletion and water logging are already prevailing problems in the area where almost all cotton production is irrigated. Cotton farmers in Andhra Pradesh are struggling with pest infestation which induces them to overconsume pesticides, affecting not only water quality in the area, but also farmers’ livelihood. It is likely that climate change will not minimize the outbreaks; on the contrary it might benefit some pests, which might increase the consumption of pesticide in the region. Coastal districts are more exposed to extreme weather which can harm cotton cultivation...|$|R

To understand the implications of climate change on cotton production in India, cotton production to the different scenarios (A 2, B 2 and A 1 B) of future climate was simulated using the simulation model Infocrop-cotton. The GCM projections showed a nearly 3. 95, 3. 20 and 1. 85 °C rise in mean temperature of <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>regions</b> of India for the A 2, B 2 and A 1 B scenarios, respectively. Simulation results using the Infocrop-cotton model indicated that seed cotton yield declined by 477 kg ha− 1 for the A 2 scenario and by 268 kg ha− 1 for the B 2 scenario; while it was non-significant for the A 1 B scenario. However, it became non-significant under elevated [CO 2] levels across all the scenarios. The yield decline was higher in the northern zone over the southern zone. The impact of climate change on rainfed cotton which covers more than 60 % of the country’s total cotton production area (mostly in the central zone) and {{is dependent on the}} monsoons is likely to be minimum, possibly on account of marginal increase in rainfall levels. Results of this assessment suggest that productivity in northern India may marginally decline; while in central and southern India, productivity may either remain the same or increase. At the national level, therefore, cotton production is unlikely to change with climate change. Adaptive measures such as changes in planting time and more responsive cultivars may further boost cotton production in India...|$|R

However, the involvement of vsiRNAs during infection of the Geminiviridae family member cotton leaf curl virus (CLCuD), which causes significant economic losses in <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>regions,</b> remains largely uncharacterized. Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV) associated with a betasatellite called Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB) is a major constraint to cotton production in South Asia and is now established in Southern China. In this study, we obtained the profiles of vsiRNAs from CLCuMV and CLCuMB in infected upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plants by deep sequencing. Our data showed that vsiRNA that were derived almost equally from sense and antisense CLCuD DNA strands accumulated preferentially as 21 - and 22 -nucleotide (nt) small RNA population and had a cytosine bias at the 5 ’-terminus. Polarity distribution revealed that vsiRNAs were almost continuously present along the CLCuD genome and hotspots of sense and antisense strands were mainly distributed in the Rep proteins region of CLCuMuV and in the C 1 protein of CLCuMuB. In addition, hundreds of host transcripts targeted by vsiRNAs were predicted, many of which encode transcription factors associated with biotic and abiotic stresses. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of selected potential vsiRNA targets showed that some targets were significantly down-regulated in CLCuD-infected cotton plants. We also verified the potential function of vsiRNA targets that {{may be involved in}} CLCuD infection by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and 5 ’-rapid amplification of cDNA end (5 ’-RACE). Here, we provide the first report on vsiRNAs responses to CLCuD infection in cotton...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) canopy growth is well documented, {{but there have}} been few studies on root growth and root distribution patterns. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how cotton root growth at different soil depths responded to temperature during the early growing stages, so that these responses could be incorporated into plant growth models used to manage cotton production. In addition, the effect of aldicarb, a systemic insecticide widely used in the <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>regions,</b> on root growth was also evaluated. Cotton plants (cv. DES- 119) were grown in outdoor sunlit soil-plant-atmosphere-research units at four day/night temperatures (20 / 12, 30 / 22, 35 / 27, 40 / 32 ℃). Aldicarb was applied to soil at sowing at 0. 84 kg ha^ and at initial flower bud formation at 2. 24 kg ha^. Root number, length, and distribution in various soil depths were determined weekly during a 56 day experimental period. Plants grown at 30 / 22 ℃ produced more growing roots than those grown at either 20 / 12 ℃ or 40 / 32 ℃ at the end of the experiment. Root length at 30 / 22 and 35 / 27 ℃ was also 20 % greater than that at 40 / 32 ℃. Total root dry weight at 30 / 22 ℃ was 1. 5 and 5 times as much as those at 40 / 32 and 20 / 12 ℃, respectively. Increases in day/night temperatures resulted in increases in rooting depth and the percentages of root distribution in the deeper soil depths. Aldicarb not only increased total root dry weight for all four temperatures, but also altered root distribution in favor of the 20 - 40 and > 40 cm soil depths over the top 20 cm layer. Our results showed that the optimum range of temperature for cotton root growth is 30 / 22 to 35 / 27 ℃, and that both high temperatures and aldicarb altered the distribution of roots, favoring deeper root systems under optimum water and nutrient conditions...|$|R
40|$|Three {{distinct}} plant viruses, {{transmitted by}} the tobacco whitefly Bemisia tabaci Genn., {{were associated with}} diseased food or fiber crops grown in the southwestern deserts of Arizona. The cotton leaf crumple virus (CLCV), thought to affect only cotton Gossypium (L.) spp., is now known to infect other malvaceous plants {{and members of the}} Convolvulaceae and Leguminosae. Results of an experimental host range study suggest that potential virus-vector reservoirs may exist in <b>cotton</b> <b>growing</b> <b>regions</b> which include both weeds and cultivated plants. Geminivirus-like (GVL) particles of ∼ 18 x 30 nm were isolated for the first time from CLCV-infected bean, Phaseolus vulgaris (L.), 'Red Kidney', a plant which was a better purification host than cotton. Studies of CLCV-vector relationships indicated that the acquisition- and inoculation-access times, latent period and length of retention by whitefly vectors were {{similar to those of the}} original isolate reported in California in 1954. When growth chamber temperatures of 26, 32, and 37 C were used in virus-vector studies, optimal acquisition and transmission occurred at 32 C while temperatures of 37 C were lethal to whitefly adults. Two additional virus-like agents were isolated from single and mixed infections of lettuce or melons, respectively. The virus-like agent from lettuce infected primarily members of the Chenopodiaceae, Compositae and Cucurbitaceae, and was whitefly but not mechanically transmissible. Long flexuous closterovirus-like rods of ∼ 10 x 1400 - 2000 nm were visualized in extracts prepared from plants inoculated with the lettuce isolate. The isolate was similar to the lettuce infectious yellow virus (LIYV) based upon host range, transmission characteristics and unique particle morphology. Both long flexuous rods like those associated with the lettuce isolate and GVL particles of 18 x 30 nm were associated with diseased melons. The host range of the GVL agent was confined to the Cucurbitaceae and Leguminosae and the agent was separated from the mixed infection by mechanical transmission to a non-LIYV host. The GVL-agent was distinct from previously described cucurbit viruses including the squash leaf curl virus, based upon host range and transmission characteristics and was tentatively designated as the watermelon curly mottle virus (WCMV) ...|$|R

40|$|Both {{large and}} small scale migrations of Helicoverpa armigera Hübner in Australia were {{investigated}} using AMOVA analysis and genetic assignment tests. Five microsatellite loci were screened across 3142 individuals from 16 localities in eight major <b>cotton</b> and grain <b>growing</b> <b>regions</b> within Australia, over a 38 -month period (November 1999 to January 2003). From November 1999 to March 2001 relatively low levels of migration were characterized between <b>growing</b> <b>regions.</b> Substantially higher than average gene-flow rates and limited differentiation between cropping regions characterized the period from April 2001 to March 2002. A reduced migration rate in the year from April 2002 to March 2003 resulted in significant genetic structuring between cropping regions. This differentiation was established within two or three generations. Genetic drift alone is unlikely to drive genetic differentiation over such {{a small number of}} generations, unless it is accompanied by extreme bottlenecks and/or selection. Helicoverpa armigera in Australia demonstrated isolation by distance, so immigration into cropping regions is more likely to come from nearby regions than from afar. This effect was most pronounced in years with limited migration. However, there is evidence of long distance dispersal events in periods of high migration (April 2001 –March 2002). The implications of highly variable migration patterns for resistance management are considered. K. D. Scott, K. S. Wilkinson, N. Lawrence, C. L. Lange, L. J. Scott, M. A. Merritt, A. J. Lowe and G.
