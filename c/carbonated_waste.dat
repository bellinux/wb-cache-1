One method is to cover plant leaves by fibrous membrane made of waste paper. Fine fiber coating was made by spraying the starch glue and then dusting the fine paper fibers on the plant leaves. The result showed that the fibrous membrane could reduce the transpiration of plants without choking stomata. The test results suggested the possibility to use such a method {{for the survival of}} the transplanted young seedlings of eucalyptus in a critical dry soil condition. Another method is to use the <b>carbonated</b> <b>waste</b> biomass like straw, tea leaves and coffee ground as moisture holding materials in the soils. Waste cotton wool was added as a soil moisture holding material which farmers could produce by themselves and use without carbonating process. Results of the pF measurements showed that these materials had high moisture holding capacities. Positive effect of the carbonated tea leaves and coffee ground as well as cotton on the plant growth was observed while conducting a series of cropping tests in a dry greenhouse. Outdoo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study focused}} on the removal of heavy metals from a {{synthetic}} acid mine water by using continuous column experiments and Phosphate <b>carbonated</b> <b>Wastes</b> as alkaline drains. The passive treatment system targeted aims in neutralizing the acid mine drainage (AMD) containing high concentrations of dissolved iron and other metals. In Morocco, the phosphate mine industry produces huge quantities of overburden waste rocks (named herein PLW) which contain significant quantities of carbonates (calcite (46 wt %) and dolomite (16 wt %). The column experiments were set-up in laboratory and the testing were run under anoxic and oxic conditions by using a hydraulic retention time was 15 hours. The inflow to the treatment system ranged 5. 5 mL/min, with acidic pHs of around 3, concentrations of dissolved Fe, Mn, Al, Ca, Zn and Cu were 600, 20, 166, 350, 15 and 23 mg/L respectively, containing also some traces of Co, Cr and Ni. The test results showed that pH became neutral and {{a significant decrease in}} terms of metal concentrations; in particular for Fe (600 to 120 mg/L), Al (160 to 1. 7 mg/L) and Cu (23 to 0. 002 mg/L) ...|$|R
40|$|Contradictory {{leaching}} {{results from}} <b>carbonated</b> cement-bound <b>wastes</b> {{have been reported}} in various investigations. However, the degree of carbonation of the examined samples is rarely considered as an important parameter in leaching results. This article focuses on the effect of progressive carbonation on leaching properties of cement-bound waste (bottom ash or flue gas cleaning residue), including uncarbonated, partially carbonated, and almost completely carbonated samples. Leaching is investigated after carbonation by means of semi-dynamic leaching of monoliths, supported by batch solubility and release measurements on particle-size reduced material. For partially carbonated samples, leaching of metals is in most cases less than observed from uncarbonated samples, resulting from the conversion of hydroxides to carbonates. For completely carbonated samples, increased leaching of most metals was observed in comparison to partially carbonated samples, resulting from leachate induced transformation of carbonate into more soluble bicarbonate speciation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of industrial waste presents major logistical, financial and environmental issues. Technologies that {{can reduce the}} hazardous properties of wastes are urgently required. In the present work, a number of industrial wastes arising from the cement, metallurgical, paper, waste disposal and energy industries were treated with accelerated carbonation. In this process carbonation was effected by exposing the waste to pure carbon dioxide gas. The paper and cement wastes chemically combined with up to 25 % by weight of gas. The reactivity of the wastes to carbon dioxide was controlled by their constituent minerals, and not by their elemental composition, as previously postulated. Similarly, microstructural alteration upon carbonation was primarily influenced by mineralogy. Many of the thermal wastes tested were classified as hazardous, based upon regulated metal content and pH. Treatment by accelerated carbonation reduced the leaching of certain metals, aiding the {{disposal of}} many as stable non-reactive wastes. Significant volumes of carbon dioxide were sequestrated into the accelerated <b>carbonated</b> treated <b>wastes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cementitious {{materials}} containing high {{proportions of}} slag and fly ash {{have been tested}} for suitability to immobilize simulated alkaline and <b>carbonated</b> off-gas <b>waste</b> solutions after vitrification of low- level tank wastes stored at Hanford. To assess their performance, long-term durability was assessed by measuring stability of compressive strength and weight during leaching and exposure to sulfate and carbonate solutions. The important parameter controlling the durability is pore structure, because it affects both compressive strength and susceptibility to different kinds of chemical attack. Impedance spectroscopy was utilized to assess the connectivity of the pore system at early ages. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and SEM were utilized to assess development of porosity at later ages. Phase alterations in the matrix exposed to aging and leaching in different media were followed using XRD. Mixtures were resistant to deterioration during immersion in solutions containing high concentrations of sulfate or carbonate ions. Mixtures were also resistant to leaching. These {{results are consistent with}} microstructural observations, which showed development of a finer pore structure and reduction in diffusivity over days or months of hydration...|$|R

Importava assim, encontrar uma solugiio de viabilizagtio para o aproveitamento destes residuos, tanto para OS ja produzidos como para os que venham a ser produzidos, ja que se verifica um acentuado crescimento no sector da transformagtio das rochas ornamentais, o que sera inevitavelmente acompanhado por urn {{increment}} 0 na produgZo de residuos. De entre uma serie de possiveis aplicagSes e, tendo em considerag 80 a natureza e o quantitativo destes residuos, a industria dos cimentos foi a que se revelou mais atractiva, quer devido a natureza das materias-primas que utiliza (geralmente calcftrios e argilas ou calcirios margosos), quer pela enorme capacidade de absorver no seu process 0 de fabricaggo grandes volumes de materias-primas sem necessitarem de tratamentos complexos, sendo, entre todas as industrias, a que consome maiores quantidades de matkrias-primas. Por outro lado, o aumento no consumo de cimento que se tem verificado nos ultimos anos, requerendo cada vez maiores volumes de materias-primas, acarreta a destruig 80 de recursos minerais, afigurando-se tambem importante que se promova a poupanga deste recursos, ja que s%o ioimitados e n 8 o renovaveis. A tendkncia seri, consequentemente, a utilizagiio de subprodutos e de residuos de outras industrias, como mat 6 rias-primas para a produgtio de cimento, conduzindo a que o residuo de uma indtistria se tome materia-prima de outra. Neste contexto, importava averiguar da possibilidade de produg 80 de clinquer de cimento Portland, utilizando como materias-primas as lamas de natureza carbonatada e silicatada, resultantes dos processos de transformag 80 de rochas ornamentais. 0 s resultados das investigag 6 es realizadas confirmaram essa possibilidade. In Pkro Pinheiro's region stands the biggest Portuguese concentration of ornamental rocks transformation plants. The waste muds that result fiom the transformation processes {{are at the}} origin of serious environmental problems, that result 50 m their uncontrolled and random disposal in terrains and abandomned quarries. Therefore, it's of the upmost importance {{to find a solution}} that makes these residues usable. The ones that had been already produced and those that are to be produced. This need is enhanced in face of the occuring accentuated growth in the sector of ornamental rocks transformation, that will inevitably be accompaigned by an increase in the residues production. Of a series of possible applications, and taking into consideration the nature and the quantity of these residues, the cement industry was the one to reveal itself as being the most attractive. This was a consequence of, in one hand, the nature of the raw materials it uses (usualy limestones and shales or marly limestones), on the other hand, the enourmous capacity to absorb in its fabrication process, big volumes of raw materials without the need for complex treatments. Within all the industries that could use these wastes the cement industry is the one that consumes larger amounts of raw materials. On the other hand, the increase in cement consumption that is being verified, requires increasing volumes of raw materials that, implies the destruction of natural resources. This fact enhances the importance of promoting the maintainance of these resources, that are limited and unrenewable, through input alternatives. The tendency, therefore, will be the usage of sub-products and of residues of other industries, that can function as raw materials in the production of cement, transforming one industry residue into other industry raw material. In this context, it was important to check the possibility of Portland clinker cement production, with the usage, as raw materials, of the <b>carbonated</b> and silicated <b>waste</b> muds, that are produced as a result from the transformation process of ornamental rocks.
