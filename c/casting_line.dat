25|$|Unlike other casting methods, {{fly fishing}} {{can be thought}} of as a method of <b>casting</b> <b>line</b> rather than lure. Non-flyfishing methods rely on a lure's weight to pull line from the reel during the forward motion of a cast. By design, a fly is too light to be cast, and thus simply follows the unfurling of a {{properly}} cast fly line, which is heavier and tapered and therefore more castable than lines used in other types of fishing.|$|E

6000|$|I saw a trout rise, {{with a huge}} sullen circle {{dimpling}} round him, cast over him, raised him, {{and missed}} him. The water was perfectly still, and the [...] "plop" [...] made by these fish was very exciting and tantalising. The next that rose took the alder, and, of course, ran right into the broad band of lilies. I tried all the dodges I could think of, and all that Mr. Halford suggests. I dragged at him hard. I gave him line. I sat down and endeavoured to disengage my thoughts, but I never {{got a glimpse of}} him, and finally had to wade as far in as I dared, and save as much of the <b>casting</b> <b>line</b> as I could; it was very little.|$|E
6000|$|The {{story of}} the {{following}} adventure--this deplorable confession, one may say--will not have been written in vain if it impresses on young minds the supreme necessity of carefulness about details. Let the [...] "casual" [...] and regardless who read it--the gatless, {{as they say in}} Suffolk--ponder the lesson which it teaches: a lesson which no amount of bitter experience has ever impressed on the unprincipled narrator. Never do anything carelessly whether in fishing or in golf, and carry this important maxim even into the most serious affairs of life. Many a battle has been lost, no doubt, by lack of ammunition, or by plenty of ammunition which did not happen to suit the guns; and many a salmon has been lost, ay, and many a trout, for want of carefulness, and through a culpable inattention to the soundness of your gut, and tackle generally. What fiend is it that prompts a man just to try a hopeless cast, in a low water, without testing his tackle? As sure as you do that, up comes the fish, and with his first dash breaks your <b>casting</b> <b>line,</b> and leaves you lamenting. This doctrine I preach, being my own [...] "awful example." [...] "Bad and careless little boy," [...] my worthy master used to say at school; and he would have provoked a smile in other circumstances. But Mr. Trotter, of the Edinburgh Academy, had something about him (he usually carried it in the tail-pocket of his coat) which inspired respect and discouraged ribaldry. Would that I had listened to Mr. Trotter; would that I had corrected, in early life, the happy-go-lucky disposition to scatter my Greek accents, as it were, with a pepper-caster, to fish with worn tackle, and, generally, to make free with the responsibilities of life and literature. It is too late to amend, but others may learn wisdom from this spectacle of deserved misfortune and absolute discomfiture.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's him," [...] cried {{a man who}} was trouting on the {{opposite}} bank. Doubtless it was [...] "him," [...] but he had not touched the hook. I believe the correct thing would have been to wait for half an hour, and then try the fish with a smaller fly. But I had no smaller fly, no other fly at all. I stepped back a few paces, and fished down again. In Major Traherne's work I have read that the heart leaps, or stands still, or otherwise betrays an uncomfortable interest, when one casts for the second time over a salmon which has risen. I cannot honestly say that I suffered from this tumultuous emotion. [...] "He will not come again," [...] I said, when there was a long heavy drag at the line, followed by a shrieking of the reel, as in Mr. William Black's novels. Let it be confessed that the first hooking of a salmon is an excitement unparalleled in trout-fishing. There have been anglers who, when the salmon was once on, handed him over to the gillie to play and land. One would like to act as gillie to those lordly amateurs. My own fish rushed down stream, where the big tree stands. I had no hope of landing him if he took that course, because one could neither pass the rod under the boughs, nor wade out beyond them. But he soon came back, while one took in line, and discussed his probable size with the trout-fisher opposite. His size, indeed! Nobody knows what it was, for when he had come up to the point whence he had started, he began a policy of violent short tugs--not [...] "jiggering," [...] as it is called, but plunging with all his weight on the line. I had clean forgotten the slimness of the tackle, and, as he was clearly well hooked, held him perhaps too hard. Only a very raw beginner likes to take hours over landing a fish. Perhaps I held him too tight: at all events, after a furious plunge, back came the line; the <b>casting</b> <b>line</b> had snapped at the top link.|$|E

India signaled interest in the T-90 in response to Pakistan's acquisition of 320 Ukrainian T-84 tanks, which was an intuitive decision considering India held rights to fully manufacture the T-72M1 in Avadi, with production being easily adapted to assemble the T-90.|$|E

For example, the double-deck bus shown above has its <b>casting</b> <b>line,</b> for its two halves, right down {{the centre of the}} roof. Also, most earlier Lone Stars have simpler bumper, grille and body detail than Corgi or Dinky. The later Impy series, however, outdid Matchbox by a long shot.|$|E
50|$|Brian's {{overlooked}} {{and neglected}} teenage son Dylan returns to Quahog. While Dylan tries {{to reconnect with}} his father, Brian tries to distance himself and ignore him. However, when he learns that Dylan is a now a cast member in a new Disney Channel television series, he — under the ruse of bonding — uses Dylan's connections to secure a job on the series' writing staff to further his career prospects. However, rather than work under age-appropriate guidelines, Brian tries to adapt the writing to include more mature content; because the material does not fit the network, Brian is fired by a producer. Furthermore, a disillusioned Dylan realizes that Brian {{is not interested in}} bonding but is merely using him for his own selfish ambitions, and tells him that he never wants to see him again. When Stewie sees Brian getting drunk out of depression, Brian realizes how selfish he has been and how he never realized that he had the chance to have Dylan back into his life again, but he pushed it aside. Stewie decides to help him apologize to Dylan. On the first try Brian gets beaten up after trying to sneak past security. However, right when they are about to leave, Stewie sees a <b>casting</b> <b>line</b> and successfully tries out for Dylan's show under one of his aliases. While recording, Stewie breaks character and explains to Dylan that Brian wants to apologize to him and become a true father to him.

A mathematical formulation for scheduling jobs to minimize the total setup time while achieving workload balance between the production lines is presented. Since the casting scheduling problem is an NP-hard problem, even with only one <b>casting</b> <b>line,</b> a four-step algorithm to find good solutions in a reasonable amount of time is proposed. In this process, a set of asymmetric travelling salesman problems is followed by a pairwise exchange heuristic. The proposed procedure is applied to a case study using real casting data...|$|E

40|$|Clamshell casting is {{a popular}} {{manufacturing}} technique where liquid is poured into a mold or cast and the cast is removed once the liquid has hardened. The term clamshell refers {{to the way in}} which the cast is removed. The two cast parts are removed by rotation through a hinge much like a clamshell. Given an object, modeled by a polyhedron P of arbitrary genus with combinatorial complexity n, we determine when the surface of the polyhedron can be decomposed into two parts s. t. each part can be rotated around a line in space without colliding with each other or intersecting the interior. Such a line is a valid <b>casting</b> <b>line.</b> Specifically, we solve the following problems: (1) Given a line l in space, we determine in O (n) time whether l is a valid <b>casting</b> <b>line</b> for P. If degeneracies are present, such as a reflex edge or face of P is perpendicular to l, the running time increases slightly to O (n log n). (2) In 4 O (n α (n)) time, where α (n) is the inverse Ackermann function, we report all combinatorially distinct valid casting lines. The running time is O (n log n) in the presence of degeneracies. All of the running times are shown to be almost optimal...|$|E
