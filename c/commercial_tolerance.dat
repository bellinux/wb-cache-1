40|$|Eddy current (EC) based {{testing and}} {{measurement}} methods {{are well known}} in non-destructive testing (NDT) world. EC sensors are extensively studied and used for material health monitoring and its property measurement. Target displacement measurement {{is one of the}} well-known applications of EC method. The main advantage of EC sensor is its working capability in harsh environment like humidity, contamination etc. It is non-contact, rugged and requires less maintenance. The range and sensitivity of target displacement is mainly determined by the probe geometry and its construction method. Also displacement measurement depends upon geometry and electromagnetic (EM) properties of the target plate. Any variation of ambient temperature alters the EM properties of the probe as well as EM properties of the target. Thus, many parameters like geometry, EM properties and temperature involved in target displacement measurement. Hence, while using EC sensor for displacement measurement, it demands careful design and measurement procedure to achieve high sensitivity and high precision with low temperature drift. To achieve these, we present the following. 1) A temperature compensation technique 2) Optimization of probe geometry and its construction method to increase the range and sensitivity 3) Selection of suitable probe measurement parameter (Z, R, X) based on target material properties 4) Making the displacement measurement less sensitive to tolerance in probe construction parameter. A temperature compensation technique for target displacement measurement, using a self-running LC oscillator has been presented. A sensing coil is energized by a Hartley oscillator. The oscillator voltage is maintained at a constant level by a closed loop feedback circuit and the average feedback current to the oscillator is measured for target displacement detection. The temperature drift of the feedback current is compensated by applying temperature compensation function (TCF) and this is verified experimentally. Cold rolled mild steel (carbon steel) is taken as a target material and the sensor is tested over a temperature range of 20 °C – 80 °C. It shows that the temperature drift is less than ± 30 ppm/°C over 3 mm target displacement. To match all the sensor modules in mass production, components selection procedure is presented. To avoid mismatch across sensors in manufacturing process, the transistor based oscillator is modified with operational trans-conductance amplifier (OTA). The same temperature compensation formula (TCF) is applied to compensate the temperature drift of feedback current and achieved intended accuracy. Geometry and construction parameters of the eddy current sensing probe is optimized for target displacement measurement using Ansoft Maxwell, electromagnetic design software. EC probe with different geometry are analyzed in search of suitable geometry for target displacement measurement. Four shapes of commercially available core have been chosen for probe construction. For each shape of sensing probe, the radius and height of the probe is increased by 0 mm to 9 mm to find the effect of them on sensitivity and range of target displacement measurement. It has been observed that the probe with less height and maximum diameter has shown better performance. In addition to that, the probe geometry is optimized to achieve more sensitivity and range within the space available for probe mounting. It helps to utilize the available space effectively for probe design. Coil winding and mount-ing it inside the core window also important parameter in probe design. It has been observed that de-pressing the sensing coil inside the core window from sensing face by 3 mm decreases the sensitivity by 40 %. Hence, it is recommended to place the coil on the extreme end of the sensing face of the core. To know the effect of core permeability, it is varied from 1000 to 15000. It has been observed that it has no effect on sensitivity and measurement range. Only optimizing the probe geometry and its construction method is not adequate for target displacement measurement. We know that the EC based displacement measurement is also target material dependent. Generally probe impedance is measured and then the temperature drift of the sensing coil resistance is compensated to know the target displacement. Most of the temperature compensation techniques use this compensation technique and it is shown that those are suitable for high conductivity targets like copper. Choosing Z for displacement measurement may not be only best choice for all target materials. The displacement can be measured also through either R or X of the probe. Choosing the proper probe parameter for a given target material will provide a less temperature drift for target displacement measurement. To know about this, a simulation has been made for target displacement measurement with target metal of μr = 1, relative permittivity εr = 1, and temperature coefficient of resistivity ∝ = 0. 004 K- 1. The conductivity (σ) of the target is varied from 1 × 106 S/m to 62 × 106 S/m in the temperature range of 20 ℃ – 80 ℃. Now the simulation has been repeated by fixing  as a constant and varying target μr. The metal plate with  = 1 × 106 S/m, εr= 1 and ∝ = 0. 004 K – 1 is taken as a target and μr is varied from 100 to 10000. For both conductivity and permeability sweep analysis, the target displacement is measured as a function of Z, R and X independently. The temperature drift in displacement measurement is also analysed for the above temperature range. An experiment has been conducted with copper, stainless steel and mild steel as target metal in the temperature range of 20 ℃ – 80 ℃. The temperature drift is calculated when the displacement is measured as function of Z, R and X. Based on the results, we have identified that the target material relative permeability determines the selection of probe measurement parameter for target displacement measurement. Hence, knowing tar-get r alone suffice to select the probe measurement parameter (Z or R or X) for displacement measurement. Optimizing the probe geometry, selecting the proper probe measurement parameter and temperature compensation technique suffice to provide a good sensitivity, range and low temperature drift for a single probe. But in general, one of the mass produced probes is selected as a reference probe and it is calibrated against the ambient temperature and target displacement. And the calibration curves are loaded to all the probes. Matching the probe construction parameters to each other across the production patches is not possible in mass production. This makes the temperature compensation function and displacement calibration are different for every individual probes for displacement measurement. This degrades the measurement accuracy. A simulation has been performed with pot core with <b>commercial</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Using this, we have obtained 24 probes due to variations in 1) Individual and few combinational variations in core and coil dimensions 2) Core permeability variation and 3) relative position of the coil with respect to core. Finally, we have quantified the displacement error for each probe. We have identified the important probe dimensional parameters that have to be controlled precisely in mass production to improve the measurement accuracy. It shows error of 0. 86 % in the displacement measurement when the relative reactance and relative displacement is used for measurement. In practice, error in displacement measurement due to both the ambient temperature drift and the tolerance in probe construction parameter exist simultaneously. Hence, the combined error is computed for the target displacement range of 0 mm – 3 mm for the temperature range of 0 °C – 100 °C. The total error of less than 1 % is achieved for commercial standard probe tolerance. Finally, we have provided general factory production procedure and user calibration procedure of probe design to achieve cost effective displacement measurement with sensitivity and range with low temperature drift...|$|E

However, to our knowledge, no such study has been conducted in Africa. For this reason, we studied within-bale variability of fiber micronaire, length, uniformity, strength, reflectance and yellowness as measured by the SITC.

Our representative sample was composed of 1720 fiber samples that were analyzed in controlled conditions using the SITC in a laboratory in which international recommendations are fully respected.

40|$|Worldwide, lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is an {{important}} pulse crop. Canada is the world-leading producer and exporter of lentils, with Saskatchewan alone exporting more than 2. 0 Mt annually. Lentil is a poor competitor with both grasses and broad-leaved weeds, and chemical methods are the main form of control in mechanized broad acre production systems. Imidazolinone (Group 2) tolerance has been developed in lentil, but due to new resistance to this herbicide in weed populations, the use of metribuzin (MB) (Group 5, approved at 206 g a. i. ha- 1) has recently increased in western Canada. However, metribuzin can cause extensive damage to lentil crops under certain environmental conditions. The purpose of these studies was to develop strategies to improve tolerance to metribuzin in lentil through identifying potential genetic sources of improved tolerance and understanding the mode of inheritance of tolerance. Potential metribuzin tolerant F 2 populations were screened at 3 x (618 g a. i ha- 1) rate of metribuzin application for improved resistance. Commercial lentil varieties were screened at 0 x, 0. 5 x, 2 x and 4 x rates to evaluate tolerance to metribuzin to determine if natural variability occurs among genotypes and market classes. A mutagenized population of CDC Redberry was also screened at 10 x (2060 g a. i ha- 1) and three putative tolerant selections were identified.

40|$|Vectorial {{dimensioning}} and tolerancing (VD and T) {{has proven}} to be an unambiguous tolerancing system based upon the co-ordinate geometry and the co-ordinate measurement technique. Furthermore, the VD and T data structure is in line with the computer models already embedded in CAD, NC and CMM software and it is well suited for the establishment of CAD-NC-CMM control loops. However, the necessary introduction of a completely new tolerancing system with new drawing symbology and the numerous numbers of existing drawings (which today all comply with ISO-tolerance standards, GD and T) have prevented a broader use of VD and T in engineering practice. The idea of converting GD and T into VD and T tolerances evolved a few years ago, in order to process GD and T tolerances within a VD and T environment. The relationship between both tolerancing systems is examined and the layout of a computer integrated transformation procedure is described in this thesis. Despite pessimistic views expressed by critics a computer-supported, context sensitive and semi-automatic transformation seems to be possible. In fact, vendors of <b>commercial</b> computer aided <b>tolerancing</b> software (CAT systems) already claim that their systems could create unambiguous 3 D-tolerance models out of given drawing symbols according to ISO 1101. In the approach described in this doctoral thesis, the CAD system with its powerful 3 D-capability and its application interface is used to alleviate the problems resulting mainly from the ambiguity of the current tolerance standards. An ISO-based tolerance user interface leads the designer through the tolerance assignment process. Thus unambiguous tolerance combinations or (in the sense of the transformation procedure) non-regular datum systems can be avoided. The transformation procedure will be performed semi-automatically with designer interaction still required e. g. for reference point definition. Following the calculation of vectorial tolerance values, a tolerance analysis or the visualisation of deviations can be performed within the CAD environment. The analysis functions need not to be as sophisticated as those provided by commercial CAT software. Instead, a software prototype developed as part of this thesis focuses on an easy-to-use system for use by a designer who is not necessarily a tolerance expert. The application is fully embedded in the CoCreate's SolidDesigner 3 D-CAD-system and has been developed using the LISP IntegrationKit provided by the system. (orig.)

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScPolymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cells}} (PEMFCs) among other fuel cells {{are considered the}} best candidate for commercialization of portable and transportation applications because of their high energy conversion and low pollutant emission. Recently, there has been significant interest in high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs), due to certain advantages such as simplified system and better tolerance to CO poisoning. Cost, durability and the reliability are delaying the commercialization of PEM fuel cell technology. Above all durability is the most critical issue and it influences the other two issues. The main objective of this work is to study the durability of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for HT-PEMFC. In this study the investigation of commercial MEAs was done by evaluating their performance through polarization studies on a single cell, including using pure hydrogen and hydrogen containing various concentrations of CO as fuel, and to study {{the performance of the}} MEAs at various operating temperatures. The durability of the MEAs was evaluated by carrying out long term studies with a fixed load, temperature cycling and open circuit voltage degradation. Among the parameters studied, significant loss in the performance of the MEAs was noted during temperature cycling. The effect of temperature cycling on the performance of the cell showed that the performance decreases with increasing no. of cycles. This could be due to leaching of acid from the cell or loss of electrochemically active surface area caused by Pt particle size growth. For example at 160 °C, a performance loss of 3. 5 % was obtained after the first cycle, but after the fourth cycle a huge loss of 80. 8 % was obtained. The in-house MEAs with Pt-based binary catalysts as anodes were studied for CO tolerance, performance and durability. A comparison of polarization curves between commercial and in-house MEAs illustrated that commercial MEA gave better performance, obtaining 0. 52 A/cm² at 0. 5 V and temperature of 160 °C, with in-house giving 0. 39 A/cm² using same parameters as <b>commercial.</b> The CO <b>tolerance</b> of both <b>commercial</b> and in-house MEA was found to be similar. In order to increase the CO tolerance of the in-house MEAs, Pt based binary catalysts were employed as anodesand the performance was investigated In-house MEAs with Pt/C and Pt-based binary catalysts were compared and a better performance was observed for Pt/C than Pt-alloy catalysts with Pt-Co/C showing comparable performance. At 0. 5 V the performance obtained was 0. 39 A/cm 2 for Pt/C, and 0. 34 A/cm², 0. 28 A/cm², 0. 27 A/cm² and 0. 16 A/cm² were obtained for Pt-Co/C, Pt-Fe/C, Pt-Cu/C and Pt-Ni respectively. When the binary catalysts were tested for CO tolerance, Pt-Co showed no significant loss in performance when hydrogen containing CO was used as anode fuel.
