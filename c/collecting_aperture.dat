The testbed program has an emphasis on experimental CST [...] incorporating a broad suite of actuators and sensors, active struts, system identification, passive damping, active mirror mounts, and precision component characterization. The SERC testbed represents a one-tenth scaled version of an optical interferometer concept based on an inherently rigid tetrahedral configuration with <b>collecting</b> <b>apertures</b> on one face. The testbed consists of six 3. 5 meter long truss legs joined at four vertices and is suspended with attachment points at three vertices.

The stiff tetrahedral design differs from similar testbeds (such as the JPL Phase B) in that the structural topology is closed. The tetrahedral design minimizes structural deflections at the vertices (site of optical components for maximum baseline) resulting in reduced stroke requirements for isolation and pointing of optics.

40|$|If {{necessity}} {{truly is}} the mother of invention, then advances in lightweight space mirror technology have been driven by launch vehicle mass and volume constraints. In the late 1970 s, at the start of Hubble development, {{the state of the art}} in ground based telescopes was 3 to 4 meter monolithic primary mirrors with masses of 6000 to 10, 000 kg - clearly too massive for the planned space shuttle 25, 000 kg capability to LEO. Necessity led Hubble to a different solution. Launch vehicle mass constraints (and cost) resulted in the development of a 2. 4 meter lightweight eggcrate mirror. At 810 kg (180 kg/m 2), this mirror was approximately 7. 4 % of HST s total 11, 110 kg mass. And, the total observatory structure at 4. 3 m x 13. 2 m fit snuggly inside the space shuttle 4. 6 m x 18. 3 m payload bay. In the early 1990 s, at the start of JWST development, the state of the art in ground based telescopes was 8 meter class monolithic primary mirrors (16, 000 to 23, 000 kg) and 10 meter segmented mirrors (14, 400 kg). Unfortunately, launch vehicles were still constrained to 4. 5 meter payloads and 25, 000 kg to LEO or 6, 600 kg to L 2. Furthermore, science now demanded a space telescope with 6 to 8 meter aperture operating at L 2. Mirror technology was identified as a critical capability necessary to enable the next generation of large aperture space telescopes. Specific telescope architectures were explored via three independent design concept studies conducted during the summer of 1996 (1). These studies identified two significant architectural constraints: segmentation and areal density. Because the launch vehicle fairing payload dynamic envelop diameter is approximately 4. 5 meters, the only way to launch an 8 meter class mirror is to segment it, fold it and deploy it on orbit - resulting in actuation and control requirements. And, because of launch vehicle mass limits, the primary mirror allocation was only 1000 kg - resulting in a maximum areal density of 20 kg/m 2. At the inception of JWST in 1996, such a capability did not exist. A highly successful technology development program was initiated resulting in matured and demonstrated mirror technology for JWST (2, 3). Today, the JWST 6. 5 meter primary mirror has an areal density of 25 kg/m 2 for a total mass of 625 kg or 9. 6 % of the total JWST observatory mass of 6, 500 kg. Looking into the future, science requires increasing larger <b>collecting</b> <b>apertures.</b> Ground based telescopes are already moving towards 30 + meter mirrors. The only way to meet this challenge for space telescopes is via even lower areal density mirrors or on-orbit assembly or larger launch vehicles (4).

Numerical simulations were produced with the same Cn 2 value as the experimental data. Aperture-averaging effects were investigated by comparing the irradiance distributions for the three apertures at two different values of the structure parameter Cn 2, and, hence, different values of the coherence radius 0.

40|$|AbstractWe {{report on}} the design and {{performance}} of a novel 600 x high-concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) collector. The design is unique in that it diverges from the predominant HCPV approach of a 3 D concentrator mounted on a 2 -axis tracker. We consider minimization of the cost per m 2 of <b>collecting</b> <b>aperture</b> {{to be the most}} important aspect in achieving cost-competitiveness. Accordingly, we borrow from the knowledge of the more mature CSP industry which has shown the parabolic trough to be an effective and economical method to concentrate sunlight. To further leverage the advantages of scalability of trough geometries, the primary concentrator utilizes a construction based on inflated metalized polymer membranes as reflectors supported on modular concrete structures. With this design, aperture widths surpassing 10 m and trough lengths exceeding 200 m are possible. At a trough length of 200 m, the rated power of one collector is 500 kWp. To augment the concentration into the realm of HCPV, where use of high-efficiency triple-junction concentrator cells becomes economically viable, a novel secondary concentrating stage is employed, consisting of an array of tracking non-imaging concentrators arranged along the focal line of the primary. This two-stage line-to-point focus system allows for concentrations of over 600 x, considerably surpassing the 2 D limit of ∼ 200 x inherent to trough-like geometries, while maintaining the advantages of a one-axis tracking trough primary concentrator. A full-scale prototype of the system has been constructed in Biasca, Switzerland. Year-round solar-to-electrical efficiency is expected to exceed 25 %...|$|E

These systems are based on volume phase holograms made in dichromated gelatin (DCG) sandwiched between 2 layers of high quality float glass. They have demonstrated the practical application of this technology to compact scanning lidar systems at 532 and 1064 nm wavelengths, the ability to withstand moderately high laser power and energy loading, sufficient optical quality for most direct detection systems, overall efficiencies rivaling conventional receivers, and the stability to last several years under typical lidar system environments.

40|$|Super-resolution is {{the ability}} of a {{restoration}} algorithm to restore meaningful spatial frequency content beyond the diffraction limit of the imaging system. The Gerchberg-Papoulis (GP) algorithm {{is one of the most}} celebrated algorithms for super-resolution. The GP algorithm is conceptually simple and demonstrates the importance of using a priori information in the formation of the object estimate. In the first part of this dissertation the continuous GP algorithm is discussed in detail and shown to be a projection on convex sets algorithm. The discrete GP algorithm is shown to converge in the exactly-, over- and under-determined cases. A direct formula for the computation of the estimate at the kth iteration and at convergence is given. This analysis of the discrete GP algorithm sets the stage to connect super-resolution to error-correction codes. Reed-Solomon codes are used for error-correction in magnetic recording devices, compact disk players and by NASA for space communications. Reed-Solomon codes have a very simple description when analyzed with the Fourier transform. This signal processing approach to error-correction codes allows the error-correction problem to be compared with the super-resolution problem. The GP algorithm for super-resolution is shown to be equivalent to the correction of errors with a Reed-Solomon code over an erasure channel. The Restoration from Magnitude (RFM) problem seeks to recover a signal from the magnitude of the spectrum. This problem has applications to imaging through a turbulent atmosphere. The turbulent atmosphere causes localized changes in the index of refraction and introduces different phase delays in the data <b>collected.</b> Synthetic <b>aperture</b> radar (SAR) and hyperspectral imaging systems are capable of simultaneously recording multiple images of different polarizations or wavelengths. Each of these images will experience the same turbulent atmosphere and have a common phase distortion. A projection based restoration algorithm for the simultaneous restoration of pairs of images experiencing a common phase distortion is presented...|$|R
