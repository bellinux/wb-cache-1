40|$|The {{formation}} {{and growth of}} intermetallic <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> thickness {{is one of the}} important issues in search for reliable electronic and electrical connections. Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are an essential part of solder joints. At low levels, they have a strengthening effect on the joint; but at higher levels, they tend to make solder joints more brittle. If the solder joint is subjected to long-standing exposure of high temperature, this could result in continuous growth of intermetallic <b>compound</b> <b>layer.</b> The brittle intermetallic <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> formed in this way is very much prone to fracture and cold therefore lead to mechanical and electrical failure of the joint.

40|$|Nitriding and {{carbonitriding}} treatments {{generate on}} the surface of the steel workpieces a combined double layer with an external <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> of nitrides and carbonitrides and an inner layer with the microstructure of the base steel modified by nitrogen enrichment by diffusion. Tlte composition and constitution of the <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> depend both on the treatment conditions and on the composition and microstructure of the base material. Off course, to different constitution correspond also differences in properties and technological behaviour: hardness, porosity, wear and corrosion resistance, etc. In the paper the <b>compound</b> <b>layers</b> obtained by the same "hard nitriding" treatment on steels of different carbon content have been examined. The interaction of nitrogen with the steel surface can produce too different nitrides: the γ-Fe 4 N and the ε-Fe 2 N. Only the latter can dissolve significant amount of carbon, up to about 3 %. Tγe nitriding of pure iron (or ferrite) usually produce at first the γ′-nitride, and subsequently the C, superimposed to the first γ′layer. But the progressive growth of the C layer generate some porosity, coming from the partial decomposition in the inner zone of the layer of this nitride, not more in equilibrium with the external nitriding atmosfere, Therefore the nitriding <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> on ferrite, or pure iron, is a double layer, with a thick external layer of C nitride over an inner layer of γ′-nitride. The nitriding mechanism of the steels is more complex because, as contemporary to the previously described phenomena, also occur the interaction of the nitrogen with the cementite, the iron carbide, which produce the c-carbonitride. Therefore the <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> assume a more complex constitution: a nitrogen rich ε-carbonitride as surface layer, an intermediate γ′ layer, and a inner, carbon rich, carbonitridc <b>layer.</b> The <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> obtained on steel samples shown in Table 1 have been examined by usual metallographic techniques (OM and SEM, backscattered electron images), X-ray diffraction and hardness measurements. In the same Table 1 hardness and thickness of <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> obtained are also reported.

40|$|In this {{research}} study, {{we proposed a}} model that describes the formation of thin-film of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> at the interfaces of two immiscible solid layers A and B {{under the influence of}} irradiation. However, we begin our study with a non-irradiation process where we investigate the growth kinetics of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> under the diffusion of one and two kinds of species. This diffusion process takes place by means of one or two transport mechanisms during an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> formation process. The results that follow from this investigation reveal a complex growth kinetics of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> under the diffusion of two kinds of species by means of two transport mechanisms. However, the complex growth behaviour transforms to simple linear-parabolic or parabolic growths when only one kind of species diffuse by means of one transport mechanism. In the irradiation aspect of the study, the A and B solid layers (bilayer system) are considered to be bombarded by a beam of light and heavy energetic particles independently under different considerations. We take into account two possibilities during the irradiation of this bilayer system. Firstly, the majority of the kinetic energy of the radiation particles is considered to be converted into heat energy which subsequently results in the heating of the irradiated layers. We assume that the energy transferred from the incident particles to the atoms of the irradiated materials during the course of irradiation is less than their lattice threshold displacement energy. Thus, no defects are generated during this process. The influence of heating that accompanies the irradiation process is investigated to see if it could accelerate the growth of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> at the interfaces of the A and B layers. The second possibility is considered under the presupposition that the kinetic energy transferred by the radiation particles is greater than the lattice threshold displacement energy of the A and B layers; therefore, this process results in defects generation. The contribution of the two basic point defects (i. e. interstitial and vacancy defects), induced by irradiation, towards the growth of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> is studied independently. The results that follow from this study show that the rate of growth of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> at the interfaces depends on the defect generation rate. The growth rate increases proportionally with the defect generation rate. At high-temperature irradiation, the growth rate depends strongly on both temperature and defect generation rate while at lowtemperature irradiation it depends strongly only on defect generation rate. On the other hand, the radiation heating makes no significant contribution towards the growth of an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> at low temperature; this is because the dimensions of the A and B layers that are considered in this study are in the order of a few tens of nanometers. Considering the fact that the amount of energy deposited by the radiation particles increases with the thickness of the irradiated layer, less energy is, therefore, deposited in the irradiated layers under the thin film consideration. This reason makes radiation heating a less probable process for an AB <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> formation under the influence of irradiation. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

Three cold-rolled IF steel plates were nitrided for 4  h after shot peening at three different temperatures: 450  °C, 475  °C, and 500  °C. The resultant nitrided layers were then characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld method, and hardness measurements. Through SEM images, it was possible to visualize two main sublayers: a <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> and a diffusion zone. Through XRD, two phases were identified in the <b>compound</b> <b>layer,</b> which were ɛ-Fe 2 – 3 N and γ′-Fe 4 N. The diffusion zone presented a ferritic matrix with fine precipitates, possibly α″-Fe 16 N 2. By Rietveld, the calculated quantity of γ′-Fe 4 N was 68  wt. % for the sample treated at 475  °C and 58  wt. % for the one treated at 500  °C. These values were consistent with the hardness measurements. Thus, it is suggested that higher nitriding temperatures facilitate the decreasing of γ′-Fe 4 N and, consequently, the increasing of ɛ-Fe 2 – 3 N in the <b>compound</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|R
40|$|Surface {{treatments}} {{have been}} used to improve tool life in many manufacturing processes in industry. Plasma nitriding is widely used, because it allows controlling the surface microstructure, regarding <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> formation. Duplex surface treatments are new solutions for tools, combining the advantages of plasma nitriding and PVD coatings looking for a still better performance in service. This paper presents tribological properties of a duplex treatment consisting on plasma nitriding and PVD/TiN coating an AISI H 13 hot work tool steel. Duplex coating increases the wear resistance of the tool up to 30 %. The TiN microabrasion rate is not sensitive to the substrate pretreatment. On the other hand, coating adhesion is strongly dependent on the mechanical properties of the nitrided layer close to the interface. The adhesion condition was found to increase when the relation H/E and the amount of elastic recovery of the nitrided case are close to that of the TiN coating. The best results were obtained for plasma nitriding treatments carried out in a 5 %N 2 gas mixture, avoiding the formation of a <b>compound</b> <b>layer.</b> For 20 %N 2 content the <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> is formed and its transformation during the coating process lowers the adhesion of the TiN coating...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} planarising a {{substrate}} surface, with height differences caused by metallic structures (140), involves applying a titanium <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> (180, 200) {{onto the top}} and side faces of the structures (140) and then carrying out O 3 -activated deposition of SiO 2 or SiOF (220) from a precursor onto the substrate surface. Preferably, the titanium <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> (180, 200) consists of TiN, TiON, TiW, TiC and/or TiCON, applied by sputtering or CVD. USE - E. g. {{in the production of}} highly integrated circuits. ADVANTAGE - The method produces improved planarity compared with conventional TEOS processes and improved void-free filling of extremely narrow interspaces of down to one-tenth of a micron in a simple and inexpensive manner without the need for additional steps such as back-etching or chemical-mechanical polishing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this work, a {{duplex coating}} is {{performed}} by conducting microwave plasma nitriding on Ti 6 Al 4 V, {{followed by the}} deposition of hardcoating (CrN) using an arc coating system. Plasma nitriding of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy using microwave plasma technique, created a thick (∼ 130 μm) modified layer (case depth) at processing temperature of 700 °C and 5 hour. The load carrying capacity of the duplex coating assessed using Rockwell-C test shows that the case depth increases {{with an increase in}} process temperature and time for nitriding. Consequently, it affects the formation of <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> on the plasma nitrided specimen. Moreover, the formation of <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> may lead to uneven distributions of the applied hardcoating (CrN) resulted in poor adhesion of hard coating - nitrided substrate...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue {{properties}} of the nitrided SS 400 are investigated {{on the basis of}} the observation of dislocation structures, surface topography and fracture surface by means of optical and electron microscopy. Both slip bands and dislocation structures during stress cycling are not formed in the <b>compound</b> <b>layer.</b> The dislocation morphology of the diffusion layer is composed of the untangled and uniformly distributed dislocations and the clusters of the dislocation dipoles at lower stress amplitude, but well defined cell structures at higher stress amplitude. It is also found that the fatigue cracks of the nitrided specimen are initiated without the formation of slip bands and the separation between the <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> and the diffusion layer occurs during cyclic loading. On the basis of these observations, a mechanism of fatigue fracture for the nitrided SS 400 is proposed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper the {{structure}} and scratch resistance properties of gas nitrided pure iron samples were investigated. The effects of material strain hardening and amount of grain boundaries exposed on nitriding surface were evaluated by cold rolling the starting samples to different reduction levels before gas nitriding. Nitriding without any prior cold rolling produced a comparatively wide <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> with a large fraction of porous zone featuring low scratch hardness values but no evidence of damage. On the contrary, cold rolling before nitriding led to a more irregular and thinner <b>compound</b> <b>layer</b> with reduced amount of porous zone and much finer nitrides in the diffusion zone. Scratch hardness was increased but failure mechanism changed by generation of conformal cracks within the track groove {{and the appearance of}} discontinuous spallation at high loads...|$|R
