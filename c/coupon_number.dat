40|$|Abstract. We {{extend the}} {{classical}} coupon collector’s problem {{to one in}} which two collectors are simultaneously and independently seeking collections of d coupons. We find, in finite terms, {{the probability that the}} two collectors finish at the same trial, and we find, using the methods of Gessel– Viennot, the probability that the game has the following “ballot-like ” character: the two collectors are tied with each other for some initial number of steps, and after that the player who first gains the lead remains ahead throughout the game. As a by-product we obtain the evaluation in finite terms of certain infinite series whose coefficients are powers and products of Stirling numbers of the second kind. We study the variant of the original coupon collector’s problem in which a single collector wants to obtain at least h copies of each coupon. Here we give a simpler derivation of results of Newman and Shepp and extend those results. Finally we obtain the distribution of the <b>number</b> of <b>coupons</b> that have been obtained exactly once (“singletons”) at the conclusion of a successful coupon collecting sequence.

40|$|The {{targeting}} {{guidelines of}} the Farm Input Subsidy Programme (FISP) in Malawi identify special target groups as guardians looking after physically challenged persons and vulnerable groups such as child headed, female-headed or orphan headed or physically challenged-headed households and those households with infected or affected with HIV and AIDS. This paper documents experiences of communities and most vulnerable households in accessing coupons and subsidized farm inputs. The most vulnerable groups captured in the study include female-headed, child headed and elderly headed households. We find that the problems in accessing coupons were isolated while the difficulties in redeeming coupons were most severe for most households, particularly the most vulnerable groups. With respect to access to coupons the main challenges were sharing of <b>coupons,</b> fewer <b>numbers</b> of <b>coupons</b> relative {{to the number of}} qualifying beneficiaries, malpractices by officials and the process of identification, particularly use of identification cards. Access to subsidized inputs was more problematic due to long queues, frequent stock outs, long distances to markets and payment of tips and bribes. These raised the transaction costs and opportunity costs which most vulnerable groups could not afford. The most vulnerable households had particular challenges in finding money to redeem the coupons let alone payment of tips to purchase subsidized inputs...|$|R

The standard deviation and the distribution of rupture stress strongly depended on the specimen geometry size, the fiber length and the loading span width. The correlation of the fiber orientation in the loaded area, of the region of failure initiation and of the measured flexural strength were investigated by high resolution X-ray computer tomography and SEM in order to obtain further insight into the causes of strength scatter in these materials.

40|$|This {{document}} was created with FrameMaker 4. 0. 2 In {{the second study}} [3, 4], broad band sensors and a digital oscilloscope for waveform acquisition were used in addition to conventional (parameter based) AE measurements. Analysis based on wave propagation models in plate geometries allowed discrimination of signals generated by cracks from extraneous noise. Transverse matrix cracks were shown to preferentially generate extensional plate mode signals due to their in-plane source motion. Extraneous noise sources such as grip damage generated signals with large flexural mode components. Waveform capture rate limitations prevented digital acquisition of all signals during the tests. However, with the conventional system optimized for detection and location of crack induced extensional mode signals, fair correlation between AE determined crack locations and cracks measured with an ultrasonic backscatter technique was obtained. In this research, advanced AE techniques using broad band sensors, high capture rate digital waveform acquisition, and plate wave propagation based analysis were applied to cross-ply composite <b>coupons</b> with different <b>numbers</b> of 0 and 90 degree plies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{conventional and}} new measures of market, credit, and liquidity risks for government bonds. These measures are analyzed {{from the perspective}} of a sovereign''s debt manager. In particular, it examines duration, convexity, M-square, skewness, kurtosis, and VaR statistics as measures of interest rate exposure; a VaR statistic as the prominent measure of exchange rate exposure; the balance sheet approach (or contingent claims approach), and its consequent probability of default as the most promising measure of credit risk exposure; and an elasticity approach and a VaR statistic to measure liquidity risk. Along with the formulas for the various statistics proposed, we provide simple examples of their application to some common risk valuation cases. Finally, we present an integrated approach for the simultaneous estimation of a portfolio''s interest rate and exchange rate risk using the VaR methodology. The integrated approach is then extended to also include N risk factors. This approach allows us to measure the total risk of a portfolio, provided that the volatilities and correlations among the risk factors can be estimated.

40|$|Transverse matrix {{cracking}} in cross-ply gr/ep laminates was {{studied with}} advanced acoustic emission (AE) techniques. The {{primary goal of}} this research was to measure the load required to initiate the first transverse matrix crack in cross-ply laminates of different thicknesses. Other methods had been previously used for these measurements including penetrant enhanced radiography, optical microscopy, and audible acoustic microphone measurements. The former methods required that the mechanical test be paused for measurements at load intervals. This slowed the test procedure and did not provide the required resolution in load. With acoustic microphones, acoustic signals from cracks could not be clearly differentiated from other noise sources such as grip damage, specimen slippage, or test machine noise. A second goal for this work was to use the high resolution source location accuracy of the advanced acoustic emission techniques to determine whether the crack initiation site was at the specimen edge or in the interior of the specimen. In this research, advanced AE techniques using broad band sensors, high capture rate digital waveform acquisition, and plate wave propagation based analysis were applied to cross-ply composite <b>coupons</b> with different <b>numbers</b> of 0 and 90 degree plies. Noise signals, believed to be caused by grip damage or specimen slipping, were eliminated based on their plate wave characteristics. Such signals were always located outside the sensor gage length in the gripped region of the specimen. Cracks were confirmed post-test by microscopic analysis of a polished specimen edge, backscatter ultrasonic scans, and in limited cases, by penetrant enhanced radiography. For specimens with three or more 90 degree plies together, there was an exact 1 - 1 correlation between AE crack signals and observed cracks. The ultrasonic scans and some destructive sectioning analysis showed that the cracks extended across the full width of the specimen. Furthermore, the locations of the cracks from the AE data were in excellent agreement with the locations measured with the microscope. The high resolution source location capability of this technique, combined with an array of sensors, was able to determine that the cracks initiated at the specimen edges, rather than in the interior. For specimens with only one or two 90 degree plies, the crack-like signals were significantly smaller in amplitude and there was not a 1 - 1 correlation to observed cracks. This was similar to previous results. In this case, however, ultrasonic and destructive sectioning analysis revealed that the cracks did not extend across the specimen. They initiated at the edge, but did not propagate any appreciable distance into the specimen. This explains the much smaller AE signal amplitudes and the difficulty in correlating these signals to actual cracks in this, {{as well as in the}} previous study...|$|R
40|$|The {{service life}} of {{industrial}} components is limited predominantly by chemical corrosion, mechanical failure or mechanical wear. In the aluminium high {{pressure die casting}} industry, liquid aluminium is extremely reactive with the constituents of H 13 die steel and {{has a tendency to}} form intermetallic layers. This chemical interaction results in sticking of molten metal to the die surface which produces defective castings and also damages the die surface. The use of thermal spray coatings provides protection to the surfaces operating in severe environments. An HVOF thermally sprayed coating has the advantage of having excellent bond strength and very low porosity levels (< 1 %). This research work is concerned with producing and evaluating the performance of titanium/alumina based composite coatings to improve the service life of tool steel (H 13) used for dies in aluminium high pressure die casting and dummy blocks used in Al extrusion. In this research work, the powder feedstocks for making the composite coatings were produced by high energy mechanical milling of a mixture of Al and TiO₂ powders in two different molar ratios followed by a thermal reaction process. The feedstock powder was then thermally sprayed using a high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) technique on H 13 steel substrates to produce Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ and TiAl/Al₂O₃ composite coatings. The performance of the coatings was assessed in terms of Al soldering, liquid metal corrosion resistance, thermal shock resistance and wear resistance. In an immersion test, the coated specimens were dipped into molten Al at a temperature of 700 ± 10 °C for different intervals of time. The performance of the coatings was tested in terms of liquid metal corrosion resistance and propensity to Al soldering. The dissolution behaviour of the coatings was evaluated by measuring weight loss after dipping the samples in to molten aluminium. The immersion test results showed that the coated samples have relatively few locations where aluminium soldering (reactive/chemical) occurred, however, an H 13 steel surface showed more tendency for aluminium soldering. It was found that composite coatings changed the molten Al attack on H 13 tool steel from a generalized to a localized one. No reaction between molten aluminium and a Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coating was identified. The TiAl/Al 2 O₃ composite coating was found to be attacked by molten aluminium {{as a result of a}} reaction between the coating and molten aluminium. The metallic phase TiAl in the composite coating is believed to be attacked by the molten Al. A Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coating was found to be a better protective coating than the TiAl/Al₂O₃ composite coating due its stability against molten aluminium attack. The thermal shock behaviour of the composite coatings was investigated by subjecting the coated <b>coupons</b> to a <b>number</b> of cycles, each cycle consisting of a holding time of 30 seconds in molten aluminium at 700 ± 10 °C followed by quenching into water. The surfaces of the coupons were examined for Al soldering and an evaluation of surface spallation. Any cracks found in the coatings were studied to explain their thermal shock behaviour. A Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coating on H 13 tool steel produced from a fine feedstock has better thermal shock resistance than the Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ TiAl/Al₂O₃ composite coatings produced from the agglomerated feedstocks. The study also describes and compares the tribological properties such as friction and sliding wear rate of the composite coatings both at room and high temperature (700. °C) under dry and lubricating conditions. The wear resistance of the coatings was investigated by a tribometer using a spherical ended alumina, flat ended high speed steel and spherical ended hardened steel pins as counter bodies. The experimental results show that the composite coatings look promising for high temperature applications due to their low wear rate at high temperature. However room temperature applications of the composite coatings can be improved under lubricated conditions. Successful trials of a Ti(Al,O) /Al₂O₃ composite coated dummy block revealed that the coating has potential as an industrial coating...|$|R
