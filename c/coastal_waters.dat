40|$|Four JAEA {{researchers}} visited PNNL for {{two weeks}} in February, 2013 to learn the PNNL-developed, unsteady, one-dimensional, river model, TODAM and the PNNL-developed, time-dependent, three dimensional, <b>coastal</b> <b>water</b> model, FLESCOT. These codes predict sediment and contaminant concentrations by accounting sediment-radionuclide interactions, e. g., adsorption/desorption and transport-deposition-resuspension of sediment-sorbed radionuclides. The objective {{of the river and}} <b>coastal</b> <b>water</b> modeling is to simulate • 134 Cs and 137 Cs migration in Fukushima rivers and the <b>coastal</b> <b>water,</b> and • their accumulation in the river and ocean bed along the Fukushima coast. Forecasting the future cesium behavior in the river and <b>coastal</b> <b>water</b> under various scenarios would enable JAEA to assess the effectiveness of various on-land remediation activities and if required, possible river and <b>coastal</b> <b>water</b> clean-up operations to reduce the contamination of the river and <b>coastal</b> <b>water,</b> agricultural products, fish and other aquatic biota. PNNL presented the following during the JAEA visit to PNNL: • TODAM and FLESCOT’s theories and mathematical formulations • TODAM and FLESCOT model structures • Past TODAM and FLESCOT applications • Demonstrating these two codes' capabilities by applying them to simple hypothetical river and <b>coastal</b> <b>water</b> cases. • Initial application of TODAM to the Ukedo River in Fukushima and JAEA researchers' participation in its modeling. PNNL also presented the relevant topics relevant to Fukushima environmental assessment and remediation, including • PNNL molecular modeling and EMSL computer facilities • Cesium adsorption/desorption characteristics • Experiences of connecting molecular science research results to macro model applications to the environment • EMSL tour • Hanford Site road tour.

Adult megalodon were not abundant in shallow water environments, and mostly inhabited offshore areas. Megalodon may have moved between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages of its life cycle. However, megalodon teeth have been excavated from regions far away from continental lands, such as the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

Solitary foraging species usually exploit <b>coastal</b> <b>waters,</b> bays and rivers. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey.
