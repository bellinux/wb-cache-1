40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with the estimation of the grade of service given to the subscribers in a telephone exchange. The analytical models used are (a) the probability linear graph for lost calls and (b) the traffic flow graph for delayed calls. Both of these models are expressed in terms of the <b>congestion</b> <b>functions</b> of the sub-units of the switching system in the exchange. When these models are used, the engineering procedure of determining the quantity of equipment for the switching system in the exchange to satisfy the objective grade of service is simple. The switching system in the exchange may be divided into three major sub-units: the trunk groups, the switching network, and the common control. The <b>congestion</b> <b>functions</b> for these sub-units are discussed. The structure and the mode of operation for these sub-units are usually very complex, so that the <b>congestion</b> <b>functions</b> for these units can only be approximated. Thus, the overall grade of service estimated this way is only an approximation. Finally, the procedure of estimating the overall grade of service of an exchange is demonstrated by considering a simple hypothetical telephone switching system. The main contributions in this thesis are: (1) The traffic flow graph: This graph is used as the model for estimating the grade of service for delayed calls in an exchange. It can also be used for approximating the waiting time distribution for a given waiting system. (2) The equivalent trunk technique: This technique is shown to be reasonably accurate and simple for use in computing the trunk group congestion distribution when the trunk group is arranged in grading. (3) A method of approximating network blocking probability: This method can be used to approximate the blocking probability of any complex switching network. It is simple and inexpensive and produces reasonably accurate results. (4) Single linking stage network loaded with multitype of traffic: When some types of traffic require the service of more than one link at a time, the network for these types of traffic is blocked even if there are some idle links in the network. Extremely poor approximation will result if the usual assumption of independent busy links is used for calculating the blocking probability. In this thesis, such a network is analysed and a better approximation for computing the blocking probability is given.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the proportional allocation mechanism first studied by Kelly (1997) {{in the context}} of congestion control algorithms for communication networks. A single infinitely divisible resource is to be allocated efficiently to competing players whose individual utility func-tions are unknown to the resource manager. If players anticipate the ef-fect of their bids on the price of the resource and their utility functions are concave, strictly increasing and continuously differentiable, Johari and Tsitsiklis (2004) proved that the price of anarchy is 4 / 3. The question was raised whether there is a relationship between this result and that of Roughgarden and Tardos (2002), who had earlier shown exactly the same bound for nonatomic selfish routing with affine-linear <b>congestion</b> <b>functions.</b> We establish such a relationship and show, in particular, that the efficiency loss can be characterized by precisely the same geometric quantity.

40|$|The urban {{transportation}} model predicts flows on {{a transportation}} network {{as a function}} of the urban system containing the network and the characteristics of the transportation network. It comprises four steps: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, (3) modal split, and (4) traffic assignment. The fourth step, traffic assignment, predicts routes (paths) used between each origin-destination pair on the transportation network. ^ Calibration of traffic assignment models is acknowledged as a perquisite to their application. Such calibration efforts have traditionally been ad hoc. They have fallen into one of five categories: (1) modification of the network representation, (2) adjustment of travel demand, (3) selecting the traffic assignment method and assumptions, (4) adjustment of the traffic dispersion parameter for stochastic assignments, and (5) estimating <b>congestion</b> <b>function</b> parameters. ^ Some efforts have recently been made towards systematizing the calibration of traffic assignment. These efforts can be categorized as mathematical programming and heuristic procedures. Mathematical programming has been traditionally applied in the estimation of <b>congestion</b> <b>function</b> parameters. If observed link flows and travel times are available, least squares are applied. ^ In practice, however, it is hard to measure link travel times. Proposed is a generic method I term network loading (NL). This method simultaneously estimates the link flows and <b>congestion</b> <b>function</b> parameters. If equilibrium link flows are used in parameter estimation and prediction, we have what I call the user-equilibrium (UE) model. A particular implementation of the UE model is the Entropy-Maximizing (EM) model. The bilevel formulation by Suh et al. (1990) is a similar approach that I cover in this research. It has an upper-level objective function that minimizes the error in estimated link flows. The lower-level problem is the formulation of the UE assignment. ^ Despite their elaborate formulations, the mathematical programming methods are difficult to implement. The difficulty increases with the size of the network. Human-based expertise and heuristics provide a viable alternative approach. Fricker (1989) proposes the parameter adjustment (PA) method for the calibration of <b>congestion</b> <b>function</b> parameters. He also proposes the direct impedance adjustment (DIA) and simultaneous link speed adjustment (SLSA) methods for modifying link free-flow travel times and speeds. The three proposed procedures require only observed link flows. ^ The three heuristic procedures are tested on two networks, the fictitious Archerville and the real Eindhoven networks. The experiments on the Archerville network are controlled for extraneous sources of error while those on the Eindhoven network are not. The Eindhoven network is supplemented with synthetic data and more controlled tests are conducted. ^ The conclusions of the experiments are as follows: (1) PA is very sensitive to parameter starting values and level of congestion on the network. It performs well only on highly detailed networks. (2) DIA and SLSA improve traffic assignment performance in terms of replicating actual link flows. DIA, however, does not always perform very well. (3) DIA and SLSA perform better at higher levels of network detail. (4) DIA and SLSA can be applied to all or parts of a network. (5) SLSA is clearly superior to DIA. Accordingly, it recommended for use by transportation planners. ...|$|E

Most of these studies attempt to investigate the cost structures of specific public services such as the police or fire department, schools, sewage, or water supply services and so on. For example, Hirsch (1959) investigated total expenditure on police services, refuse collection, fire protection, and education services. He fitted a quadratic function of population and found inverted U-shaped relationships with various kinds of expenditures, which suggest the existence of economies of scale. Bodkin and Conklin (1971) conducted a similar analysis on per capita local public expenditures. They found a U-shaped relationship between per capita total expenditure and population but did not find U-shaped relationships with some specific public expenditure items. Beaton (1974) fitted linear regression equations {{to the cost of}} police services by population size of cities. Borcherding and Deacon (1972) also fitted simple log-linear equations to several outputs of public services. Craig (1987), Craig and Heikkila (1989), and Edwards (1990) introduced <b>congestion</b> <b>functions</b> and estimated the degrees of congestion in providing public safety and others. Ladd (1992) estimated a piecewise linear function and obtained asymmetric U-shaped cost function. Solé-Ollé and Bosch (2005) took a similar approach. Duncombe et al.

Several studies have fitted quadratic functions to the cost structure of local public services: Hirsch (1965) for refuse collections, Knapp (1982) for crematoria, and Tao and Yuan (2005) for public elementary schools. Furthermore, in relation to other aspects of cost structures, Ladd (1994) and Nelson (1992) investigated the relationship between population growth and counties’ expenditures.
