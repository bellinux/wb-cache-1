5000|$|If the {{connectors}} {{are mounted}} on the PCB, the outer perimeter of the PCB should contain a strip of copper connecting to the <b>shields</b> of the <b>connectors.</b> There should be a break in copper between this strip, and the main ground plane of the circuit. The two should be connected at only one point. This way, {{if there is a}} large current between <b>connector</b> <b>shields,</b> it will not pass through the ground plane of the circuit.|$|R

50|$|More recent {{standards}} such as USB, FireWire, and Ethernet {{take advantage}} of declining costs of interface electronics to implement more complex standards providing higher bandwidth. The multi-conductor (parallel data) <b>connectors</b> and <b>shielded</b> cable were inherently more costly than the connectors and cabling {{that could be used}} with serial data transfer standards such as RS-232, RS-485, USB, FireWire or Ethernet. Very few mass-market personal computers or peripherals (such as printers or scanners) implemented IEEE 488.|$|R

50|$|The {{connector}} {{is divided}} in two sections: the longer one has thirteen pins numbered {{from right to}} left (5 to 17); the shorter one has three pins, on the left (3), top (2) and right (1). The cable <b>shield</b> <b>connectors</b> (4,18) are located {{on each side of the}} thirteen pins.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of these}} connectors, {{and other types}} of connectors, are also used at radio {{frequency}} (RF) to connect a radio or television receiver to an antenna or to a cable system; RF connector applications are not further described here. Analog A/V <b>connectors</b> often use <b>shielded</b> cables to inhibit radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise.|$|R
5000|$|Push-on (aka Flex) F Type <b>connectors</b> provide poorer <b>shielding</b> against {{microwave}} {{signals of}} high field strength. This leakage problem is more {{an artifact of}} bent or partly broken push on connectors, but is mostly not observed with compression connectors. Nearby television, FM radio, mobile & cordless phones, government radiolocation (54-1,002 MHz) [...] transmitters can potentially interfere with a CATV or DTH Satellite reception or operation if the Flex connector poorly installed.|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms for {{engaging}} and disengaging electrical and fluid line connectors are required to be operated repeatedly in hazardous or remote locations on space station, nuclear reactors, toxic chemical and undersea environments. Such mechanisms may require shields to protect the mating faces of the connectors when connectors are not engaged and move these shields {{out of the way}} during connector engagement. It is desirable to provide a force-transmitting structure to react the force required to engage or disengage the connectors. It is also desirable that the mechanism for moving the <b>connectors</b> and <b>shields</b> is reliable, simple, and the structure as lightweight as possible. With these basic requirements, an Umbilical Mechanism Assembly (UMA) was originally designed for the Space Station Freedom and now being utilized for the International Space Station...|$|R

40|$|In {{the power}} drive system of the Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), High Voltage (HV) cables {{play a major role}} in {{evaluating}} the EMI of the whole system. Transfer impedance (Z T) is the most commonly used performance parameter for the HV cable. To analyse and design HV cables and <b>connectors</b> with better <b>shielding</b> effectiveness (SE), appropriate measurement and simulation methods are required. In this paper, Ground Plate Method (GPM) with improvements has been proposed to measure Z T. Use of low-frequency ferrites to avoid ground-loop effects has also been investigated. Additionally, a combination of analytical model with a circuit model has been implemented to simulate limitations (frequency response) of the test setup. Also parametrical studies using the analytical model have been performed to analyse the shielding behaviour of HV cables...|$|R
30|$|The current {{consumption}} of the device powered by the emulator was measured and sampled {{by means of a}} National Instruments PXI- 4071 digital multimeter with a sensitivity down to 1 pA [44] while digital waveforms were sampled by means of a National Instruments NI-DAQmx PCI- 6251 16 -channel data acquisition board connected to a BNC- 2120 <b>shielded</b> <b>connector</b> block [45, 46]. Square waves were produced using a TG 2000 Aim-TTi analogue and digital function generators [47]. During the experiments, the emulator prototype was powered at 12 V by a NGMO 2 Rohde & Schwarz dual-channel power supply [48]. The emulator was tested with constant load by connecting it to simple static resistors while an ad-hoc designed DC electronic load was used in constant current experiments. Finally, more realistic operating conditions have been experimented by using the emulator as a power source for a real VirtualSense sensor node [49].|$|R
50|$|To {{meet this}} {{requirement}} while including internal TV circuitry, the machines {{needed to be}} heavily shielded. Both were built around very strong cast aluminum shields forming a partial Faraday cage, with the various components screwed down onto this internal framework. This {{had the advantage of}} producing an extremely sturdy computer, although at the disadvantage of added manufacturing expense and complexity. The FCC ruling also made it difficult to have any sizable holes in the case, which eliminated expansion slots or cards that communicated with the outside world via their own connectors. Instead, Atari designed the Serial Input/Output (SIO) computer bus, a daisy-chainable system that allowed multiple, auto-configuring devices to connect to the computer through a single <b>shielded</b> <b>connector.</b> The internal slots were reserved for ROM and RAM modules; they did not have the control lines necessary for a fully functional expansion card, nor room to route a cable outside the case to communicate with external devices.|$|R
5000|$|On some amps with {{a number}} of input and output jacks, the jacks may be {{consolidated}} in a patch bay. Some amps have an input jack for a foot-operated switch which can be used to turn on an effect or switch to a solo channel. Some higher-end amps have a Speakon speaker jack for an extension speaker. In the 2010s, the Speakon jack is often used in high wattage amplifiers, because the design of the <b>connector,</b> which is <b>shielded</b> from human touch, prevents electrical shock from a high-powered amplifier. Some amplifiers have a [...] "tuner out" [...] jack, for sending the instrument signal to an external electronic tuner. Bass speaker cabinets often have two 1/4" [...] jacks. These are provided so that one speaker cable can be plugged into the first jack and connected to the power amp; if the bassist wants to use a second cabinet, a second speaker cable is plugged into the second jack and then into second speaker.|$|R
5000|$|The Dell Inspiron 531 is Dell's AMD desktop {{counterpart}} to the Inspiron 530, and with {{exception of the}} CPU and motherboard, is virtually identical. Starting with the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ it can be customized up to an AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+. The Athlon X2 7000, Phenom, Phenom II and Athlon II series are not supported. It uses 1 GB of DDR2 SDRAM at 667 MHz, which can be upgraded up to 8 GB 800 MHz under JEDEC DDR2 voltage specification. The model features the M2N61-AX OEM motherboard made by ASUS [...] and uses nVidia GeForce 6150 integrated graphics with the nForce 430i chipset, and has two PCI slots, one PCI-e X1 and one PCI-e X16 1.0a slot. Due to {{the arrangement of the}} expansion slots, however, use of a double height video card renders the PCI-e X1 slot useless. The motherboard also features four SATA 1.0 Ports, one EIDE (floppy) plug, three USB plugs for front USB, a Firewire plug, and a front audio plug. Cooling is somewhat limited, as the motherboard only provides one 4-pin PWM CPU fan plug, and one 3-pin rear fan plug. Installation of a fan controller will be required to use additional fans. Recently, the 6.05 version of nVidia's System Performance Tools allows minor FSB overclocking, but does not allow voltage or multiplier adjustments, limiting overclocking potential. The case is Micro-ATX sized, lightweight aluminum and features one 92 mm Rear fan, one external 3" [...] drive bay, two 5" [...] bays and two vertical 3" [...] internal drive bays. It also features a standard ATX sized 300 watt power supply with four SATA plugs, one 24-pin ATX12V 2.0 plug and one 4-pin P4 plug, oddly excluding any standard 4-pin Molex <b>connectors.</b> The I/O <b>Shield</b> is also part of the case, preventing the installation of third-party motherboards without modifications to the case.|$|R
