2500|$|Spin <b>casting</b> <b>rods</b> are rods {{designed}} to hold a spin casting reel, which are normally mounted above the handle. Spin <b>casting</b> <b>rods</b> also have small eyes and, frequently, a forefinger grip trigger. They {{are very similar to}} bait <b>casting</b> <b>rods,</b> to the point where either type of reel may be used on a particular rod. While rods were at one time offered as specific [...] "spin casting" [...] or [...] "bait casting" [...] rods, this has become uncommon, as the rod design is suited to either fishing style, and today they are generally called simply [...] "casting rods", and are usually offered with no distinction as to which style they are best suited for in use. <b>Casting</b> <b>rods</b> are typically viewed as somewhat more powerful than their spinning rod counterparts – they can use heavier line and can handle heavier cover.|$|R

They are almost always used in shore fishing (sea fishing from the shoreline) from the beach, rocks or other shore feature.

40|$|Abstract. Hot {{isostatic}} pressing (HIPping) technology {{is used for}} healing the casting defects for aerospace applications. Castings used for aerospace applications like turbo-pumps need to meet very stringent quality requirements. Complexity of the castings used in these applications, {{makes it difficult to}} meet the quality requirements in all the areas. Defects like gas holes, shrinkages, cavities etc. may occur in few locations and need to be repaired by welding or healed by HIPping. In the present study, we attempted to simulate the defect healing capability of HIP in a systematic manner. Artificial defects were created in Austenite-Martensite grade stainless steel <b>cast</b> <b>rod.</b> These rods were then subjected to HIP prcoss cycle at 1150 ˚C and at a pressure of 1620 bar. Healing of the defects was ensured through X-ray radiography. Detailed microstructural analysis using optical metallography and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDX was carried out before and after HIPping, to understand the defect healing mechanisms. These results are discussed in detail here...|$|E

40|$|The cooling rates {{associated}} with suction and copper-mould casting of ø 2, ø 3 and ø 5 mm rods made in Fe- 25 wt%Ni and Al- 33 wt%Cu alloys were determined {{based on their}} cellular and lamellar spacings, respectively. The work showed that the temperature profile in cylindrical samples {{can not be determined}} merely by microstructural examination of eutectic sample alloys. A concave solidification front, as a result of eutectic transformation, caused decrease of a lamellar spacing while approaching to the rod centre. The minimum axial cooling rates, estimated based on the cellular spacing in the Fe- 25 wt%Ni alloy, were evaluated to be about 200 K/s for both ø 2 and ø 3 mm and only 30 K/s for the ø 5 mm suction <b>cast</b> <b>rods.</b> The corresponding values were slightly lower for the copper-mould <b>cast</b> <b>rods...</b>|$|R

40|$|The grain {{refining}} technique of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy by MgCO 3 has been investigated. The refining mechanism and tensile {{properties of the}} resulting alloy have also been discussed. The results indicate that MgCO 3 can decrease its grain size from 311 to 53 µm. Correspondingly, the tensile properties are obviously improved. The higher the cooling rate from addition temperature to pouring temperature or the higher the addition temperature, the finer the grains. The melt treated by MgCO 3 should be poured {{as soon as possible}} because the inoculation fading is quite quick. The microstructure sensitivity to the diameter of a <b>cast</b> <b>rod</b> is relatively high and the microstructures of the rods with large diameters are quite inhomogeneous.

40|$|Fluoroindate {{glasses are}} {{attractive}} {{materials for the}} fabrication of mid-infrared transmitting fibers with extended spectral range. Preparation of fluoroindate glasses under different melting conditions and preform fabrication using the billet extrusion technique were investigated in this study. Experimental {{results showed that the}} fluorination of the raw materials using ammonium bifluoride reduced OH content and oxide impurities, and enhanced the crystallization stability of the glasses. In addition, a shift of the IR absorption edge to longer wavelength was observed by using ammonium bifluoride. Casting and extrusion methods were compared for application to preform fabrication. In this work, the fiber with the lowest loss (~ 2 dB/m at 1. 55 μm) was obtained using preform extrusion at 322 °C. The significantly reduced loss of the fiber made from the extruded preform compared to the fiber made using a cast preform is attributed to the suppression of scattering centers and the better surface quality of extruded rods compared with the <b>cast</b> <b>rod.</b> Jiafang Bei, Tanya M.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the detailed procedure for {{the synthesis of}} pure ferromagnetic tau phase in binary Heusler Al- 55 pct Mn alloy in bulk form through casting route without any addition of stabilizers. To obtain the processing domain {{for the formation of}} the tau phase from high-temperature epsilon phase, isothermal transformation experiments were carried out. The structure and microstructure were characterized by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy studies. The tau phase start times were obtained through magnetic measurements. In order to tune the casting conditions for the formation of this phase, thermal modeling was carried out to predict the heat extraction rates for copper molds of different diameters (2 to 12 mm) containing hot solids during casting process. This enabled us to estimate the diameter of the mold to be used for obtaining tau phase directly during casting. It was concluded through experimental verification that 10 -mm-diameter casting in copper mold is suitable to obtain complete tau phase. A saturation magnetization of 116 emu/g at 10 K was measured for such samples. The Curie point for the tau phase was found to be 668 K (395 A degrees C). Additionally, the <b>cast</b> <b>rod</b> exhibits a compressive strength of 1170 MPa which is higher than those of both ferrites and AlNiCo magnets...|$|E

40|$|The hot {{and cold}} {{cracking}} tendencies of some early iron aluminide alloy compositions limited their use to applications where good weldability was not required. Considerable {{progress has been made}} toward improving this situation. Using hot crack testing techniques developed at ORNL and a systematic study of alloy compositional effects, we have established a range of compositions within which hot cracking resistance is very good, essentially equivalent to stainless steel. Cold cracking, however, remains an issue, and extensive efforts are continuing to optimize composition and welding parameters, especially preheat and postweld heat treatment, to minimize its occurrence. In terms of filler metal and process development, we have progressed from sheared strip through aspiration <b>cast</b> <b>rod</b> and shielded metal arc electrodes {{to the point where we}} can now produce composite wire with a steel sheath and aluminum core in coil form, which permits the use of both the gas tungsten arc and gas metal arc processes. This is a significant advancement in that the gas metal arc process lends itself well to automated welding, and is the process of choice for commercial weld overlay applications. Using the newly developed filler metals, we have prepared clad specimens for testing in a variety of environments both in-house and outside ORNL, including laboratory and commercial organizations. As a means of assessing the field performance of this new type of material, we have modified several non-pressure boundary boiler components, including fuel nozzles and port shrouds, by introducing areas of weld overlay in strategic locations, and have placed these components in service in operating boilers for a side-by-side comparison with conventional corrosion-resistant materials...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} the investigations results of fabrication and structure tests binary Ni-Nb metallic glasses. Design/methodology/approach: The studies {{were performed on}} Ni 60 +xNb 40 -x (x= 0, 1, 2) alloys in form of ribbon and rods up to 2 mm. For the purpose of fabrication test pieces, melt spinning and pressure die casting methods were used. The main index for determine glass forming ability was thickness of specimens. To the tests of samples structure X-ray diffraction phase analysis (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used. Owing to good mechanical properties of Ni-based metallic glasses, microhardness of <b>cast</b> <b>rods</b> were examined. Findings: X-ray diffraction and SEM analysis have revealed that samples in form of ribbons were amorphous, while <b>cast</b> <b>rods</b> were crystalline.
