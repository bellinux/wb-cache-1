40|$|Opportunistic infections of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) are common {{complications}} of advanced immunode�ciency in individuals with human immunode�ciency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection. Neurological disease is the �rst manifestation of acquired immunode�ciency syndrome (AIDS) in 10 % to 20 % of symptomatic HIV- 1 infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of such disorders is critical. Also, in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), these disease states have changed in presentation and epidemiology. Therefore, we review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of �ve common central nervous system disorders in individuals with HIV- 1 infection: toxoplasma encephalitis, primary central nervous system lymphoma, cryptococcal meningitis, <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopath y.

Nevertheless, the management of CMV-related encephalitis appears to be problematic and data {{in the literature on}} the clinical efficacy of ganciclovir therapy is sparse and controversial. We describe two patients with AIDS who developed CMV encephalitis while receiving ganciclovir maintenance therapy for CMV retinitis. Moreover, there was no improvement in neurological status or virological and radiological response during a further induction course of ganciclovir. These observations suggest that the currently recommended therapeutic protocols with ganciclovir are not effective in the prevention and treatment of CMV encephalitis in patients with AIDS...|$|R

To describe a patient with GS who developed <b>cytomegalovirus</b> (CMV) <b>encephalitis</b> and showed a periodic electroencephalographic pattern and myoclonus. Case report. Outpatient neurology clinic at a university medical center. Patient A 64 -year-old man who developed periodic myoclonus involving the right half of his body and the left arm. Five years previously, the patient had undergone resection of a pathologically confirmed epithelial thymoma. Quantitative CMV polymerase chain reaction of the serum and cerebrospinal fluid showed strongly positive results (1 : 10 000), allowing the diagnosis of CMV encephalitis. To the best of our knowledge, myoclonus and periodic electroencephalographic pattern have not previously been reported in CMV encephalitis.

40|$|<b>Cytomegalovirus</b> <b>encephalitis</b> occurs {{rarely in}} {{transplant}} re-cipients. We describe {{a patient with}} cytomegalovirus ventri-culoencephalitis who had a very high CSF viral load but a low peripheral blood viral load. No resistance mutations were present in cerebrospinal fluid viral DNA, whereas DNA from blood showed a resistance mutation in the UL 54 gene {{but not in the}} UL 97 gene. Viral replication was intense in the brain ependyma and periventricular areas without evidence of peripheral cytomegalovirus disease. The data provide evi-dence for compartmentalization of cytomegalovirus infec-tion. Levels of ganciclovir and foscarnet in the cerebrospinal fluid may be inadequate for treatment, even for some drug-susceptible strains, and, together with periventricular rep-lication, may explain the disparity between cerebrospinal fluid viral load and peripheral blood viral load...|$|E
40|$|Polymerase chain {{reaction}} assays are {{a powerful tool}} for detecting the presence of infectious genomes in the cerebrospinal fluid. Positive results always mean a current or pending infection of the central nervous system. Subacute (> 7 days) or chronic infections induce an intrathecal humoral immune response and the appearance of oligoclonal IgG antibodies directed against the causal infectious agent. This local synthesis may be observed even in cases of severe systemic immunodeficiency. The use of polymerase {{chain reaction}}s in combination with the detection of a specific intrathecal immune response should represent the most reliable strategy for the diagnosis of viral and chronic infections of the central nervous system.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} evaluation {{was conducted in}} patients with AIDS and an autopsy diagnosis of <b>cytomegalovirus</b> (CMV) <b>encephalitis</b> to determine the relevance of clinical and laboratory findings in establishing a diagnosis. On autopsy of 100 patients, CMV encephalitis was diagnosed in 13 patients; eight had periventricular CMV encephalitis, four micronodular CMV encephalitis, and one both conditions. Seven patients had had a CMV infection previously (6 cases of retinitis, 1 case of colitis), and {{at the onset of}} encephalitis all of them were receiving a maintenance dose of ganciclovir. Examination of the CSF showed specific changes in patients with periventricular encephalitis. CT revealed no characteristic findings, while MRI showed an increased signal intensity on T 2 weighted images. CMV DNA amplification by nested PCR was performed in nine patients with CMV encephalitis; PCR was positive in eight patients whose CSF was collected during CMV encephalitis, and negative in one patient whose CSF was collected six months before death. In conclusion, some clinical findings suggest a presumptive diagnosis, especially of periventricular encephalitis, and nested PCR appears to be a reliable and rapid technique for making an antemortem diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cytomegalovirus</b> (CMV) <b>encephalitis</b> is well {{documented}} in immunosuppressed persons, but its pathogenesis has received little investigative attention. The examination of brain tissue from 2 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who had CMV encephalitis showed colocalization of CMV inclusions and trans-forming growth factor (TGF) -b in cells that contained astrocyte-specific glial filaments. To investigate the relationship between CMV and TGF-b in the brain, an ex vivo murine model of CMV-infected astrocytes was established. Cultures of primary murine (strain FVB/N) astrocytes inoculated with murine (Smith strain) CMV expressed, over time, increasing amounts of infectious CMV in parallel with increasing levels of TGF-b mRNA and peptide. Astrocyte release of CMV declined {{in the presence of}} antibody to TGF-b and increased substantially after the addition of exogenous TGF-b. These findings suggest that CMV infection of astrocytes induces the production of TGF-b, which in turn enhances productive CMV expression. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a b-herpesvirus that infects up to 70 % of adults in developed countries, such as the United States, and nearly 90 % of persons in de-veloping countries [1, 2]. The majority of infected per-sons are immunocompetent, and infection is usually asymptomatic. However, in infants and immunocom...|$|R
40|$|Paraffin-embedded {{necropsy}} {{material from}} 6 patients with human <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (HCMVE) corroborated by immunocytochemistry and 11 control cases were examined {{for the presence}} of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA by a nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). A characteristic 183 base pair (bp) fragment of the HCMV genome could readily be amplified in 4 cases of HCMVE. In 2 cases of HCMVE, viral DNA could be demonstrated only sporadically by PCR, due most likely to inefficient DNA extraction or DNA degradation. All control cases remained negative. The nPCR provides a specific method for detecting HCMV DNA in routinely processed biopsy and necropsy material and may be used in archival tissues for the diagnosis of infection. Fixation of samples and DNA extraction are, however, crucial steps and require careful control if PCR is used for detection of HCMV, to avoid false negative results...|$|E
40|$|Enhanced {{delivery}} of ganciclovir {{to the brain}} was demonstrated by a redox-based chemical delivery system. A ganciclovir monoester in which a 1 -methyl- 1, 4 -dihydronicotinate was covalently attached {{to one of the}} hydroxymethyl functions was prepared. The stability of the ganciclovir chemical delivery system (DHPG-CDS) was evaluated in aqueous buffers and organ homogenates. In vivo distribution studies in the rat indicated that while ganciclovir poorly penetrated into the central nervous system and was rapidly eliminated, DHPG-CDS provided for therapeutically relevant (2. 7 microM) and sustained levels of the parent compound through 6 h. An analysis of the area under the concentration curve indicated that the chemical delivery system delivered five times more ganciclovir than that of the parent drug. The high levels in the brain and reduced levels in the blood gave a brain-to-blood drug concentration ratio of 2. 54 for ganciclovir when delivered by the chemical delivery system, compared to a ratio of 0. 063 when the parent drug was administered. These data suggest that DHPG-CDS could be a useful adjunct for the treatment of <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>encephalitis...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To measure {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) ferritin in HIV infected patients with acute neurological episodes and to correlate the findings {{with the type}} and severity of neurological disease. METHODS: CSF ferritin and the ratio of CSF to serum albumin (QAlb) were prospectively measured in 27 consecutive HIV infected patients admitted to a specialist unit for investigation of acute neurological episodes; the results were compared with their clinical diagnoses. RESULTS: Ten patients had HIV associated dementia complex, six had cryptococcal meningitis, two had primary CNS lymphoma and nine had miscellaneous conditions including herpes simplex virus encephalitis, <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> cerebral toxoplasmosis and mononeuritis multiplex. Overall, 16 (59 %) patients had raised CSF ferritin levels, ranging from 13. 0 to 50. 2 micrograms/l, (median = 16. 1 micrograms/l: normal range = 1. 0 - 12. 0 micrograms/l). Thirteen of the 16 also had normal QAlb values, implying an intact CSF-blood barrier, and thus that local synthesis of ferritin had occurred. Elevated ferritin levels were not associated with particular neurological diagnoses. In those with HIV associated dementia complex there was no correlation between CSF ferritin levels and the severity of clinical cognitive deficit or the extent of magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated CSF ferritin level is a non-specific finding in HIV infected patients presenting with acute neurological episodes...|$|E
40|$|Human <b>cytomegalovirus</b> (HCMV) <b>encephalitis</b> {{in adult}} nonimmunosuppressed {{patients}} {{has rarely been}} reported. We have diagnosed HCMV encephalitis in an anti-HCMV immunoglobulin G-negative, nonimmunosuppressed young woman by HCMV DNA PCR and virus isolation from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). At the same time, HCMV antigen and HCMV DNA could be demonstrated in peripheral blood leukocytes, and the virus was isolated in fibroblast cultures. After 22 days of acute illness, the virus disappeared from the CSF. Remarkably, the patient did not generate detectable anti-HCMV antibodies within 5 months after the beginning of illness. To investigate the significance of HCMV DNA detection in CSF, samples of CSF, blood cells, and serum from 35 nonimmunosuppressed patients with various neurological disorders (but no herpes simplex virus central nervous system [CNS] disease) were tested for HCMV DNA, antigen, and antibodies. Eleven of these patients {{were found to be}} positive for virus DNA and/or antigen in peripheral blood leukocytes. Additionally, HCMV DNA was detected in the CSF of two patients with noninflammatory CNS diseases. A causative role of HCMV in the CNS diseases of these two patients was not evident. In summary, HCMV DNA amplification from CSF samples is a very suitable method to verify HCMV-associated encephalitis, but it should be taken into consideration that there are few cases of positive PCR with DNA from CSF without any known clinical correlative...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the frequency of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV- 6) DNA detection in the CSF of patients infected with HIV {{and its relation to}} brain disease and systemic HHV- 6 infection.   Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyse CSF samples from 365 consecutive HIV infected patients with neurological symptoms. When available, plasma and brain tissues from patients whose CSF was HHV- 6 positive were also studied.   HHV- 6 was found in the CSF of eight of the 365 patients (2. 2 %) : two had type A and four type B; the HHV- 6 variant could not be defined in the remaining two. All eight patients had neurological symptoms and signs related to concomitant opportunistic brain diseases, including <b>cytomegalovirus</b> (CMV) <b>encephalitis</b> in five patients whose CSF was also positive for CMV-DNA. Opportunistic infections but no other unexplained lesions were also found in the brain of all of the four patients who underwent neuropathological examination. Both HHV- 6 and CMV were also detected in the plasma of respectively five and seven of seven patients whose CSF was HHV- 6 positive.   In conclusion, HHV- 6 type A or B DNA was infrequently found in the CSF of HIV infected patients, in association with both CMV brain infection and systemic HHV- 6 replication. However, no certain relation between HHV- 6 and brain disease was found. ...|$|R

40|$|Background:   Viral {{encephalitis}} is {{a medical}} emergency. The prognosis depends mainly on the pathogen and host immunologic state. Correct immediate diagnosis and introduction of symptomatic and specific therapy has a dramatic influence upon survival and reduces the extent of permanent brain injury. Methods:   We searched the literature from 1966 to 2009. Recommendations were reached by consensus. Where there was lack of evidence but consensus was clear, we have stated our opinion as good practice points. Recommendations:   Diagnosis {{should be based on}} medical history and examination followed by CSF analysis for protein and glucose levels, cellular analysis, and identification of the pathogen by polymerase chain reaction amplification (recommendation level A) and serology (level B). Neuroimaging, preferably by MRI, is essential (level B). Lumbar puncture can follow neuroimaging when immediately available, but if this cannot be performed immediately, LP should be delayed only under unusual circumstances. Brain biopsy should be reserved only for unusual and diagnostically difficult cases. Patients must be hospitalized with easy access to intensive care units. Specific, evidence-based, antiviral therapy, acyclovir, is available for herpes encephalitis (level A) and may also be effective for varicella-zoster virus encephalitis. Ganciclovir and foscarnet can be given to treat <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> and pleconaril for enterovirus encephalitis (IV class evidence). Corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for acute viral encephalitis are not generally considered to be effective, and their use is controversial, but this important issue is currently being evaluated in a large clinical trial.

40|$|Foscarnet (phosphonoformate) is {{a potent}} virustatic drug against herpes-like viruses and is widely used in the therapy of {{cytomegalovirus}} infections in immunosuppressed patients. To obtain data on its penetration across the blood-brain barrier, we determined concentrations of foscarnet in cerebrospinal fluid and in plasma specimens from 26 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (stages 2 to 6 by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research classification) after a single infusion of 90 mg of foscarnet per kg of body weight and at steady state by electrochemical detection by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Penetration coefficients were correlated with {{the integrity of the}} blood-brain barrier. After a single infusion of foscarnet, levels in plasma ranged from 297 to 1, 775 micrograms/ml (990 to 5, 920 mumol/liter), with a mean of 766 +/- 400 micrograms/ml. Corresponding levels in cerebrospinal fluid were 57 to 225 micrograms/ml (190 to 750 mumol/liter), with a mean of 131 +/- 52 micrograms/ml. The penetration coefficient was 0. 05 to 0. 72 (mean, 0. 23 +/- 0. 16). At steady state, mean foscarnet levels in plasma were 464 +/- 219 micrograms/ml (1, 553 mumol/liter) and mean levels in cerebrospinal fluid were 308 +/- 155 micrograms/ml (1, 023 mumol/liter). The penetration coefficient was 0. 66 +/- 0. 11. Although penetration coefficients were highly variable after a single administration and at steady state, the concentrations of foscarnet attained in cerebrospinal fluid are sufficient for complete inhibition of cytomegalovirus replication in vitro. In conclusion, we show that foscarnet seems to be the drug of choice for the treatment of <b>cytomegalovirus</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> because it penetrates the blood-brain barrier and is found in the cerebrospinal fluid in virustatic concentrations. Foscarnet might be considered for additive therapy for human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis in combination with zidovudine or dideoxyinosine...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{investigate}} whether the CC-chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) - 1 {{could play a}} role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection of the central nervous system. This hypothesis was suggested by previous observations, including our finding of elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of this chemokine in patients with <b>cytomegalovirus</b> (CMV) <b>encephalitis.</b> DESIGN AND METHODS CSF levels of MCP- 1 were determined in 37 HIV-infected patients with neurological symptoms, and were compared with both the presence and severity of HIV- 1 encephalitis at post-mortem examination and CSF HIV RNA levels. MCP- 1 production by monocyte-derived macrophages was tested after in vitro infection of these cells by HIV. RESULTS CSF MCP- 1 levels were significantly higher in patients with (median, 4. 99 ng/ml) than in those without (median, 1. 72 ng/ml) HIV encephalitis. Elevated CSF MCP- 1 concentrations were also found in patients with CMV encephalitis and with concomitant HIV and CMV encephalitis (median, 3. 14 and 4. 23 ng/ml, respectively). HIV encephalitis was strongly associated with high CSF MCP- 1 levels (P = 0. 002), which were also correlated to high HIV- 1 RNA levels in the CSF (P = 0. 007), but not to plasma viraemia. In vitro, productive HIV- 1 infection of monocyte-derived macrophages upregulated the secretion of MCP- 1. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these in vivo and in vitro findings support a model whereby HIV encephalitis is sustained by virus replication in microglial cells, a process amplified by recruitment of mononuclear cells via HIV-induced MCP- 1...|$|R
