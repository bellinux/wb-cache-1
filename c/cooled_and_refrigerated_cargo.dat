50|$|Initial post-harvest storage {{conditions}} {{are critical to}} maintaining quality. Each crop has an optimum range of storage temperature and humidity. Also, certain crops cannot be effectively stored together, as unwanted chemical interactions can result. Various methods of high-speed <b>cooling,</b> <b>and</b> sophisticated <b>refrigerated</b> <b>and</b> atmosphere-controlled environments, are employed to prolong freshness, particularly in large-scale operations.|$|R
