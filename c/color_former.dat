Primary [ilg] development was [first] used for [itself by Homolk[ilg]n 1907. He wanted [to] find developing agents whose oxidation products [ilg]re themselves insoluble and preferably colored. The [ilg] commonly known agent of such a type is of cou[ilg] pyro. A pyro develope[d] image shows the character[istic] brownish stain, and even after the silver has been removed by bleaching the stain image is very evident. The qualitity of sulfite in the pyro developer, as is [w]ell known, cont[ilg]s the amount of stain obtained. There are several other primary developing agents [s]ome even giving colored images that might be [u]sed in color photography where the spectral hues [req]uired are quite specific., Secondary color development is of most [ilg]rest at the [p]resent time because of its [ilg] rang[e] of color and control. Fischer and [ilg]ist published the first material on secondary [ilg] or development in 1914 and additions to the s[ilg] have been rapidly increasing for the last t[ilg] years. A large number of color formers are k[ilg] which couple in a manner still under disc[uss]ion. (although the present explanation is that t[h]e developer's oxidation product couples when it is formed with a <b>color</b> <b>former</b> to yield {{a more or less}} insoluble dye). Thus is secondary coupling we use not the oxidation product of the develop[ment] alone but compounds that unite with it and g[ilg] brightly colored dyes. The majority of the early d[y]e images w[ilg] of the indoaniline, indamine and indophenol group, although as the list has grown rapidly in rece[nt] years many new types have been used. The latest [c]onvenient summary of known couplers was published by Tull. T[he] dyes must of course be relatively [i]nsoluble after [ilg]mation, and for practical purposes fairly [ilg]st to lig[ilg] and of the proper hue., The actual application of dye coupling to m[ono]chrome photography has been oddly enough, rather rare. The research that ha[s] been done on dye couplers has generally been carries on with the idea of using the results in direct color photography. In view of the infinite variety of hues that may be obtained and the simplicity of their production, the use of single or multiple black and white prints should be interested in the making of monochrome prints or transparencies. An understanding of the procedure is also helpful in considering the more complicated applications of the same ideas in the color photography of today and the near future, The production of dye-coupled monochrome prints necessitates the same steps as are used in making a normal black and white print. The prints are exposed, developed, rinsed, fixed, washed and dried. The color of the final image will depend chiefly on the composition of the developing solution. If desired, completed black and white prints can be bleached and redeveloped to obtain similar results although the results obtained {{do not seem to be}} of as high quality in such prints as in those directly developed in [ilg] special developers. The emulsions useable for d[ye] coupling development are quite numerous al[th]ough some chlorides and chlorobromides do not work al all except by redevelopment. These papers make the dye form in the developing solution even before actual silver development is evident. Most of the common enlarging papers such as Kodabrom, Velous Black, Brovira, etc. work very well as do the transparency materials from the same manufacturers. The exposure of any of these sensitive emultions is approximately the same as that used when making a black and white print., The mixing of the developer solution probably offers the greatest deviation from normal procedure. The working solution is made up from tex parts of a fairly normal developer with one part of a <b>color</b> <b>former</b> or mixture of color formers. The developer solution is composed of, Sodium sulfite 18 grams, Sodium carbonate 40 grams, Potassium bromide 1 grams, Developing agent 0. 5 - 2. 0 grams, Water to make 1 liter, The composition of this developer for monochrome work is not as critical as for three color work. The quantities of sulfite or carbonate may be varied within reasonable limited but the quantity of developing agent does not have considerable effect on the result. As the quantity of developing agent increases, the strength and contrast of the image increases until there is considerable gerneral stain produced.

The color varies somewhat with the emulsion used. In the diagram page 16, the three primary color formers are {{shown at the}} points of a triangle. Any desired color between these primaries {{can be obtained by}} mixing color formers at the ends of connecting lines. The colors of bleached prints will be obtained along the sides of the triangle while unbleached prints will have their color [ilg] mixed with a greenish black silver imag[e] and the colors so formed will lie inside the triangle., Limiting the developer to one-[ilg] gram per liter pure whites can be obtained. W[hen] prints are being redeveloped after bleaching the [q]uantity can be increased and the development t[ilg]e shortened. This solution is best made up as a stoc[k s]olution containting everything but the developing ag[ent] which is added shortly before use (same day). Th[e r]eason for this procedure is that the developer so[l]ution changed fairly rapidly if fully mixed due to fairly high alkalinity. The color formers are ma[de] up as 1 % solutions of the chemical in some or[gan]ic solvent such as alcohol or acetone. The color [ilg]ers are generally insoluble in a neutral water solution. These <b>color</b> <b>former</b> stock solutions will keep in bro[ilg] bottles for over a month without noticeable c[h]ange. The developer solution is put into the tray or tank and the proper amount of <b>color</b> <b>former</b> added just before development. The activity of the fin[a]l mixed solution changed quite rapidly and prints c[a]nnot be duplicated without making compensations in exposure and development time. Large quantities of prints can be tank developed at one time in racks. The time of development controls the contrast as in black and white work although as in al printing papers, the development should always be longer than a specified minimum., The exposure should be adjusted that development takes at least three minutes and it may be carried up to ten minutes without danger of fogging the paper if properly handled. The developed print is rinsed for about one minute in running water and then immersed in a hypo bath for not over fifteen minutes. Due to the fact that a normal acid fixing bath decolorizes some of the dyes, and alkaline bath is used. The formula is:, Sodium sulfite 40 grams, 25 % Hypo solution 1 liter, Formaldehyde 100 cc., After fixing, the prints are washed as usual and dried. The procedure when using transparency stock is exactly the same., The worker can exercise the greatest control in the mixing of the developer solution. For normal work the two developing agents found most useful were diethyl-p-phenylene-diamin[ilg] hydrochloride and 2 -amino- 5 -diethylaminotoluene mono-hydrochloride. Either one can be substituted [ilg] the formula for developing agent although somewhat different colors are obtained with some color [ilg]ormers as indicated in Table I. The most useful co[ilg] formers for common use are maginta (p-nitrophenylacetonitrile), a blue (a-naphthol), a cyan (2, 4 dichloro- 1 -naphthol), and a yellow (acetoacet 2, 5 dichloroanilide). These four couplers have been chosen because of the possibility of getting almost a[n]y desired color from them, and also because they give images of roughly similar contrast when proce[ss]ed under the described conditions. l By using the four ocuplers almost any conceivable color can be obtained by simply making the <b>color</b> <b>former</b> sol[utio]n {{to be added to the}} developer from combinations of two or more of the above stock solutions. Thus in Table I we have a few common combinations that will possibly prove useful as a starting point. With a few prints made from known couplers or combinations, any color desired between two chosen prints can be obtained simply by changing the relative quantities of the color formers as shown in Table II. It is thus apparent that the common sepias, browns, and blues are readily obtained by direct development without taking longer to produce than a normal black and white print, and that many other colors that cannot be obtained in any other way are easily secured. The firal image in such work consists of both dye and silver. If a pure dye image is desired the fully washed print may be bleached in Farmer's reducer. The removal of the black silver of course brightens the colors to a considerable extent, which is desired is a matter of personal preference. The removal of silver leads to a lowering of contrast in the picture so that when bleaching is contemplated the print development should be carried a little further than required for an unbleached print. The permanence of some of the colors obtained is open to question as some of them are undoubtedly not very fast to light. Prints exposed for over a year under normal conditions, however, show no signs of fading, although if left in direct sunlight for some time fading is noticeable. As most colors fade under such treatment, it is not a serious objection to their use. For practical purposes, the prints are stable enough. It is of course evident that transparencies may be made in a similar mannder either on film, plates, or the special materials., The application of such methods of making colored pictures to direct color photography is naturally of great interest. There are many problems involved in the manufacture of monopacks for such work, among them the choice of color formers which have the proper spectral hues as well as satisfying the rigid demands of the manufacture of the material. There must be rigid control of coating and sensitization of emulsions as well as processing conditions, any errors in which will upset the balance of the six variables of density and contrast. The outstanding success of the new Agfacolor and Kodachrome processes testifies to the possibilities of the dye coupling method. The basic difference in these two processes is that the Agfa process uses a monopack film in the three, (Continued on page 32); 18; photo technique September 1939 " [...] on article...|$|E

When this film is developed after reversal in the proper developer, the colors are formed. The Kodachrome monopack film {{on the other hand}} introduces the <b>color</b> <b>formers</b> to the proper emulsion layers by controlled diffusion during development. Each method produces excellent results., The obvious simplification for color prints is to use stripping films or papers, developing the proper positives in the appropriate solution and later combining them in register. The nearest spectral colors can be obtained by using the magenta (p-nitrophenylacetonitrile), the cyan (2, 4 dichloro- 1 -naphthol), and the yellow (acetoact 2, 5 dichloroanilide), all with developing agent 2 -amino- 5 -diethylaminotoluene mono hydrochloride. The positives are of course bleached to remove the silver and then superposed. In laying down the colored positives, the yellow and magenta should be placed down first as the cyan is the most transparent of the three images. The same system can of course be used in the making of color transparencies from a set of separation negatives. The dye coupling method is unexcelled for making rapid proofs from a set of separations as it is possible to have the finished product (wet) in an hour and a half. Such proofs are not only easy to make but quite inexpensive and will indicate i what direction correction or retouching should follow before the final color print is made., Dye coupling methods, while still relatively undeveloped, give promise of advancement toward that desired simplification of color photography. The often repeated wish for a system as straightforward as black and white processing is at least being approached. The common black silver picture image rather seems to be nearing that age when it is only a by-product in the formation of a colored image., References:, Klein - 'Colour Cinematography,', Tull - British Journal of Photography - October 7 and 14, 1938., Movie Makers - April, 1939., Kodachrome patent literature., Wilson - American Photography - March, 1939.
