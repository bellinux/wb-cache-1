50|$|A common {{proximity}} {{format is}} 26 bit Wiegand. This format uses a <b>facility</b> <b>code</b> also called a site <b>code.</b> The <b>facility</b> <b>code</b> is unique number {{common to all}} of the cards in a particular set. The idea is an organization has their own <b>facility</b> <b>code</b> and then numbered cards incrementing from 1. Another organization has a different <b>facility</b> <b>code</b> and their card set also increments from 1. Thus different organizations can have card sets with the same card numbers but since the <b>facility</b> <b>codes</b> differ, the cards only work at one organization. This idea worked fine for a while but there is no governing body controlling card numbers, different manufacturers can supply cards with identical <b>facility</b> <b>codes</b> and identical card numbers to different organizations. Thus there is a problem of duplicate cards. To counteract this problem some manufacturers have created formats beyond 26 bit Wiegand that they control and issue to an organization.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Most routing {{protocols}} in disruption tolerant networks use redundant transmissions {{to explore the}} diversities in routing paths {{in order to reduce}} data transmission delay. However mobile nodes in DTN usually have limited energy and may prefer fewer transmissions for longer lifetime. Hence, it is vital to carefully balance the tradeoff between data transmission delay and the amount of transmissions among mobile nodes. We consider the problem to route a batch of data packets in DTN. By making an analogy between the routing protocol and lower density erasure codes, we investigate the information-theoretical optimal number of transmission in delivering data. With extensive theoretical analysis and simulations, we show that network <b>coding</b> <b>facilities</b> a better tradeoff between resource usage and protocol performance, and that protocol offers unique advantages over replication-based protocols...|$|R

They also use a non-volatile memory so that no information is lost if the batteries go flat. This will allow the safe to be opened when the batteries are changed after the pre-set time if the correct code is entered. Some electronic combination locks with a time-delay feature require the code to be entered twice: once to start the timer, and a second to unlock and open the safe entered after the delay period has expired.|$|R

40|$|Smartcards {{can be seen}} {{as service}} {{providing}} entities that implement a secure, tamper-proof storage and offer computational resources which make them ideally suited for a variety of tasks such as authentication, management of personal profiles, and other kinds of secure information processing. Integration of smartcards into networked environments though, has not been achieved yet in a transparent manner. In this paper we describe the requirements for the design of a middleware for smartcards and propose a platform for the execution of mobile code as the core of such middleware. This is in contrast to traditional architectures based on a request-broker scheme that would need huge standardization efforts to be applicable to smartcards. As an instance of such middleware, we describe our implementation which is centered around the mobile <b>code</b> <b>facilities</b> available in Java and the service trading features of Jini. 1.

40|$|Aims: Over {{the last}} years, the {{management}} of patients with head and neck cancer has become extremely complex, and the knowledge and information needed {{to care for a}} patient can no longer be trusted to the memory or manual systems. Recent advances in data processing technology offer the potential for creating ideal instruments to organize, store and analyze such information. Methods: We developed a computerized database management system (H&N-CDMS) which fulfils the following requisites: easy to use even by operators not expert in informatics; minimum possibility of insertion of ambiguous data; use for clinical and research purposes; can be interconnected in a network of similar database operating in other centers; can be expanded to image processing. Conclusions: The configuration of the system is described and its main characteristics are discussed: data entry and <b>coding</b> <b>facilities,</b> data accuracy and standardization, security and anonymity, data retrieval and analysis. H&H-CDMS is a user-friendly tool for head and neck cancer data management in clinical and research environments...|$|R

40|$|The Napa {{earthquake}} (Mw= 6; depth 10 km) {{occurred on}} the August 24 th, 2014 and caused severe damages because of both ground motion and surface displacement. Large strong motion was recorded in the Napa City area (0. 4 g), preferentially affecting the pre-Building <b>Code</b> <b>facilities,</b> and damage pattern was also controlled by the 2 D geometry of the Napa Basin. This event questions the scaling relationships usually applied in seismic hazard studies to infer magnitude from measurable surface faulting parameters, with high values of maximum displacement (45 cm) and surface rupture length (12. 5 km) for such a moderate magnitude. Huge amount of afterslip took place on several sections of the main strand, whereas secondary ruptures occurred more than 2 km off the main segment. The scientific community used a large panel of techniques, from classical field mapping to modern techniques (InSAR, LiDAR), providing an interesting feedback {{for the study of}} future earthquakes and the updating of seismotectonic databases (e. g. surface ruptures). Finally, besides these seismotectonic peculiarities of the quake, the regulatory and prevention aftermath will be followed carefully...|$|R
