5|$|<b>Cathodoluminescence</b> (CL) — light {{emission}} excited by electron beam — {{is a process}} commonly observed in TV screens. An electron beam can be finely focused and scanned across the studied material. This technique is widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It would be beneficial to apply this technique to carbon nanotubes. However, no reliable CL, i.e. sharp peaks assignable to certain (n,m) indices, has been detected from carbon nanotubes yet.|$|E
5|$|The defects can be {{detected}} by different types of spectroscopy, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), luminescence induced by light (photoluminescence, PL) or electron beam (<b>cathodoluminescence,</b> CL), and absorption {{of light in the}} infrared (IR), visible and UV parts of the spectrum. Absorption spectrum is used not only to identify the defects, but also to estimate their concentration; it can also distinguish natural from synthetic or enhanced diamonds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cathodoluminescence,</b> the {{emission}} of light when atoms excited by high-energy electrons {{return to their}} ground state, is analogous to UV-induced fluorescence, and some materials such as zinc sulfide and some fluorescent dyes, exhibit both phenomena. Over the last decades, <b>cathodoluminescence</b> was most commonly experienced as the light emission from the inner surface of the cathode ray tube in television sets and computer CRT monitors. In the SEM, CL detectors either collect all light emitted by the specimen or can analyse the wavelengths emitted by the specimen and display an emission spectrum or {{an image of the}} distribution of <b>cathodoluminescence</b> emitted by the specimen in real color.|$|E
25|$|Zircon {{has played}} an {{important}} role during the evolution of radiometric dating. Zircons contain trace amounts of uranium and thorium (from 10 ppm up to 1 wt%) and can be dated using several modern analytical techniques. Because zircons can survive geologic processes like erosion, transport, even high-grade metamorphism, they contain a rich and varied record of geological processes. Currently, zircons are typically dated by uranium-lead (U-Pb), fission-track, <b>cathodoluminescence,</b> and U+Th/He techniques. For instance, imaging the <b>cathodoluminescence</b> emission from fast electrons {{can be used as a}} prescreening tool for high-resolution secondary-ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS) to image the zonation pattern and identify regions of interest for isotope analysis. This is done using an integrated <b>cathodoluminescence</b> and scanning electron microscope. Zircons in sedimentary rock can identify the sediment source.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{substances}} produce {{light when}} they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, {{a process known as}} fluorescence. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as phosphorescence. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. <b>Cathodoluminescence</b> is one example. This mechanism is used in cathode ray tube television sets and computer monitors.|$|E
25|$|The SEM {{produces}} images by {{probing the}} specimen with a focused electron beam that is scanned across a rectangular {{area of the}} specimen (raster scanning). When the electron beam interacts with the specimen, it loses energy {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. The lost energy is converted into alternative forms such as heat, emission of low-energy secondary electrons and high-energy backscattered electrons, light emission (<b>cathodoluminescence)</b> or X-ray emission, all of which provide signals carrying information about the properties of the specimen surface, such as its topography and composition. The image displayed by an SEM maps the varying intensity of any of these signals into the image in a position corresponding to the position of the beam on the specimen when the signal was generated. In the SEM image of an ant shown below and to the right, the image was constructed from signals produced by a secondary electron detector, the normal or conventional imaging mode in most SEMs.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a direct}} bandgap material, {{recombination}} of these electron-hole pairs {{will result in}} cathodoluminescence; if the sample contains an internal electric field, such as is present at a p-n junction, the SEM beam injection of carriers will cause electron beam induced current (EBIC) to flow.

2500|$|The signals {{used by a}} {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} to produce an image result from interactions of the electron beam with atoms at various depths within the sample. Various types of signals are produced including secondary electrons (SE), reflected or back-scattered electrons (BSE), characteristic X-rays and light (<b>cathodoluminescence)</b> (CL), absorbed current (specimen current) and transmitted electrons. [...] Secondary electron detectors are standard equipment in all SEMs, but it is rare that a single machine would have detectors for all other possible signals.|$|E
2500|$|Measurement of {{the energy}} of photons emitted from the {{specimen}} is a common method to get analytical capabilities. Examples are the Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detectors used in elemental analysis and <b>Cathodoluminescence</b> microscope (CL) systems that analyse the intensity and spectrum of electron-induced luminescence in (for example) geological specimens. [...] In SEM systems using these detectors {{it is common to}} color code these extra signals and superimpose them in a single color image, so that differences in the distribution of the various components of the specimen can be seen clearly and compared. Optionally, the standard secondary electron image can be merged with the one or more compositional channels, so that the specimen's structure and composition can be compared. [...] Such images can be made while maintaining the full integrity of the original signal data, which is not modified in any way.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} imaging mode {{collects}} low-energy (<50 eV) secondary electrons that are {{ejected from the}} k-shell of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate within a few nanometers from the sample surface. The electrons are detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which {{is a type of}} scintillator-photomultiplier system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (<b>cathodoluminescence),</b> which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical signal output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue video display, or subjected to analog-to-digital conversion and displayed and saved as a digital image. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the detector. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons [...] "escape" [...] from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the [...] "escape" [...] distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons image resolution less than 0.5nbsp&nm is possible.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cathodoluminescence</b> is {{an optical}} and {{electromagnetic}} phenomenon in which electrons impacting on a luminescent material {{such as a}} phosphor, cause the emission of photons which may have wavelengths in the visible spectrum. A familiar example is the generation of light by an electron beam scanning the phosphor-coated inner surface of the screen of a television that uses a cathode ray tube. <b>Cathodoluminescence</b> is the inverse of the photoelectric effect, in which electron emission is induced by irradiation with photons.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cathodoluminescence</b> {{is another}} mode of {{detection}} involving the photons {{generated by the}} beam-specimen interaction.

However, not much is known on its use outside the experimental prototype originally tested. Clearly, ESEM is more powerful and meaningful under this detection mode than SEM, since the natural surface of any specimen can be examined in the imaging process. <b>Cathodoluminescence</b> is a materials property, but with various specimen treatments required and other limitations in SEM the properties are obscured or altered or impossible to detect and hence this mode of detection has not become popular in the past. The advent of ESEM with its unlimited potential may provoke more interest in this area too, in the future.|$|E
