40|$|A {{confocal}} scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO) {{was used}} {{to examine the effects of}} <b>confocal</b> <b>optics</b> on the image of the human fundus in vivo. Patients from a retinal clinic and a glaucoma clinic were examined using the cSLO in the confocal mode. A degree of optical sectioning could be achieved, and the results agree with a best axial resolution of 300 microns measured in a model eye. The main advantage of using a confocal system was found to be the improved contrast of the images. This improved the resolution of structures such as the lamina cribrosa and optic disc drusen which are seen in low contrast in conventional images. The improved contrast of the confocal images is partly achieved by excluding light which has been scattered within the plane of focus. Structures which multiply scatter light will become less visible with <b>confocal</b> <b>optics</b> and hard exudates were found to be an example of such a structure. The cSLO and the fundus camera are seen as complementary instruments rather than as alternatives for imaging the fundus. It is envisaged that confocal imaging will enable details of the fundus to be revealed which are at present not seen in conventional images...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Most current superresolution (SR) {{microscope}} techniques {{surpass the}} diffraction limit {{at the expense}} of temporal resolution, compromising their applications to live-cell imag-ing. Here we describe a new SR fluorescence microscope based on <b>confocal</b> microscope <b>optics,</b> which we name the spinning disk superresolution microscope (SDSRM). Theoretically, the SDSRM is equivalent to a structured illumination microscope (SIM) and achieves a spatial resolution of 120 nm, double that of the diffraction limit of wide-field fluorescence micros-copy. However, the SDSRM is 10 times faster than a conventional SIM because SR signals are recovered by optical demodulation through the stripe pattern of the disk. Therefore a single SR image requires only a single averaged image through the rotating disk. On the basis of this theory, we modified a commercial spinning disk confocal microscope. The improved reso-lution around 120 nm was confirmed with biological samples. The rapid dynamics of micro-tubules, mitochondria, lysosomes, and endosomes were observed with temporal resolutions of 30 – 100 frames/s.

The 442 -nm line allowed efficient excitation of Chromomycin A 3, with minimal background autofluorescence, to visualize GC-rich heterochromatin as an aid to chromosome identification. Sequential excitation with 442 - and 488 -nm light enabled ratio imaging of cytosolic pH using BCECF. The red HeNe laser penetrated deep into intact plant tissues, being less prone to scattering than shorter blue lines, and was also used to image fluorescent samples in reflection, prior to fluorescence measurements, to reduce photobleaching.

Measured focus differences between blue, green and red wavelengths, for commonly used objectives, were up to half the optical section thickness for both our multi-laser system and a multi-line single-laser instrument.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Confocal</b> {{adaptive}} <b>optics</b> scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) images {{provide a}} sensitive measure of cone structure. However, {{the relationship between}} structural findings of diminished cone reflectivity and visual function is unclear. We used fundus-referenced testing to evaluate visual function in regions of apparent cone loss identified using confocal AOSLO images. Methods: A patient diagnosed with acute bilateral foveolitis had spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) (Spectralis HRA + OCT system [Heidelberg Engineering, Vista, CA, USA]) images indicating focal loss of the inner segment-outer segment junction band with an intact, but hyper-reflective, external limiting membrane. Five years after symptom onset, visual acuity had improved from 20 / 80 to 20 / 25, but the retinal appearance remained unchanged compared to 3 months after symptoms began. We performed structural assessments using SD-OCT, directional OCT (non-standard use of a prototype on loan from Carl Zeiss Meditec) and AOSLO (custom-built system). We also administered fundus-referenced functional tests {{in the region of}} apparent cone loss, including analysis of preferred retinal locus (PRL), AOSLO acuity, and microperimetry with tracking SLO (TSLO) (prototype system). To determine AOSLO-corrected visual acuity, the scanning laser was modulated with a tumbling E consistent with 20 / 30 visual acuity. Visual sensitivity was assessed in and around the lesion using TSLO microperimetry. Complete eye examination, including standard measures of best-corrected visual acuity, visual field tests, color fundus photos, and fundus auto-fluorescence were also performed. Results: Despite a lack of visible cone profiles in the foveal lesion, fundus-referenced vision testing demonstrated visual function within the lesion consistent with cone function. The PRL was within the lesion of apparent cone loss at the fovea. AOSLO visual acuity tests were abnormal, but measurable: for trials in which the stimulus remained completely within the lesion, the subject got 48 % correct, compared to 78 % correct when the stimulus was outside the lesion. TSLO microperimetry revealed reduced, but detectible, sensitivity thresholds within the lesion. Conclusions and importance: Fundus-referenced visual testing proved useful to identify functional cones despite apparent photoreceptor loss identified using AOSLO and SD-OCT. While AOSLO and SD-OCT appear to be sensitive for the detection of abnormal or absent photoreceptors, changes in photoreceptors that are identified with these imaging tools do not correlate completely with visual function in every patient. Fundus-referenced vision testing is a useful tool to indicate the presence of cones that may be amenable to recovery or response to experimental therapies despite not being visible on confocal AOSLO or SD-OCT images...|$|R

40|$|Heavy metal uptake {{in plants}} is an {{important}} area not only for basic research, {{but also because of}} its impact on human nutrition and its application for the phytoremediation of contaminated soils. One of the most interesting topics in this area of research is the localisation and speciation of toxic metals&metalloids (e. g. As, Cd, Cu, Zn) inside the plant (e. g. [1], [2]). Here, we analyzed the distribution of non-hyperaccumulated As, Cd, Cu and Zn in the metal-sensitive shoot model plant Ceratophyllum demersum by µ XRF, and furthermore studied tissue-specific As speciation in the same sample using confocal µ XANES [3 - 5]. Samples of living leaves were prepared in capillaries, shock-frozen in supercooled isopentane, and maintained frozen-hydrated at about 100 K throughout the measurement. Elements in micro X-ray fluorescence (µ XRF) tomograms were quantified using standard-filled capillaries including a tomographic correction for X ray absorption in the sample. Measurements of As-stressed plants revealed that As was mainly sequestered in the epidermis. However, increasing As in the nutrient solution from 1 µM to 5 µM resulted in further increase of As in the vein and mesophyll but not in the epidermis of young leaves. Copper was mainly localized in the vein, and it did not change upon As exposure. In contrast, Zn was homogenously distributed over the whole leaf in control plants, but with increasing As, Zn was exported more towards the epidermis [3]. The in situ speciation of As in the same leaves was performed through µ XANES coupled to <b>confocal</b> detector <b>optics.</b> Thus we could distinguish As speciation at the tissue level i. e. epidermis, mesophyll and vein tissues (including xylem, phloem and separating tissue in between). The epidermis of a mature leaf contained the highest proportion of thiol-bound As (mostly with PCs), while in young leaves a lower proportion of As was thiol-bound. Further, at higher As concentrations the percentage of unbound AsIII increased in the vein and mesophyll of young leaves. Micro-XRF of Cd exposed plant leaves revealed changing distribution patterns of Cd and Zn at non-toxic (0. 2 nM, 2 nM), moderately toxic (20 nM) and lethally toxic (200 nM) levels of Cd. Increasing Cd led to enhanced sequestration of Cd into non-photosynthetic tissues like epidermis and vein. At toxic Cd concentrations, Zn was redistributed and mainly found in the vein along with Cd, indicating an inhibition of their export from the vein [4]. At deficient and optimal copper supply, Cu was mainly localized in the vein. Copper deficiency did not alter the Cu distribution pattern, but lowered the tissue concentrations. In contrast, at toxic Cu after two weeks Cu was sequestered from veins towards the mesophyll and epidermis, with Cu concentrations in the epidermis reaching about half of the concentration in the vein. Longer treatment did not further increase the epidermal copper accumulation, but only Cu accumulation in the vein. Zn content of the leaves was reduced by increasing copper. Cu deficiency did not only increase Zn accumulation in the leaves, but also changed Zn distribution. While at optimal and toxic Cu, Zn was rather homogeneously distributed throughout the leaves, at deficient copper supply the additionally accumulated Zn was sequestered to the epidermis [5].

40|$|AbstractFluorescence {{correlation}} spectroscopy (FCS) {{can provide a}} wealth of information about biological and chemical systems on a broad range of time scales (1 s). Numerical modeling of the FCS observation volume combined with measurements has revealed, however, that the standard assumption of a three-dimensional Gaussian FCS observation volume is not a valid approximation under many common measurement conditions. As a result, the FCS autocorrelation will contain significant, systematic artifacts that are most severe with <b>confocal</b> <b>optics</b> when using a large detector aperture and aperture-limited illumination. These optical artifacts manifest themselves in the fluorescence correlation as an apparent additional exponential component or diffusing species with significant (> 30 %) amplitude that can imply extraneous kinetics, shift the measured diffusion time by as much as ∼ 80 %, and cause the axial ratio to diverge. Artifacts can be minimized or virtually eliminated by using a small confocal detector aperture, underfilled objective back-aperture, or two-photon excitation. However, using a detector aperture that is smaller or larger than the optimal value (∼ 4. 5 optical units) greatly reduces both the count rate per molecule and the signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, there is a tradeoff between optimizing signal-to-noise and reducing experimental artifacts in one-photon FCS...|$|E
