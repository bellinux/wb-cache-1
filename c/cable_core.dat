50|$|Optical fiber {{consists}} of a core and a cladding layer, selected for total internal reflection due to {{the difference in the}} refractive index between the two. In practical fibers, the cladding is usually coated with a layer of acrylate polymer or polyimide.

Individual coated fibers (or fibers formed into ribbons or bundles) then have a tough resin buffer layer and/or core tube(s) extruded around them to form the <b>cable</b> <b>core.</b> Several layers of protective sheathing, depending on the application, are added to form the cable. Rigid fiber assemblies sometimes put light-absorbing ("dark") glass between the fibers, to prevent light that leaks out of one fiber from entering another.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{submarine}} power cables is {{the transport of}} electric current at high voltage. The electric core is a concentric assembly of inner conductor, electric insulation and protective layers. The conductor is made from copper or aluminum wires, the latter material having a small but increasing market share. Conductor sizes ≤ 1200 are most common, but sizes ≥ 2400 mm2 have been made occasionally. For voltages ≥ 12 kV the conductors are round. Three different types of electric insulation around the conductor are mainly used today.Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) is used up to 420 kV system voltage. It is produced by extrusion in insulation thickness of up to about 30 mm. 36 kV class cables have only 5.5 - 8 mm insulation thickness. Certain formulations of XLPE insulation {{can also be used}} for DC.Low-pressure oil-filled cables have an insulation lapped from paper strips. The entire <b>cable</b> <b>core</b> is impregnated with a low-viscosity insulation fluid (mineral oil or synthetic). A central oil channel in the conductor facilitates oil flow when the cable gets warm. Rarely used in submarine cables due to oil pollution risk at cable damage. Is used up to 525 kV.Mass-impregnated cables have also a paper-lapped insulation but the impregnation compound is highly viscous and does not exit when the cable is damaged. MI insulation can be used for massive HVDC cables up to 525 kV. Cables ≥ 52 kV are equipped with an extruded lead sheath to prevent water intrusion. No other materials have been accepted so far. The lead alloy is extruded onto the insulation in long lengths (over 50 km is possible). In this stage the product is called <b>cable</b> <b>core.</b> In single-core cables the core is surrounded by a concentric armoring. In three-core cables, three cable cores are laid-up in a spiral configuration before the armoring is applied.The armouring consists most often of steel wires, soaked in bitumen for corrosion protection. Since the alternating magnetic field in ac cables causes losses in the armoring those cables are sometimes equipped with non-magnetic metallic materials (stainless steel, copper, brass). Modern three-core cables, e.g. for the interconnection of offshore wind turbines) carry often optical fibers for data transmission or temperature measurement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{renewable}} energy source is considered as a good measure {{to cope with the}} global warming problem and the fossil energy exhaustion. The construction of electric power plant such as an offshore wind farm is rapidly increasing and this trend is expected to be continued during this century. The bulky and long distance power transmission media is essential to support and promote the sustainable expansion of {{renewable energy}} source. DC power cable is generally considered as the best solution and the demand for DC electric power has been rapidly increasing. Especially, the high temperature superconducting (HTS) DC cable system begins to make a mark because of its advantages of huge power transmission capacity, low transmission loss and other environmental friendly aspects. Technical contents of DC HTS cable system are very similar to those of AC HTS cable system. However the DC HTS cable can be operated near its critical current if the heat generation is insignificant, while the operating current of AC HTS cable is generally selected at about 50 ~ 70 % of the critical current because of AC loss. We chose the specifications of the <b>cable</b> <b>core</b> of 'Tres Amigas' project as an example for our study and investigated the heat generation when the DC HTS cable operated near the critical current by some electric and thermal analyses.

30|$|By Eq. (1), {{the wave}} {{impedance}} decreases as the distributed capacitance increases, and increases as the distributed reactance increases. Usually the wave impedance of overhead lines is between 270 and 380  Ω [14]. The mutual inductance {{approaches to the}} self-reactance when the <b>cable</b> <b>cores</b> are arranged closely. The equivalent distributed reactance is greatly reduced when the values of currents in two cores are the same with opposite directions. At the same time, when {{the distance between the}} <b>cable</b> <b>cores</b> is closer and the insulation material between the cores has a relative dielectric constant up to 4 or 5, the distributed capacitance is greatly increased. So the cable’s wave impedance would be much less than overhead line’s impedance. The cable’s wave impedance would be approximately 1 / 7 of overhead line’s impedance [15]. From Eq. (2), {{it can be seen that}} the transmission capability of a cable is approximately 7 times those of overhead lines or catenaries at the same voltage level, since the natural power is inversely proportional to the wave impedance. Empirical data [14] show that the output power at one side of a single loop (head-to-end) of 35  kV overhead lines can reach up to 10  MW with a transmission distance of approximately 20  km, while the output power of cables under the same condition can reach up to 70  MW (for double-loop circuit lines to 140  MW). Thus it can be derived that the cable’s one-side transmission distance is up to 100  km or longer. It is able to fully meet the needs of any metro or light rail line.|$|R

40|$|The {{breakdown}} of insulation in cables while in service can cause considerable damage to {{equipment and the}} accessories {{to which they are}} connected. PD in cables arises due to the overstressing of cable insulation resulting from electric field enhancement caused by imperfections in <b>cable</b> <b>core</b> and screen. The nature and magnitude of PD activity depends upon the type of defect, aging, environmental factors, applied voltage and cable loading. Reduction in system voltage can potentially reduce PD, which will correspondingly extend the service life of the cable. Currently, industry voltage statutory requirements permit ± 6 % tolerance setting on nominal voltage on distribution networks. This ± 6 % voltage reduction on may have little or an adverse effect on PD magnitude depending on the nature of defect present in the cable. Hence there is a clear requirement to pre-determine the PD inception voltage in cables through laboratory experiments to understand the significance of voltage reduction. This means to verify the effect of voltage reduction on extinguishing or minimizing PD activity in cables. In this paper, range of voltages at which PD incepts termed as partial discharge inception voltage(PDIV) is measured using a test cell containing different types of electrode configuration having different spacing.

40|$|As {{with most}} {{elements}} of infrastructure, electrical wiring is innocuous; usually hidden away and unnoticed until it fails. Failure of infrastructure, however, sometimes leads to serious {{health and safety}} hazards. Electrical wiring fails when the polymeric (usually rubber) insulation material that sheathes the conductor gets embrittled with age from exposure to pressure, temperature or radiation cycling or when the insulation gets removed by the chafing of wires against each other. Miles of such wiring {{can be found in}} typical aircraft, with significant lengths of the wiring immersed in aviation fuel - a recipe for an explosion if a spark were to occur. Diagnosing the health of wiring is thus an important aspect of monitoring the health of aging aircraft. Stress wave propagation through wiring affords a quick and non-invasive method for health monitoring. The extent to which a stress wave propagating through the <b>cable</b> <b>core</b> gets attenuated depends on the condition of the surrounding insulation. When the insulation is in good condition - supple and pliable, there is more damping or attenuation of the waveform. As the insulation gets embrittled and cracked, the attenuation is likely to reduce and the waveform of the propagating stress wave is likely to change. The monitoring of these changes provides a potential tool to evaluate wiring or cabling in service that is not accessible for visual inspection. This experiment has been designed for use in an introductory mechanical or materials engineering instrumentation lab. Initial setup (after procuring all the materials) should take the lab instructor about 4 hours.

One layer is a metallic tubular sheathing {{with the main}} purpose {{to act as a}} moisture-blocking barrier to prevent moisture ingress towards the <b>cable</b> <b>core.</b> Unlike a static cable, which normally utilizes a smooth tubular sheathing, the dynamic cable is exposed to various hanging configurations and fatigue loading. Hence, a need for a more flexible but also fatigue resistant sheathing has arose. Thus, metallic corrugated tubular sheathing (MCTS) has been introduced as a candidate, due to high flexibility, good mechanical strength and favourable fatigue resistant. This master thesis investigates, on commission from Nexans, a MCTS with respect to how various geometrical parameters, that is corrugation pitch (P), amplitude (A), sheath thickness (t) and helical inclination angle influences the developed strain along the corrugation geometry. The obtained results can be utilized as a parameter to predict the MCTS fatigue properties. In this thesis, the MCTS was 3 D modelled and parametrized, thereafter a finite element approach was utilized to expose the MCTS models to static axial and bending analysis and quasi-static four-point bending analysis. Variations in local geometry parameters were analysed and evaluated based on developed strain. When changing the different geometrical parameters, variations in developed strain occurred. Local developed strain values were further compared to global strain values obtained by exposing a smooth tubular sheathing to similar boundary conditions as the corrugated models. Finite element analysis (FEA) indicated that the most suitable corrugation geometry for fatigue life based on global and local strain development fields in the corrugation was a MCTS inherent with a thin wall thickness, a low P/A ratio and a high A-value. Considering the most suitable corrugation wave pattern, the FEA indicated that both annular and helical were favourable. However, if selecting a helical wave pattern, the helical inclination angle should remain small, due to the presence of a relatively high shear strain sensitivity when introducing a helical wave pattern. A prime design example considering fatigue life, based on the FEA results, may be a MCTS comprising of t= 0. 7 mm, P/A= 2. 0, A= 5. 0 mm and a corrugation geometry holding either an annular or helical wave pattern, where the helical pattern should hold a low inclination angle...|$|E

In the distribution and transmission network, large-scale and small-scale wind and solar power plants will be introduced, {{in proportion to the}} annual economic growth. The transmission and distribution network will be expanded, focusing on the electricity transport, however, there will also be a need for exchanges with neighboring countries. Alternative solutions are needed in order to support the changes of the future grid. High temperature superconductors are an alternative to conventional conductors, due to their high current density and very low AC loss, and therefore deserve more attention. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore ways to integrate high-temperature superconducting cables in a future network and to compare their favorable technical properties with, e. g., the conventional XLPE cable. The development of 2 nd generation high temperature superconducting tapes results in a high tape quality, making it very attractive for use in superconducting power transmission cables. At the same time, the network requirements placed on the grid, based on society needs are changing, such as low magnetic field emissions, reducing space requirements, lower losses, minimizing visual intrusion, etc. Our study shows that superconducting cables compared to conventional cables score better on these societal requirements. From our comparison of three practical low and high temperature superconductors we can conclude that Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide is the most suitable superconductor for use in transmission cables. Our techno-economic analysis shows that superconducting cables become already competitive with conventional cable in the AC transmission, such as XLPE cables. Possible future problems concerning the transport capacity in the power grid where high temperature superconducting cables can offer a solution have been identified. For one promising location, we have formulated the requirements for the design of a high-temperature superconducting cable. Next, we propose two types of cable systems (with cold and warm dielectric). For both types we describe the core, the electrical insulation, the screen, the cryostat, the cooling system, etc. Also for the distribution grid a techno-economic investigation is conducted. To assess the feasibility of the application in distribution grids, we have experimentally demonstrated a reduction of AC conductor losses from 1 W/m to 0. 1 W/m. We also carried out an experimental investigation to improve the developed cryostat design for a 6 km long cable connection. Despite these substantial technical improvements our economic study showed that the high-temperature superconducting distribution cable is not yet competitive with the present conventional distribution cable systems except for niche locations where additional advantages e. g. magnetic emission, reduced space usage, power density weighs more heavily. Besides the HVAC grid the Netherlands has HVDC interconnections with neighboring countries and there are initiatives for the use of DC high voltage connections to wind farms further out to sea. In our study, we make reference to a suitable location, where the above mentioned attractive features of the superconducting cable are applicable as well. We advised a modified design of a HTS HVDC cable which enables a possible upgrade of the transmission capacity of the HVDC link at such location. The main results from the investigation are that:  Based on our techno-economic analysis HTS cables offer the most competitive solution in transmission grids. Introduction of such cables will reduce HTS tape price, which in turn will stimulate further applications.  Conceptual designs of competitive HTS AC and DC transmission cables are formulated along with that for HTS AC distribution cable. Novel designs allow for much longer length between cooling stations.  Our experimental research has shown that HTS <b>cable</b> <b>core</b> losses may be reduced by a factor 10 (down to 0. 11 W/m/phase at 3 kArms, 77 K, 50 Hz).  Dedicated low friction cable cryostat was developed and successfully tested for 47 meters length.
