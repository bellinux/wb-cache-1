All incoming <b>call</b> <b>details,</b> outgoing <b>call</b> <b>details,</b> text details, emails and multimedia messages can be seen and interrupted by the managers, who can also monitor where their employees are, access a history of {{where they have been}} and set up alerts if their employees are going outside of the approved geographical zones, are receiving texts from unapproved numbers or calls from banned persons. This system is really very helpful for the managers to monitor their employees through mobile phones. By using this system, the organisation can avoid the unnecessary involvement by the employees by monitoring their mobile phone usage and also by tracking their current location. The Global Positioning System is used for location tracking. Keywords- Global Positioning System, Google APIs, Android Smartphones, Application Stores I...|$|E
