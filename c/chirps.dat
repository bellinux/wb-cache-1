5|$|The Cape sparrow's {{calls are}} <b>chirps</b> {{similar to those}} of the house sparrow, but much more musical and mellow. The basic call is used in flight and while {{perching}} socially and transcribed as chissip, chirrup, chreep, or chirrichup. A loud, distinctive call used by the male to advertise nest ownership can be written as tweeng or twileeng; this call can be extended into a jerky and repetitive song, chip cheerup, chip cheerup.|$|E
5|$|USB2.0 devices use {{a special}} {{protocol}} during reset, called chirping, {{to negotiate the}} high bandwidth mode with the host/hub. A device that is USB2.0 High Speed capable first connects as a Full Speed device (D+ pulled high), but upon receiving a USB RESET (both D+ and D− driven LOW by host for 10 to 20ms) it pulls the D− line high, known as chirp K. This indicates to the host that the device is high bandwidth. If the host/hub is also HS capable, it <b>chirps</b> (returns alternating J and K states on D− and D+ lines) letting the device know that the hub operates at high bandwidth. The device has to receive at least three sets of KJ <b>chirps</b> before it changes to high bandwidth terminations and begins high bandwidth signaling. Because USB 3.0 uses wiring separate and additional to that used by USB2.0 and USB1.x, such bandwidth negotiation is not required.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} has no true song, but its vocalisations include an excited series of tschip calls given by {{unpaired}} or courting males.

A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds had fewer shared syllable types (memes) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows. This may have resulted from {{the small size of}} the founding North American population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity.|$|E

5|$|Mole crickets {{have three}} life stages, eggs, nymphs, and adults. Most {{of their life}} in these stages is spent underground, but adults have wings and {{disperse}} in the breeding season. They vary in their diet; some species are vegetarian, mainly feeding on roots, others are omnivores, including worms and grubs in their diet, while a few are largely predatory. Male mole crickets have an exceptionally loud song; they sing from a subsurface burrow that opens out into {{the air in the}} shape of an exponential horn.

40|$|Discussions {{about the}} {{evolution}} of female mating preferences have often suggested that females should express multiple strong preferences when different male traits are correlated with different mating benefits, yet few studies have directly tested this hypothesis by comparing the strength of female preferences for male traits known to be correlated with different benefits. In the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, females receive fecundity and fertility benefits from mating with males with higher <b>chirp</b> rates and life-span benefits from mating with males with longer <b>chirp</b> durations. Although females prefer higher <b>chirp</b> rates and longer <b>chirp</b> durations when the other trait is held constant, {{it is possible that}} they give priority to one of these song traits when both vary. In this study, we examined the relative importance of <b>chirp</b> rate and <b>chirp</b> duration in female mate choice using single-stimulus presentations of songs that varied in both <b>chirp</b> rate and <b>chirp</b> duration. Females expressed both directional and stabilizing preferences based on <b>chirp</b> rate, responding most strongly to a <b>chirp</b> rate approximately one standard deviation above the population mean. Females did not express preferences based on <b>chirp</b> duration, and did not express correlational preferences.

In Flicky, the player controls the eponymous blue bird and must gather all the <b>Chirps</b> in each round {{and bring them}} safely to the exit. There are cat and lizard enemies which can disperse the <b>Chirps</b> and kill the player, but Flicky can use items {{on the playing field}} to protect herself and the <b>Chirps</b> from danger.|$|E
25|$|Collected <b>Chirps</b> will {{disperse}} if the their chain {{comes in}} contact with an enemy.

There are two enemy types in the standard rounds, house cats called Tigers and green iguanas called Iggys. These enemies can be simply avoided but can also be defeated with throwable items available on some levels. These items include telephones, flower pots, cups, and bottles. Flicky can pick up an item by walking into it, and throw it by jumping. Sometimes diamonds may appear, which cannot be thrown but rather provide bonus points. There are also bonus rounds in which Flicky attempts to catch as many falling <b>Chirps</b> as possible in a net.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the first}} 20 weeks after a {{cotton-top}} tamarin is born, {{it is not}} fully capable of producing the range of vocalizations that an adult monkey can. Despite this limitation on speech producibility, researchers believe that language acquisition occurs early on with speech comprehension abilities arising first. Infants can at times produce adult-like <b>chirps,</b> but this is rarely done in the correct context and remains inconsistent across the first 20 weeks of life. Regardless, infant cotton-tops are able to respond in behaviorally appropriate ways to varying contexts when presented with adult <b>chirps.</b> This indicates that verbal perception is a quickly acquired skill for offspring, followed closely by auditory comprehension, and later by proper vocal producibility.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, two novel {{approaches}} to optically generating high-frequency <b>chirped</b> electrical pulses with tunable <b>chirp</b> rate using a tunable nonlinearly <b>chirped</b> fiber Bragg grating (NL-CFBG) are proposed. In the first approach, a high-frequency electrical <b>chirped</b> pulse is generated based on optical spectral shaping and nonlinear wavelength-to-time conversion using a tunable NL-CFBG. In the second approach, two ultrashort pulses at different wavelengths are dispersed at an NL-CFBG. The beating {{of the two}} differently dispersed pulses at a high-speed photodetector generates a <b>chirped</b> electrical pulse with tunable <b>chirp</b> rate. The NL-CFBG used in the proposed systems is produced using a simple technique based on strain-gradient beam tuning. Mathematical models to describe the <b>chirped</b> electrical pulse generation are developed, which are verified by numerical simulations.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} Huygens-Fresnel {{diffraction}} integral and the Fourier transform, the propagation {{expression of a}} <b>chirped</b> pulse passing through a hard-edged aperture is derived. Using the obtained expression, the intensity distributions of the pulse with different <b>chirp</b> in the near and far fields are analyzed in detail. Due to the modulation of the aperture, many intensity peaks emerge in the intensity distributions of the <b>chirped</b> pulse in the near field. However, the amplitudes of the intensity peaks decrease on increasing the <b>chirp,</b> which results in the smoothing effect in the intensity distributions. The beam smoothing brought by increasing the <b>chirp</b> is explained physically. Also, {{it is found that}} the radius of the intensity distribution of the <b>chirped</b> pulse decreases when the <b>chirp</b> increases in the far field. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of fabricating Bragg gratings in various fibres, {{with or without}} hydrogen loading, and with varying laser power levels are explored. Three new techniques for fabricating <b>chirped</b> gratings are presented. Beams with dissimilar wavefront curvatures are interfered to give <b>chirped</b> gratings. With the same aim techniques of writing gratings on tapered fibres and on deformed fibres are also covered. With these techniques, {{a wide variety of}} gratings has been fabricated from the 'superbroad' (with bandwidths of up to 180 nm), small to medium bandwidth gratings with linear <b>chirp</b> profiles and quadratic <b>chirped</b> gratings. It is demonstrated that <b>chirped</b> grating can be concatenated to form all-fibre Fabry-Perot and Moiré resonators.
