5|$|Bupropion is a {{substituted}} <b>cathinone.</b> It is synthesized in two chemical steps {{starting from}} 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position {{adjacent to the}} ketone is first brominated followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting alpha-bromoketone with t-butylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% overall yield.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. It often {{is described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist. However, bupropion {{does not appear to have}} significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances. Chemically, bupropion belongs to the class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants such as <b>cathinone</b> and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacologically, {{bath salts}} usually contain a <b>cathinone,</b> {{typically}} methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), methylone or mephedrone; however, the chemical composition varies widely and products labeled {{with the same}} name may also contain derivatives of pyrovalerone or pipradrol. In Europe the main synthetic <b>cathinone</b> is mephedrone, whereas in the US MDPV is more common.|$|E
30|$|<b>Cathinones</b> {{are also}} known as bath salts and have been listed as illicit drugs since 2011. The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued the order to {{temporarily}} schedule three synthetic <b>cathinones</b> as schedule I substances under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (Drug Enforcement Administrations 2011; 2014). Internationally, <b>cathinones</b> have been banned in numerous other countries. Designer <b>cathinones,</b> which are newly synthesized derivatives of existing <b>cathinones</b> to mimic the effects of existing illegal drugs {{and at the same}} time bypass the existing controlled drug regulations, are still available (Kelly 2011). These products have caught the attention of law enforcement due to incidents of acute toxicity and numerous fatalities that have been linked with the use of these designer <b>cathinones.</b>|$|R
30|$|Introduction Synthetic <b>cathinones,</b> beta-keto-amphetamine derivates, are new psychoactive and {{stimulant}} substances with exponentially increasing use since 10  years. Bath salts, often sold legally, contain {{mixtures of}} several <b>cathinones</b> like 3, 4 -methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and mephedrone (4 MMC). Toxicity of {{combination of two}} <b>cathinones,</b> mimicking their real use in humans, has never been studied. Our objective was to investigate possible synergy of MDPV/ 4 MMC combination on their stimulant effects in the Sprague–Dawley rat and analyze their mechanisms of interaction.|$|R
40|$|A set of 25 <b>cathinones</b> {{has been}} {{analyzed}} by GC high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) using a soft ionization source, referred in {{here as the}} microplasma photoionization (MPPI) source. This plasma-based, wavelength-selectable ionization source enables softer (i. e., ~ 8 to 12 eV) ionization of the test <b>cathinones</b> relative to electron ionization at 70 eV. Plasma gases such as Xe, Kr, and Ar, which generate distinct vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) resonance lines (i. e., Xe @ 8. 44 / 9. 57 eV, Kr @ 10. 03 / 10. 64 eV, and Ar @ 11. 62 / 11. 83 eV), have been evaluated for the identification of underivatized and derivatized <b>cathinones.</b> Derivatization of the test compounds with trifluoroacetic anhydride and α-methoxy-α-(trifluoromethyl) - phenylacetyl pyrazole was evaluated because the MPPI mass spectra of the underivatized <b>cathinones</b> yield primarily immonium ions and are identical to those obtained by electron ionization, thus leading to inconclusive MS identification of the test compounds. The MPPI mass spectra of TFA-derivatized <b>cathinones</b> yield both benzoyl and immonium ions, and certain TFA-derivatized <b>cathinones</b> yield molecular ions especially when using Xe as plasma gas, thus making possible their identification by MS...|$|R
25|$|Methcathinone is a beta-keto N-methylamphetamine and {{is closely}} related to the {{naturally}} occurring compounds, <b>cathinone</b> and cathine. It is also very closely related to methamphetamine, differing by only the β-ketone substituent and differing from amphetamine by both a keto and N-methyl substituent. Its carbon skeleton is identical to pseudoephedrine and methamphetamine. It differs from pseudoephedrine in that the hydroxide beta to the aromatic ring is oxidized to a ketone.|$|E
500|$|Mephedrone, {{also known}} as 4-methyl methcathinone (4-MMC) or 4-methyl ephedrone, is a {{synthetic}} stimulant drug of the amphetamine and <b>cathinone</b> classes. Slang names include bath salts, drone, M-CAT, White Magic [...] and meow meow. It is chemically similar to the <b>cathinone</b> compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa. It {{comes in the form}} of tablets or a powder, which users can swallow, snort or inject, producing similar effects to MDMA, amphetamines and cocaine.|$|E
500|$|Amphetamine {{belongs to}} the phenethylamine class. It is also the parent {{compound}} of its own structural class, the substituted amphetamines, which includes prominent substances such as bupropion, <b>cathinone,</b> MDMA, and methamphetamine.

Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while [...] is a positional isomer of amphetamine that differs only in the placement of the methyl group.|$|E
50|$|In March 2010, the ACMD {{published}} a report, Consideration of the <b>cathinones,</b> which recommended that mephedrone and other <b>cathinones</b> {{should be made}} illegal.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the {{phenomenon}} of new designer drugs has attracted much attention. Synthetic cannabinoids and <b>cathinones</b> are the two main classes of these drugs.

The present work {{is based on a}} systematic review of studies that have assessed the market and prevalence of synthetic cannabinoids and <b>cathinones,</b> and integrates pharmacological, sociological, and epidemiological aspects of these two groups of emerging synthetic drugs. The review refl ects that the Internet has made synthetic cannabinoids and <b>cathinones</b> widely available. Furthermore, aggressive and widespread marketing, as well as the low price level of these drugs, their juridical status and their lack of detection on standard drug tests may serve as major motivations for drug use. The number of prevalence studies is small and derived from a limited number of countries. In spite of the many methodological shortcomings, some conclusions may be cautiously drawn. Taken together, the results point toward higher prevalence of use for synthetic <b>cathinones</b> than for synthetic cannabinoids. In the general population, the prevalence of use of synthetic <b>cathinones</b> is reported to be around 4 % compared to fi gures lower than 1 % for synthetic cannabinoids.

500|$|A drug {{similar to}} mephedrone, {{containing}} <b>cathinone,</b> was sold legally in Israel from around 2004, {{under the name}} hagigat. When this was made illegal, the <b>cathinone</b> was modified and the new products were sold by the Israeli company, Neorganics. The products had names such as Neodoves pills, but the range was discontinued in January 2008 after the Israeli government made mephedrone illegal. The Psychonaut Research Project, an EU organisation that searches the internet for information regarding new drugs, first identified mephedrone in 2008. Their research suggested the drug first became available to purchase on the internet in 2007, when it was also discussed on internet forums. Mephedrone was first seized in France in May 2007, after police sent a tablet they assumed to be ecstasy to be analysed, with the discovery published in a paper titled [...] "Is 4-methylephedrone, an [...] "Ecstasy" [...] of the twenty-first century?" [...] Mephedrone was reported as having been sold as ecstasy in the Australian city of Cairns, along with ethylcathinone, in 2008. An annual survey of regular ecstasy users in Australia in 2010 found 21% of those surveyed had used mephedrone, with 17% having done so in the previous six months. The price they paid per gram varied from A$16 to $320.|$|E
500|$|In Canada, {{mephedrone}} is {{not explicitly}} listed in any schedule of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, but [...] "amphetamines, their salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues" [...] {{are included in}} Section 19 of Schedule I of the act. <b>Cathinone</b> and methcathinone are listed in separate sections of Schedule III, while diethylpropion and pyrovalerone (also cathinones), are listed in separate sections of Schedule IV, each without language to capture analogues, isomers, etc. Mephedrone is considered a controlled substance by Health Canada. According to the Canadian Medical Association, mephedrone is grouped with other amphetamines as Schedule I controlled substances. There have been several media reports of the Canadian police seizing mephedrone. Mephedrone is also currently scheduled in the United States as of 2011. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) states, as an analogue of methcathinone, possession of mephedrone can be controlled by the Federal Analog Act, {{but according to the}} Los Angeles Times, this only applies if it is sold for human consumption. Several cities and states, such as New York state, have passed legislation to specifically list mephedrone as illegal, but in most areas it remained legal, so long as it is not sold for human consumption, so retailers described it as 'bath salts'. In September 2011, The DEA began using its emergency scheduling authority to temporarily control mephedrone. Except as authorised by law, this action made possessing and selling mephedrone or the products that contain it illegal in the US for at least one year while the DEA and the United States Department of Health and Human Services conduct further study. Control of these compounds became permanent on 9 July 2012, via passage of the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{parliamentary}} debate {{was held on}} 8 April, {{one day after the}} 2010 general election had been announced, meaning it was during the so-called [...] "wash-up period" [...] when legislation is passed with little scrutiny. Only one hour was spent debating the ban and all three parties agreed, meaning no vote was required. In an interview conducted in July 2010, when he was no longer a minister, Johnson admitted the decision to ban mephedrone was sped up after widespread reporting of deaths caused by the drug, and because the government wished to pass the law before parliament was dissolved prior to the upcoming general election. In January 2011, however, Johnson told the Scunthorpe Telegraph that the decision was based only on information from the ACMD. An editorial in the April 2010 edition of The Lancet questioned the decision to ban mephedrone, saying the ACMD did not have enough evidence to judge the potential harms caused by mephedrone and arguing that policy makers should have sought to understand why young people took it and how they could be influenced to not take it. Evan Harris, then the Liberal Democrat science spokesman, stated the ACMD [...] "was not 'legally constituted'" [...] as required by the Misuse of Drugs Act, when the report on cathinones was published, since after Taylor resigned, it lacked a veterinary surgeon. In the rush to make mephedrone illegal, the act that was passed specified the inactive enantiomer of mephedrone, leaving the active form legal until the loophole was closed in February 2011 by another act of parliament. In Chemistry World, John Mann, professor of chemistry at Queen's University Belfast, suggested the UK create a law similar to the Federal Analog Act of the United States, which would have made mephedrone illegal as an analog of <b>cathinone.</b> In August 2010, James Brokenshire, the Home Office drugs minister, announced plans to create a new category in the Misuse of Drugs Act, through the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill, that would allow new legal highs to be made temporarily illegal, without the need for a vote in parliament or advice from the ACMD, as was required to categorise mephedrone.|$|E
40|$|Forensic {{laboratories}} face {{issues with}} large backlogs on evidence {{needing to be}} analyzed is due to two reasons: budgeting issues {{and the emergence of}} designer drugs. Currently, forensic laboratory directors cite that there are a shortage of scientists to deal with the yearly increase in caseloads. Additionally, designer drugs like synthetic <b>cathinones,</b> commonly known as “bath salts,” have increased the backlog due to the changing chemical compositions and misidentification as other compounds. Therefore, the use of a portable mass spectrometer for on-site forensic chemical analysis of synthetic <b>cathinones</b> would reduce the backlog of suspected controlled substances in forensic chemistry laboratories. A comparison of research on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), typically used in forensic laboratories, and ambient mass spectrometry, an upcoming method, was conducted to determine which technique would be more suitable for on-site analysis of synthetic <b>cathinones.</b> Ambient mass spectrometry techniques are proven to successfully analyze these evidence samples without degradation and to be employed in the field without extensive power requirements at a low cost. Also, ambient mass spectrometry methods are able to be conducted by non-technical operators. Through use of portable ambient mass spectrometry techniques, synthetic <b>cathinones</b> would be accurately identified in the field, reducing the strain of the backlog in forensic laboratories. Future studies are needed to make the analysis of a spectrum coming from an ambient mass spectrometer easier for non-technical operators to identify synthetic <b>cathinones.</b> [URL]...|$|R
30|$|Accurately, {{quantifying}} {{the concentration}} of <b>cathinones</b> in biological samples {{is important for the}} regulation of <b>cathinones.</b> A problem for law enforcement and clinical laboratories occurs due to the difficulties of validation and maintenance of multiple analytical methods used in the accurate and precise detection of these compounds. Despite the increased availability of designer drugs, few studies have focused on the analytical extraction techniques and the matrix effects affecting their detection and quantification in biological samples.|$|R
40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} detection method using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) — time-of-flight (TOF) — mass spectrometry (MS) {{was developed for}} the analysis of four pyrrolidino <b>cathinones,</b> such as α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (PPP), 4 ’-methyl-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (MPPP), α-pyrrolidinobutiophenone (PBP), and α-pyrrolidinovalerophenone (PVP). In this method, α-cyano- 4 -hydroxy cinnamic acid was used as the matrix to assist the ionization of <b>cathinones.</b> Each MALDI-TOF-MS spectrum of these <b>cathinones</b> showed not only protonated molecular ion [M + H]+, but also several fragment ions having comparable intensities to that of [M + H]+. Hence MPPP and PBP could be clearly discriminated by the mass spectra alone, although they have almost the same mass numbers in their protonated molecular ions. The quantification of MPPP, PBP or PVP was performed using PPP as internal standard, respectively, and that of PPP was performed using PBP as internal standard. The limit of detection was 1 ng/ml, and the quantification range was 2 – 200 ng/ml for the four <b>cathinones</b> using 20 μl of blood. In a fatal poisoning case in which PVP was abused, the PVP levels in whole blood samples obtained from the right heart, left heart and femoral vein were 0. 597, 0. 635 and 0. 580 μg/ml, respectively.

2500|$|Synthetic cathinones such as mephedrone, {{which are}} {{chemically}} similar to <b>cathinone,</b> naturally {{found in the}} plant Catha edulis (khat), were first synthesised in the 1920s.

In 2009 and 2010 there was a significant rise in the abuse of synthetic cathinones, initially in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, and subsequently in the United States. Drugs marketed as [...] "bath salts" [...] first came to the attention of authorities in the US in 2010 after reports were made to US poison centers.

50|$|Khat {{leaves are}} removed from the plant stalk and are kept in a ball in the cheek and chewed.

The stomach and small intestine are very important in the absorption of ingested alkaloids. At approximately 2.3 hours after chewing khat leaves, the maximum concentration of <b>cathinone</b> in blood plasma is reached. The mean residence time is 5.2 ± 3.4 hours. The elimination half-life of <b>cathinone</b> is 1.5 ± 0.8 hours. A two-compartment model for absorption and elimination best describes this data.

5000|$|The {{structure}} of <b>cathinone</b> {{is very similar}} to that of other molecules. By reducing the ketone, it becomes cathine if it retains its stereochemistry, or norephedrine if its stereochemistry is inverted. Cathine is a less potent version of <b>cathinone</b> and cathinone's spontaneous reduction is the reason that older khat plants are not as stimulating and younger ones. <b>Cathinone</b> and amphetamine are closely related in that amphetamine is only lacking the ketone C=O group. [...] <b>Cathinone</b> is structurally related to methcathinone, {{in much the same way}} as amphetamine is related to methamphetamine. <b>Cathinone</b> differs from amphetamine by possessing a ketone oxygen atom (C=O) on the β (beta) position of the side chain. The corresponding alcohol, cathine, is a less powerful stimulant. The biophysiological conversion from <b>cathinone</b> to cathine is to blame for the depotentiation of khat leaves over time. Fresh leaves have a greater ratio of <b>cathinone</b> to cathine than dried ones, therefore having more psychoactive effects.|$|E
50|$|Internationally, <b>cathinone</b> is a Schedule I drug {{under the}} Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Circa 1993, the DEA added <b>cathinone</b> to the Controlled Substances Act's Schedule I.|$|E
50|$|The {{metabolites}} of <b>cathinone,</b> cathine and norephedrine also possess CNS stimulation, but create much weaker effects.

40|$|The {{pharmacology}} {{of novel}} psychoactive substances is mostly unknown. We evaluated the transporter and receptor interaction profiles {{of a series}} of para-(4) -substituted amphetamines and pyrovalerone <b>cathinones.</b> We tested the potency of these compounds to inhibit the norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5 -HT) transporters (NET, DAT, and SERT, respectively) using human embryonic kidney 293 cells that express the respective human transporters. We also tested the substance-induced efflux of NE, DA, and 5 -HT from monoamine-loaded cells, binding affinities to monoamine receptors, and 5 -HT 2 B receptor activation. Para-(4) -substituted amphetamines, including 4 -methylmethcathinone (mephedrone), 4 -ethylmethcathinone, 4 -fluoroamphetamine, 4 -fluoromethamphetamine, 4 -fluoromethcatinone (flephedrone), and 4 -bromomethcathinone, were relatively more serotonergic (lower DAT:SERT ratio) compared with their analogs amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methcathinone. The 4 -methyl, 4 -ethyl, and 4 -bromo groups resulted in enhanced serotonergic properties compared with the 4 -fluoro group. The para-substituted amphetamines released NE and DA. 4 -Fluoramphetamine, 4 -flouromethamphetamine, 4 -methylmethcathinone, and 4 -ethylmethcathinone also released 5 -HT similarly to 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine. The pyrovalerone <b>cathinones</b> 3, 4 -methylenedioxypyrovalerone, pyrovalerone, α-pyrrolidinovalerophenone, 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone, and 3, 4 -methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinobutiophenone potently inhibited the NET and DAT but not the SERT. Naphyrone was the only pyrovalerone that also inhibited the SERT. The pyrovalerone <b>cathinones</b> did not release monoamines. Most of the para-substituted amphetamines exhibited affinity for the 5 -HT 2 A receptor but no relevant activation of the 5 -HT 2 B receptor. All the <b>cathinones</b> exhibited reduced trace amine-associated receptor 1 binding compared with the non-β-keto-amphetamines. In conclusion, para-substituted amphetamines exhibited enhanced direct and indirect serotonergic agonist properties and are likely associated with more MDMA-like effects.

40|$|Novel psychoactive {{substances}} are newly used {{designer drugs}} ("internet drugs", "research chemicals", "legal highs") potentially posing similar health risks to classic illicit substances.

Pharmacologically, these substances interact with various monoaminergic targets. Typically, stimulants inhibit the transport of dopamine and noradrenaline (pipradrols, pyrovalerone <b>cathinones)</b> or induce the release of these monoamines (amphetamines and methamphetamine-like <b>cathinones),</b> entactogens predominantly enhance serotonin release (phenylpiperazines, aminoindanes, para-substituted amphetamines, and MDMA-like <b>cathinones)</b> similar to MDMA (ecstasy), and hallucinogens (tryptamines, hallucinogenic phenethylamines) are direct agonists at serotonergic 5 -HT 2 A receptors. Synthetic cannabinoids are another group of novel substances which all act as agonists at the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor similar to THC but are chemically diverse. In particular, the relative serotonergic vs dopaminergic activity (determined by the dopamine/serotonin transporter inhibition ratio in vitro) can be helpful to predict the desired psychotropic but also the toxic effects of novel substances {{as well as their}} potential for addiction. Although the use of novel psychoactive substances mostly produces minor or moderate poisonings, serious complications occur. Serotonergic drugs (entactogens and hallucinogens) are associated with acute serotonin syndrome, hyperthermia, seizures, and hyponatremia.
