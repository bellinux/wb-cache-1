MILP is an optimization method under multiple <b>constraint</b> <b>conditions</b> of objective function maximization or minimization.

The objective function and <b>constraint</b> <b>conditions</b> are required in linear by MILP, however, the motion of USV and its path planning are nonlinear. So the principle problem is to transform the nonlinear problem into the linear problem. On the other hand, VO makes a linear prediction, which is well appended into the <b>constraint</b> <b>conditions.</b> MILP has advantages in astringency, optimization, real-time and VO also has the advantages in real-time. The combination of MILP and VO utilized the advantages of rapidity of computations, which is well suited for embedded system of robotic applications.
