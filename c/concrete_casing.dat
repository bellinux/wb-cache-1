30|$|Variable {{environmental}} (production) {{conditions and}} disturbed natural hydrogeochemical equilibria (temperature/pressure changes, CO 2 /H 2 O outgassing) can significantly promote scaling in production wells, downhole pumps, transport pipes, valves, and heat exchangers leading to inner diameter reduction, disturbed flow regimes, and clogging counteracting efficient energy extraction (Zarrouk et al. 2014). Similarly, mineral precipitation and mobilization (e.g., fine particles) can {{significantly reduce the}} reinjection efficiency of cooled thermal fluids depending on the respective physicochemical injection conditions, aquifer lithology, and hydraulic parameters (Rivera Diaz et al. 2016). Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) precipitation is widespread in low- to moderate enthalpy geothermal facilities tapping deep limestone/dolomite aquifers (e.g., Central European sedimentary basins) entailing elevated dissolved carbonate and carbon dioxide concentrations (Alt-Epping et al. 2013; Stober 2014). Silica/silicates, in contrast, dominate scale formation in high-enthalpy geothermal regions (e.g., Iceland, New Zealand; Gunnarsson and Arnórsson 2005; Zarrouk et al. 2014). Sulfates, sulfides, (hydro)oxides, or even chlorides can also form scale deposits (Corsi 1986; Regenspurg et al. 2015). Next to problematic mineral precipitation, corrosion of varying chemistry and degree can significantly harm carbon- and low-alloy steel components as well as <b>concrete</b> <b>casings</b> of geothermal installations (Mundhenk et al. 2013; Nogara and Zarrouk 2014). These material deterioration processes mostly depend on the prevailing electrochemical (redox) conditions and critical solution/gas constituents of the thermal fluid. Reducing conditions in aquifers and geothermal wells typically result in H 2 S-based corrosion and formation of various metal sulfides, while (intermittent) oxidizing conditions support the occurrence of iron-(oxy)hydroxides (Valdez et al. 2009; Bai et al. 2014). Steel corrosion and scaling processes may further be affected (e.g., catalyzed) by diverse microbial communities, i.e., playing an active (e.g., changing hydrochemistry) or passive (e.g., being a substrate) role for corrosion/scale mineral crystallization (Lanneluc et al. 2015; Würdemann et al. 2016).|$|R

2500|$|A {{peculiarity}} of the Lost Hills {{operations is}} the pronounced subsidence {{of the ground}} surface as it collapses into the area vacated by the petroleum after being pumped out. Portions of the hills overlying the oil field have subsided up to [...] in the central region of operations, and subsidence occurs field-wide {{at a rate of}} about [...] per year. The dropping land surface causes operational problems, including fractures of well casings, and sometimes complete well failures. Waterflooding – the practice of filling the reservoir with water to push petroleum to recovery wells, and thereby also reoccupying the space vacated by oil and gas – has partially mitigated the problem. Some wells have actually disappeared into craters: in 1976, a Getty Oil well blew out, and quickly collapsed into a crater over [...] deep and , taking with it the <b>concrete</b> pad, <b>casing,</b> and pumping unit.

40|$|In {{this report}} I {{consider}} a {{case with a}} simple three-dimensional two-layer model penetrated by a thin vertical intrusion. Synthetic seismic data is generated, {{and a number of}} events are identified. The identified events affected by the vertical intrusions are a prismatic wave, reflected from both the layer boundary and the intrusion wall, and two diffractions. The first diffraction event occurs where the intrusion penetrates the layer boundary (representing a vertical change in elastic parameters), while the second one occurs where the intrusion terminates in the bottom layer. The focus in this report is mainly on the prismatic wave, as this generally displays higher amplitude than both diffraction events. Experiments were carried out to investigate amplitude trends. The experiments were carried out by changing the elastic parameters and thickness of the intrusion, and by changing the dominant wavelet frequency. Specifically, cases were constructed to simulate the case of bore holes (with water/mud-based drilling/injection fluids or <b>concrete</b> <b>casings),</b> and a case with a gas pipe as discussed in L&# 248;seth et al. (2011). The results suggested an increase in amplitude both with increasing dominant wavelet frequency and with increasing contrast in elastic parameters. The amplitudes were strongly affected by changes in intrusion thickness, and the case simulating a gas pipe displayed relatively high amplitude compared to all simulated well cases. Finally, the synthetic seismic data was migrated using 2 D Reverse-time migration, and the result was compared to the original model. While signals pertaining to the intrusion were weak compared to events such as the layer reflection, filtering procedures allowed the intrusion to be identified on the migrated image. In spite of the prismatic event being stronger than the diffraction events, the latter made the stronger contribution in the images. This is likely due to the migration successfully collapsing the diffraction hyperbolas to their respective point origins, while the signal from the prismatic wave has to be divided across the intrusion wall. Given more time, 3 D migration should be performed, and should yield stronger contributions to the image for the events affected by the intrusion (scattered events in general) ...|$|R

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) casings, in {{the form}} of stay-in-place formwork, provide an attractive alternative to conventional confinement reinforcement for <b>concrete</b> columns. These <b>casings</b> can fulfill multiple functions of; i) formwork, ii) confinement reinforcement, and iii) protective shell against corrosion, weathering and chemical attacks. This paper investigates the use of stay-in-place FRP formwork as concrete confinement reinforcement for HSC columns with circular and square crosssections. Large-scale specimens with 270 mm cross-sectional dimension and up to 90 MPa concrete strength, were tested under combined axial compression and incrementally increasing lateral deformation reversals. FRP casings were manufactured from carbon fiber sheets and epoxy resin. One of the square columns was provided with internal FRP crossties, a new technique introduced by the authors, to provide welldistributed lateral restraints along the column face, thereby improving the mechanism of confinement. The results indicate that the deformation capacity of HSC columns can be improved significantly by using FRP casings. The results further indicate that the confinement effectiveness of casings of square columns is significantly affected by the corner radius of casings. Confinement efficiency of these casings improves with the use of FRP crossties. T. Ozbakkaloglu and M. Saatcioglu[URL]...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} phase of this project three {{enhanced}} large diameter (> 60 cm) residential wells were constructed at a study site in Lindsay, Ontario. Two wells were constructed using <b>concrete</b> tile <b>casing</b> while the other well was constructed using galvanized steel casing. Javor (2010) evaluated various aspects of drinking water well construction and design to determine the susceptibility of residential large diameter drinking water wells to surface water and airborne contamination. One of the purposes of these new installations was to remove the uncertainty with respect to construction methods, age and maintenance that is characteristic of residential drinking water well performance studies. Javor (2010) conducted a field and laboratory study to assess the performance of several design changes that were thought to improve the integrity of large diameter drinking water wells. These experiments were also used to determine whether one design was more prone to atmospheric and/or surface water contamination than another. During the second phase of this project routine monitoring was continued and data pertinent to assess the performance of the test wells were collected using the same instrumentation. This routine monitoring involved the visual inspection of the wells, collection of well water elevation, collection of soil temperature profile data, collection and analysis of water samples, and collection of cumulative water volumes extracted from the test wells. In addition to the routine monitoring, a ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey was performed in October 2010 to complement the previous data collected during February 2010. Smoke tracer tests were performed under non-frozen and frozen conditions to re-assess the potential pathways of contaminants between the atmosphere and the interior of the test wells. Bacteriological indicators and high concentrations of two dissolved ions were detected in all test and monitoring wells. The smoke tracer tests demonstrated that pathways for airborne contaminants to enter the test wells exist with similar pathways observed in the winter and the summer. GPR surveys indicated that the bentonite slurry annular sealant was the most homogeneous media. A baseline characterization of the microbial nature of the biofilm performed in three of the test wells (CTH 1, ETH 1 and ETH 3) indicated that the sessile bacteria are more metabolically diverse than suspended bacteria, and that this diversity is even higher in the concrete cased wells. Biofilm characterization performed on concrete, fibreglass and galvanized steel coupons incubated in two of the test wells (concrete and galvanized steel) showed that bacteria in the concrete cased wells barely colonized on fiberglass and galvanized steel, while bacteria in the galvanized steel cased well did not have difficulty colonizing on any of the casing materials. The results of the biofilm cleaning study indicated that the use of pressure washing combined with chlorination effectively removed biofilm grown on galvanized steel and fibreglass casing materials. This study investigated various factors that could affect the performance of large diameter drinking water wells. Since the test wells used in this study were under the direct influence of surface water a comparison between the various annular sealants was problematic. However, the three enhanced test wells outperformed the conventional test well. The observations from the smoke tracer tests performed under non-frozen and frozen conditions indicate that the Poly-Lok lid seam is the most prevalent pathway for airborne contaminants to enter a well. Fibreglass may be the preferred choice for large diameter well casing material since fibreglass is corrosion resistant, lightweight, easy to install, has a high strength to weight ratio, and a greater degree of biofilm was able to be removed from fibreglass casing material than from galvanized steel casing material...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{high-strength}} concrete (HSC), with strengths reaching 130 MPa, {{has increased}} in recent years due to its superior performance and strength. Structures are designed and built utilizing HSC, especially in columns of multi-story buildings. However, the use of high-strength concrete (HSC) in seismically active regions poses a major concern because of the brittle nature of the material. The confinement requirements for HSC columns may be prohibitively stringent since they require proportionately greater confinement than columns of normal-strength concrete. An alternative to conventional confinement reinforcement {{is the use of}} fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) casings, {{in the form of a}} stay-in-place formwork. The use of stay-in-place FRP formwork as concrete confinement reinforcement for HSC columns was investigated. Large scale HSC building columns, encased in FRP casings, were tested under simulated seismic loading. The columns had 270 mm square and circular cross-sections and concrete strengths up to 90 MPa. The casings were manufactured from carbon FRP and epoxy resin. The unique aspects of the test program were the introduction of the corner radius as a test parameter, and the presence of internally placed FRP crossties in square columns, integrally built with column casings to improve the effectiveness of concrete confinement. Results indicate that the deformation capacity of HSC columns can be improved significantly by using FRP casings. The results further indicate that the confinement effectiveness of square columns is significantly affected by the corner radius of casings. Additionally, the confinement efficiency can be improved with the use of FRP crossties. The columns developed inelastic drift capacities of up to 12 %, demonstrating the usefulness of FRP stay-in-place formwork in improving deformability of HSC columns. Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite casings offer an attractive alternative to conventional reinforcement to enhance strength and deformability of <b>concrete</b> columns. FRP <b>casings</b> can be designed to increase lateral deformability of earthquake resistant columns significantly, while also providing some enhancement of load-carrying capacity. There is a clear need for a design procedure to compute lateral drift capacities of FRP encased square and circular columns. A design approach was developed that incorporates experimentally observed confinement parameters, while also incorporating axial load and lateral drift as design variables. The approach had evolved from a displacement based design procedure developed for concrete columns confined with conventional steel reinforcement. The expression derived as part of the proposed design procedure had been verified against available experimental data. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
