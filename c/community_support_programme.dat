40|$|Abstract Background Task-shifting to lay {{community}} health providers is increasingly suggested {{as a potential}} strategy to overcome the barriers to sustainable antiretroviral treatment (ART) scale-up in high-HIV-prevalence, resource-limited settings. The dearth of systematic scientific evidence on the contributory role and function of these forms of community mobilisation has rendered a formal evaluation of the published results of existing <b>community</b> <b>support</b> <b>programmes</b> a research priority. Methods We reviewed the relevant published work for the period from November 2003 to December 2011 {{in accordance with the}} guidelines for a synthetic review. ISI Web of Knowledge, Science Direct, BioMed Central, OVID Medline, PubMed, Social Services Abstracts, and Sociological Abstracts and a number of relevant websites were searched. Results The reviewed literature reported an unambiguous positive impact of <b>community</b> <b>support</b> {{on a wide range of}} aspects, including access, coverage, adherence, virological and immunological outcomes, patient retention and survival. Looking at the mechanisms through which <b>community</b> <b>support</b> can impact ART programmes, the review indicates that <b>community</b> <b>support</b> initiatives are a promising strategy to address five often cited challenges to ART scale-up, namely (1) the lack of integration of ART services into the general health system; (2) the growing need for comprehensive care, (3) patient empowerment, (4) and defaulter tracing; and (5) the crippling shortage in human resources for health. The literature indicates that by linking HIV/AIDS-care to other primary health care programmes, by providing psychosocial care in addition to the technical-medical care from nurses and doctors, by empowering patients towards self-management and by tracing defaulters, well-organised <b>community</b> <b>support</b> initiatives are a vital part of any sustainable public-sector ART programme. Conclusions The review demonstrates that <b>community</b> <b>support</b> initiatives are a potentially effective strategy to address the growing shortage of health workers, and to broaden care to accommodate the needs associated with chronic HIV/AIDS. The existing evidence suggests that <b>community</b> <b>support</b> <b>programmes,</b> although not necessarily cheap or easy, remain a good investment to improve coverage of communities with much needed health services, such as ART. For this reason, health policy makers, managers, and providers must acknowledge and strengthen the role of <b>community</b> <b>support</b> in the fight against HIV/AIDS. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Maternal {{mortality}} {{is a major}} public health problem worldwide especially in low income countries. Most causes of maternal deaths are due to direct obstetric complications. Maternal mortality ratio remains high in Rukungiri district, western Uganda estimated at 475 per 100, 000 live births. The objectives were to identify types of community involvement and examine factors influencing the level of community involvement {{in the management of}} obstetric emergencies. Methods We conducted a descriptive study during 2 nd to 28 th February 2009 in rural Rukungiri district, western Uganda. A total of 448 heads of households, randomly selected from 6 / 11 (54. 5 %) of sub-counties, 21 / 42 (50. 0 %) parishes and 32 / 212 (15. 1 %) villages (clusters), were interviewed. Data were analysed using STATA version 10. 0. Results <b>Community</b> pre-emergency <b>support</b> interventions available included community awareness creation (sensitization) while interventions undertaken when emergency had occurred included transportation and referring women to health facility. <b>Community</b> <b>support</b> <b>programmes</b> towards health care (obstetric emergencies) included establishment of community savings and credit schemes, and insurance schemes. The factors associated with community involvement in obstetric emergency management were community members being employed (AOR = 1. 91, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 3. 54) and rating the quality of maternal health care as good (AOR = 2. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 19 - 4. 14). Conclusions Types of community involvement in obstetric emergency management include practices and <b>support</b> <b>programmes.</b> <b>Community</b> involvement in obstetric emergency management is influenced by employment status and perceived quality of health care services. Policies to promote community networks and resource mobilization strategies for health care should be implemented. There is need for promotion of <b>community</b> <b>support</b> initiatives including health insurance schemes and self help associations; further community sensitization by empowered community based resource persons rather than health workers and improvement in quality of health care can contribute towards effective management of obstetric complications. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of a {{research}} program that was carried out by the Laboratory for Evaluation of Development Policies and Programs, University of Thessaly). Greek economy, after nominal converging with other western European countries and meeting the accession criteria to the European Monetary Union, sets as a new objective the attainment of "real" convergence. Success in this objective, while operating in a globalized economic environment and the single European market, will be judged on the choice of a development policy focused on competitiveness and regional development. This paper exactly aims at informing the strategic planning of a regional competitiveness policy. Especially, it intends to set specifications for a regional competitiveness strategy, to define actions at an institutional level for its implementation and to propose a quantification and measurement system of its results. Based on the definition of competitiveness and its determinant factors for each level (national, branch, enterprise, regional) and how they are intertwined, the necessity for a regional competitiveness strategy is validated by a critical analysis of Greek economy 2 s recent related data and performance. The frame in which Greek regions 2 competitiveness problems will be addressed is analyzed under the light of the European Union 2 s new regional development policies Furthermore, the article analyzes the competitiveness strategic planning of Greece and Greek regions in interventions of the current programming period. Namely, it evaluates the extent at which competitiveness is identified and specified in the <b>Community</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Programme,</b> the Competitiveness Operational Programme and the SWOT analyses of the Regional Operational Programmes. Moreover the policies that implement the European regional policy (CSP, OP) and the competitiveness policy (COP) are being evaluated on aspects that include fund allocation, strategy update, regional priorities, implementation progress, efficiency, performance, and synergies, as far as competitiveness and its determinant factors are concerned. Based on literature review, the paper assesses and analyzes the most renowned benchmark systems of countries 2 and regions 2 competitiveness. This paper results to a coherent set of proposals for regional competitiveness policy strategic planning. Particularly, it defines requests towards the aforementioned policy and identifies important issues for the forthcoming programming period. It proposes the establishment of regional agencies analogous to the National Competitiveness and Development Council, alternative organizational forms and a typical action plan. It defines an index set for Greek regions 2 competitiveness benchmarking, a synthesis and utilization methodology, and evaluates the documentation of available data...|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} a {{study is}} presented {{of the design}} parameters for a new information service, which when used users interact with hybrid information spaces, i. e., combinations of digital and physical library spaces, via a common use interface. Even though the goal of collecting, preserving and delivering content to the users is common for both information spaces (digital and physical), the services, tools and techniques to access and search in the available content differs. For example, a user of a printed collection can browse through the available books and form a better perception of the available resources and links among them, {{in contrast to a}} digital library system where the user needs to rely more on his/her memory and less to visual cues and stimuli from the environment {{in order to create a}} mental model about the available resources. On the other hand, the content of a digital library is always available (round-the-clock availability), there is no constraint about the number of available copies and the user has access to powerful search and retrieval tools. Considering the recent developments in the mobile computing technology (in the form of personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones) as well as in wireless communication networks, it is worth examining the potential raised by these technologies as a means for the unified experience in the two information spaces, in a way that overcomes the limitations introduced by each information space. In this research framework we study a new service, created to unify the seeking approaches in the two spaces into a new, unified seeking experience. In addition, we evaluate whether or not has the capacity to fulfill its purpose. More specifically, this dissertation focus on two goals: the design procedure of a unified model for digital and conventional information services, i. e., the collection, study, analysis and processing of all necessary information and parameters which can lead to the design of a prototype model to support the new service; the methods, and criteria to evaluate the new service, e. g., usability, effectiveness, intention to use, etc. In other words, we validate the research hypotheses and examine the significance and effects among the evaluation criteria. The information system which supports the new service was installed and evaluated in the premisses of the Library and Information Services, at Patras University, where there is a large collection of both printed documents (books, journals, lexicons, encyclopedias, etc) and subscriptions to a large number of e-books, electronic journals and conference proceedings. The Library and Information Service at Patras University is a pioneer hybrid library, providing a wealth of documents and services to enhance the effectiveness of the seeking procedures of its patrons. Its printed collection spans on a new building (8. 000 m 2) which hosts more than 90. 000 books, journals and audio/visual material. In addition, as a member of the link for the Hellenic Academic Libraries in Greece, it can provide to its patrons access to more than 12. 000 electronic journals and e-books, making it one of the biggest hybrid libraries in Greece. This dissertation was conducted as part of the research project “Hybrid Libraries: advanced systems and access services in physical and virtual information domains”. This project is part of the 3 rd <b>Community</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Programme,</b> under the Operational Programme “Competitiveness” (2000 - 2006), Measure 8. 3 (Research & Technology for Human Resources), Action 8. 3. 1 (Reinforcement Programme of Human Research Manpower - ΠΕΝΕΔ).

We contrast the traditional numeric approach to transparency, which involves auditing and third-party certifications; with an alternative approach that we call narrative transparency. Central to narrative transparency is an emphasis on stake-holder dialogue and an invitation to stake-holders {{to play the role}} of auditor. This article illustrates how alternative marketing organisations engage in rhetorical tactics central to a narrative approach, to communicate transparency to their stakeholders. These rhetorical tactics include persona, allegory, consumer sovereignty and enlightenment. <b>Community</b> <b>supported</b> agriculture <b>programmes</b> from across the United States are the context for this study.

For this analysis we construct a perceived competition index composed of variables that measure farmers’ perceptions of competition with numerous market outlets and their being constrained in raising their prices due to competitive pressures. Our analysis shows that perceived competition is negatively correlated with CSA farms’ profitability, farmers’ satisfaction on a number of fronts, various indicators of the social embeddedness of CSA, and two community food security strategies. We conclude that competition is a real, although differential, phenomenon experienced by many CSA farmers in California, and that this competition impacts CSA in ways that undermine some of its commonly held values, especially fair farmer compensation and strong member-farmer relationships...|$|R

However, development projects initiated and lor funded by these agencies perform poorly and many become nonoperational on termination of donor support. Despite this problem, evaluative studies and recommendations by external consultants are not relevant with the context and sociocultural factors of African communities. Most of these projects lack transition and participation strategies due to donor pressure on accountability. This therefore poses a gap,. that this study seeks to fill through investigation of the factors that influence the success and sustainability of the projects especially in poverty ravaged county of Turkana. The study adopts a descriptive research design. The target population included the employees of selected INGOs in Turkana County.

Six public health facilities that are providing ARVs were included in the study; this included the regional hospital, two dispensaries and three health centers. With the national ART scale up, the poor health infrastructures are faced with poor retention of patients into care, as a result maintaining adherence becomes a problem due to a lack of follow up. The goal of the study was to assess the use of home based care services as a strategy to support Anti-retroviral treatment adherence among PLWHA. A total of five Focused Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 30 home based care providers to find out from them whether the HBC intervention had experienced any changes since the advent of ARV scale up in the region, and whether their roles had changed in the delivery of services to PLWHA to include adherence support and management. Key Informant Interviews were conducted with 13 health care providers including the facility in-charges, CTC in-charges, hospital pharmacist and HBC Supervisor from the six health facilities that were included in the study to find out their perceptions towards home based care services and whether HBC is providing support to the formal health care systems in ensuring clients adhere to their ART regimen. Whereas in-depth interviews were conducted with 14 PLWHA who are taking ARTs to find out their perceptions towards home based care services and whether they support them with ART adherence. The study findings revealed that HBC services support the formal health care systems with <b>community</b> care <b>support</b> services such as patient tracking and monitoring clients’ adherence to ARTs. Health care providers revealed that the success of ART up in the region is faced with many obstacles including the poor rates of patient retention due to high rates of patients who miss appointments and those who default on their treatments. They revealed that this obstacle is being tackled by HBC providers who assist them to do the patient tracking and returning defaulters back into care, also they provide community supportive services including ART adherence and patient follow up. PLWHA who were interviewed attributed their good adherence to the contribution of <b>community</b> <b>support</b> <b>programmes</b> such as HBC. They acknowledged the regular follow up visits, provision of counseling and monitoring that HBC providers conducted has helped them to maintain good adherence. This is because HBC has evolved in response to the roll-out of ARVs, where it has become more medicalised as a result of the drive to sustain PLWHA on ART to adhere to their treatment regimen. It was concluded that HBC services are a key attribute that provides can be used to provide facility-community linkage which will ensure patients receive community care services as well as facility care and at the same time bridging the gap between formal health services and community care. Therefore further studies should be done on adherence interventions in order to develop evidence based strategies that can promote sustained adherence. In order for the national scale up efforts of ARV to be successful, it is important to assess the component of adherence as a contributing factor in ensuring the effectiveness or ARVs in achieving the desired results. ...|$|R

With low {{adoption}} {{rates of}} soil conservation measures (SCM) widespread, we examine determinants {{of current and}} potential future adoption in the Secano Costero region of Central Chile. Randomly selected farmers (N?=? 140) spent an equivalent of 48 ? 000 CLP/year (79 US$) on SCM. Contingent valuation of a hypothesized soil conservation programme revealed a willingness-to-pay of 30 ? 610 CLP/year (50. 4 US$) for future adoption. Social-psychology variables from Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; response efficacy, perceived barriers) were used to predict current and potential future adoption. Current spending on SCM is influenced by perceptions of (1) erosion problem severity, (2) response efficacy of SCM, (3) farming problems and (4) barriers (lack of labour and draught animals). In addition, farm size and education were significant predictors. Willingness-to-pay for future adoption of SCM is influenced by farmer perception of (1) response efficacy of SCM, and (2) <b>community</b> <b>support</b> to the <b>programme</b> as well as farm size, age and gender.

The provision and continuity {{of health care in}} complex emergencies remain a significant challenge. Health agencies are often hesitant to implement tuberculosis programmes in particular because its treatment requires a longer commitment than most acute diseases. However, not treating tuberculosis promptly increases mortality and untreated tuberculosis further increases the incidence of tuberculosis. Given that complex emergencies are increasing globally, there is an urgent need to analyse the available evidence to improve our understanding of how best to deliver tuberculosis programmes in such settings. Using a scoping review method, we selected and analysed fifteen studies on tuberculosis programmes in complex emergencies. We found that despite the challenges, tuberculosis programmes have been successful in complex emergencies. We identified seven cross-cutting factors that were found to be important: service providers and treatment regime, training and supervision, donor support, adherence, leadership and coordination, monitoring, and government and <b>community</b> <b>support.</b> In general, <b>programmes</b> showed greater creativity and flexibility to adapt to the local conditions and at times, it also meant diverting from the WHO guidelines. We identify areas of further research including the need to study the effectiveness of programmes that divert from the WHO guidelines and their implication on drug resistance...|$|R

This {{research}} {{is about the}} enhancement of the Grade 1 learner's social and emotional development through a music <b>support</b> <b>programme.</b> The aim {{of this research was}} to determine how a music <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> could enhance the social and emotional development of Grade 1 learners through a music <b>support</b> <b>programme.</b> To achieve this goal, data were gathered through a literature study and empirical study. The empirical study was performed by way of semi constructed interviews with the Grade 1 learners' teacher to assemble the empirical data. The results indicated that the Grade 1 learners manifested social and emotional difficulties and that the music <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> was effective for those learners' social and emotional development. Recommendations from the study include: • schools should consider a music <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> on a permanent basis. • The community must be introduced to the music <b>support</b> <b>programme</b> because the concept is still unknown. • To help children with social-emotional behavioural problems, schools can raise a fund that will help these learners to develop through a music <b>support</b> <b>programme.</b> • Schools and/or a music support presenter can give parental guidance and can set up a programme for parents.
