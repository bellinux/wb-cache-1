50|$|There {{have been}} some studies {{involving}} the use of reprocessed uranium in CANDU reactors. CANDU is designed to use natural uranium as fuel; the U-235 content remaining in spent PWR/BWR fuel is typically greater than that found in natural uranium, which is about 0.72% U-235, allowing the re-enrichment step to be skipped. Fuel <b>cycle</b> <b>tests</b> also have included the DUPIC (Direct Use of spent PWR fuel In CANDU) fuel cycle, where used fuel from a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) is packaged into a CANDU fuel bundle with only physical reprocessing (cut into pieces) but no chemical reprocessing.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{tests are}} {{long-term}} tests (weeks, months years), {{relative to the}} test organism’s life span (>10% of life span), and generally use sub-lethal endpoints. In chronic exposures, organisms {{come into contact with}} low, continuous doses of a toxicant. Chronic exposures may induce effects to acute exposure, but can also result in effects that develop slowly. Chronic tests are generally considered full life <b>cycle</b> <b>tests</b> and cover an entire generation time or reproductive life cycle (“egg to egg”). Chronic tests are not considered valid if mortality in the control sample is greater than 20%. These results are generally reported in NOECs (No observed effects level) and LOECs (Lowest observed effects level).|$|E

50|$|Acute {{tests are}} {{short-term}} exposure tests (hours or days) and generally use lethality as an endpoint. In acute exposures, organisms {{come into contact}} with higher doses of the toxicant in a single event or in multiple events over {{a short period of time}} and usually produce immediate effects, depending on absorption time of the toxicant. These tests are generally conducted on organisms during a specific time period of the organism’s life cycle, and are considered partial life <b>cycle</b> <b>tests.</b> Acute tests are not valid if mortality in the control sample is greater than 10%. Results are reported in EC50, or concentration that will affect fifty percent of the sample size.|$|E
5000|$|On March 13, 2017 EEStor completes {{third party}} testing of their {{capacitors}} showing a 20X increase in time constants over prior testing. Using a patented stacking approach that utilizes [...] "floating electrodes and induced field effect leakage buffering", third party verified results of stacked samples (4, 8, and 16 layer stacks) illustrate that capacitance increases proportionally with number of layers, but resistance does not drop {{as would be}} expected. Resistance actually remains flat and constant resulting in the time constant growing proportionally with number of layers, which is a unique aspect of EEStor's technology. Testing also included environmental testing with humidity of 20% to 65% and <b>cycle</b> <b>tests</b> to 500K cycles with no measured heat generation or performance degradation.|$|E
50|$|High-rate, partial state-of-charge <b>cycle</b> <b>tests</b> were {{performed}} to measure the ability of UltraBattery for use in utility ancillary service applications for energy storage and wind farm energy smoothing. Using a high-rate, partial state-of-charge cycling profile at the 1C1 to 4C1 rate, the UltraBattery was capable of more than 15,000 cycles with less than 20% capacity loss, and could cycle at the 4C1 rate. An absorbed glass matt (AGM) VRLA battery tested under the same conditions could only cycle at the 1C1 rate, required a recovery charge after about 100 cycles, and after 1100 cycles lost more than 20% of its capacity. UltraBattery was also able to cycle {{for more than ten}} times the number of cycles between recovery charges than the AGM VRLA battery (1000 vs.100).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design a simple field test to measure the {{anaerobic}} endurance fitness of rugby league players, which is an important fitness quality in the game of rugby league. Twelve amateur football players with a mean (+/-SD) age of 21. 5 years (+/- 2. 2) volunteered to participate in the study. The subjects completed 1 trial of the Wingate 60 -second (W 60) <b>cycle</b> <b>test</b> and 2 trials of the new Triple- 120 meter shuttle (T 120 S) test. All trials were completed 4 days apart. The validity of the T 120 S was determined by comparing physiological responses (heart rate and blood lactate) and rating of perceived exertion to the all-out W 60 <b>cycle</b> <b>test.</b> The results indicate there is a significant relationship between maximum heart rate (r = 0. 63 and 0. 71) for the 2 trials of the T 120 S and the W 60 <b>cycle</b> <b>test.</b> There was no significant relationship between the 2 trials and the W 60 <b>cycle</b> <b>test</b> for post 3 minute lactate (r = 0. 112 and 0. 101) and rating of perceived exertion (r = 0. 94 and 0. 161). However, the T 120 S test elicited greater mean values for these measures than the W 60 <b>cycle</b> <b>test.</b> The results indicate that the T 120 S is a valid test of anaerobic endurance and represents a sports specific test of this quality that may provide useful information for players and coaches involved in the sport of rugby league...|$|R

50|$|There remain some {{limitations}} with early life stage toxicity testing. Although ELS tests are quicker and more cost-efficient than full life <b>cycle</b> <b>tests,</b> they remain resource- and time-intensive. Fish early life stage (FELS) tests require hundreds {{of fish and}} 1 to 5 months to complete. Other issues include the lack of mechanistic information, differing sensitivities between species, and insensitivity to parental exposure. ELS tests don't provide information on the toxicant's mechanism of action. Sensitivity to specific toxicants varies with species, so the most sensitive or most important species should be tested in each case. ELS tests appear to be insensitive to parental exposure, and MATCs are generally the same for embryos of both exposed and unexposed parents. This {{could be due to}} the mode of action of the toxicant or the variability and insensitivity of ELS test design. Additionally, growth response {{has been found to be}} an insensitive endpoint in ELS tests with fish, having little bearing on the estimation of an MATC. Growth response could be omitted to reduce the duration and cost of screening tests.|$|E
