5000|$|Another problem {{common to}} cast iron plow bottoms {{was the lack}} of {{soundness}} and uniformity in the metal's molecular structure, which meant that some cast iron bottoms would have soft spots in the hardened surface, reducing the wearability of the plow bottom. Improvements made by James Oliver to his casting process overcame this problem also. Consequently, on June 30, 1857, James Oliver obtained his first patent from the United States government for his chilled plow shares and in February 1869, he obtained another patent for his process. What Oliver accomplished by this invention is sometimes referred to as <b>chill</b> <b>hardening,</b> or simply chilling. The purpose of chilling, whether it be a plowpoint or a wheel for a railroad car, is to produce an extremely hard and durable exterior of the object. This is done by including [...] "chills", pieces of metal, into the sand mold, such that when the molten iron is poured into the mould, the portion next to the chill cools rapidly, hardening in a way akin to quenching. This chilled area forms the exterior of the plowpoint. This metal cools more quickly than the metal which forms the other portion of the plowshare, and effectively becomes case hardened. Also, the vapors which arise as the molten metal comes in contract with the mould are expelled through a spout. Had these vapors been trapped in the mould, they would have caused impurities and would have weakened the plowpoint at the place where it should have been the hardest. To harden the plowpoints, Oliver arranged his moulding apparatus in such manner that the surface of the chill was in a position so that the melted metal first came into contact with the chill {{at the edge of the}} plowshare. This insured a hard plow cutting point.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Past studies {{suggested}} that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) assisted anti-tumor treatment and intensified {{the sensitivity of}} chemotherapy. However its clinical application has been curbed because of its low purity, high dosage, and strong toxicity. This research, through perspective random clinical control experiment, observed the therapeutic effect of the treatment of late malignant tumor through the injection of recombinant mutant human tumor necrosis factor (rmhTNF) combined with general chemotherapy and its adverse reactions. Methods 105 patients with advanced malignant tumor were randomly divided into trial group, 69 patients, and control group, 36 patients. Injection of rmhTNF 4 × 10 6 u/m 2 {{was given to the}} trial group, from the 1 st to 7 th days, the 11 th to 17 th days combined with chemotherapy course. The chemotherapy plan was as follows: CAP for patients with the NSCLC; FAM for patients with gastric cancer; FC for patients with colorectal cancer. One treatment cycle lasted for 21 days and two cycles were scheduled. The control group was given only the same chemotherapy as the trial group. Results In the trial group there was 1 CR case and 12 PR cases, and the response rate is 13 / 69 (18. 84 %); in the control group 1 PR case, the response rate 1 / 36 (2. 78 %). The response rate of the trial group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P = 0. 022). The response rate for NSCLC in the trial group was 8 / 17 (47. 06 %), and 1 / 6 (16. 67 %) in the control group. The response rates for gastric cancer and colorectal cancer in the trial groups also were higher than those of the control groups. After the treatment the KPS is 89. 00 ± 9. 92 in the trial group, and 84. 17 ± 8. 84 in the control group, with {{a significant difference between the}} two groups (P = 0. 028). The adverse reactions of rmhTNF injection included: pain in the injection area, <b>chill,</b> <b>hardening</b> and swelling and redness in the injection area, fever, ostealgia and myosalgia, and cold-like symptoms. All these adverse reactions were mild and bearable. Conclusions The administration of rmhTNF injection in combination with general chemotherapy is an effective and secure means in treating advanced malignant tumor. </p...|$|E

5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory butter {{prepared}} by mixing softened butter with very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper {{has also been}} used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper or plastic wrap and <b>chilled</b> to <b>harden.</b>|$|R
50|$|One myth tells that Poliʻahu {{had come}} from Mauna Kea with her friends to attend sled races down the grassy hills south of Hamakua. Pele came {{disguised}} as a beautiful stranger and was greeted by Poliʻahu. However, Pele became jealously enraged at the goddess of Mauna Kea. She opened the subterranean caverns of Mauna Kea and threw fire from them towards Poliʻahu, with the snow goddess fleeing towards the summit. Poliʻahu {{was finally able to}} grab her now-burning snow mantle and throw it over the mountain. Earthquakes shook the island as the snow mantle unfolded until it reached the fire fountains, <b>chilling</b> and <b>hardening</b> the lava. The rivers of lava were driven back to Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Later battles also led to the defeat of Pele and confirmed the supremacy of the snow goddesses in the northern portion of the island and of Pele in the southern portion.|$|R
