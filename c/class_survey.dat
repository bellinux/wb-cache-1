2500|$|In 1946, the Australian Cabinet {{decided that}} the RAN would remain in control of all hydrographic {{operations}} in both Australian waters and areas of Australian interest. RAN warships were used to survey waters around Australia {{as part of a}} national hydrographic survey. In 1947, the Antarctic exploration ship [...] was commissioned, but only one voyage was completed, and RAN hydrographic operations in the Antarctic were stopped in 1948. In 1963, a resource and export boom required the Hydrographic Service to change its focus from a comprehensive national survey to the charting of new ports and shipping routes suitable for deep-draught merchant ships. A purpose-built survey ship, [...] entered service in 1964. Survey of ports and shipping routes was completed by 1974. From 1979 onwards, the Hydrographic Service began to provide hydrographic assistance and training to Pacific island nations. During 1989 and 1990, four Paluma <b>class</b> <b>survey</b> ships entered service with the RAN, followed by two larger Leeuwin class ships in 1999. In 1993, the RAN began to use Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (LADS) technology to asistin surveying: this was first fitted to a Fokker F27 aircraft, then in 2010 was installed in a De Havilland Dash 8, operated by the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder Flight.|$|E

They included complete overhaul and docking of the ship, <b>class</b> <b>surveys,</b> renovation of accommodations and galleys, shell plating and deck house steel renewal. Especially interesting was the modification of the existing vessel’s electrical power supply system and the installation of new generators, switch boards and control mechanisms, and refurbishment of the fuel system, reverse osmosis system, black and gray discharge water system, fire alarm and similar. UHP water blasting of hull, Ballast tanks blasting with steel shots and application of full coating system, cleaning and gas freeing of all fuel tanks, modification of existing spaces into the new auxiliary engine room including installation of 3 new CAT generators, switch boards and control room was carried out. This is the second time that Viktor Lenac has been awarded a USS Mount Whitney contract. In 2011 the ship underwent extensive docking and <b>class</b> <b>surveys.</b>|$|R
