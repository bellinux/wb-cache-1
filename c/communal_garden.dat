500|$|Joseph T. Parkinson {{designed}} and built the houses in Montagu Square {{as part of the}} Portman Estate, between 1810 and 1815. It was named after the Yorkshire-born Elizabeth Montagu: a social reformer, patron of the arts, salonist, literary critic, and writer. She had lived nearby, in Montagu House, Portman Square, until her death on 25August1800. The square is an example of Regency terrace residential architecture that was popular in the 19th century, with a <b>communal</b> <b>garden</b> located in the centre; surrounded by iron railings and padlocked so its use would be limited to residents. No.34 was built as one of the square's many tall buildings which were originally intended for use as whole family homes instead of apartments. A Victorian writer was especially caustic when talking about the architecture: [...] "Montagu Square and Bryanston Square are twin deformities, [...] economical modern builders ... dispose of with profit to those who wish to live near the great".|$|E

There is a <b>communal</b> <b>garden</b> in modern Fougères that commemorates this interesting and little known fact.|$|E
