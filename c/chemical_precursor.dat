Bio mass pyrolysis is a proven method of producing a broad mixture of small molecular organic compounds (SMOC; Bridgwater 2003) which can be isolated and treated as alternatives for renewable organic <b>chemical</b> <b>precursors.</b> The petrochemical industry is also based on seven different building blocks, namely, ethylene, propylene, butane, butylene, butadiene, syn gas and BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene), and all organic chemicals can be derived from these building blocks (Brown 2003).
