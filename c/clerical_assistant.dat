The £ 2. 02 m allocated to the FRC over the period 1991 - 1993 (75 % funded by the EC) is being used to carry out applied research in the three main areas of our responsibility - fish stocks, aquaculture and marine environment - in support of lreland’s marine based industries.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an outline of}} the history of library provision for nurses {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century. The few libraries for nurses that existed in the fifties were usually attached to Schools of Nursing and often run by volunteers, <b>clerical</b> <b>assistants</b> or nurse tutors. In an organisation where the emphasis was on training and skills development rather than education and reflection and the prime aim was maintaining a health service with limited resources, provision of books and journals for theoretical learning had a low priority. In turn nurses gained a reputation as people who did not read. In order to respond to problems of staff morale, recruitment and retention, in the last decade of the century attempts were made to make nursing more attractive by giving pre-registration learners student status, encouraging a research-based approach to learning and absorbing it into higher education. However many of the problems facing libraries would not be quickly resolved. An attempt will be made to explain library provision for nurses with reference to the generation of knowledge in nursing and its relationship to library based knowledge. This will touch on the role and status of the nurse, the nature of her work and training, the ideological foundations of the nursin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Why do many Japanese women choose female-dominated occupations, {{even though}} it is {{generally}} believed that they lead to dead-end careers? In this article, I posit that under the conditions of existing discrimination by employers and structural barriers, many Japanese women are investing in this “feminine path ” (non-career <b>clerical</b> or <b>assistant</b> roles in large companies) which endows women (or so they believe) with certain advantages in acquiring status through marriage (“attainment of marital status“). I call this “feminine capital”, and it is one reason why women choose these paths. 1 I argue that these feminine paths can benefit them in attaining marital status more than gender-neutral occupations, es-pecially when women are not capable of pursuing highly selective gender-neutral occupations. 2 Feminine occupations are considered to have benefits when com-pared to gender-neutral occupations, mainly because they have advantages in cul-tural capital and social capital. 1...|$|R
40|$|To {{know where}} our state {{libraries}} are going, {{it is important}} first {{to know where they}} have been and where they are now. Without going into this exhaustively, let me develop with you for a few moments {{some of the things that}} have happened to us in the five years since the Library Services Act became the law of the land. I think we are all aware of the fact that the r improvement in our state library agencies is one of the principal accomplishments of the Library Services Act. The publication, State Plans under the Library Services Act. Supplement 2, A makes this quite clear. State after state reported strengthened state library agencies in all parts of the country. Idaho, for example, employed its first trained administrator and three more professional librarians in the state agency. Kansas and Mississippi added professional librarians and <b>clerical</b> <b>assistants.</b> It was not just the small state agencies that did this, however; even the New York State Library built on its existing strength by adding specialists in Young Adult, Reference, and Children's Services. In all, more than 115 field workers or consultants were added to state agency staffs, an increase of more than 100 per cent over the total field staffs in existence in 1956. In addition, 285 other professional librarians were added. It is significant that 15 states, in addition to adding staff r and other resources to their central agencies, established or strengthened regional branches &r extension offices. Equally noteworthy is the fact that more than 30 processing centers were established under the stimulus of the Library Services Act and are now serving more than 500 libraries in the several states. Granted that it is largely the smaller libraries that are being serviced in this manner, it is still true that this figure represents just about one-fourteenth of the total number of public libraries in the United States today. State agencies have played a key part in this development, which represents an important and significant step forward toward our announced goals of ^larger library systems for the United States...|$|R
