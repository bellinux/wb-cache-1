40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{systematically}} document drivers {{of change and}} the implications they will have on international supply chain management in the coming two decades. Design/methodology/approach - This study was commissioned by the World Customs Organization (WCO) {{at the end of}} June 2006. Because of increased trade volumes, emerging complex supply networks and heightened security concerns, the WCO saw the need to assess future trends and drivers in supply chain management. The Delphi method was applied to identify a set of foreseeable drivers of change and to assess their predicted impact on global supply chain management in the coming ten to 20 years. Based on a literature review of 150 recent publications and interviews among 33 industry, academic and <b>customs</b> <b>experts,</b> a survey was designed and conducted to collect current and potential change drivers in global supply chains. These drivers were compiled and prioritized by an eclectic team of 12 specialists. Findings - The main results of the study are strongly connected to strategic and operational supply chain planning for the next ten to 20 years. They are related to increased off-shoring of operations through truly global manufacturing, characterized by its intercontinental supply of materials; increased product complexity with shorter product life cycles; increased importance of business-to-governmert networking for operational and security efficiency; introduction of new supply chain services integrating financial, physical and information flows leading to further consolidation in the logistics markets; and the overall increase in risks and vulnerabilities in international supply chains. Originality/value - This paper provides a 360 degree view of the future of international supply chain management and the challenges companies will face to compete in the twenty-first century business environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{share of}} renewable energy sources introduces the need for flexibility on the demand side of the electricity system. A prominent example of loads that offer flexibility at the residential level are thermostatically controlled loads, such as heat pumps, air conditioning units, and electric water heaters. Demand response programs harness demand flexibility by enabling consumers to adapt their electricity consumption profile in response {{to changes in the}} electricity price or other grid signals. The traditional control paradigm defines the demand response problem as a model-based control problem, requiring a model of the demand response application, an optimizer, and a forecasting technique. A critical step in setting up a model-based controller comprises selecting accurate models and estimating the model parameters. This step becomes even more challenging considering the heterogeneity of the end users and their different patterns of behavior. As a result, different end users are expected to have different model parameters and even different models. Building such a controller is considered a cumbersome endeavour, requiring <b>custom</b> <b>expert</b> knowledge, that has to be repeated for each load, making a large scale deployment of similar solutions challenging. Reinforcement Learning (RL), on the other hand, is a model-free technique that requires no a priori knowledge and considers its environment as a “black box”. RL techniques enable an agent to learn a control policy by interacting with its environment without the need to use modeling and system identification techniques. Inspired by the recent developments in batch RL, this work builds upon the existing batch RL literature and contributes to its application to residential demand response, opening the door for practical implementations: from theory to practice. This dissertation proposes a model-free approach to harness the flexibility of thermostatically controlled loads that is practical, cost-effective, self-adaptive and generally applicable. 1 Introduction 2 Control strategies for residential demand response 3 Reinforcement learning 4 Demand response using batch reinforcement learning 5 Simulation results 6 Experimental results 7 Aggregated demand response 8 Conclusions and future researchnrpages: 162 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|At {{the request}} of the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism in the Netherlands a {{research}} project called “Security through innovation - risk-oriented detection in a drive-through set-up” has been carried out by TNO Defense, Security and Safety (TNO) and by Dutch Customs. In 2009 and 2010, a group of TNO and Dutch <b>Customs</b> <b>experts</b> performed two experimental sessions involving air cargo containers, several trace detector systems and real explosive compounds at the cargo terminal of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Field experiments were designed in order to test the applicability of various commercially of the shelf trace detectors and promising newly-developed instruments with 6 + TRL levels for screening of air cargo containers and pallets. In order to select instruments suitable for cargo screening and trace detection of explosives hidden in cargo containers, a detailed market review and assessment of information acquired from diverse available sources has been performed during the initial phase of the project. In the subsequent stages a theoretical evaluation of the potential of these instruments or techniques was performed, followed by laboratory experiments and feasibility trials with selected devices and sampling tools. Preliminary investigation resulted in the fi nal choice of devices/systems matched to the acknowledged threat list. Six diff erent explosives – among them pure explosives as well as composites, characterized by diff erentiated physical and chemical properties were used during the experiments in two diff erent scenarios. All explosives were packaged and concealed, such that large quantities of explosive were not visually exposed and possibly not readily available for sampling and analysis, with the aim of avoiding easy, visual detection. All experiments were designed and performed by TNO employees with particular attention paid to meticulous and well-structured sampling procedures. Logistic schemes were built to secure the best possible performance for all instruments tested. All trace detectors were applied according to the instructions provided by the many cooperating suppliers, enabling the equipment to achieve the best results for each detector. In particular cases simple modifi cations to the sampling methods were carried out and/or additional sampling methods were introduced and tested. Both vapor and particle trace detectors were employed during the experiments. The results were analyzed directly after the sampling step or in more complicated cases the analysis was performed afterwards. The applicability of the particular set up or technique in a current scenario was evaluated. Functioning of the detectors used in a dedicated scenario was assessed in terms of the detection performance, observed false alarm rate and usage convenience. Also logistic issues and commercial aspects were taken into account. Research performed during the experimental sessions resulted in a vast amount of observations and fi ndings and recommendations...|$|R
40|$|The XML Expert System Shell (XESS) was {{designed}} to alleviate some of the difficulties associated with translating a knowledge base from one expert system to another. The major goal of XESS is to allow programmers to model an expert system, complete with traditional facts and rules, in an XML-based language that leverages the universally understood terms used when teaching artificial intelligence to students. XML, the extensible markup language, is a text-based standard for information interchange between disparate systems 1; it was originally designed to represent data in an easily parsable, human readable format 2. While some extensions of the XML specification, particularly the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), have long since abandoned human readability, the core XML specification is still used frequently to produce documents that can easily be exchanged between computational platforms and created or understood by human beings. The XESS-XML language inherits all of the usability of XML; it can be edited by hand in any text editor, is human readable, and can be parsed using XML parsers commonly available in any modern programming language. The XML Schema specification provides a mechanism for explicitly defining the content of an XML document so that a document can be validated 3, 4, 5. XML schemas specify the make-up of an XML document in exacting detail 6, using a pseudo-object-oriented syntax to specify exactly which entities are allowed in the document, the attributes of those entities, where they are allowed in the document, and how often they may occur. The XESS-XML language {{is defined as a}} fully extensible XML Schema, which can be used to validate any knowledge base written in the language. The Schema provides entities for common facts (e. g. predictes, structs) and a robust syntax for expressing rules in an if-then-else format, as well as the actions that should be taken in the event that a rule is fired. Additionally, because XML schemas are fully extensible, the XESS schema may be extended to add additional functionality such as support for fuzzy logic, new clause types, or new actions to be taken when rules are fired. In addition to the XML language, XESS also includes an object oriented interpreter specification that defines a robust set of language independent APIs for interacting with the expert system. This interpreter specification is meant to set expectations, both for XESS developers and users, as to the features provided by the XESS API regardless of the language in which the interpreter has been implemented. As part of the specification, the XESS API also provides object oriented definitions for XESS plug-ins; a plug-in is capable of translating from an XESS document to the native language of a specific expert system shell in a generic way (i. e. not specific to any one rule set) and back again. This allows users to express <b>custom</b> <b>expert</b> system shells in the XESS-XML language, parse them using an XESS interpreter written in any language, and translate them to a specific expert system shell through the use of an XESS plug-in without needing to learn the specific expert system shell language or rewriting the knowledge base once for each shell tested...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary: The {{software}} {{contained in}} this package, termed POSAT (Police Officer Standards and Training) is the prototype knowledge-base {{decision support system}} developed specifically for the Utah State Police Academy. All police officers must be certified annual {{for the use of}} radar guns. This self-study computer program is intended to reduce the cost of providing field training for hundreds of police officers each year. By installing the POSAT software at remote locations, polic officers within a certain districut need only to travel to the nearest remote testing sight to take the exam and renew their radar certification. POSAT automatically transmits the exam results to the mainframe computer located in Salt Lake City, where they can be evaluated, and notices of valid re-certification can be distributed to the officers who took the exam. POSAT was constructed from a <b>custom</b> designed <b>expert</b> system kernet using object oriented technologies and languages (C++). Ther kernet is completely event driven, and operates under rule, action, and variable objects. Each of the objects derive their knowledge from either user input, or external modules that provide the knowledge automatically (via fact bases, or remote data bases). POSAT was then implemented under the Microsoft Windows operating system. As a result, the software can administer intelligent exams and context sensitive advice through the expert system kernel, as well as take advantage of the friendly interface inherent to Windows programs, multimedia support such as digitized photos, movie clips, animation, and other forms of interactive teaching methodologies that are not available in other environments. This manual briefly describes the features in POSAT. It explains how to install the program on your computer system, and how to start and quit the program. It also includes information about the screens you will see and the appropriate responses needed to navigate the program. This manual assumes that you are familiar with the basic terminology and procedures for using Microsoft Windows version 3. 1 or later. It also assumes that you have set up the Window soperating environment on your computer system...|$|R
