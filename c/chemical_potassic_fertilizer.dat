40|$|In the South African sugar {{industry}} {{during the past}} three decades, considerable research has taken place in the field laboratory and glasshouse with regard to the potassium re~ quirement of sugarcane. The value of <b>potassic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> for cane production is reviewed using field experimental data. Correlations established between cane and sucrose yield {{on the one hand and}} soil and leaf analyses on the other are discussed. Whilst soil and leaf analyses are used as a guide for assessing the K requirement of sugarcane, various soil and clim~tic factors can markedly influence the availability of J?otassmm to sugarcanethus affecting the reliability with WhICh K recommendations can be made on certain soils. Severalof these factors are discussedin detail which include clay mineralogy of the soil, exchangeable K as an index of K availability, non-exchangeable K and rate of K release K-fixation, amount of subsoil K., antagonism between ion~ in the soil solution, and soil temperature and moisture content. Taking these factors into account, various proposals are made for improving the current system of recommendations for potassium based on soil and leaf analyses...|$|R
40|$|Changes in soil mineralogical {{properties}} in humid subtropical regions due to <b>potassic</b> <b>fertilizer</b> practices {{are so far}} poorly understood. The main objective {{of this study was}} to compare the changes in soil minerals and the consequences on K+ release. Soil samples (depth of 0 – 10 cm) were collected over eleven years from areas with and without K fertilization and from a nearby natural grassy vegetation site on the Campus of the Federal University of Santa Maria. The K fertilizer treatments were 0 kg ha- 1 year- 1 of K 2 O (K 0) and 90 kg ha- 1 of K 2 O year- 1 of K 2 O (K 90). The total K+, non exchangeable K+ and exchangeable K+ were determined in the soil samples. Feldspats, illite and interstratified illite-smetite minerals were identified in X ray diagrams of Ca 2 +-saturated soil and clay fractions. The K 90 treatment appeared to preserve the illite and illite-smectite interstratified minerals in the clay fraction. Independent of the level of potassic fertilization, the illite and illite-smectite mineral proportions tended to decrease at the expense of interstratified hydroxy-Al vermiculite...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Many {{countries}} import <b>potassic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> due to {{dearth of}} K-mineral deposits. Therefore processes to obtain K-nutrient sources from sea bittern {{were developed by}} our Institute. The present investigation evaluated the fertilizer potential of three different sea bittern-derived (SBD) potassium forms developed viz., potassium schoenite, potassium nitrate and potassium ammonium sulfate on maize productivity in two cropping seasons. Methods: The pot and field experiments consisted of four treatments, wherein the three K forms were applied at the recommended rate of 40 kg K 2 O ha− 1 and were compared with commercially used sulfate of potash. The effect of these fertilizers on different parameters of plant and soil were evaluated. Results: The application of SBD-potassic fertilizers led to enhancement in growth, productivity and quality of maize which related well with higher photosynthesis, nutrient uptake and soil quality parameters. On an average all the three forms of sea bittern-derived potash enhanced yield of maize over control by 22. 3 and 23. 8 %, respectively, in pot and field trials. The best performance was under SBD-KNO 3, which also recorded the highest benefit: cost ratio of 1. 76. Conclusion: The K-fertilizers derived from sea-bittern—a waste product of salt industry—can thus be economically used to improve crop production sustainably...|$|R

The objectives were evaluation {{of the performance of}} the center pivot irrigation system, the irrigation scheduling practiced in the farm and crop water requirement. The low level of both macro–and micro – nutrients suggests the need for addition of nitrogenous, phosphatic and <b>potassic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> together with foliar spray of micro–nutrients. Also, the results showed that the uniformity coefficients, using Christiansen (Cu) and Heirman and Hein (CuHH) methods was relatively low being 84. 14 % and 85. 32 %, respectively. The distribution uniformity (Du) was 80 % at 50 % speed which is below the acceptable value. The results also revealed that the application efficiency is 77. 72 %. For proper irrigation scheduling, a recent innovation having the trade name „„Watermark” coupled with a special resistance digital meter were used for monitoring the soil moisture. It becomes evident from these results that when appropriate scheduling programmes are followed, as by using the “Watermark”, three to four irrigations can be eliminated in one month which will reduce the fuel cost and finally the total cost of operation of the center pivot irrigation system...|$|R
40|$|The {{fertilizer}} {{consumption in}} India has grown during last fifty years from a mere 69000 tonnes of NPK to 18 million tonnes. In the process, food grain production has increased over four times starting from 50 million tonnes during 1950 - 51 to 208 million tonnes during 1999 - 2000. Correspondingly, fertilizer consumption per hectare {{has increased from}} merely 0. 52 kg to 94. 72 kg/ha. This represents a consumption of 60. 77 kg N, 25. 15 kg P 2 O 5 and 8. 8 kg K 2 O and a NPK consumption ratio of 6. 9 : 2. 7 : 1. The NPK consumption ratio during 1991 - 92 was 5. 9 : 2. 4 : 1 which got widened to 9. 5 : 3. 2 : 1 during 1992 - 93 due to increase in prices of phosphatic and <b>potassic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> due to their de-control resulting into their reduced consumption. This clearly brings out the major effect of prices on the consumption of fertilizers. The ratio has gradually narrowed down to 6. 9 : 2. 7 : 1 during 1999 - 2000 due {{to a number of}} measures taken by the Government like ad hoc price support to de-controlled fertilizers and increase in the support prices of food grains etc. The increase in the suppor...|$|R

30|$|Sugarcane pre-dominantly {{grows in}} the {{tropical}} and sub-tropical regions, and sugar beet predominantly grows in colder temperate regions of the world. Other than sugar, products derived from sugarcane include falernum, molasses, rum, cachaça (a traditional spirit from Brazil), bagasse, and ethanol. Several workers throughout the world have characterized these bio-resources {{from the point of}} their utilization in agriculture, and reported that these bio-resources could be used in agriculture for improving the soil fertility and productivity, growth, and yield of crops. Under the present trend of exploitative agriculture, inherent soil fertility can no longer be maintained on a sustainable basis. The nutrient supplying capacity of soil declines steadily under continuous and intensive cropping (Shukla et al. 2016). The use of optimum levels of N, P, and K has failed to maintain yield levels, probably due to increasing secondary and micronutrient deficiencies and also unfavorable alterations in the physical and chemical properties of soil. Apart from the fertility and productivity issues, the use of chemical fertilizers is also becoming increasingly difficult due to their high costs and scarcity during peak season. Alternative means of providing nutrients needs to be explored. In this context, the utilization of by-products and industries wastes serves as sources of macro-, secondary, and micro-nutrients. Sugarcane is a heavy feeder; it required higher amount of nitrogenous, phosphatic, and <b>potassic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> for a better healthy crop. For healthier food products, people using organic fertilizer are heaving negligible amount of chemical fertilizers. It is gaining more attention, nowadays, than chemical fertilizers. It enhanced the soil organic matter and supply plant nutrient in a long way, by the significant improvement in soil physio-chemical properties.|$|R

The treatments consisted of three nitrogen rates (60, 80 and 100 kg ha) along with phosphorous and <b>potassic</b> <b>fertilizers</b> and two chlormequatchloride formulations (50 % AS, 30 mL ha, 50 % AS, 60 mL ha, 10 % AS, 150 mL ha and 10 % AS, 300 mL ha were the four levels). The field {{experiment was}} laid out in split plot design with three replications. The spraying of the chlormequatchloride was done during flowering phase of cotton viz., 60, 70, 80 and 90 days after sowing. Adopting all the recommended package of practices the crop was grown to maturity and harvested. The results showed that the height of the cotton plant was markedly increased with graded doses of N and reduced to the chlormequatchloride treatments. There was profuse vegetative growth of the test crop of MCU- 7 cotton at 100 kg of N ha. With reference to the yield attributes, chlormequatchloride sprayed in two formulations (chlormequatchloride 50 % AS, 30 mL ha x 4 applications at 60, 70, 80, 90 days interval and 10 % AS, 150 mL ha x 4 applications at 60, 70, 80, 90 days interval) and with increased N rates had produced more number of monopodia, sympodia and bolls as compared to control that did not receive chlormequatchloride. The boll weight was also profoundly increased.

50|$|In {{addition}} to its use as a fertilizer, potassium chloride is important in many industrialized economies, where it is used in aluminium recycling, by the chloralkali industry to produce potassium hydroxide, in metal electroplating, oil-well drilling fluid, snow and ice melting, steel heat-treating, in medicine {{as a treatment for}} hypokalemia, and water softening. Potassium hydroxide is used for industrial water treatment and is the precursor of potassium carbonate, several forms of potassium phosphate, many other <b>potassic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> and soap manufacturing. Potassium carbonate is used to produce animal feed supplements, cement, fire extinguishers, food products, photographic chemicals, and textiles. It is also used in brewing beer, pharmaceutical preparations, and as a catalyst for synthetic rubber manufacturing. These non-fertilizer uses have accounted for about 15% of annual potash consumption in the United States.|$|R
40|$|The {{elimination}} of straw burning of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) propitiates the mulch {{left in the}} field, promoting improvement of soil fertility and can reduce the use of potash fertilizers. This study aimed to evaluate the response of first and second sugarcane ratoon cultivated in conservative management system, the potassium levels, in Red-yellow latosol (Hapludox) (LVAD) and Red-yellow Argisol Eutrophic (PVAe). Two experiments, one in LVAD (variety SP 81 - 3250) and another in PVAe (variety RB 855453) were developed. The treatments consisted of doses of 32, 5; 65; 130 and 195 kg ha- 1 of K 2 O, {{in the form of}} potassium chloride, besides the control (without <b>potassic</b> <b>fertilizer),</b> arranged in a randomized block design with five replications. The plots that received the treatments in the first ratoon were once again treated with the same doses in the second ratoon. The plots that received the treatments in the first ratoon were once again treated with the same doses in the second ratoon. Were applied 100 kg ha- 1 of nitrogen in the form of urea and 30 kg ha- 1 of P 2 O 5 in the form of triple superphosphate. The fertilizers were applied {{to the side of the}} line of ratoon from sugarcane, without incorporation in each year of cultivation. Were evaluated the biometric variables (height, tiller number and diameter); potassium contents in soil, straw and plant, production and quality of the culms in two seasons (2010 / 2011 and 2011 / 2012). Potassium fertilization resulted in higher contents of nutrients in the soil and the plant, reflecting gains in the production of culms, both the first as the second sugarcane ratoon in both soils evaluated. The dose of 65 kg ha- 1 of K 2 O is associated with 97 and 98 % of the maximum production at the first ratoon, while, in the second ratoon this dose represents 90 and 95 % of the maximum production respectively for the LVAd and PVAdA eliminação da queima da palhada da cana-de-açúcar (Saccharum ssp.) propicia a cobertura morta deixada no campo, promovendo melhoria da fertilidade do solo e podendo diminuir o uso de fertilizantes potássicos. Objetivou-se avaliar a resposta da primeira e da segunda soqueira da cana-de-açúcar, cultivada no sistema de manejo conservacionista, a doses de potássio, em Latossolo Vermelho Amarelo Distrófico (LVAd) e em Argissolo Vermelho Amarelo Eutrófico (PVAe). Foram desenvolvidos dois experimentos, um em LVAd (variedade SP 81 - 3250) e outro em PVAe (variedade RB 855453). Os tratamentos constituíram-se das doses de 32, 5; 65; 130 e 195 kg ha- 1 de K 2 O, na forma de cloreto de potássio, além do tratamento controle (sem adubo potássico), dispostos em blocos ao acaso, com cinco repetições. As parcelas que receberam os tratamentos na primeira soqueira foram novamente tratadas com as mesmas doses na segunda soqueira. Foram aplicados 100 kg ha- 1 de nitrogênio na forma de ureia e 30 kg ha- 1 de P 2 O 5 na forma de superfosfato triplo. Os fertilizantes foram aplicados ao lado da linha da soqueira da cana-de-açúcar, sem incorporação em cada ano de cultivo. Avaliaram-se as variáveis biométricas (altura, número e diâmetro de perfilho); teores de potássio no solo, palhada e planta; a produção e a qualidade dos colmos em duas safras (2010 / 2011 e 2011 / 2012). A adubação potássica aumentou o teor do nutriente no solo e na planta, refletindo em ganhos na produção de colmos, tanto da primeira quanto da segunda soqueira da cana-de-açúcar, nos dois solos avaliados.

40|$|The {{virulence}} of 300 monosporous field isolates of Ophiobolus graminis {{was compared}} on wheat. All were strongly pathogenic when first Isolated, but some became weakly pathogenic when maintained in culture. Symptom expression was studied in wheat infected {{with one of}} the isolates. Infections affected root length and numbers, plant height, fresh weight, had development and yield. : The so-called empty "deadhead" was only one of several head symptoms which ranged from complete suppression to empty and poorly-filled heads. Overall symptoms were increased in severity by reducing light intensity, days length and soil moisture; by restricting root development, and by earlier inoculations. Symptoms were also influenced by temperature in the test range 20 - 28 C, being more severe at the lower temperatures when plants were inoculated within eight weeks of seeding. Lower temperatures and shorter day lengths also retarded plant maturity, thus indirectly increasing severity of final symptoms. Symptom expression was unaffected by nitrogenous, phosphatic, <b>potassic</b> and complete <b>fertilizers,</b> although nitrogenous dressings increased yield. Symptoms caused by the isolate in wheat were compared with those by Fusarium graminearum, HeIminthosporium sativum and Pythium ultimum under spring glasshouse conditions. Swelling of root tips was caused by P. ultimum and root discolouration by the remainder, but only O. graminis significantly reduced plant height, fresh weight, numbers of functional roots and yield. Nuclear distribution in hyphae of the isolate was compared with that of Curvularia ramosa, C. spicifera, Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. graminearum, Helminthosporium sativum and Wojnowicia graminis. Tip cells of O. graminis were predominantly uni-nucleate whilst those of other fungi were generally multi-nucleate. When opposed to other fungi in culture, O. graminis was slightly antagonistic towards Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum. Helminthosporium satiyum and Wojnowicia graminis, whereas Pythium ultimum exhibited antagonism towards O. graminis. The combination of O. graminis with Curyularia ramosa was mutually antagonistic, but no antagonism was evident in combination with either C. spicifera or Fusarium graminearum. The saprophytic survival of the isolate was examined on artificially-infected wheat straw buried in unsterilized soil. Survival was prolonged by nitrogenous soil amendments, unaffected. by superphosphate dressings and reduced by growing various plant species over infected straw. O. graminis was isolated from all species, including dicotyledons, sown over straw. Three methods for estimating survival on various hosts were compared, viz., those involving artificially-infected straws previously sterilized by either propylene oxide or autoclaving and inverted sods of infected hosts. The use of sods was the most satisfactory and indicated O. graminis survived better on barley than wheat if inoculated at seeding and inverted after four weeks. Delaying inversion further increased survival on barley but not on wheat. Survival was also increased by increasing plant density, the effect being relatively greater with barley than wheat. However, survival was greater on wheat than barley when inoculation was delayed until eight weeks after seeding. O. graminis also survived better on Lolium perenne, Bromus mollis and B. sterilis than on Avena fatua and Vulpia myuros; and on Bromus gussonii and Hordeum hystrix than on PhalarIs minor, Avena sterilis, Ehrharta erecta and linseed when inoculated at seeding and inverted eight weeks later.
