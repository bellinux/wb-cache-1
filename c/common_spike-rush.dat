5000|$|The {{reserve is}} {{considered}} {{to have one of}} the best collections of wet heathland and bog plants in the county. Notable plants are bog asphodel, <b>common</b> cotton-grass, few-flowered <b>spike-rush</b> and tawny sedge. The loss of local habitat has resulted in this reserve becoming an important conservation area. Also recorded are lesser spearwort and marsh pennywort.|$|R
50|$|The pits are colonised by a rich flora. In the {{southern}} site grassland plants include southern marsh-orchid, bee orchid, common fleabane, field scabious and parasitic knapweed broomrape. Marshland plants include tufted forget-me-not, water mint, pink water-speedwell, <b>common</b> <b>spike-rush,</b> amphibious bistort and the rare greater tussock-sedge.|$|E
50|$|Wetter {{areas of}} the site are {{dominated}} by soft rush Juncus effusus, and stable wet areas exhibit Sphagnum moss. Other areas have sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus and herbs such as water mint Mentha aquatica and sneezewort Achillea ptarmica. The bulrush Typha latifolia, floating sweet-grass Glyceria fluitans and <b>common</b> <b>spike-rush</b> Eleocharis palustris are also found.|$|E
5000|$|Eleocharis palustris (<b>common</b> <b>spike-rush,</b> {{creeping}} spike-rush or marsh spike-rush) is {{a species}} of mat-forming perennial flowering plants in the sedge family Cyperaceae. It grows in wetlands in Europe, North Africa, northern and central Asia (Siberia, China, Mongolia, Iran, Nepal, etc.) and North America (United States, Canada, Greenland, northern Mexico). [...] Eleocharis palustris is not easily distinguished from other closely related species and is extremely variable worldwide itself.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{a meadow}} beside the River Chess. It {{is an example of}} damp {{grassland}} which has been traditionally managed for grazing. There are also areas of swamp and marsh. The main plants in grassland areas include sweet vernal grass and meadow foxtail, and marsh horsetail and <b>common</b> <b>spike-rush</b> are common in damper areas. The site has hedgehogs and a wide variety of wetland birds and invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} {{is mainly}} of {{a mosaic of}} yellow iris Iris pseudacorus, branched bur-reed Sparganium erectum and rushes Juncus spp., while greater tussock-sedge Carex paniculata is locally dominant. Other conspicuous plants include meadowsweet Filipendula ulmaria, marsh-marigold Caltha palustris, ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi, watermint Mentha aquatica and southern marsh-orchid Dactylorhiza praetermissa. Also present are four species which are local in Devon: wood club-rush Scirpus sylvaticus, marsh valerian Valeriana dioica, fen bedstraw Galium uliginosum and <b>common</b> <b>spike-rush</b> Eleocharis palustris. The stream is bordered {{for most of its}} length by alder Alnus glutinosa, with a ground flora dominated by ramsons Allium ursinum.|$|E
50|$|In the {{southern}} part of the site the land slopes gently eastwards within a draining gully system; the head of the stream West End Brook flows through here. On the northern part of the site a former gravel pit, now partially infilled after it was abandoned in the early 1980s, has developed into a mosaic of shallow pools, also supporting a large pond, some heathland and scrub. The area supports many wetland plants including bulrush Typha latifolia, <b>common</b> <b>spike-rush</b> Eleocharis palustris, as well as a locally scarce species marsh speedwell Veronica scutellata. The heathland and scrub areas are predominantly populated by heather Calluna vulgaris and are slowly being colonised by birch. Surrounding land comprises typically of secondary birch woodland with some heathland. There is also a small valley bog where purple moor-grass Molinia caerulea is particularly abundant.|$|E
