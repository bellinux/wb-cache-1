40|$|In this study, a multi-variable {{extremum}} seeking control (ESC) {{scheme is}} proposed for a variable-speed mini-split air-conditioning system. The control inputs are the evaporator and <b>condenser</b> <b>fan</b> speeds, respectively, while the total power consumption {{is used as}} the feedback. As accurate model is hard and expensive to obtain for the AC system of interest in real time, nearly model-free self-optimizing control methods such as ESC is considered a more feasible solution to practical deployment. Recent development in ESC, and especially the Newton based multi-variable ESC method with online Hessian estimation provides the capability for real-time decoupling among the input channels (Ghaffari et al. 2012). Different from gradient based multi-variable ESC method, the Newton based multi-variable ESC provides uniform convergence characteristics for all the control inputs. Therefore, the Newton based multi-variable ESC is suitable for multi-input real-time optimization, especially for the case with large gain variation and coupling for different control input channels. An experimental setup is developed with a 9000 BTU variable-speed mini-split AC system (Mitsubishi MSZ-GE 09 NA 2 ̆ 6 MUY-GE 09 NA). A 2000 Watts electrical heater works as the heat load. The indoor unit of the mini-split system and the heater are installed in a 4 ’x 8 ’x 6 ’ insulated chamber. A Watt Node Pulse WNB- 3 D- 240 -P power meter is utilized to measure the power consumption of the mini-split system. To achieve the speed control of the evaporator fan motor and <b>condenser</b> <b>fan,</b> a TMS 320 F 28035 based customized motor controller is used. Three RTD temperature sensors are deployed to measure the indoor temperature, the outdoor temperature and the condenser coil temperature, respectively. The data acquisition and control algorithms are implemented on a National Instruments CompactRIO platform. During the system operation, the CompactRIO reads the power consumption sent from the power meter, which will be fed into the ESC control algorithm to get the speed reference for both the evaporator fan and the <b>condenser</b> <b>fan.</b> Then, the speed reference will {{be applied to the}} motor controllers for each motor. Meanwhile, some other measurements such as indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, the speed feedback for both the motors, etc. are also monitored by the CompactRIO.

40|$|An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a {{thermodynamic}} cycle {{that is particularly}} well-suited for waste heat recovery. It is generally employed for waste heat with temperatures {{in the range of}} 80 °C – 300 °C. When the application is strictly to convert waste heat into work with no restrictions on heat source exit temperature, thermal efficiency is not as relevant as other aspects of the cycle performance. In such an application, maximization of net power may be the objective rather than maximization of thermal efficiency. An air-cooled ORC for waste-heat conversion is studied in the present work. Two alternative cycle configurations which could increase the net power produced from a heat source with a given temperature and flow rate are proposed and analyzed. These cycle configurations are: • An ORC with two-phase flash expansion • An ORC with a zeotropic working fluid mixture (ZRC) A simplified ORC model is introduced which calculates the pinch point in the heat exchangers based on a specified minimum temperature difference. This model is used to assess the merits of each cycle configuration with respect to a baseline ORC when the finite capacity of the heat source and heat sink fluids is considered. The finite capacity of the heat sink fluid is incorporated into the model in terms of a <b>condenser</b> <b>fan</b> power requirement. Of all working fluids studied for the baseline ORC, R 134 a and R 245 fa result in the highest net power. The ORC with two-phase flash expansion offers the most improvement over the baseline cycle provided the expander can handle two-phase flow at the same isentropic efficiency as in the baseline case. Relative improvements are highest at low source temperatures. The maximum increase in net power is 84 % over the baseline ORC when water is the working fluid at a source temperature of 80 °C. At low source temperatures, the improvements decrease with increasing <b>condenser</b> <b>fan</b> power requirements. The improvements of the ZRC are also higher for low heat source temperatures. The ZRC shows improvement between 20 % and 40 % over the baseline as long as the <b>condenser</b> <b>fan</b> power is not negligible. At the highest estimated <b>condenser</b> <b>fan</b> power, the ZRC shows up to 92 % improvement at a source temperature of 100 °C, while the ORC with flash expansion is no longer beneficial.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{modelling}} and findings of the energy performance of an air-cooled reciprocating multiple-chiller plant under the conventional head pressure control and the new condensing-temperature control in a subtropical climate. The simulation model was validated using the operating data of an existing chiller plant. As noted from this existing air-cooled reciprocating chiller plant, there was a substantial efficiency drop at part-load resulting from the head pressure control. If operating at variable lower condensing-temperatures based on the established operating mode of the <b>condenser</b> <b>fans</b> and compressors, it is shown that the chiller consumption can be maintained below 2 kW/refrigeration ton throughout {{the entire range of}} outdoor temperature and part-load conditions, giving an average efficiency of 1. 08 kW/refrigeration ton.

40|$|This report {{identifies}} and quantifies the cycling {{losses in}} a domestic refrigerator-freezer. During cycling operation the refrigerator {{was found to}} operate between 5 and 25 % less efficient then the corresponding quasisteady machine. The cycling refrigerator operates with an evaporator capacity between 3 and 17 % less than the quasi-steady refrigerator, {{while at the same}} time requiring between 1 and 9 % more power to operate. This refrigerator performance degradation was attributed to several factors, the most important being the refrigerant migration and the thermal mass of the evaporator and compressor. During the off-cycle refrigerant migrates from the condenser to the evaporator as the system pressures equalize. The off-cycle migration increases the temperature of the evaporator and necessitates refrigerant redistribution during the on-cycle, and thereby tends to reduce system performance. The increased power requirements, traced to the compressor, result from slight differences in system pressure and the reduced compressor efficiency due to a cool compressor. With the cycling losses identified, several possible refrigerator design changes were suggested. It appears that a refrigerator equipped with a reciprocating compressor, solenoid valves to isolate the condenser, and no accumulator should operate in a nearly quasi-steady manner.

40|$|In {{heat engine}} design, the usual {{objective}} is to maximize thermal efficiency. However, for heat engines applied to waste heat recovery, an appropriate {{objective is to}} maximize power production by converting {{as much of the}} waste heat as possible into work. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is particularly well-suited to waste heat recovery because of its compactness relative to a steam Rankine cycle at typical waste heat temperatures. For a single-phase (sensible) waste heat stream with a finite capacity, maximization of thermal efficiency does not result in maximum power production. Therefore, traditional approaches aimed at increasing cycle thermal efficiency are not helpful. Instead, it is necessary to find designs that properly balance heat extraction from the source and thermal efficiency of the heat engine. In this regard two alternative ORC configurations are studied and compared using a uniform modeling strategy. These configurations are the ORC with two-phase flash expansion and the ORC with zeotropic working fluid mixture (ZRC). There are two key elements of the modeling strategy. Pinch point temperature differences are used to characterize the heat exchangers, and the air-side <b>condenser</b> <b>fan</b> power requirements are estimated. Each cycle configuration is modeled and compared to a baseline ORC for a range of potential working fluids and source fluid temperatures. Based on the model, the ORC with flash expansion shows the most consistent improvement over the baseline ORC. The highest increase in net power of 84 % over the baseline is seen at the low source temperature of 80 °C with water as the working fluid. However, this cycle and working fluid present more costly challenges to implementation, particularly in the expander design. This is due to the high volume ratios needed to expand low-pressure, two-phase water. The ZRC gives some of the highest relative improvements, but only when <b>condenser</b> <b>fan</b> power consumption is high. For a 100 °C source temperature and a mixture of R 134 a and R 245 fa as the working fluid, an improvement of 92 % over the baseline is seen if the required <b>condenser</b> <b>fan</b> power is 846 W/(m 3 /s). In addition, the ZRC has the benefit that it can utilize existing ORC expanders, giving it a potentially lower cost than the ORC with flash expansion. These results are valid in terms of their comparison of the thermodynamic potential of the different cycles and working fluids. However, a more detailed analysis incorporating the geometry and cost of each component is necessary to arrive at a final recommendation for a given application...|$|E

These chillers have long been considered inefficient because they operate under head pressure control where the condensing temperature is kept high in the refrigeration cycle.

An experiment is carried out on an air-cooled reciprocating chiller to confirm that an electronic expansion valve enables refrigerant to be adequately fed into the evaporator in all operating conditions, even when the condensing temperature falls to around 20 °C.

A mathematical model of an air-cooled chiller is developed for simulation and is validated by using the operating data of an existing chiller and of an experimental chiller. Compared to head pressure control (HPC) with a fixed set point of condensing temperature, CTC brings a moderate rise in the condensing temperature above the outdoor temperature, and hence enables the compressors to operate at a lower condensing pressure through staging more condenser fans. While more <b>condenser</b> <b>fan</b> power is consumed, compressor power can drop considerablely, reducing the annual chiller power consumption by 18. 4 %. It is suggested that the condensing temperature can be coupled with the outdoor temperature and the part load ratio of chillers to gauge the achievable part load efficiency.

40|$|Air-cooled {{chillers}} {{can take}} up around one-fourth of the total electricity consumption of an air-conditioned building. This paper evaluates the potential electricity cost savings of these chillers with improved condenser features of condensing temperature control (CTC), evaporative pre-coolers (EC) and variable speed <b>condenser</b> <b>fans</b> (VSF). A validated model for an air-cooled screw chiller was used to ascertain how the individual and mixed features influence the annual electricity consumption of chillers operating for the cooling load profile of a hotel. With regard to a chiller plant with a 15 -year lifespan, the life cycle electricity cost savings are estimated at between HK$ 2, 291, 247 and 8, 320, 732, depending on the features used. The simple payback of the features could range from 1. 07 to 3. 32 years. These findings show how chiller manufacturers and building owners can profit from implementing energy efficient technologies for air-cooled chillers. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{economic benefits}} of an air-cooled chiller retrofitted with advanced heat rejection features. The rated capacity was 282 kW and operating variables were monitored comprehensively to develop random forest models. The top five variables to ensure model accuracy were identified. Electricity savings were predicted by the models with 3 advanced operating modes: variable speed control for <b>condenser</b> <b>fans</b> with an adjustable condensing temperature (the VSD mode), mist precooling of condenser air (the Mist mode), and their composites (the VSD + Mist mode). The integrated part load value (IPLV) was 2. 90, 3. 31, 2. 93 and 3. 34 for the normal mode, VSD mode, Mist mode, and the VSD + Mist mode, respectively. For a chiller system serving an office building, the VSD mode gave the highest economic benefit with a simple payback of 10. 83 yrs and an {{internal rate of return}} of 4. 38 % over a 15 -yr life cycle.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{standard}} {{practice in the}} field of industrial refrigeration to design and operate systems with little regard toward part-load performance. This approach is understandable, whether viewed {{from the standpoint of the}} design engineer, plant manager or chief operator. As long a space temperature and production rates are maintained during peak periods, the refrigeration system is viewed as operating "correctly". The truth is, most refrigeration systems spend some, if not most operating hours at reduced capacity. Screw compressors back off slide valves, evaporator coils utilize back-pressure regulators (BPRs) or liquid solenoids, and condensers cycle fans. Unfortunately, these control methods do not provide the maximum attainable reduction in brake horsepower (BHP) as refrigeration capacity is reduced. This paper will discuss the application of variable speed drive (VSD, also called "variable frequency drive", "adjustable speed drive", "inverter", or simply "freq. drive") technology to capacity control of screw compressors, evaporator <b>fans,</b> and <b>condenser</b> <b>fans.</b> As shown through theory and case study, speed control of these components provides maximum flexibility, control and energy efficiency...|$|R
