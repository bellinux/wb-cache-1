40|$|Abstract – In seismic areas, {{ductility}} is {{an important}} factor in the design of high strength concrete (HSC) members under flexure. In order to investigate this, here in this study, eight HSC beams with different percentages of ρρ ′ & were cast and incrementally loaded under bending. During the test, the strain on the concrete middle faces, the tension and <b>compression</b> <b>bars,</b> and also the deflection at different points of the span length were measured up to failure. Based on the obtained results, the serviceability and ultimate behavior, and especially the ductility of the HCS members are more deeply reviewed. Also a comparison between theoretical and experimental results are reported here...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation into the structural behaviour of reinforced concrete beams incorporating a novel EPS-based lightweight aggregate (LWA) called stabilised polystyrene (SPS) aggregate. Four concrete mixtures with water to cement (W/C) ratio of 0. 8 were used. The replacement levels of natural aggregate by SPS were 0 %, 30 %, 60 % and 100 %. The volume ratio to manufacture SPS aggregate was 8 : 1 : 1 (80 % waste EPS: 10 % cement: 10 % clay). A total of 24 beams were cast and tested at 28 -day age. Three types of tension reinforcement were used: 2 bars, 3 bars and 2 bars + shear links. There were no <b>compression</b> <b>bars</b> at the top for all beams. Four point-loading flexural tests were conducted up to failure. In general, it can be observed that the structural behaviour of SPS concrete beams {{is similar to that of}} other types of lightweight aggregate concretes used around the world...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Test {{results of}} {{eighteen}} beams of high-strength concrete of 85 MPa (12, 300 psi) compressive strength are presented {{to study the}} influence of steel fibers and longitudinal tension and compression reinforcements on their immediate and long-term deflections. The re-sults show that the addition of fibers in singly reinforced beams reduc-es immediate and long-term deflections. For beams with <b>compression</b> <b>bars</b> and fibers, the excessive amount of two reinforcements may have an unfavorable effect on the long-term deflections. The beams having the ACI Code's minimum longitudinal tension reinforcement showed much higher time-dependent deflection to immediate deflection ratio, when {{compared with that of}} the beams having about 50 percent of the balanced tension reinforcement. The theoretical method presented in the paper for predicting deflections considers the effect of steel fibers on material and section properties. The computed values for the tested beams and those of a parametric study indicate that the influence of steel fibers in increasing the moment of inertia of cracked transformed sections is most pronounced in beams having small amount of longitu-dinal tension reinforcement...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{existing}} numerical models of shield tunnel with double lining, an improved numerical model is developed and its rationality is verified by a similar model test. In the improved numerical model, lining, joint, and junction surface, respectively, are simulated by beam, spring, and a combination of <b>compression</b> <b>bar</b> and spring. Through the comparison of the numerical analysis results of the improved model and existing models, {{it turns out that}} the defects or problems in {{the existing}} numerical models are resolved; tension appearance on the contact surface and junction surface and the abrupt change of bending moment in linings are solved in the improved model because the <b>compression</b> <b>bar</b> element and the coupling technology of node displacement in the junction surface is applied. Therefore, the improved numerical model could be applied to analyze double lining with waterproof on the junction surface and separation of the junction surface under an unfavorable load. In this paper, the parameter formulas of element stiffness, applicable to the junction surface and contact surface of double lining, are given definitely, and the influence of the element amount of junction surface on the analysis results is discussed. Based on the improved numerical model, the mechanical behavior of the double lining of the Huangpu River Tunnel in China is studied, and some conclusions are obtained as follows. (1) The thickness increase of the double lining will clearly increase its bending moment, but it has little influence on its axial force. (2) The allocation proportion of the bending moment between the segment lining and secondary lining has no linear relationship with the ratio of the lining thickness...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of column failures observed during recent earthquakes {{were attributed to}} poor column behaviour caused by lack of inelastic deformability. The deformability of reinforced concrete columns can be improved through the confinement of potential plastic hinge regions by properly designed transverse reinforcement. The conventional reinforcement used for confinement consists of closely spaced perimeter hoops, overlapping hoops, cross-ties and circular spirals. One possible alternative for column confinement is to use steel-belted tires. Scrap automotive tires may provide an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional transverse reinforcement in circular concrete columns, especially for bridge and parking structures. Steel-belted radial tires contain sufficiently high percentage of high-grade embedded steel that can be effective in confining column concrete. Tires can be assembled {{on top of each}} other, clamped by longitudinal reinforcement inserted through their sidewalls, and function as stay-in-place formwork. The same assembly can confine the compression concrete and provide shear resistance while also protecting the column against corrosion and chemical attacks. They also provide energy absorption under impact loads. The effectiveness of steel-belted tires as transverse column reinforcement was investigated experimentally by testing six full size circular concrete columns encased in either 550 mm or 700 mm diameter tires. Columns were tested under constant axial compression and incrementally increasing lateral deformation reversals. The results indicate that reinforced concrete columns, cast in steel-belted radial tires perform favorably well into the inelastic range of deformations, exhibiting drift capacities of 4 % to 8 %, providing superior concrete confinement. The results also indicate that the concrete between the longitudinal reinforcement and tires are able to restrain the <b>compression</b> <b>bars</b> against buckling. The results further indicate that column flexural capacity can be computed through conventional plane-section analysis when appropriate concrete models are incorporated, accounting for concrete confinement and the presence of rubber sidewalls between the layers of compression concrete. Moment-curvature relationships generated by such analysis can be used to construct the variation of curvatures along the column height. The curvature variation can be used to compute force-deformation relationships under monotonically increasing loads. These relationships are shown to provide very good agreement with experimentally recorded hysteretic relationships, further verifying the applicability of conventional techniques to tire-confined columns. The experimental results provided invaluable information on the contribution of steel-belted radial tries to shear resistance while also providing knowledge on shear capacity of concrete enchased in tires. It is shown that the General Design Method for shear, specified in CSA A 23. 3 - 2004, can be employed to compute column shear capacity with a limit of 0. 4 % on transverse steel strains in tire rubber. A design approach is developed for reinforced concrete columns transversely reinforced with steel-belted tires. Design for flexure and shear under earthquake loads are illustrated...|$|E
40|$|Connection {{design is}} one of the most {{important}} considerations for the successful construction of precast concrete structures. The configuration details of the connection affect the strength, stability, ductility as well as load redistribution of the structure under loading. Since the 19802 ̆ 7 s, extensive laboratory testing and research work has been conducted to study the seismic behaviour of beam-column connections in cast-in-place reinforced concrete building frames. However, only a limited number of studies have been conducted on the performance of precast concrete connections, and into a lesser extent on moment resistant precast concrete beam-column connections. This is in spite of the fact that precast concrete connections have been in use all over the world since the 19502 ̆ 7 s. Reliable connection behaviour can only be verified by testing, although the ACI Manual and the Australian Manual describe nearly 40 beam-column connections fulfilling many functions. Therefore, it is desirable to perform tests on more precast beam-column subassemblies. This study investigates the performance of two types of moment-resisting connections for joining precast beams and columns, which were recommended by the American Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI) and Australian Prestressed Concrete Group (APCG) for use in precast reinforced concrete building frames. A total of twelve half-scale model connections, divided into two groups according to the type of loading were designed, manufactured and tested to failure under static and repeated loadings. Each group had two monolithic models for the purpose of comparison and two models of each type of precast connections. The beam and column dimensions, the strength of precast concrete and configuration details were kept constant to afford a direct comparative study of connection behaviour. The only variable used in the study was the steel ratio of tension bar in the connecting beams. Each type of connection in each group had two steel ratios corresponding to the two cases, ρt-ρc= 2 / 3 ρall and ρt- ρc=ρall, respectively to study the effect of the amount of reinforcement in the subassemblies. Note that (ρt-ρc) is the steel ratio difference between the tension and <b>compression</b> <b>bars</b> and ρall is the tension steel ratio allowed by the Australian Standard. The objective of this study is to develop a moment-resisting precast concrete beamcolumn connection that is economical and can be easily constructed. The connections are evaluated based on their performance in terms of strength, deformation ductility, crack features, failure modes and energy dissipation characteristics as well as their constructibility. From the comparative study, it is found that both types of precast connections performed satisfactorily in that their bending strength capacity and energy absorbing capacity are, without exception, better than the monolithic ones. In addition, their ductility, in general, is superior to their monolithic counterparts. This indicates that both types of precast connections can be considered as moment-resisting ductile precast concrete beam-column connections and can be safely applied to precast reinforced concrete building frame construction. Finally, in light of the test results, the relative merits of the two types of precast connections are discussed and recommendations given...|$|E

40|$|Characterization of soft {{materials}} at dynamic rates is {{of critical importance}} due {{to the need for}} accurate data in constitutive models. Knowledge of dynamic behavior of {{soft materials}} can be applied to improve areas ranging from soldier protection in a blast setting, to common car crashes. Commercially available methods to characterize materials extend only to loading rates of about 150 s− 1, which covers only a portion of the possible rates of loading. Thus, empirical methods must be used to gather such data. Because empirical data is the only source of dynamic behavior characterization, validity of experimental methods must be closely monitored. Constraints of experimental methods must be closely observed when dealing with soft materials, the deformation of the specimen in particular. ^ Numerous researchers have acknowledged the presence of radial inertia in Kolsky bar experiments. Several have derived equations to analytically remove the inertia induced stress, and others have validated the removal of this stress from experimental results. Numerical studies have called into question the validity of testing exceedingly soft materials using the traditional <b>compression</b> Kolsky <b>bar</b> experiment, showing inhomogeneous sample deformation. Further studies on accurate portrayal of modulus suggest more problems when using the <b>compression</b> Kolsky <b>bar</b> for soft material characterization. ^ In this study, standard soft material characterization has been completed on four rubbers each with drastically different shear modulus using the Kolsky bar. Annular samples, and solid samples with extra radial inertia induced stress removed were used to investigate the apparent modulus behavior. Through a modified single pulse loading setup, high speed photography was used to capture the deformation during typical experiments; the deformation profile of each rubber was found. Rubbers having a shear modulus less than 200 KPa were found to experience inhomogeneous deformation, while rubbers having a shear modulus of ∼ 5000 KPa deformed homogeneously, which validates numerical studies. Despite removing extra stress, disparities between shear modulus obtained from commercially available methods at low rate and the <b>compression</b> Kolsky <b>bar</b> still exist. ...|$|R

The adaptive form-finding method is introduced along with the example of designing an ellipsoidal network dome with bar length variations being as small as possible.

Next, this network is transformed into the ellipsoidal shape as desired by applying <b>compressions</b> on <b>bars</b> according to the bar length variations caused by transformation. Afterwards, the dynamic relaxation method is employed to explicitly integrate the node positions by applying residual forces. During the form-finding process, the boundary condition of constraining nodes on the ellipsoid surface is innovatively considered as reactions on the normal direction of the surface at node positions, which are balanced with {{the components of the}} nodal forces in a reverse direction induced by <b>compressions</b> on <b>bars.</b> The node positions are also corrected according to the fixed-form condition in each explicit iteration step.

The result is a modified Kolsky bar capable of measuring axial deformation and axial stresses of a specimen at various strain rates under a range of confinement pressures. Borosilicate glass was subjected to triaxial confinement pressures of 25 MPa, 50 MPa, and 100 MPa at a strain rate around 1500 s- 1, and soda-lime glass was subjected to triaxial confinement pressures of 25 MPa, 50 MPa, and 75 MPa at a strain rate of around 1100 s- 1. These results were compared to unconfined experiments at similar strain rates, as well as unconfined experiments on a servo-hydraulic machine at a strain rate of 0. 001 s- 1.

However, strength did not vary much over the range of confinement pressures observed. ...|$|R

Two non-ductile columns with similar size, concrete and cross-sectional properties were tested under lateral cyclic loading. The first column (G 1) possesses longitudinal reinforcement ratio of 2. 76 % with 0. 25 x 0. 35 m in size and 1. 1 m in height. The minimum requirement for the amount of stirrup was used in these columns. For the second column (G 2), the column was wrapped by 3 -layer GFRP 500 mm from the base. When column G 1 was subjected to lateral cyclic loading, the column failed in shear at the lateral drift of 3. 5 %. For column G 2, the GFRP could increase column shear capacity and also confine the concrete in the plastic hinge region. Consequently, the column maximum displacement was dramatically increased up to 12 % drift and the column eventually failed in flexure mode associated with longitudinal reinforcement yielding, <b>compression</b> <b>bar</b> buckling and crushing of concrete inside the GFRP.

Non-linear static pushover analysis of the key parameters in change defined in Turkish Earthquake Code (TEC- 2007) for columns and beams was carried out and the capacity curves, failure loads and displacements were obtained.

In the classical Kolsky <b>compression</b> <b>bar,</b> pulse shaping has been developed in order to subject the specimen to desired dynamic loading conditions.

Developing an apparatus that can utilize the better-understood compression pulse shaping methods is then advantageous.

With a functional pulse-shaping technique in hand, the potential for this novel torsion Kolsky bar toward studying dynamic friction and shear of various materials is comparable to state-of-the-art compression and tension Kolsky bar techniques...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Textured Mg alloys exhibit tension – {{compression}} strength asymmetry due to mechanical twinning. The distinction arises as the material deforms primarily by slip {{in one direction}} and by twinning in the other. In-situ neutron diffraction during cyclic loading in tension and <b>compression</b> of extruded <b>bar</b> allows study of the effect of twinning on subsequent load reversals. The diffraction data reveal the texture evolution and internal stress development as a function of deformation. De-twinning resulted in complete texture reversal during initial cycles, but eventually “fatigued” resulting in some residual twin component...|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{technology has}} been developed to fabricate metal components that include complex prototype fabrication, small lot production, precision repair or feature addition, and tooling. However, the mechanical response of the AM materials is a concern to meet requirements for specific applications. Differences between AM materials as compared to wrought materials might be expected, due to possible differences in porosity (voids), grain size, and residual stress levels. When the AM materials are designed for impact applications, the dynamic mechanical properties in both compression and tension need to be fully characterized and understood for reliable designs. In this study, a 304 L stainless steel was manufactured with AM technology. For comparison purposes, both the AM and wrought 304 L stainless steels were dynamically characterized in <b>compression</b> Kolsky <b>bar</b> techniques. They dynamic compressive stress-strain curves were obtained and the strain rate effects were determined for both the AM and wrought 304 L stainless steels. A comprehensive comparison of dynamic compressive response between the AM and wrought 304 L stainless steels was performed. SAND 2015 - 0993 C...|$|R
40|$|Distortional {{buckling}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} buckling models of steel-concrete composite beam in negative moment region. Rotation restraining rigidity and lateral restraining rigidity which steel beam web to bottom plate of steel-concrete composite are the key factors to influence the distortional buckling behavior. A comprehensive and intensive study on rotation restraining rigidity and lateral restraining rigidity which steel beam web to bottom plate of I-shaped steel-concrete composite beam in negative moment region is conducted in this paper. Energy variation principle is adopted to deduce the analytical expressions to calculate the rotation restraining rigidity and lateral restraining rigidity. Combined with the buckling theory of axial <b>compression</b> thin-walled <b>bars</b> in elastic medium, the buckling moment is obtained. Theoretical analysis shows that the rotation restraining rigidity and lateral restraining rigidity of steel beam web appear to have a linear relationship with the external loads and could also be negative. Compared with other methods, the results calculated by the proposed expressions agree well with the numerical results by ANSYS. The proposed expressions are more concise and suitable than the existing formulas for the engineering application...|$|R
40|$|Specific {{mechanical}} properties of composites make them particularly attractive. Dynamic loads are of prime interest for their applications. Laminated structures’ impact modelling implies prior material dynamic characterisation. This study suggests {{an analysis of}} split Hopkinson <b>bar</b> <b>compression</b> testing on T 300 / 914 carbon/epoxy composite material. First, the effect of fibre orientation and stratification on compression dynamic behaviour is studied. Results show a high non-linearity for +/- 45 ° laminates testing. This non-linearity is not observed when the laminates are reinforced with 0 ° and 90 ° plies. Analytical modelling is {{in agreement with the}} experimental results. Secondly, experiments are performed on pre-cracked specimens to show the influence of cracking on dynamic behaviour...|$|R
