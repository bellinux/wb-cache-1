5|$|The game lets players {{control the}} mute {{criminal}} Claude. During the story, Claude meets various new characters from gangs. As players completes missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend players, while rival gang members will recognise players and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, players may {{engage in activities}} such as a vigilante minigame, a fire fighting activity, and a taxi cab service. Completion of these activities grants players with context-specific rewards; for example, completing the vigilante mission allows players to bribe police after <b>committing</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the old regime, which required the consent of the Attorney General for England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of <b>committing</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> If an individual is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E

25|$|Many criminals wear {{gloves to}} avoid leaving fingerprints. However, the gloves {{themselves}} can leave prints {{that are as}} unique as human fingerprints.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the Sicilian Mafia costs the Sicilian economy more than €10 billion a year through protection rackets. Roughly 70 percent of Sicilian businesses pay protection money to Cosa Nostra. Monthly payments can range from €200 for a small shop or bar to €5,000 for a supermarket. In Sicily, protection money is known as pizzo; the anti-extortion support group Addiopizzo derives its name from this. Mafiosi might sometimes ask for favours instead of money, such as assistance in <b>committing</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{attempt to}} <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> occurs if <b>a</b> {{criminal}} has <b>an</b> intent to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> and takes <b>a</b> substantial step toward completing the crime, but for reasons not intended by the criminal, the final resulting crime does not occur. Attempt to <b>commit</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>crime</b> is <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> usually {{considered to be}} of the same or lesser gravity as the particular crime that never ended up happening. Attempt is a type of inchoate <b>crime,</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> that is not fully developed. The crime of attempt has two elements, intent and some conduct toward completion of the crime.|$|R
25|$|When the Eastern State Penitentiary, or Cherry Hill as it {{was known}} at the time, was erected in 1829 in Francisville (the idea of this new prison was created in a meeting held at Benjamin Franklin's house in 1787) {{it was the largest}} and most {{expensive}} public structure in the country. Its architectural significance first arose in 1821, when British architect John Haviland was chosen to design the building. Haviland found most of his inspiration for his plan for the penitentiary from prisons and asylums built beginning in the 1780s in England and Ireland. He gave the prison a neo-Gothic look to instill fear into those who thought of <b>committing</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gloves {{protect and}} comfort hands against cold or heat, damage by friction, {{abrasion}} or chemicals, and disease; or {{in turn to}} provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch. Latex, nitrile rubber or vinyl disposable gloves are often worn by health care professionals as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying evidence in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting glove prints, law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence. In many jurisdictions the act of wearing gloves itself while <b>committing</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> can be prosecuted as an inchoate offense.|$|E

500|$|The story {{takes place}} in an authoritarian future dystopia, where omnipresent public sensors {{continuously}} scan the mental states of every passing citizen.

Authorities are alerted whenever excessive ratings are detected, and officers of the Public Safety Bureau are dispatched with weapons called [...] "Dominators", energy pistols that modulate their power {{in response to the}} target's Psycho Pass.

The Act has a near-universal jurisdiction, allowing for the prosecution of an individual or company with links to the United Kingdom, regardless of where the crime occurred. Described as [...] "the toughest anti-corruption legislation in the world", concerns have been raised that the Act's provisions criminalise behaviour that is acceptable in the global market, and puts British business at a competitive disadvantage.|$|E

500|$|Bribery {{of foreign}} public {{officials}} {{is a distinct}} crime under Section 6, {{in line with the}} OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. A person will be guilty of this offence if they promise, offer or give a financial or other advantage to a foreign public official, either directly or through a third party, where such an advantage is not legitimately due. A foreign public official is defined, under Section 6(4), as [...] " [...] an individual holding legislative, administrative or judicial posts or anyone carrying out a public function for a foreign country or the country's public agencies or an official or agent of a public international organisation". The inclusion of [...] "through a third party" [...] is intended to prevent the use of go-betweens to avoid <b>committing</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> although if the written law of the country of the foreign public official allows or requires the official to accept the advantage offered, no crime will be committed. Unlike with general bribery offences, there is no requirement to show that the public official acted improperly as a result; this is a distinction between the Act and the Anti-Bribery Convention. The offence under Section 6 only applies to the briber, and not to the official who receives or agrees to receive such a bribe.|$|E
