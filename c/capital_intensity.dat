5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow demographic transition in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower <b>capital</b> <b>intensity,</b> which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} a tariff on sectoral adjustments in an economy which produces two traded consumption goods, one of which is exported, and a non-traded investment good. The importance of sectoral <b>capital</b> <b>intensities</b> is emphasized. In particular, the qualitative dynamic adjustment depends upon the relative <b>capital</b> <b>intensities</b> of the import-competing consumption good sector and the non-traded investment good sector. Sectoral labor allocation effects are analyzed and the long-run effect on aggregate capital accumulation is shown to depend upon the relative <b>capital</b> <b>intensities</b> of the import and export sectors. Temporary as well as permanent tariffs are discussed. ...|$|R

25|$|Reswitching {{implies the}} {{possibility}} of capital reversing, an association between high interest rates (or rates of profit) and more capital-intensive techniques. Thus, reswitching implies the rejection of a simple (monotonic) non-increasing relationship between <b>capital</b> <b>intensity</b> and either the rate of profit, sometimes confusingly {{referred to as the}} rate of interest. As rates fall, for example, profit-seeking businesses can switch from using one set of techniques (A) to another (B) and then back to A. This problem arises for either a macroeconomic or a microeconomic production process and so goes beyond the aggregation problems discussed above.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the course}} of the 1990s, many leftist {{academics}} lost interest in Sraffian economics. Although he had written a few articles and edited the collected works of David Ricardo, Sraffa had authored only one book himself, a neo-Ricardian analysis about the distribution of value-added from production (Sraffa calls net value-added the [...] "surplus") which is divided or distributed among workers and capitalists. While Sraffa had provided an alternative to the problematic labor theory of value of the orthodox Marxists, while undermining the marginalist theory of capital, Sraffa's book provided no answers to many important contemporary macroeconomic issues. It was not designed for that purpose. For example, [...] "The Sraffa system, like many stationary-state general equilbrium models, contains no good which, uniquely, possesses all the important features of money." [...] Instead, many Marxists and leftists became more focused on the political economy of Michał Kalecki, who tried to combine Marxian and Keynesian economics in a more realistic way, without relying on any labor theory of value.

40|$|We use a two-sector neoclassical {{open economy}} model with traded and non-traded goods to {{investigate}} both the aggregate and the sectoral e®ects of temporary ¯scal shocks.

Performing working capital adjustments are necessary to ensure that returns derived from a set of comparables can be reliably applied to a tested party operating in a non arm’s length setting. There is no theoretical argument that suggests that working capital adjustments should be rejected.

These findings are supported on theoretical grounds which are violated when different working <b>capital</b> <b>intensities</b> between firms exist.
