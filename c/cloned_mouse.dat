40|$|The {{effect of}} {{treating}} cultured mouse fibroblasts (L 929 cells) with <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> interferon-gamma {{on the growth}} of Rickettsia prowazekii within the fibroblasts was studied. Within 48 h after infection, rickettsiae were cleared from a substantial proportion of the initially infected cells and rickettsial growth was inhibited in those cells that remained infected, when L 929 cells were treated with <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> interferon-gamma {{both before and after}} infection. When L 929 cells were treated with <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> interferon-gamma either only before or only after infection with rickettsiae, rickettsial growth was markedly inhibited but rickettsiae were not cleared from many cells. Addition of cycloheximide to L 929 cells markedly suppressed the antirickettsial activity of the interferon, and <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> interferon-gamma did not induce antirickettsial activity in human foreskin fibroblasts. The antirickettsial effects of <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> interferon-gamma were similar to those induced by crude mouse lymphokines prepared from concanavalin A-stimulated mouse spleen cells. Equivalent amounts (units) of <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> interferon-gamma produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells or by Escherichia coli caused equivalent inhibition of rickettsial growth in mouse fibroblasts. However, at high concentrations of interferon-gamma, treatment of rickettsia-infected fibroblasts with equivalent amounts (units) of interferon-gamma, as crude mouse lymphokines or <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> interferon-gamma, resulted in slightly greater inhibition of rickettsial growth by the crude lymphokines. Most of the antirickettsial activity of crude mouse lymphokines {{can be explained by the}} interferon-gamma that is present in these preparations. Interferon- gamma, by virtue of its ability to inhibit rickettsial growth and effect the clearance of rickettsia from nonprofessional phagocytes, may play a crucial role in the elimination of rickettsiae from the infected host...|$|E

40|$|Cloning {{allows the}} asexual {{reproduction}} of selected individuals {{such that the}} offspring have an essentially identical nuclear genome. Cloning by nuclear transfer thus far has been reported only with freshly isolated cells and cells from primary cultures. We previously reported a method of <b>cloning</b> <b>mice</b> from adult somatic cells after nuclear transfer by microinjection. Here, we apply this method to <b>clone</b> <b>mice</b> from widely available, established embryonic stem (ES) cell lines at late passage. With the ES cell line R 1, 29 % of reconstructed oocytes developed in vitro to the morula/blastocyst stage, and 8 % of these embryos developed to live-born pups when transferred to surrogate mothers. We thus <b>cloned</b> 26 <b>mice</b> from R 1 cells. Nuclei from the ES cell line E 14 also were shown to direct development to term. We present evidence that the nuclei of ES cells at G 1 - or G 2 /M-phases are efficiently able to support full development. Our findings demonstrate that late-passage ES cells {{can be used to}} produce viable <b>cloned</b> <b>mice</b> and provide a link between the technologies of ES cells and animal cloning.

40|$|Guinea pig basophils, <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> mast cells, and <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> granule-containing {{lymphoid cells}} {{were found to}} utilize a {{vesicular}} transport system to internalize eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) added in vitro. Kinetic analysis indicated that EPO internalization involved the binding of EPO to the plasma membrane, the formation of complex surface invaginations, {{and the movement of}} EPO-laden vesicles, tubules, and vacuoles {{toward the center of the}} cells. EPO became associated with multivesicular bodies in granule-containing lymphoid cells and mast cells, with immature granules in mast cells, and with mature granules in basophils. In other cells, the endogenous production of granule peroxidases (neutrophils and eosinophils) or the prior uptake of exogenous peroxidatic substances (some basophils) precluded cytochemical analysis of granules for EPO. Vesicular transport of EPO provides a possible explanation for the variable detection of peroxidase activity in mast cells or basophils. It also provides a mechanism for sequestration of this potentially toxic material or for its storage for possible future use...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the first}} <b>mouse</b> <b>clone</b> was {{produced}} by somatic cell nuclear transfer, the success rate of <b>cloning</b> in <b>mice</b> has been extremely low. Some histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as trichostatin A and scriptaid, have improved the full-term development of <b>mouse</b> <b>clones</b> significantly, but the mechanisms allowing for this are unclear. Here, we found that two other specific inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and oxam-flatin, could also reduce the rate of apoptosis in blastocysts, improve the full-term development of <b>cloned</b> <b>mice,</b> and increase establishment of nuclear transfer-generated embryonic stem cell lines significantly without leading to obvious abnormalities. However, another inhibitor, valproic acid, could not improve cloning efficiency. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, oxamflatin, trichostatin A, and scriptaid are inhibitors for classes I and IIa/b histone deacetylase, whereas valproic acid is an inhibitor for classes I and IIa, suggesting that inhibiting class IIb histone deacetylase {{is an important step}} for reprogramming <b>mouse</b> <b>cloning</b> efficiency. clone, developmental biology, early development, embryo, HDACi, nuclear transfer, ntES cell, reprogrammin...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cloning</b> {{methods in}} <b>mice</b> are now well {{described}} and are becoming routine.

This technique could be used in regenerative medicine and, in theory, in infertility clinics to treat completely infertile individuals. However, these results suggest that the reprogramming integrity of each cloned embryo differs: some cloned embryos can be converted to ntES cells, but these embryos cannot achieve full term development.

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{explore the}} {{relationships}} between transcription, messenger RNA (mRNA) processing, and nuclear structure, ribonucleoprotein particles containing heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNP) have been purified from globin-producing mouse Friend erythroleukemia cells. These nuclear hnRNP particles sediment at 50 S- 2005 and contain, in addition to high molecular weight hnRNA, {{a specific set of}} nuclear proteins predominated by a major component of 38, 000 mol wt. The hnRNP particles are free of histones and ribosomal structural proteins, indicating their purification from the two other major nucleoprotein components of the nucleus: chromatin and nucleolar ribosomal precursor RNP particles. The authenticity of the Friend cell hnRNP particles is demonstrated by the results of reconstruction experiments with deproteinized hnRNA, and by the resistance of the particles to dissociation during isopycnic banding in C 5 2 SO 4 gradients without prior aldehyde fixation. Hybridization analysis with <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> 8 -globin DNA demonstrates that hnRNP particles from induced Friend cells contain newly synthesized transcripts of the a-globin gene.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of crude mouse lymphokines and <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> interferon-gamma on the {{interaction}} of Rickettsia prowazekii with mouse macrophage-like RAW 264. 7 cells. Treatment of RAW 264. 7 cells with lymphokines before infection, after infection, or {{both before and after}} infection with R. prowazekii led to killing of a substantial proportion of the RAW 264. 7 cells. Such cytotoxicity required both lymphokines and viable R. prowazekii and did not occur in mouse fibroblastic L 929 cells. Untreated cultures of RAW 264. 7 cells supported good growth of the Breinl strain of R. prowazekii, but in lymphokine-treated cultures, little or no rickettsial growth occurred in the cells that survived the cytotoxic reaction. In addition, treatment of RAW 264. 7 cells with lymphokines before rickettsial infection was associated with suppression of the initial infection. The effects of <b>cloned</b> <b>mouse</b> interferon-gamma were similar to {{the effects of}} crude mouse lymphokines. Assessment of cytotoxicity, inhibition of the initial infection, and inhibition of rickettsial growth in RAW 264. 7 cells pretreated with various concentrations of interferon-gamma indicated that the effects of the lymphokines could be explained by the interferon-gamma that was present in these preparations.

The mouse NTR 3 is detectable by photoaffinity labeling and immunoblotting at the cell surface as a 100 kDa N-glycosylated protein.

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{successful}} cloning of mammals from adult so-matic cells, {{there has been no}} examination of the learning or behavior of cloned offspring. The possibility of adverse effects on animals produced through adult somatic cell cloning is high because many natural biological processes are bypassed and DNA from adult cells, which presumably contain mutations, are used. In this study, we compared <b>cloned</b> <b>mice</b> produced by mi-croinjection transfer of cumulus cell nuclei into enucleated oo-cytes, to control mice that were specifically generated to elim-inate confounding factors that are unique to our cloning pro-cedure. Postnatal weight gain of clones was significantly greater than that of controls. Preweaning development observations re-vealed that first appearance or performance of 3 out of 10 mea-sures was delayed in cloned mice; however, results of subse-quent tests of learning and memory, activity level, and motor skills were comparable for both groups.
