40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Treasury has taken a number of actions since 2008, in part in response to recommendations we made, to establish a structured system to manage potential <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> involving its contractors and financial agents. The system {{is based on a}} formal regulation Treasury issued in interim form in 2009 and final form in 2011, which prohibits organizational or personal <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> unless they have been waived or mitigated under a Treasury-approved plan. The regulation sets forth requirements to address actual and potential conflicts that may arise, establishes responsibilities for contractors and financial agents in preventing conflicts from occurring, and outlines Treasury's process for reviewing and addressing conflicts. Treasury has developed a multifaceted process to manage and oversee potential <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> which is managed by OFS's Office of the Chief Compliance Officer. The process includes reviewing proposed contracts and financial agency agreements, approving contractor and financial agent mitigation plans, addressing <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> inquiries, reviewing <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> certifications, and preparing feedback reports for contractors and financial agents. In addition, because the monitoring <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> was based to some degree on self-reported information submitted by contractors and financial agents, Treasury began conducting on-site design and compliance reviews in 2011 {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} its contractors' and financial agents' internal controls and procedures for <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Treasury has also established an internal database to document and track financial agent and contractor <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> certifications, inquiries, and requests for waivers. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Financial and nonfinancial <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in {{medicine}} and surgery are troubling {{because they have the}} capacity to skew decision making in ways that might be detrimental to patient care and well-being. The recent case of the Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) hip provides a vivid illustration of the harmful effects <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in surgery. Discussion. We identify financial and nonfinancial <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> experienced by surgeons, hospitals and regulators in the ASR case. These conflicts may have impacted surgical advice, decision-making and evidence gathering with respect to the ASR prosthesis, and contributed to the significant harms experienced by patients in whom the hip was implanted. Drawing on this case we explore shortcomings in the standard responses to <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> - disclosure and recusal. We argue disclosure is necessary but by no means sufficient to address <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Using the concept of recusal we develop remedies including second opinions and third party consent which may be effective in mitigating conflicts, but their implementation introduces new challenges. Summary. Deployment of the ASR hip is a case of surgical innovation gone wrong. As we show, there were multiple <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> involved in the introduction of the ASR hip into practice and subsequent attempts to gloss over the mounting body of evidence about its lack of safety and effectiveness. <b>Conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in surgery are often not well managed. We suggest strategies in this paper which can minimise the <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> associated with surgical innovation. 9 page(s...|$|R
