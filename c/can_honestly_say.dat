His {{appearance}} {{made him the}} first Pakistan international to play in Thailand. About his debut Rehman commented [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>say</b> I loved the experience.

500|$|Eleanor {{dismissed}} Bamie's criticisms {{by referring}} to her as an [...] "aged woman." [...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>say</b> that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E

The stakes were huge and the heroes faced the greatest of hazards. The use of the oil rig created a sense of isolation for Mulder and Doggett, and the paranoia levels were sky-high. We still can't figure out why we haven't seen more episodes along the lines of Vienen during the past three seasons." [...] Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B–". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave Vienen a positive review, and wrote, [...] "after watching 'Vienen', I <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>say</b> that for once of the few times this season, it felt good to be an X-Files fan again". Kessenich praised the significant development in Mulder and Scully's relationship and the return of the [...] "fourth season version" [...] of the black oil; the 1998 movie had dramatically altered the nature of the substanceinfected hosts gestate aliens inside their bodies rather than merely being taken over.|$|E
500|$|A {{journalist}} wrote, in {{the late}} 1890s, that Leno was [...] "probably the highest paid funny man in the world". In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Johnny Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in Fulham, which was demolished in 1971. Leno published an autobiography, Dan Leno: Hys Booke, in 1899, ghostwritten by T. C. Elder. Leno's biographer J. Hickory Wood commented: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>say</b> that I never saw him absolutely at rest. He was always doing something, and had {{something else to do}} afterwards; or he had just been somewhere, was going somewhere else, and had several other appointments to follow." [...] That year, Leno performed the role of [...] "waxi omo" [...] (a slang expression for a black-face performer) in the Doo-da-Day Minstrels, an act that included Danvers, Campbell, Bransby Williams, Joe Elvin and Eugene Stratton. [...] The troupe's only performance was at the London Pavilion on 29 May 1899 as part of a benefit. [...] Leno's song [...] "The Funny Little Nigger" [...] greatly amused the audience. His biographer Barry Anthony considered the performance to be [...] "more or less, the last gasp of black-face minstrelsy in Britain".|$|E
500|$|The album's Roman numeral title {{referred}} {{to each of}} the band members having turned 20 years old by the time xx was released. Because of their age, many critics interpreted the songs as nocturnal depictions of adolescent lust. Philip Sherburne wrote in Spin that xx brimmed with a [...] "young lust" [...] often found in rock music, and recordings such as [...] "Fantasy" [...] and [...] "Shelter" [...] expressed a jaded yearning, particularly in a lyric from the latter song: [...] "Can I make it better with the lights turned on". Croft vehemently denied this: [...] "We were writing these songs when we were 17. I <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>say</b> I've never thought this is about my sex life." [...] Croft and Sim, who were both gay, did not intend for the songs to be heard as romantic duets; she said they were singing [...] "past each other" [...] rather than to each other. Having combined their individually written lyrics, they could not definitely explain what their songs were about, although Croft said Sim's lyrics resonated with her nonetheless and enjoyed the personal interpretation it offered. [...] "You can put them into your own life", she explained, [...] "like, 'Oh, this is my song. The romantic situations Sim wrote of had been inspired by other people. [...] "I hadn't really had any relationships to be working off, but I had a huge interest in life, and looking at other people's relationships around me", he said.|$|E

500|$|On {{his return}} to the Netherlands, the {{harmonica}} band broke up and Geldray travelled alone to Brussels, where he found work playing with the dance orchestra at the club Le Boeuf sur le Toit, where he remained for a year. He then worked with a dance band in The Hague, before joining the house band at the Ostend Casino, the Johnny Fresno Band [...] He would meet a number of influential acts who were booked to play the casino on occasion, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, the English bandleader Ambrose and French bandleader Ray Ventura. Ventura soon offered Geldray a job and in 1937 Geldray moved to Paris. While in Paris, he went to the Hot Club de France and played with jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, a musician about whom Geldray asserts, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>say</b> that I have never heard anyone better". The two became close friends and played together often. With the invasion of France by German forces in early 1940, Geldray travelled to England, where he realised he would be safer. On 20 September 1940 he joined the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade, part of the Dutch army exiled in England. During the war he continued to play and appeared on BBC Radio; in 1942 {{he was part of the}} entertainment laid on for Princess Elizabeth's sixteenth birthday at Windsor Castle. During the course of 1942 Geldray also met Sarah Prentice, a 26-year-old Scottish variety artiste, whose professional name was Zaza Peters; the couple married on 18 January 1943.|$|E

Speaking in an interview, North {{admitted}} there's a [...] "disconnect" [...] in the Ubisoft game's current setup, which has voice actors provide voice facial animation separately from body motion capture, which is recorded by different actors. [...] "I wish it wasn't done separately," [...] North said. [...] "Don't get me wrong, the mo-cap actors {{do a great}} job, but {{there will always be}} somewhat of a disconnect when it's done this way.

However, the album failed to revive her career, receiving mixed reviews {{and failing to}} spawning a hit in the US, but sold considerably well. After enduring three years of [...] "carping" [...] from critics, Carey planned her return to music. On November 18, 2004, she revealed on her website that she would return to music and announced that the album would be called The Emancipation of Mimi, stating, [...] "For {{the first time in}} my life, I feel free and unashamed to be who I really am," [...] she wrote.

[...] The {{introduction}} is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping, which have been further described as [...] "warbly [...] lighthearted". Throughout the song, the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production. In the pre-chorus lines, Knowles sings: [...] "Maybe it's over, maybe we're through, but I <b>honestly</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> I still love you / Maybe we reached a mountain peak and there’s no more left to climb / and maybe we lost a magic piece and we're too blind to find" [...] while her vocals are followed by background sounds. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming into the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings: [...] "Let’s start over / Let's give love their wings / Let’s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing". As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up, she urges her man to [...] "give love another life". During the bridge, Knowles sings: [...] "I know I called you selfish / But that’s a lie", over a simple piano line.|$|R

[...] "I <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>say,</b> after Afghanistan, I'll never take anything in my life for granted again."

[...] Referring to the [...] "great economic storm" [...] currently under way in Ireland, he warned against excessive pessimism: [...] "Some gains have been lost, but in truth many remain.

Deftones {{give birth to a}} refined sound that makes creations like 'Prince' and '976-Evil' enslaving." [...] The Skinny's Mark Shukla likewise gave a 4-star rating, explaining, [...] "The first four tracks set a blistering pace as churning riffs transition relentlessly into fret-burning breakdowns; all the while Chino Moreno deploying his wounded croon and lacerating howl with an intensity that remains impressively undiminished." [...] Sputnikmusic staff writer Nick Greer gave an unequivocally positive review. He awarded a [...] "classic" [...] 5-out-of-5 score and stated that the album is [...] "better than White Pony". He described the album's sound as [...] "intense and visceral, but introspective and sensitive in ways Deftones have never been before", before finally adding, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>say</b> it's Deftones' best album to date." [...] Scott Gordon of The A.V. Club stated that while there are moments on the album where Deftones [...] "sound a bit like a band on auto-pilot", many of the other tracks [...] "stomp such limp moments with pleasingly crude riffs that claw and scrape through the verses, then release Chino Moreno's voice into glimmering, menacing choruses." ...|$|E

How can we live together while that man lives?--he being your husband in nature, and not I. If he were dead it might be different... Besides, that's not all the difficulty; it lies in another consideration--one bearing upon the future of other people than ourselves.

There is not an uttermost part of the earth but somebody comes from it or goes to it from elsewhere.

Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly went one step further, likening it to a variation of The Odd Couple that possessed [...] "neither romantic spark nor crisp verbal byplay". [...] The Los Angeles Daily News claimed {{it was the worst}} new show of the season, and that if you tuned in to the show at 8:30, you would [...] "probably be watching something else by 8:38". TeeVee's Peter Ko wrote a lengthy review (which itself got some publicity nine years later) in which he heavily bashed Curry, then he went on to state, [...] "I have stood in a freezer full of dead people at the morgue. I have seen a man's scalp pulled back over his nose. I've even seen 35 minutes of Ellen DeGeneres's Mr. Wrong. But I <b>can</b> now <b>honestly</b> <b>say</b> that until Steve Carell's turn in the premiere of Over the Top, I have never known true horror." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales, on the other hand, was substantially kinder than most critics, saying [...] "the show seemed merely okay at first encounter," [...] but after seeing the season's other new shows, [...] "Over the Top is looking better and better.

I feel like 'Hate It or Love It' was such an inspirational record that a lot of people didn't see coming. And this has the same feel as far as how it makes you feel, but it's gonna inspire the shit outta everybody. It's one of those records — his performance, his delivery, he's lyrically on a level that I can't even compare anyone to. He stepped it up to a notch that's amazing. He definitely has a new passion.
