It is possible to use both carbonitriding and carburizing together to form optimum conditions of deeper case depths and therefore performance of the part in industry. This method is applied particularly to steels with low case hardenability, such as {{the seat of the}} valve. The process applied is initially carburizing to the required case depth (up to 2.5 mm) at around 900-955°C, and then carbonitriding to achieve required <b>carbonitrided</b> case depth.

40|$|Summary. Currently in {{the repair}} and {{manufacture}} {{at the stage}} of recovery of steel parts, widely used special coatings formed by electrolytic effects on ferrous ions. This technique offers high performance, ease of implementation, low cost of technological equipment and materials used, as well as easy automation of the process. However, this method has several disadvantages: low fatigue strength of reconditioned parts, insufficiently strong grip of the iron coating to the substrate, particularly in alloy steels, insufficient wear resistance. For the purpose of increasing durability and wear resistance of parts, restored through electrochemical action, it is proposed to use chemical-heat treatment, consisting {{in the application of}} <b>carbonitriding.</b> Investigated the efficacy of different modes of <b>carbonitriding</b> in the highly carburizing paste-and their influence on the structure and properties of iron plating. It is established that the nitrocarburizing both low and high temperatures repeatedly (6 - 7. 5 times) increases the microhardness of the coatings. The highest hardness is obtained by low-temperature <b>carbonitriding</b> with direct quenching in water. Conducting the <b>carbonitriding</b> process at low temperatures (650 °C), significantly increases the hardness of the iron coatings, increasing the limit of its fluidity, a and also greatly increases its endurance limit. Nitrocarburized fatigue strength of samples with iron precipitation on the surface, as shown by our studies, not only higher strength of the same samples without <b>carbonitriding</b> (more than 2 times), but higher than the fatigue strength of the base metal without coatings. Raising the temperature of the <b>carbonitriding</b> did not increase the hardness of electrolytic iron. Developed a rational technology of hardening of steel parts, re-chain iron fortification.

The proposed procedure consists in performing the Vickers microindentation hardness test across the <b>carbonitrided</b> steel {{in order to obtain}} the thickness of the hardened layers.

40|$|Vanadium <b>carbonitrides</b> (VCxN 1 −x) were {{prepared}} via mechanosynthesis from mixtures of elemental vanadium and carbon with different V/C atomic ratios under a nitrogen atmosphere using a high-energy ball mill. We obtained the full composition range of <b>carbonitrides</b> at room temperature. The products were characterized using X-ray diffraction, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and electron energy loss spectroscopy. The results showed particle-sized products with high sinterability and very high microhardness. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that large and well faceted {{hexagonal}} crystallites can grow on Si and Ti substrates under higher nitrogen gas {{flow in the}} gaseous mixture of CH 4 and H 2 in the normal process of diamond deposition using microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MP-CVD). Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD), energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDX), wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDX) and Raman analysis revealed that these crystals are silicon <b>carbonitride</b> rather than <b>carbonitride</b> as we expected and usually regarded. This indicates that the hypothetical covalent <b>carbonitride</b> is not as easily formed as the crystallite with Si substitution. Comparing films deposited on Ti alloy substrates, with and without Si chips present during the deposition, {{we found that the}} Si chips activated by the plasma sputtering provides Si sources for crystallite SiCN formation on Ti substrate. The hexagonal SiCN structure and its lower hardness are attributed to the C 3 v-symmetric quasi-tetrahedral nitride with a nonbonding lone pair. The involvement of the less electronegative Si specimen may make the SiCN form easier than the covalent <b>carbonitride...</b>|$|R
40|$|Complete solid-solution cermets {{based on}} titanium-tantalum <b>carbonitride</b> using a {{starting}} nominal composition with 80 wt. % of (Ti 0. 8 Ta 0. 2) (C 0. 5 N 0. 5) and 20 wt. % of Co were performed by pressure-less sintering at 1550 C for different times (from 0 to 180 min) in an inert atmosphere. Chemical and phase {{analyses were conducted}} using X-ray diffraction (XRD), elemental analysis and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). The binder mean free path and the contiguity of the <b>carbonitride</b> particles were used to rationalise the microstructural effects of the mechanical behaviour. Mechanical characterisation included determining the Vickers hardness, the fracture toughness (conventional indentation microfractures, IM), the dynamic Young's modulus (ultrasonic technique), the biaxial strength (ball on three ball) and a detailed fractographic examination. Finally, the experimental findings were combined with a theoretical fracture mechanics analysis to estimate the critical processing flaw sizes. Binder-less <b>carbonitride</b> clusters, pores and coarse <b>carbonitride</b> grains were the main defects observed and {{were responsible for the}} fractures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
