5|$|By 2016, {{the freight}} rail service between {{a number of}} {{container}} terminals in China and their <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> Europe has become fairly regular. Between some city pairs, there is one train per week.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the 1st and 2nd centuries, the 3rd and 4th centuries saw {{much greater}} {{fortification}} activity, with many new forts built. Later Roman fortifications, both new and upgraded old ones, contained much stronger defensive features than their earlier <b>counterparts.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the late 3rd/4th centuries saw the fortification of many {{towns and cities}} including the City of Rome itself and its eastern sister, Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{descriptions}} {{were published}} by Henri Frankfort (1936), by Pauline Albenda (2005), {{and in a}} monograph by Dominique Collon, curator at the British Museum, where the plaque is now housed.

5|$|North of Standish, US23 {{is a part}} of the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT). This {{tour was}} created in May 1986 as part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour through a joint effort between MDOT and its <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett {{collaborated with}} the folklorist Dr Jacqueline Simpson on The Folklore of Discworld (2008), {{a study of the}} {{relationship}} between many of the persons, places and events described in the Discworld books and their <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> myths, legends, fairy tales and folk customs on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the Kangchu was not recognised by the British colonial government, even though they exercised a similar degree of autonomy as their <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> Johor. Nevertheless, the Kangchu in Singapore had easy access to forested land in Singapore compared to their <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> Johor, as the British colonial government adopted a laissez-faire attitude to the Kangchu and imposed very little regulation on their agricultural activities. However, the British were wary {{of the fact that}} many Kangchu in Singapore were members of the Ngee Heng Kongsi, which was illegal in Singapore and enjoyed monopoly rights over the regional opium trade. The British appointed a Chinese official among the Kangchu to oversee the social and economic affairs of the gambier and pepper plantations in Singapore and to act as the intermediary.|$|E

5|$|The hippocampus, {{strictly}} speaking, {{is found}} only in mammals. However, the area it derives from, the medial pallium, has <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> all vertebrates. There is evidence that {{this part of the}} brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes, birds, reptiles, and mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} been in place since 2007 when {{graduate}} endowments were abolished. Labour's education spokesperson Rhona Brankin criticised the Scottish system for failing to address student poverty. Scotland has fewer disadvantaged students than England, Wales or Northern Ireland and disadvantaged students receive around £560 a year less in financial support than their <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> England do.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of workers, {{fearing that}} the {{financial}} burden would be passed to them, protested the measures. The government, defending the measures as necessary in Hong Kong's changing economy, said that foreign domestic workers were still better paid than their <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> other Asian countries; according to James Tien, the monthly wage of Filipina maids in Singapore was about HK$1,400 and $1,130 in Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Able and Baker are {{the first}} two letters of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, used from 1941 until 1956. Alpha and Bravo are their <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> the current NATO phonetic alphabet. Charlie is the third letter in both systems. According to {{eyewitness}} accounts, the time of detonation for each test was announced as H or How hour; in the official JTF-1 history, the term M or Mike hour is used instead.|$|E
5|$|According to Stephen Shaw, most of Mysteries of the Siths {{content was}} {{inspired}} by Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy of books; one of the game's protagonists, Mara Jade, was drawn directly from the novels. Though the expansion includes characters from the previous game, new dialogue was recorded for Mysteries of the Siths scenario, including recurring background characters who speak similar lines to their <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> Dark Forces II. Some dialogue was authentically translated into Huttese, a fictional language used in Return of the Jedi {{and elsewhere in the}} Star Wars universe. The Star Wars original soundtrack by John Williams is used in Mysteries of the Sith.|$|E
5|$|According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's Revenge was {{the first}} Mega Man game to be {{outsourced}} to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's Revenge was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which follow its trend of reusing elements from their home console <b>counterparts.</b> <b>In</b> 2011, Dr. Wily's Revenge was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.|$|E

5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> equipment, training and fighting capability. The main difference was that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy and light, and other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E
5|$|Chemically, scandium, yttrium and {{lutetium}} (and presumably lawrencium) {{behave like}} trivalent {{versions of the}} group 1–2 metals. On the other hand, trends going down the group for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, {{are similar to those}} found among their group 4–8 <b>counterparts.</b> <b>In</b> this variant, the number of f electrons in the gaseous forms of the f-block atoms usually matches their position in the f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the first five f-block elements are La 0, Ce 1, Pr 3, Nd 4 and Pm 5.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{became the}} channel of {{communication}} between the NDRC and its <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> Britain and Canada. Through him, Laurence obtained an introduction to Lyman J. Briggs, {{the chairman of the}} NDRC's S-1 Uranium Committee, who supplied copies of American studies. On returning to England, Cockcroft arranged through Lord Melchett for Laurence to receive a $5,000 grant to continue his research. This payment was made by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) through a Canadian subsidiary. It had the desired side effect of impressing the Canadian authorities with the importance of Laurence's work.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} the Damascus government began an overwhelmingly anti-Iraqi Ba'athist propaganda campaign, {{to which their}} <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> Baghdad responded. However, the Iraqi Ba'athists helped Assad, who at the 4th Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch called for the reunification of the Ba'ath Party, {{in his attempt to}} seize power from Jadid. It was reported that Assad promised the Iraqis to recognize Aflaq's historical leadership. Iraq's foreign minister Abd al-Karim al-Shaykli even had his own personal office in the Syrian Ministry of Defence, which Assad headed. However, this should not be misconstrued, the Iraqi Regional Branch was Arab nationalist in name only, and was in fact Iraqi nationalist.|$|E
5|$|However, later {{experience}} with Soviet tactics, {{such as the}} Battle of Stalingrad where entire Russian units armed with submachine guns outgunned their German <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> short range urban combat, caused a shift in tactics, {{and by the end}} of the war the MP 40 and its derivatives were being issued to entire assault platoons on a limited basis. Starting in 1943, the German Army moved to replace both the Karabiner 98k rifle and MP 40 with the new, revolutionary StG 44. By the end of World War II (which ended in 1945), an estimated 1.1 million MP 40s had been produced of all variants.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the Michigan Department of Transportation {{consulted}} with its <b>counterparts</b> <b>in</b> Wisconsin (WisDOT), Minnesota (Mn/DOT) and Ontario (Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, MTO) about {{the formation of}} a circle tour around Lake Superior. The Lake Michigan Circle Tour was signed on maps by 1988. In May 2001, the section of US12 through Saline was designated a Michigan Historic Heritage Route. The segment through Clinton was given the same status in October 2002. On June 9, 2004, the full length of US12 was dedicated as the US12 Heritage Trail. In December 2014, this became a Pure Michigan Byway when Governor Rick Snyder signed legislation renaming the Michigan Heritage Route System to the Pure Michigan Byway System.|$|E
