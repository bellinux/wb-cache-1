40|$|AbstractRegional {{differences}} in IQ are estimated for 47 prefectures of Japan. IQ scores obtained from official achievement tests show a gradient {{from north to}} south. Latitudes correlate with height, IQ, and skin color at r= 0. 70, 0. 44, 0. 47, respectively. IQ also correlates with height (0. 52), skin color (0. 42), income (0. 51) after correction, less homicide rate (− 0. 60), and less divorce (− 0. 69) but not with fertility infant mortali'ty. The lower IQ in southern Japanese islands could be attributable to warmer climates with <b>less</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> for more than fifteen hundred years...|$|R
3000|$|The {{greater the}} learner’s {{vocabulary}} knowledge, the <b>less</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>demands</b> {{are placed on}} a learner. More developed levels of vocabulary knowledge enable learners to read with less effort (Segalowitz & Segalowitz, 1993; Segalowitz, Segalowitz & Wood, Segalowitz, Segalowitz & Wood, Segalowitz, Segalowitz & Wood, 1998) and result in better performance on comprehension tests (Chen, 2011; Miller & Peleg, 2010; Nassaji, 2003; Qian, 1999). The preponderance of the evidence indicates {{that in order for}} an L 2 to become a vehicle for learning, vocabulary knowledge must first be sufficiently developed. This in turn suggests that measures of vocabulary knowledge could predict written AEP proficiency and academic performance.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} an example of a method to get insight into workload changes over time, executed tasks and situation awareness (SA) in complex task environments. The method is applied to measure the workload of a helicopter crew. The method has three components: 1) task analysis, 2) video recordings of the tasks and 3) analysis of the video tapes by the crew members. A computer program was developed for the third part of the method. The crew members had to indicate the tasks that were executed during the mission and they had to indicate the workload during the mission at fixed time intervals. The results showed, among others, that the relation between number of tasks that were executed concurrently and the workload was low for the crew members of which the tasks were mainly cognitive demanding. Workload for these crew members were more related to the level of SA. The workload was high during periods of low SA. Workload for the crew member of which the tasks were <b>less</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>demanding</b> was more related to the number of tasks that were executed concurrently and less by the level of SA...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} it is {{investigated}} whether Intelligent leg prostheses {{are better than}} conventional leg prostheses. In the 1990 s the Intelligent prostheses were developed. Nowadays the intelligent prostheses conquer the prosthetic market. Intelligent Prostheses {{are said to be}} the future. But are they really? The main question is answered trough a few paragraphs. Advantages and disadvantages of intelligent prostheses (IP) in literature are examined. Disadvantages of the IP are almost not found in literature, while advantages are numerously found. From comparison studies between intelligent prostheses and conventional prostheses it appeared that intelligent prostheses have a lot of advantages. They can improve gait and balance, show less oxygen consumption, and you’re able to walk down/ up stairs and ramps. Also the users preferences go to the intelligent leg. Negative points to the intelligent leg prosthesis aren’t really there, or at least not in literature. However the intelligent prosthesis is not found to be <b>less</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>demanding</b> as said in comparison to mechanical prostheses. It is also presumably that the intelligent prosthesis are much more expensive than the mechanical ones. Altogether you can see {{there are a lot of}} advantages towards Intelligent leg prostheses compared to conventional prostheses. The conclusion of this thesis is that the Intelligent Prostheses are indeed better than conventional prostheses. And will probably be even better in the future. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Conventional {{techniques}} to measure health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) in a single value or index are complex, require abstract reasoning skills, and are prone to biases (e. g., adaptation). A possible alternative that requires <b>less</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> is Thurstone scaling. The present explorative study investigates the feasibility and concurrent validity of using Thurstone scaling to elicit health-state values in patients with dementia and their proxies. Methods: The participants {{in the present study}} were 145 pairs, consisting of community-dwelling persons with dementia and their proxies. We administered the prototype of the dementia quality-of-life instrument (DQI), a dementia-specific HRQoL index instrument, to both patients and proxies. The patient's health state as defined by the DQI was placed randomly among nine other DQI health states and these were ranked from best to worst. These rankings were used for Thurstone scaling. After ranking, the health states were placed on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: Thurstone scaling had a completion rate of 37 % for patients and 88 % for proxies. Thurstone scaling showed a high correspondence with VAS values. In addition, we identified a trend that shows that patients value most of the evaluated health states systematically lower than proxies. Conclusions: Thurstone scaling proved to be unfeasible for most patients, but feasible for proxies. Its concurrent validity was supported and new insights into patient-proxy discrepancies were discovered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

We use Dutch data on women’s wages and construct an indicator for <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> jobs. Our estimations indicate that the motherhood decision is strongly correlated with both employment and having a <b>less</b> <b>demanding</b> job.

The selectivity corrected estimation of women’s wage differentials indicate that {{a large part of}} the wage differential is composed by discrimination compared to estimations without correction for selectivity. ...|$|R

40|$|Biased {{cognition}} {{during high}} arousal {{states is a}} relevant phenomenon {{in a variety of}} topics: from the development of post-traumatic stress disorders or stress-triggered addictive behaviors to forensic considerations regarding crimes of passion. Recent evidence indicates that arousal modulates the engagement of a hippocampus-based “cognitive” system in favor of a striatum-based “habit” system in learning and memory, promoting a switch from flexible, contextualized to more rigid, reflexive responses. Existing findings appear inconsistent, therefore it is unclear whether and which type of context processing is disrupted by enhanced arousal. In this behavioral study, we investigated such arousal-triggered cognitive-state shifts in human subjects. We validated an arousal induction procedure (three experimental conditions: violent scene, erotic scene, neutral control scene) using pupillometry (Preliminary Experiment, n = 13) and randomly administered this method to healthy young adults to examine whether high arousal states affect performance in two core domains of contextual processing, the acquisition of spatial (spatial discrimination paradigm; Experiment 1, n = 66) and sequence information (learned irrelevance paradigm; Experiment 2, n = 84). In both paradigms, spatial location and sequences were encoded incidentally and both displacements when retrieving spatial position as well as the predictability of the target by a cue in sequence learning changed stepwise. Results showed that both implicit spatial and sequence learning were disrupted during high arousal states, regardless of valence. Compared to the control group, participants in the arousal conditions showed impaired discrimination of spatial positions and abolished learning of associative sequences. Furthermore, Bayesian analyses revealed evidence against the null models. In line with recent models of stress effects on cognition, both experiments provide evidence for decreased engagement of flexible, cognitive systems supporting encoding of context information in active cognition during acute arousal, promoting reduced sensitivity for contextual details. We argue that arousal fosters <b>cognitive</b> adaptation towards <b>less</b> <b>demanding,</b> more present-oriented information processing, which prioritizes a current behavioral response set at the cost of contextual cues. This transient state of behavioral perseverance might reduce reliance on context information in unpredictable environments and thus represent an adaptive response in certain situations...|$|R
