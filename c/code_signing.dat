25|$|Applications can be {{distributed}} to Macs and installed by the user from any source and by any method such as downloading (with or without <b>code</b> <b>signing,</b> available via an Apple developer account) or through the Mac App Store, a marketplace of software maintained by Apple {{by way of a}} process requiring the company's approval. Apps installed through the Mac App Store run within a sandbox, restricting their ability to exchange information with other applications or modify the core operating system and its features. This has been cited as an advantage, by allowing users to install apps with confidence that they should not be able to damage their system, but also as a disadvantage, by blocking the Mac App Store's use by professional applications that require elevated privileges. Applications without any code signature cannot be run by default except from a computer's administrator account.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Code</b> <b>signing</b> uses public-key {{infrastructure}} to check if a file has been modified since being digitally signed by its publisher. Alternatively, a system owner or administrator {{can use a}} cryptographic hash function to compute a [...] "fingerprint" [...] at installation time that can help to detect subsequent unauthorized changes to on-disk code libraries. However, unsophisticated schemes check only whether the code has been modified since installation time; subversion prior to that time is not detectable. The fingerprint must be re-established each time changes are made to the system: for example, after installing security updates or a service pack. The hash function creates a message digest, a relatively short code calculated from each bit in the file using an algorithm that creates large changes in the message digest with even smaller changes to the original file. By recalculating and comparing the message digest of the installed files at regular intervals against a trusted list of message digests, changes in the system can be detected and monitored—as long as the original baseline was created before the malware was added.|$|E

50|$|The growing Internet of Things (IoT) {{is giving}} <b>code</b> <b>signing</b> {{critical}} new importance. As {{more and more}} sensors and devices are connected to close network ecosystems, certificate issuance mechanisms have been extended beyond identifying people to identifying machines. Device credentialing enables control over the manufacturing process of high technology products and protects against unauthorized production of counterfeits. Together with <b>code</b> <b>signing,</b> the technology ensures physical authenticity and the authenticity and integrity of the code they possess {{at the time of}} manufacture {{through the use of a}} digital birth certificate, or during subsequent upgrades through code validation any time during the product lifecycle. This is creating a new dimension for <b>code</b> <b>signing,</b> and elevating the security awareness and need to maintain private signing keys secured within a dedicated protected environment to establish a root of trust for the entire system. Given the prevalence of malware and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), many software vendors, providers of online services, enterprise IT organizations and manufacturers of high-technology IoT devices are under pressure to increase the security of their high technology manufacturing and <b>code</b> <b>signing</b> process.|$|E
