The fluorescence decay was apparently caused by {{a decrease in the}} fluorescence quantum yield of QD embedded in the shells of the capsules. This effect is likely to have resulted from the change in the distribution of the electron potential and the geometric rearrangement of QDs in the inner layers of the polymer shell after the <b>core</b> <b>removal</b> that increased the probability of nonradiative recombination due to the charge transfer to between neighboring QDs or between QDs and polymer molecules [22].|$|E

(2) Single nozzle co-electrospinning: this process involves two immiscible polymers dissolved in solvent that results in phase separation during electrospinning owing to the intrinsic polymer properties, yielding core-shell composite fibers or hollow fibers after suitable <b>core</b> <b>removal</b> [19, 20].

PTX was encapsulated into the nanopores of preformed CaCO 3 MP prepared by the co-precipitation method. Infrared (IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) provides evidences that PTX has been encapsulated into nanopores of CaCO 3 MP and not crystallized on the surface. PTX loaded CaCO 3 MP (CaCO 3 -PTX) {{was found to be}} highly stabilized against thermal decomposition as evinced by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicating decomposition at 600 0;C and 250 0;C for CaCO 3 -PTX and PTX respectively. The multilayer assembly over CaCO 3 -PTX was effectuated by alternate deposition of protamine sulfate (PRM) and sodium alginate (SA) using LBL technique followed by subsequent <b>core</b> <b>removal</b> [PTX- (PRM/SA) 5]. The pay load efficiency of PTX in this system was found to be 78. 98 1; 2. 14 %. The developed system was further evaluated for surface morphology, size and size distribution, surface charge, <b>core</b> <b>removal</b> and layer-by-layer growth due to sequential adsorption of PE&#x 2019;s. The release data of PTX-(PRM/SA) 5 was comparable with marketed {{formulation of}} PTX (PTX-M) and CaCO 3 -PTX when performed in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF pH= 7. 4). The release profile of PTX-(PRM/SA) 5 indicates that PEs based multilayer matrix is capable to provide barrier to PTX release as it has been found to follow first order matrix diffusion kinetics with 64 1; 4. 8 % release within 24 hrs. The t 50 % of PTX-M, CaCO 3 -PTX and PTX-(PRM/SA) 5 was found to be 70, 90 and 480 minutes respectively. This alternative delivery system of PTX disguised in the form of LBL assembly could have immense application for the treatment of metastasized mammary glands vis- 0;-vis existing formulation of PTX which is by and large criticized for having certain toxic excipients to be given parentrally. Moreover, the proposed system provides ample of opportunity to modify the surface for targeted application of PTX. |$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, organic aerogels {{are used as}} a new binding {{material}} for mould and core production in foundry application. The work is motivated by the problems occurring during the mould and <b>core</b> <b>removal</b> in aluminium casting. In contrary to steel and iron casting the low casting temperatures lead to low temperatures in the mold and core material and therefore the bonding efficiency remains on a high level. Therefore a complete <b>core</b> <b>removal</b> is only possible by an increased mechanical effort. Thin wall parts of the casting are as much problematic as backdrafts and cavities. With AeroSands, the combination of aerogels and sands, a novel molding material for core and mold production are presented. In the present dissertation preparation methods of organic aerogels and AeroSands are presented. AeroSands are prepared by mixing conventionally foundry sands {{with a certain amount}} of aerogel sol, consisting of resorcinol, formaldehyde, sodium carbonate and water. After gelling and drying, AeroSands prepared in that way are characterized as a mold and core material. The sand types are varied (corundum, silicon carbide, quartz, mullit-hollow spheres), their grain sizes and the amount of aerogel solution in the range of 4 - 24 %. The AeroSands are characterized according to their mechanical properties,bending strength, compression strength, elastic modulus, permeability and core strength, and according to their thermophysical properties, thermal conductivity and specific heat. AeroSands made by organic aerogels have two characteristics which are quite interesting for foundry applications. The polymeric aerogel decomposes totally at temperatures above 350 °C, i. e. far below the solidus temperature of common aluminium foundry alloys. The thermal decomposition was analysed at different temperatures. The second characteristic makes the polymeric aerogels even interesting for thin walled steel castings: The thermal conductivity depends on the sand type, its grain size and the amount of aerogel. Optimizing these three parameters the effective thermal conductivity can adjusted such that thin walled steel casting can be realized. The basic research and development of this new binding material is completed by casting experiments with a conventional aluminium alloy. They showed that this new binding material leads to castings with a high surface quality and that cores can be removed without any mechanical effort by only thermal disintegration...|$|E

40|$|A cold-sensitive {{mutation}} in the structural gene for a minor phage T 4 capsid protein (p 20) leads to formation of heads containing p 20 and cleaved head proteins and empty of DNA.

It appears that p 20 has two distinct roles in head assembly: first, in construction of the prehead shell (blocked by ts and am mutation) and, second,in DNA packaging (blocked by cs mutation). The latter function is closely associated with gene 17 product, previously known to be required for DNA packagaing. Temperature shift studies of cs-ts double mutants and other observations allow determination of phage function required for DNA packaging. Contrary to previous proposals, we find that T 4 DNA packaging is not directly coupled to and can follow DNA synthesis, protein cleavage, prehead <b>core</b> <b>removal,</b> and gene 21 -mediated cleavage-induced increase in head volume.
