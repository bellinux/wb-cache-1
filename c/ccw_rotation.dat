The complete molecular mechanism of the switching process, however, remains to be explained.

30|$|As for item (d), omega bands have a {{systematic}} and relatively stable ionospheric equivalent current system, {{which is caused}} by the large-scale wavy structure along the east-west direction. The ionospheric current shows a <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> around the torch, corresponding to the upward FAC and negative potential, and a CW rotation around the dark region (i.e., inside the inverted capital Greek letter omega (Ω)), corresponding to the downward FAC and positive potential (Opgenoorth et al. 1983; Buchert et al. 1988; Wild et al. 2000; Amm et al. 2005; Vanhamäki et al. 2009). On the other hand, the ionospheric equivalent current of the EEASs indicates a quite dynamic behavior. It showed a <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> around the auroral vortex structure at 00 : 16 : 20 UT for the second event (Fig.  5 b), which corresponds to the structure of the inverted letter Ω of the omega bands; namely, the direction of the rotation is opposite to that of the omega bands. It is expected from the <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> that the upward FAC and negative potential existed inside the auroral vortex, although they depend on the distribution of the ionospheric conductivity. However, for the case of the third event at 00 : 33 : 10 UT (Fig.  5 c), the <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> in the ionospheric current can be seen {{at the front of the}} surge. The difference in the ionospheric equivalent current of the EEAS from the omega bands (and from case to case) may be attributed to a large temporal variation in the surge structure, in contrast to the stable, well-defined wavy structure of omega bands; such a large temporal variation in the surge yields a variation in spatial distribution of the FACs and non-uniform ionospheric conductivity, which causes a deformation of the ionospheric current pattern.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the paleomagnetic {{rotation}} pattern inside the deforming zone of strike-slip faults, and the kinematics and geodynamics describing it. The paleomagnetic investigation carried out along both the LOFZ and the fore-arc sliver (38 º- 42 ºS, southern Chile) revealed an asymmetric rotation pattern. East of the LOFZ and adjacent to it, rotations are up to 170 ° clockwise (CW) and fade out 10 km east of fault. West of the LOFZ at 42 ºS (Chiloé Island) and around 39 °S (Villarrica domain) systematic <b>CCW</b> <b>rotations</b> have been observed, while at 40 °- 41 °S (Ranco-Osorno domain) and adjacent to the LOFZ CW rotations reach up to 136 ° before evolving to <b>CCW</b> <b>rotations</b> at 30 km from the fault. These data suggest a directed relation with subduction interface plate coupling. Zones of high coupling yield to a wide deforming zone (30 km) west of the LOFZ characterized by CW rotations. Low coupling implies a weak LOFZ and a fore-arc dominated by <b>CCW</b> <b>rotations</b> related to NW-sinistral fault kinematics. The rotation pattern is consistent with a quasi-continuous crust kinematics. However, it seems unlikely that the lower crust flux can control block rotation in the upper crust, considering the cold and thick fore-arc crust. I suggest that rotations are consequence of forces applied directly on both the block edges and along the main fault, within the upper crust. Farther south, at the Austral Andes (54 °S) I measured the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) of 22 Upper Cretaceous to Upper Eocene sites from the Magallanes fold-thrust belt internal domains. The data document continuous compression from the Early Cretaceous until the Late Oligocene. AMS data also show that the tectonic inversion of Jurassic extensional faults during the Late Cretaceous compressive phase may have controlled the Cenozoic kinematic evolution of the Magallanes fold-thrust belt, yielding slip partitioning. ...|$|R
40|$|The Gran Sasso {{range is}} a {{striking}} salient formed by two roughly rectilinear E–W and N–S limbs. In the past ∼ 90 ° counterclockwise (<b>CCW)</b> <b>rotations</b> from the eastern Gran Sasso were reported [Tectonophysics 215 (1992) 335], suggesting west–east increase of rotation-related northward shortening along the E–W limb. In this paper, we report on paleomagnetic data from Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary dykes and strata cropping out at Corno Grande (central part of the E–W Gran Sasso limb), the highest summit of the Apennine belt. Predominant northwestward paleomagnetic declinations (in the normal polarity state) from both sedimentary dykes and strata are observed. When compared to the expected declination values for the Adriatic foreland, our data document no thrusting-related rotation at Corno Grande. The overall paleomagnetic data set coupled with the available geological information shows that the Gran Sasso arc {{is in fact a}} composite structure, formed by an unrotated-low shortening western (E–W trending) limb and a strongly CCW rotated eastern salient. Late Messinian and post-early Pliocene shortening episodes documented along the Gran Sasso front indicate that belt building and arc formation occurred during two distinct episodes. We suggest that the southern part of a late Messinian N–S front was reactivated during early–middle Pliocene time, forming a tight range salient due to <b>CCW</b> <b>rotations</b> and differential along-front shortening rates. The formation of a northward displacing bulge in an overall NW–SE chain is likely a consequence of the collision between the Latium-Abruzzi and Apulian carbonate platforms during northeastward propagation of the Apennine wedge, inducing lateral northward extrusion of Latium-Abruzzi carbonates towards ductile basinal sediment areas...|$|R

40|$|The central-western and {{the eastern}} Southern Alps are {{separated}} by the triangular shaped Adige embayment, which belongs to stable Adria and {{was the site of}} pelagic sedimentation from the Tithonian through Maastrichtian. The first part of this study presents paleomagnetic results from the Tithonian– Cenomanian Biancone and Turonian–Maastrichtian Scaglia Rossa formations sampled at 33 geographically distributed and biostratigraphically dated localities. The new and high quality paleomagnetic results from the Adige embayment are then combined with coeval paleomagnetic directions from autochthonous Istria (Márton et al., 2008), which also belongs to stable Adria. The combined data set (which for the Late Albian–Maastrichtian time period is constructed similarly to the synthetic African curve by Besse and Courtillot, 2002, 2003) reveals an important tectonic event (Late Aptian–Early Albian) characterized by 20 ° <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> and sedimentary hiatus. Comparison between paleomagnetic declinations/inclinations expected in an African framework (i. e. with the assumption that Adria is still an African promontory) leads to the following conclusions. The timedistributed Tithonian and Berriasian (150 – 135 Ma) paleomagnetic directions exhibit the “African hairpin” with an inclination minimum and a sudden change from CW to <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> at 145 Ma. Concerning the younger ages, the declinations for Adria continue to follow the African trend of <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> till the end of Cretaceous. However, the Tithonian–Maastrichtian declination curve for stable Adria is displaced by 10 ° from the “African” curve as a result of two rotations. The first, an about 20 ° CW rotation of Adria with respect to Africa took place between the Maastrichtian and the mid-Eocene.

40|$|Cells of Escherichia coli {{are able}} to swim up {{gradients}} of chemical attractants by modulating the direction of rotation of their flagellar motors, which spin alternately clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (<b>CCW).</b> <b>Rotation</b> in either direction has been thought to be symmetric and exhibit the same torques and speeds. The relationship between torque and speed {{is one of the}} most important measurable characteristics of the motor, used to distinguish specific mechanisms of motor rotation. Previous measurements of the torque–speed relationship have been made with cells lacking the response regulator CheY that spin their motors exclusively CCW. In this case, the torque declines slightly up to an intermediate speed called the “knee speed” after which it falls rapidly to zero. This result is consistent with a “power-stroke” mechanism for torque generation. Here, we measure the torque–speed relationship for cells that express large amounts of CheY and only spin their motors CW. We find that the torque decreases linearly with speed, a result remarkably different from that for <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation.</b> We obtain similar results for wild-type cells by reexamining data collected in previous work. We speculate that <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> might be optimized for runs, with higher speeds increasing the ability of cells to sense spatial gradients, whereas CW rotation might be optimized for tumbles, where the object is to change cell trajectories. But why a linear torque–speed relationship might be optimum for the latter purpose we do not know...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} visuomotor adaptation {{using an}} isometric, target-acquisition task. Following trials with no rotation, two participant groups {{were exposed to}} a random sequence of 30 degrees clockwise (CW) and 60 degrees counter-clockwise (<b>CCW)</b> <b>rotations,</b> with (DUAL-CUE), or without (DUAL-NO CUE), colour cues that enabled each environment (non-rotated, 30 degrees CW and 60 degrees CCW) to be identified. A further three groups experienced only 30 degrees CW trials or only 60 degrees <b>CCW</b> trials (SINGLE <b>rotation</b> groups) in which each visuomotor mapping was again associated with a colour cue. During training, all SINGLE groups reduced angular deviations of the cursor path during the initial portion of the movements, indicating feedforward adaptation. Consistent with {{the view that the}} adaptation occurred automatically via recalibration of the visuomotor mapping (Krakauer et al. 1999), post-training aftereffects were observed, despite colour cues that indicated that no rotation was present. For the DUAL-CUE group, angular deviations decreased with training in the 60 degrees trials, but were unchanged in the 30 degrees trials, while for the DUAL-NO CUE group angular deviations decreased for the 60 degrees CW trials but increased for the 30 degrees CW trials. These results suggest that in a dual adaptation paradigm a colour cue can permit delineation of the two environments, with a subsequent change in behaviour resulting in improved performance in {{at least one of these}} environments. Increased reaction times within the training block, together with the absence of aftereffects in the post-training period for the DUAL-CUE group suggest an explicit cue-dependent strategy was used in an attempt to compensate for the rotations. ...|$|R
40|$|Healthy human subjects, when roll tilted in darkness, make {{systematic}} {{errors in}} estimating subjective visual vertical (SVV). Typically, roll tilt underestimation occurs at angles beyond 60 degrees (A-effect). At smaller tilt angles, overestimation may occur (E-effect). At approximately 135 degrees whole-body roll tilt, Kaptein and Van Gisbergen (2004, 2005) found an abrupt A/E transition, {{the exact location}} of which depended on the preceding rotation direction indicating hysteresis. Since this was observed using relatively fast roll velocity, it remains unclear whether the described hysteresis is dynamic or static. To clarify this uncertainty, we continuously rotated nine healthy subjects about the earth-horizontal naso-occipital axis, while they performed SVV adjustments every 2 s. Starting from the upright position, three full quasi-static constant velocity rotations (2 degrees/s) were completed in both directions (CW: clockwise; CCW: counterclockwise). SVV deviation from earth-verticality was plotted as a function of whole-body roll position. A bimodal Gaussian distribution function was fitted to SVV differences between CW and <b>CCW</b> <b>rotations.</b> A-effects (peaks at 88 degrees and 257 degrees chair position) at identical whole-body positions were larger after rotations from upside-down than after rotations from upright (average peak difference: 26 degrees).

40|$|The Dukla Nappe {{belongs to}} the Outer Western Carpathians, which {{suffered}} considerable shortening due to the convergence and collision of the European and African plates. In this paper we present new paleomagnetic and magnetic anisotropy results from the Polish part of the Dukla Nappe, based on 102 individually oriented cores from nine geographically distributed localities. Susceptibility measurements and mineralogy investigations showed that paramagnetic minerals are important contributors of the susceptibility anisotropy (AMS). The AMS fabrics are related to deposition/compression (foliation) and weak tectonic deformation (lineation). The AARM fabric, that of the ferrimagnetic minerals, seems to be less sensitive indicator of tectonic deformation than the AMS fabric. The inclination-only test points to the pre-folding age of the remanent magnetizations. Seven localities exhibit <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation,</b> a single one shows CW rotation. The CCW rotated paleomagnetic directions form two groups, one showing large, the other moderate <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation.</b> Previously published paleomagentic directions from the Slovakian {{part of the same}} nappe exhibit smeared distribution between them. The declination of the overall-mean paleomagnetic direction for the Duklanappe is similar to those observed in the neighbouring Magura and Silesian nappes, but it is of poorer quality. The AMS lineations at several localities are deviating more to the west from the present north than that of the local tectonic strikes. A possible explanation for this is that the AMS lineations were imprinted first, probably still in the Oligocene, while the sediments were soft (ductile deformation) and the folding and tilting took place during the <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{southern}} Apennine belt {{is formed}} by nappes that have undergone large (i. e. hundreds of kms) horizontal displacements. In such tectonic scenario, orogenic rotations of nappes are clearly expected, and paleomagnetism {{may represent a}} key tool to constrain displacements and understand the pre-orogenic paleogeography. Recent paleomagnetic data {{have shown that the}} Apenninic carbonate platform, on top of the nappe pile, has rotated ~ 80 ° counterclockwise (CCW) after Langhian times. A similar rotation may be inferred for the Lagonegro basinal unit. Numerous data from the Plio-Pleistocene sediments unconformably overlying these two units reveal a 0 °- 40 ° (20 ° on average) <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> since early Pliocene. Data from the exposed Apulian swell, and {{from other parts of the}} Adriatic plate, suggest that the buried Apulian platform has not undergone a significant rotation. Therefore the overall paleomagnetic/ geological data suggest that during mid-late Miocene the Apenninic platform and Lagonegro unit were detached from basement, underwent internal imbrication associated with a 60 ° <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation.</b> During early-mid Pliocene, this wedge was carried over the Apulian carbonates (which were in turn internally stacked in late Plioceneearly Pleistocene times), and underwent a final 20 ° <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation.</b> The paleomagnetic data also prove that the southeastward drift of Calabrian block (and synchronous spreading of the southern Tyrrhenian Sea) induced oroclinal deformation of the southern Apennines and Sicily, which underwent similar-magnitude (but opposite in sign) orogenic rotations. Relying on such rotational pattern, we propose a paleogeographic reconstruction for late Langhian (and older) times characterized by the presence of a NNE-oriented narrow carbonate platform corridor separating the Ionian and Liguro- Piedmont oceans...|$|E
40|$|The Southern Apennines, Calabro-Peloritane block, and Sicilian Maghrebides form a ~ 700 km long orogenic bend, {{known as}} Calabrian Arc (Cifelli et al., 2007).

Despite the wealth of paleomagnetic data from the Southern Apennines, the main Miocene rotational phase still remains poorly constrained in time and, more importantly, data from the most internal paleogeographic domains of the belt are completely lacking. The Gorgoglione Formation, a middle Miocene piggy-back deposit of the Southern Apennines, unconformably resting over the internal Sicilide Unit, offers the unique opportunity to document the deformation pattern of the most internal units, and reconstruct the incipient tectonic phases leading {{to the formation of}} the Calabrian Arc.

In decerebrate cats, the multiunit EMG activity of the medial head of the forelimb extensor triceps brachii was recorded during wobble of the whole animal at 0. 15 Hz. With this procedure the animals were submitted to a tilt characterized by a fixed amplitude (10 °) and by a direction moving at constant velocity over the horizontal plane, in both a clockwise (CW) and a counterclockwise (CCW) direction. These dynamic stimuli permitted characterization of the triceps muscle response to animal tilt as a single vector in the horizontal plane. The gain of this vector was taken as the mean value obtained for the CW and CCW responses, while its orientation corresponded to the direction of head displacement, lying midway between the maximal response directions to CW and <b>CCW</b> <b>rotations.</b> The temporal phase was evaluated as the half difference between the directions of the CW and CCW responses.

40|$|International audienceThe {{island of}} Rhodos {{represents}} an uplifted {{block in the}} largely submerged southeastern Aegean forearc. It has a complex history of subsidence, uplift and counterclockwise rotation during the Plio- Pleistocene, {{in response to the}} interplay between large-scale geodynamic processes. In this paper, we present a new chronostratigraphic framework for the continental Pliocene Apolakkia basin of southwestern Rhodos. We combine these time constraints with recently published chronostratigraphic data from the marine Plio- Pleistocene basins of northeastern Rhodos to reconstruct rotational and vertical motions. Our palaeomagnetic results identify two rotation phases for Rhodos: c. 10 °(9 ± 6 °) counterclockwise (<b>ccw)</b> <b>rotation</b> between 3. 8 and 3. 6 Ma, and c. 17 ± 6 ° <b>ccw</b> <b>rotation</b> since 0. 8 Ma. Between these phases, Rhodos tilted to the SE, drowning the southeastern coast to a depth of 500 – 600 m between 2. 5 and 1. 8 Ma, then to the NW, which resulted in the re-emergence of the drowned relief between 1. 5 and 1. 1 Ma. We relate the rotations of Rhodos to incipient formation of the south Aegean sinistral strike-slip system and the foundering of the Rhodos basin. The previously shown absence of Messinian evaporites in the deep-marine Rhodos basin in combination with the 3. 8 Ma onset of <b>ccw</b> <b>rotation</b> of Rhodos constrains the onset of the formation of the south Aegean strikeslip system between 5. 3 and 3. 8 Ma. The formation of this strike-slip system is probably related to the interplay of oblique collision between the southeastern Aegean region and the northward moving African plate, the westward motion of Anatolia, gravitational spreading of the overthickened Aegean lithosphere and the recently postulated southwestward retreat of the African subducted slab along a subduction-transform edge-propagator fault...|$|E

Combined with paleomagnetic directions of corresponding age from stable Istria, these allow definition of the APW for stable Adria for the 61. 6 – 33. 9 Ma interval, which is significantly displaced from the coeval segment of the African APW due to the decoupling of the former to the latter by a moderate <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation.</b> This post-Eocene final separation (exact age is not constrained directly, but estimated as end-of-Miocene) was preceded by a small CW rotation of Adria with respect to Africa, suggested by unchanged orientation of the former across the Cretaceous– Paleocene boundary, while the latter continued its <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{theoretically}} {{expected that}} {{active galactic nucleus}} (AGN) jets should carry helical magnetic (B) fields, which arise due to {{the rotation of the}} central black hole and accretion disk combined with the jet outflow. The direction of the toroidal component of the helical B field B φ is determined by the direction of the poloidal component B p of the initial seed field that is “wound up” and the direction of rotation of the central black hole and accretion disk. The presence of the jet’s helical B field can be manifest both through the presence of Faraday rotation gradients across the jet, and the presence of appreciable circular polarization, which comes about when linearly polarized emission from {{the far side of the}} jet is partially converted to circularly polarized emission as it passes through the magnetized plasma at the front side of the jet on its way towards the observer. When both of these properties are manifest, they can be used jointly with the jet linear polarization structure to uniquely determine both the direction of B p and the direction of the central rotation. This technique has been applied to 12 AGNs. The results indicate statistically equal numbers of outward and inward B p and of clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (<b>CCW)</b> <b>rotations</b> of the central black holes on the sky. However, they suggest that the directions of B p and of the central rotation are coupled: CW/CCW central rotation is preferentially associated with inward/outward poloidal B field.

In addition, the hills are sinoid to cone-shaped. Surface drainage is negligible compared to subsurface water flow. Abandoned channel segments and spatial arrangements of karst hills {{have been found to}} correspond with fracture patterns that are genetically associated with the regional compression direction of Jawa Island. Images derived from space platforms show many landform patterns that were neither known from ground-based nor from aerial photograph study. Landforms arranged in ring, multi-ring, spiral, polygonal, and long linear to serpentine patterns are common beside the expected depressions of dolines, poljes, and uvalas. The orientations of the long linear ridges appear to change systematically from those near the coast to those located inland. These linear ridges are interpreted as depositional fronts, most likely representing breaker zones. The youngest depositional ridge fronts, located nearest to the present shoreline, are parallel to the geological strike of Jawa Island. Toward the island’s interior, linear depositional fronts deviate in orientation by as much as 40 o. This is now interpreted to have resulted from counterclockwise rotation of the Gunungsewu microplate since the late Middle Miocene. Similar <b>CCW</b> <b>rotations</b> are indicated by the paleomagnetic orientations of igneous rocks located farther east in the southern range of the island.

Another group of reticular neurons, however, showed asymmetric bidirectional response sensitivity to CW and CCW rotations; a few of these neurons were responsive only to OVAR of one direction but not to both. For each of this second group of neurons, the spread of the δ values with velocity was large. These reticular neurons were described as exhibiting asymmetric and velocity-variable bidirectional response sensitivity. The gain tuning ratios of these latter neurons were found to be within the range of broadly spatiotemporal-tuned neurons. Single neurons of both groups displayed orientational tuning. Both the best response orientations of neurons that showed symmetric and velocity-stable bidirectional response sensitivity and the preferred orientations of neurons that showed asymmetric and velocity-variable bidirectional response sensitivity were found to point in all directions on the rotary plane. The response dynamics of the former group of neurons was also examined. All showed flat response gain across the entire velocity range. Some showed a flat response lead while others showed a progressive shift from small response lead at low velocity to phase close to zero at higher velocities. The functional significance of these medial medullary reticular neurons to the direction and orientation of head tilt is discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Key to {{understanding}} the complex Mediterranean subduction history is the kinematic reconstruction of its paleogeography after Jurassic extension between Iberia, Eurasia, and Africa. While post-Eocene Liguro-Provençal back-arc extension, and associated Miocene ~ 50 ° counterclockwise (<b>ccw)</b> <b>rotation</b> of Sardinia-Corsica have been well documented, pre-Oligocene reconstructions suffer uncertainties related {{to the position of}} Sardinia-Corsica with respect to Iberia. If a previously constrained major post-middle Jurassic, pre-Oligocene rotation of Sardinia-Corsica can be quantified in time, we can test the hypothesis that Sardinia-Corsica was (or was not) part of Iberia, which underwent a ~ 35 ° ccw during the Aptian (121 - 112 Ma). Here, we present new paleomagnetic results from Triassic, Jurassic, Upper Cretaceous and Lower Eocene carbonate rocks from Sardinia. Our results show a consistent well constrained post-early Eocene to pre-Oligocene ~ 45 ° <b>ccw</b> <b>rotation</b> of Sardinia-Corsica relative to Eurasia. This rotation postdated the Iberian rotation, and unambiguously shows that the two domains must have been separated by a (transform) plate boundary. The Eocene rotation of Sardinia-Corsica was synchronous with and likely responsible for documented N-S shortening in the Provence and the incorporation of the Briançonnais continental domain, likely connected to Corsica, into the western Alps. We argue that this rotation resulted from the interplay between a southward 'Alpine' subduction zone at Corsica, retreating northward, and a northward subduction zone below Sardinia, remaining relatively stationary versus Eurasia...|$|E
40|$|The paleomagnetism of Borneo remains controversial, {{although}} {{the preponderance of}} results, both from the island itself and from the surrounding regions, suggest that counterclockwise (<b>CCW)</b> <b>rotation</b> has taken place. CCW rotations are seen in minor intrusions in Sarawak, Sabah and Kalimantan, which increase systematically with {{the age of the}} intrusion to a maximum value of 51. 8 °± 3. 7 °. The rotation can be no older than 25 Ma, which is the age of the intrusion showing the maximum rotation. The rotation appears to have neared completion by 10 Ma. Similar CCW rotations are seen in sites from Peninsular Malaysia through Borneo to Sulawesi, the Celebes Sea and Palawan in the Philippines, but the ages of these rotations are, for the most part, unknown. In Mesozoic rocks in Kalimantan and Sarawak, a stronger declination rotation of nearly 90 °CCW is recorded at seven sites, including sites which pass fold and reversal tests. This strong rotation is no older than youngest Cretaceous, and although seen over a wide region in Borneo, it is not seen in Peninsular Malaysia, nor in the Celebes Sea or Palawan, where only the weaker <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> is seen. The widespread occurrence of this strong rotation in Western Borneo suggests that it is essentially a rigid plate, or microplate rotation, and not a series of local rotations caused by distributed shear in limited deformation zones. The rotation of Borneo appears to be a consequence of convergence between the Australian and Eurasian plates, which is accommodated by subduction along the northwest margin of Borneo. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{island of}} Sumba (Southeast Indonesia) is a {{continental}} fragment that {{is situated in}} the transition zone from the Sunda Arc to the Banda Arc, between the active volcanic inner arc {{to the north and}} the locally less well developed outer arc to the south. On Sumba, rock samples for paleomagnetic research have been collected from three formations: (a) the late Cretaceous Lasipu Formation; (b) the Paleocene Massu Formation; (c) the early Miocene Jawila Formation. The sediments of the Lasipu Formation revealed a mean ChRM direction with Declination (D) = 226. 8 °, Inclination (1) = 33. 5 °, a 95 = 7. 6 ° with a paleolatitude of 18. 3 °; the volcanics of the Massu Formation gave a mean ChRM direction with D = 275. 6 °, I = 14. 6 °, a 95 = 9. 4 ° with a paleolatitude of 7. 4 °; the volcanics of the Jawila Formation presented a mean ChRM with D = 357. 1 °, I = - 19. 3 ° with a paleolatitude of 9. 9 °. These paleomagnetic data have been interpreted in terms of an original position of the Sumba fragment in the northern hemisphere in late Cretaceous time. Between the late Cretaceous and Paleocene, Sumba performed a counterclockwise (<b>CCW)</b> <b>rotation</b> of 50 ° and a drift of 11 ° to the south; between the Paleocene and early Miocene the fragment moved a <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> of 85 ° and a drift of 17 ° to the south.

40|$|Vestibular-driven motor {{responses}} have short latency and {{are largely}} controlled through automatic processes. Here we examined if the Compensatory Arm Movements (CAM) that allow subjects {{to keep the}} hand stationary in space during body motion have the same characteristics and therefore, if they {{belong to the same}} class of movements. If so, the CAM must fulfil specific criterions. The CAM must results from muscular activity. Indeed, as the arm’s inertia tends to stabilize the hand in space during body motion, the CAM could result from passive forces. We recorded EMG activity while subjects (Ss) had to keep the hand fixed in space during 35 ° body rotations in darkness. Marked EMG bursts were found in the Pectoralis major during clockwise (CW) rotations and in the posterior Deltoïdeus during counterclockwise (<b>CCW)</b> <b>rotations.</b> The swiftness of the CAM was assessed computing EMG reaction time (RT). This RT was compared with the RT measured when the arm movement responded to a visual stimulation. Here, the Ss tracked with the unseen finger a visual target that moved either CW or CCW. RT was shorter when the arm movement was a response to a body rotation than when it was a response to a visual stimulus (162 vs. 327 ms, P < 0. 05). The automatic character of the CAM was assessed testing the effect of providing Ss with information about the required direction of the impending CAM. Before the trials, the Ss were informed of the direction of the arm movements to keep the hand stationary in space during rotations or to track the visual target with the finger (task that largely depends on cognitive processes). In 14 of the trials, false information about the required arm direction was given. In 83 of the catch trials where Ss tracked the visual target, EMG bursts first appeared in the muscles permitting arm motion in the direction provided by the false precueing, i. e. in the opposite direction to the actual target motion. For the CAM, only 10 of the catch trials affected the EMG response. We conclude that the CAM are essentially based on sensorimotor mechanisms, with negligible cognitive processes...|$|R

In this paper, based on a two-dimensional soft particle discrete element method (DEM), a numerical approach is developed to investigate the consequence of the orthogonal impact into various granular beds of projectile rotating in both clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) directions. Our results reveal that, depending on the rotation direction, {{there is a significant}} deviation of the x-coordinate of the final stopping point of a spinning projectile from that of its original impact point.

40|$|Quaternary {{faulting}} {{and background}} seismicity {{in the southern}} Sierra Nevada are concentrated east and southeast of the Isabella anomaly, a high velocity body in the upper mantle interpreted to be lower Sierran lithosphere that is foundering or convectively descending into the asthenosphere. We analyzed seismicity in this region to evaluate patterns of upper crustal deformation above and adjacent to the Isabella anomaly. Earthquakes in the southern Sierra and San Joaquin Valley were relocated using joint hypocentral inversion and double-difference techniques, and groups of focal mechanisms were inverted for the components of a reduced deformation rate tensor. From east to west, the regional seismogenic deformation field derived from this analysis exhibits the following characteristics: (1) horizontal plane strain in the southern Walker Lane belt and southwestern Sierra Nevada consistent with distributed NNW-directed dextral shear; (2) heterogeneous extension and crustal thinning in the high Sierra and western foothills east of the Isabella anomaly; (3) pronounced <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> of the principal strains from regional trends in the SW Sierra Nevada; (4) horizontal plane strain in the southwestern San Joaquin Valley; and (5) a 20 - to 40 -km-wide zone of transpression directly east of the San Andreas fault. The heterogeneous extension in the southern Sierra occurs above a zone of anomalous low upper mantle P-wave velocities, {{which suggests that the}} crust is extending above delaminated lithosphere (and possibly upwelling asthenosphere). The <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> of strain trajectories in the SW Sierra occurs directly southeast of the Isabella anomaly. Speculatively, thickened lithosphere above and possibly connected to the anomaly may form a strong backstop that resists through-going NW-directed shear propagating westward into the Sierran microplate from the southern Walker Lane belt, and consequently shearing is deflected to the WNW around the southwestern margin of the anomaly. Alternatively, the Isabella anomaly may generate gravitational buoyancy forces that modify the local stress regime and perturb the deformation field, thus rotating the strain trajectories...|$|E
40|$|According to {{previous}} paleomagnetic analyses, the northward latitudinal drift of Iran {{related to the}} closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean resulted in the Late Triassic collision of Iran with the Eurasian plate and Cimmerian orogeny. The post-Cimmerian paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of Iran is instead less well known. Here we present new paleomagnetic data from the Upper Jurassic Bidou Formation of Central Iran, which we used in conjunction with published paleomagnetic data to reconstruct the history of paleomagnetic rotations and latitudinal drift of Iran during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Paleomagnetic inclination values indicate that, during the Late Jurassic, the Central-East-Iranian Microcontinent (CEIM), consisting of the Yazd, Tabas, and Lut continental blocks, was located at low latitudes close to the Eurasian margin, in agreement with the position expected from apparent polar wander paths (APWP) incorporating the so-called Jurassic massive polar shift, a major event of plate motion occurring in the Late Jurassic from 160 Ma to 145 – 140 Ma. At these times, the CEIM was oriented WSW–ENE, with the Lut Block bordered to the south by the Neo-Tethys Ocean and to the southeast by the Neo-Sistan oceanic seaway. Subsequently, the CEIM underwent significant counter-clockwise (<b>CCW)</b> <b>rotation</b> during the Early Cretaceous. This rotation may have resulted from the northward propagation of the Sistan rifting- spreading axis during Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous, or to the subsequent (late Early Cretaceous?) eastward subduction and closure of the Sistan oceanic seaway underneath the continental margin of the Afghan Block. No rotations of, or within, the CEIM occurred during the Late Cretaceous–Oligocene, whereas a second phase of <b>CCW</b> <b>rotation</b> occurred after the Middle-Late Miocene. Both the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous and post Miocene CCW rotations are confined to the CEIM and do not seem to extend to other tectonic regions of Iran. Finally, an oroclinal bending mechanism is proposed for the origin of the curved Alborz Mountains, which acquired most of its curvature in the last 8 Myr...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterial}} flagellar motor can rotate in both counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) directions. It {{has been}} shown that the sodium ion-driven chimeric flagellar motor rotates with 26 steps per revolution, which corresponds to the number of FliG subunits that form part of the rotor ring, but the size of the backward step is smaller than the forward one. Here we report that the proton-driven flagellar motor of Salmonella also rotates with 26 steps per revolution but symmetrical in both CCW and CW directions with occasional smaller backward steps in both directions. Occasional shift in the stepping positions is also observed, suggesting the frequent exchange of stators in one of the 11 – 12 possible anchoring positions around the rotor. These observations indicate that the elementary process of torque generation by the cyclic association/dissociation of the stator with every FliG subunit along the circumference of the rotor is symmetric in <b>CCW</b> and CW <b>rotation</b> even though the structure of FliG is highly asymmetric and suggests a 180 ° rotation of a FliG domain for the rotor-stator interaction to reverse the direction of rotation...|$|R

This paper tries to maximize the classification accuracies of these signals so as to improve prosthetics by comparison between two main algorithms namely using Naïve Bayes and Part rule algorithms.

The introduction of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) as a new signal pre-processing technique along with the different decision trees have provided good classification performance. VMD allows decomposition of the signal into various modes by identifying a compact frequency support around its central frequency, such that adding all the modes reconstructs the original signal. The statistical features were extracted. Out of these the useful features were identified using the J 48 decision tree algorithm and selected features were classified using Naïve Bayes and Part rule algorithms.

40|$|Halobacteria {{are light}} sensitive, motile microorganisms, which are {{propelled}} by rotating flagella. Under stationary and spatially homogeneous light conditions they change the rotational {{sense of the}} flagella spontaneously about every 10 - 30 s thereby reversing their swimming direction. The distribution of the swimming intervals, i. e., of the intervals between two successive reversals, is asymmetric with a long tail. Light or chemical stimuli may alter this spontaneous behaviour. A step-up or step-down of the intensity of greenlight prolongs or shortens a swimming interval, respectively. Stimuli in the UV range have the opposite effect. As a response to periodic light pulses as well as upon treatment with a certain chemical (IBMX) temporal patterns in the swimming behavior are observed. Detailed knowledge of the molecular basis of signal transduction in Halobacteria is scarce, however. In this thesis simple mathematical models of the system are analysed to get insight into the dynamical mechanism which may underly the swimming behavior of the bacteria. They are based on hypotheses which have previously been proposed to explain the experimental observations. In terms of stochastic processes the basic assumption is that the interval distributions have to be interpreted as first passage time distributions for the transition from clockwise (CW) to counterclockwise <b>rotation</b> (<b>CCW)</b> of the flagella, or vice versaAvailable from TIB Hannover: RA 831 (2802) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEDEGerman...|$|R
