5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other organisms in that they are based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with <b>cyclopropane</b> or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty acids in the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E

40|$|On {{treatment}} with base, diphenylphosphinoyl esters 3 (X=O) give <b>cyclopropanes</b> 4 via {{a series of}} steps including intramolecular acyl and phosphinoyl transfer processes. β-Substituted esters have been shown to give <b>cyclopropanes</b> with high diastereoselectivity. This thesis describes the synthesis of optically active β-substituted esters using Evans’ alkylation methodology and their use in the stereocontrolled synthesis of substituted <b>cyclopropanes.</b> It was found that that phosphine oxide 1 (X=O) is unstable in the conditions of the alkylation reaction and the corresponding phosphine borane 1 (X=BH 3) was employed with greater success. The thesis also describes investigations into the potential formation of <b>cyclopropanes</b> 4 from esters 3 (X= BH 3 /S) without prior conversion to the phosphine oxide 3 (X=O). It has been proposed that a phosphine ester is a key intermediate in the formation of <b>cyclopropanes</b> 4 from diphenylphosphinoyl esters 3 (X=O). Detailed in this thesis, is an investigation into the synthesis of optically active <b>cyclopropanes</b> 8 from phosphonate esters 7 prepared by an Evans’ alkylation route. Also included in this thesis are studies into the relative rates of deprotonation and the palladium-catalysed hydrogenation reactions of allyl phosphine oxides, boranes and sulfides.

25|$|Both {{saturated}} (alicyclic) {{compounds and}} unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives. The most stable rings contain {{five or six}} carbon atoms, but large rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common. The smallest cycloalkane family is the three-membered <b>cyclopropane</b> ((CH2)3). Saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only, whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or conjugated) double bond. Cycloalkanes do not contain multiple bonds, whereas the cycloalkenes and the cycloalkynes do.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and <b>cyclopropane.</b> Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E

25|$|The bond angles in {{aziridine}} {{are approximately}} 60°, {{considerably less than}} the normal hydrocarbon bond angle of 109.5°, which results in angle strain as in the comparable <b>cyclopropane</b> and ethylene oxide molecules. A banana bond model explains bonding in such compounds. Aziridine is less basic than acyclic aliphatic amines, with a pKa of 7.9 for the conjugate acid, due to increased s character of the nitrogen free electron pair. Angle strain in aziridine also increases the barrier to nitrogen inversion. This barrier height permits the isolation of separate invertomers, for example the cis and trans invertomers of N-chloro-2-methylaziridine.|$|E
25|$|One {{insight into}} the {{reaction}} mechanism for this photoreaction is given by an isotope scrambling experiment. The 6 vinylic protons in barrelene 1 are more acidic than the two bridgehead protons and therefore they can be replaced by deuterium with N-deuteriocyclohexylamide. Photolysis of 2 results in the initial formation of an biradical intermediate with a <b>cyclopropane</b> ring formed. This product rearranges to a second intermediate with a more favorable allylic radical as two mesomers. Intersystem crossing and radical recombination results in equal quantities of semibullvalenes 3 and 4. The new proton distribution with allylic, vinylic and cyclopropanyl protons determined with proton NMR confirms this model. As noted, the conversion of barrelene to semibullvalene is a di-pi-methane rearrangement.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cyclopropanes</b> and cyclobutanes, when {{activated}} with {{donor and acceptor}} groups, provide facile {{access to}} a plethora of interesting chemical scaffolds. Importantly, D-A <b>cyclopropanes</b> and cyclobutanes undergo efficient reactivity under mild Lewis acid conditions.

In this thesis, D-A <b>cyclopropanes</b> and cyclobutanes were systematically used as chemical precursors to a variety of natural product-like scaffolds. Firstly, novel interrupted formal homo-Nazarov cyclizations were investigated and provided concise entry into α-arylated cyclohexenols, α-allylated cyclohexenols, and hexahydrobenzofurans. In a different pursuit, formal [5 + 2] cycloadditions, presumably occurring via D-A cyclobutane intermediates, afforded efficient, high-yielding and diastereoselective access to azepino[1, 2 -a]indoles and cyclohepta[b]indoles, two important backbones in the indole alkaloid family of natural products (Figure 6. 1). Finally, homo-Nazarov-inspired cyclizations of strategically-chosen D-A <b>cyclopropanes</b> were successfully employed in the synthesis of hydropyrido[1, 2 -a]indoles (under continuous flow conditions) as well the dihydrodibenzo[b,d]furan core (featured in natural product propolisbenzofuran B).
