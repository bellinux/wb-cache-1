5|$|After {{the events}} of November 1, the Terminal and Traction Company hired 300 {{professional}} strikebreakers from the Pinkerton Agency in Chicago to operate the streetcars. Todd wrote {{an open letter to}} the city leadership alleging that illegitimate forces from outside the state were behind the events, and that his workers did not truly desire to unionize. He wrote that if his workers <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> adequate police protection, they could resume normal operations.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was {{in command}} of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had {{meanwhile}} decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1809, Napoleon {{crossed the}} Danube {{not far from}} Vienna and {{attacked}} Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they would have a hard time just holding out. Nansouty <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> one of his brigades, Saint-Germain's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne charging, as they had done all day long, in a desperate attempt to stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.|$|E
25|$|This process rewarded {{campaign}} {{organizations that}} <b>could</b> not <b>only</b> <b>get</b> supporters to the caucus sites, but get supporters {{who would be}} willing to serve as delegates to county conventions and beyond. As a result, Ron Paul was ultimately able to win 22 of the 28 delegates to the national convention and Mitt Romney won the other six.|$|R

5|$|Pepper Rodgers {{was hired}} soon after Fulcher quit. Rodgers was hired {{away from the}} UCLA Bruins and like Carson and Fulcher, simply could not return Tech to its {{national}} prominence of Dodd's era, and after six seasons, Rodgers had accumulated only 34 wins and barely a 50% winning percentage. Rodgers flamboyant demeanor shortened his welcome at the school, and Athletic Director Doug Weaver, replaced him with Bill Curry. Homer Rice became Athletic Director, and attempted to reinvigorate Tech's program by joining the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1980. The Georgia Tech football program reached its lowest point in modern history after the hiring of Bill Curry, who had no experience as a head coach, but was a refreshing change after the flamboyant Rodgers. Curry's first two Tech teams from 1980–1981 went 2-19-1 with the only bright spots being a brilliant 24-21 victory over Bear Bryant's Alabama team at Legion Field to open the 1981 season and a 3-3 slug fest in 1980 with then No.1 rated Notre Dame at Grant Field. Things had gotten so bad, they <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> better. He slowly rebuilt the team, restored a winning mentality to the Georgia Tech fan base, and in 1985 Tech won 9 games, including a 17-14 victory over Michigan State in the All American Bowl.|$|E

25|$|Education for {{children}} in institutions was often of a poor standard and {{by the age of}} 15 most children had left school. Many children left institutions with low levels of literacy and numeracy that may have affected their ability to find work or meant they <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> low paying jobs. It also affected their ability to further their education.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{embarked}} on their {{second set of}} matches against South Africa this season, this time in South Africa. The tour began with a Twenty20 international at the Wanderers, where South Africa won by two runs after half-centuries from Graeme Smith and Herschelle Gibbs.

50|$|Yet {{through the}} years, many musicians, music fans and journalists and readers learned to embrace PULP’s penchant for {{over-the-top}} journalism and art direction as the publication’s readership increased in no time.

25|$|The other semi-final {{was played}} {{two days later}} in {{overcast}} conditions, and the bad light conditions brought Duckworth-Lewis into play. Barbados had made 270 for 7, with Dwayne Smith hitting 96 off 81 balls amid Kenroy Peters' three-wicket-haul, and Courtney Browne and Ian Bradshaw added 67 for the last wicket as Barbados accumulated 270 for 7. Corey Collymore took two early wickets, but the Windwards recovered to 100 for 3 in the 25th over when play was stopped. 12 overs were lost, and the Windwards set a target of 217 - they lost five wickets in the process, and <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> 75 of the 117 runs required, losing by 41 runs.|$|E
25|$|Compared to the US series, the British {{version has}} a more rigid format that {{requires}} the production team to provide enough footage for each series, {{that is to be}} then incorporated into twelve separate episodes. Early rules in filming meant that multiple firings were not allowed in the first two series, a fact that was acknowledged as an issue by Lord Sugar when he expressed his desire to fire both Alexa Tilley and Syed Ahmed following a task in the second series, but <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> rid of the former. In subsequent series, this rule was changed after the show increased the number of candidates for the competition, meaning that Lord Sugar could conduct double firings where needed by the film crew as part of the filming schedule.|$|E

25|$|After the Second World War, things <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> {{better for}} Northamptonshire {{and they started}} by {{recruiting}} widely from other counties and countries, bringing in Freddie Brown from Surrey; the Australians Jock Livingston, George Tribe and Jack Manning; the New Zealander Peter Arnold; and the Cambridge University opening bat and leg-spinner Raman Subba Row. Brown joined as captain in 1949, and led the team to six place {{in his first season}} after previous years of disappointment. Under the new leadership of Dennis Brookes (a stalwart batsman for over 20 years), finished second in 1957, their best finish for 45 years. This was mainly due to the bowling attack of Frank Tyson, Vincent Broderick, Michael Allen, George Tribe and Manning. Northamptonshire were widely considered the best team in England in the late 1950s and early 1960s, during this time Keith Andrew, Northants best ever Wicket-keeper broke the records of most victims in an innings and a season.|$|E

Despite this, Kent noted that she <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> across a few very basic needs and neither made facial expressions nor used any discernible body language. When Genie was upset she would engage in silent, expressionless, self-harming tantrums until she had physically tired herself out, after which she immediately reverted to being completely non-expressive. She never cried during these outbursts—according to several firsthand accounts she could not cry at all—and if she wanted to make noise she pushed chairs or other objects. On a few occasions she responded to stimuli with a very soft, high-pitched, shrill laugh, but was otherwise completely undemonstrative.|$|E
25|$|The final 10-minute {{shoot-out}} {{began with}} very close lap times. As the chequered flag fell everyone {{was on their}} final lap. Button {{was the first of}} the main contenders to cross it for the final time and he didn't improve and stayed 5th. Next was Barrichello as he crossed the line and didn't improve and stayed 2nd. Kovalainen looked set for pole position but a lockup and a slide in the final corner <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>get</b> him up into second, so Hamilton didn't feel the need to complete his lap with no one else on fast laps. Hamilton got his first pole position of the season, but more importantly, it was a McLaren 1–2. Barrichello came third and a surprise 4th for Vettel as he split the Brawns. Räikkönen even with race fuel on board posted a lap time that was 1.279 seconds quicker than Luca Badoer's time in Q1 on low fuel. This was also the first time Lewis Hamilton had been on pole since the 2008 Chinese Grand Prix.|$|E
