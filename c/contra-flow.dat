40|$|Abstract. A {{strategy}} is proposed {{to model the}} water exchange in areas with arbitrary but stable stratification, together with complex geometry and topology. The stratification is first approximated by two or three homogeneous layers based on inspection of a density coordinate potential energy diagram. The flow regime is then classified as maximal or submaximal. The two-layer maximal exchange solution may be calculated and tabulated {{as a function of}} the imposed barotropic net flow on beforehand for a given strait with full regard to geometric features. For submaximal cases, the solution is also dependent on the interface height in one of the reservoirs. The influence of stratification within the assumed homogeneous layers may be estimated by gradually migrating towards flow cases possible to solve with other methods, e. g <b>contra-flowing</b> multi-layer groups separated by an infinitesimally thin stagnant layer...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{international}} and global news {{to date has}} focused on the operation of foreign news values, the unequal flows and emergent <b>contra-flows</b> of transnational news as well as the phenomenology of 24 / 7 live broadcasts. Today these debates are often played out under opposing `global dominance' and `global public sphere' positions. Each in its own way is concerned about communications democracy — whether its discerned curtailment by processes of geo-political economy or temporal-spatial extension by increased global cultural flows. In this article we contend that there is a `democratic lacuna' at the heart of these debates. This silence concerns how exactly leading world news channels — principally CNNI and BBC World but also international competitors such as Sky and Fox News — communicatively present the voices, views and values of contending interests and identities from around the world. Elaborating a new conception of `communicative frames' based on contemporary positions of social and political theory and applying this to a large corpus of news output, we begin to evaluate generalizing theoretical claims, both critical and celebratory, about the contribution of global 24 / 7 news to processes of global dominance or an emergent global public sphere...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is not conventionally air conditioned because {{the production of}} the electricity used to make and operate air conditioners has an environmental impact, including the release of greenhouse gasses. Instead, air flows around the perimeter of The Hive through opening windows. Air makes its way towards the main atrium and other voids where it rises to roof level and is exhausted through the roof vents. The seven roof-mounted cones encourage the upward movement of stale air by stack effect, mechanically aided a large below-ground duct which supplies air naturally {{to the bottom of the}} main atrium space. To safeguard against <b>contra-flows</b> created by external wind turbulence, which might negate this stack effect, the architects commissioned a scale model of one of the cones to be tested in a wind tunnel at Cardiff University.The predominant wind direction is from the South-West which means that air is blown over the river and the water meadow provided as part of the landscape in front of the building. There is some degree of evaporative cooling which reduces the air-temperature of the incoming air.Exposed concrete soffits provide the majority of the thermal mass and these are pre-cooled by the night-time cooling strategy. In very hot weather when the natural ventilation can no longer maintain the required conditions, cool water (fed by the river cooling system) is circulated around either chilled beams or pipes embedded in the concrete slab to provide further cooling.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike transculturation, counter-flows (or <b>contra-flow)</b> is not {{the mixing}} or meshing of two cultures.Rather, contra-flow(s) is about the {{movement}} of cultures, like a two-way traffic lane, where individualsare said to live “between cultures.”. The term <b>contra-flow</b> originated from the precedingperipheries of global media industries, designated ‘sub-altern flows.’ [...] More importantly, contra-flow(s) emerged because of the global mass media reversing the dominant Western, First Worlddirection, in other words {{it is no longer}} from “the West to the rest,” [...] It can also be said thatcounter-flows originated because of colonization and later on because of Diaspora.|$|E

5000|$|Emergency {{evacuation}} {{plans are}} developed {{to ensure the}} safest and most efficient evacuation time of all expected residents of a structure, city, or region. A benchmark [...] "evacuation time" [...] for different hazards and conditions is established. These benchmarks can be established through using best practices, regulations, or using simulations, such as modeling the flow {{of people in a}} building, to determine the benchmark. Proper planning will use multiple exits, <b>contra-flow</b> lanes, and special technologies to ensure full, fast and complete evacuation. Consideration for personal situations which may affect an individual's ability to evacuate is taken into account, including alarm signals that use both aural and visual alerts, and also evacuation equipment such as sleds, pads, and chairs for non-ambulatory people. Regulations such as building codes can be used to reduce the possibility of panic by allowing individuals to process the need to self-evacuate without causing alarm [...] Proper planning will implement an all-hazards approach so that plans can be reused for multiple hazards that could exist.|$|E

They {{also said that the}} state had prepositioned enough food and water to supply 15,000 citizens with supplies for three days, the anticipated waiting period before FEMA would arrive in force and provide supplies for those still in the city. Later, it was found that FEMA had provided these supplies, but that FEMA Director Michael D. Brown was greatly surprised by the much larger numbers of people who turned up seeking refuge and that the first wave of supplies were quickly depleted. The large number of deaths were a result of the insufficient response and evacuation before Katrina's arrival, primarily due to city and state resistance to issuing an evacuation order and risking [...] "crying wolf" [...] and losing face should the hurricane have left the path of model prediction. Had <b>contra-flow</b> on highways been initiated sooner and more buses begun evacuating families (including the idle school buses that were not used at all) the numbers of stranded New Orleans occupants would have been significantly less making the initial wave of FEMA supplies adequate and even excessive.|$|E
5000|$|The PABT is {{the gateway}} for most bus and jitney traffic {{entering}} Manhattan {{with more than}} 190,000 passengers on 6,000 bus trips made through the Lincoln Tunnel and terminal daily. The Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix (NJ 495) in Hudson County, New Jersey passes through a cut and descends the Hudson Palisades to the Lincoln Tunnel {{at the other end}} of which is the PABT. Starting in 1964, studies were conducted to address the feasibility of an exclusive bus lane (XBL) during the weekday morning peak period. The XBL, first implemented in 1970, serves weekday eastbound bus traffic between 6:00am-10:00am. The lane is fed by the New Jersey Turnpike at Exits 16E and 17 and New Jersey Route 3. The helix, tunnel, and terminal are owned and operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the bi-state agency that also implements the 2.5 mi <b>contra-flow</b> express bus left lane in three westbound lanes. The XBL serves over 1,800 buses and 65,000 bus commuters on regular weekday mornings and is a major component of the morning [...] "inbound" [...] commutation crossing the Hudson River.
