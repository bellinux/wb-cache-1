50|$|The vat dyes {{have high}} color fastness, which is {{uncommon}} in other dye classes. On the other hand, vat dyes {{tend to have}} poor rubbing fastness, but this can be mitigated with special treatments to the fabric. Indigo is subject to major <b>crocking</b> (i.e., rubbing the dye off onto other items) unless it is applied carefully. This means use a weaker dyebath, and dipping many times, rather than a single strong dipping.|$|E
50|$|Solution dyeing, {{also known}} as dope or spun dyeing, {{is the process of}} adding {{pigments}} or insoluble dyes to the spinning solution before the solution is extruded through the spinneret. Only manufactured fibers can be solution-dyed. It is used for difficult-to-dye fibers, such as olefin fibers, and for dyeing fibers for end uses that require excellent colorfastness properties. Because the color pigments {{become a part of the}} fiber, solution-dyed materials have excellent colorfastness to light, washing, <b>crocking</b> (rubbing), perspiration, and bleach. Dyeing at the solution stage is more expensive, since the equipment has to be cleaned thoroughly each time a different color is produced. Thus, the variety of colors and shades produced is limited. In addition, it is difficult to stock the inventory for each color. Decisions regarding color have to be made very early in the manufacturing process. Thus, this stage of dyeing is usually not used for apparel fabrics.|$|E

50|$|Polyester {{fabric is}} printed mostly with dye-sub or {{disperse}} direct ink, although UV and solvent inks (including HP’s latex formulation) {{can also be}} used. The great benefit of sublimation ink {{is the fact that}} the colorants will bond with the fibre during sublimation or fixation. The colours are ‘inside’ the media and don’t stay within the coating and on top of the media, as it is the case with UV-curable formulations. Even latex inks on porous textiles can suffer from <b>crocking</b> issues or ‘rub-off’. Low energy sublimation ink is easier to print with, but has the disadvantage of colours fading faster; its UV resistance, or light-fastness, is less resistant than equivalents using high energy disperse direct ink. Dye-sub can also suffer from a ‘halo’ effect which results in less sharp images. The disperse direct ink is a ‘stronger’ ink than the dye-sub kind, and this is very important for outdoor use, such as for fence fabric, flags and banners: artwork will last longer.|$|E
50|$|Protein-based fibers such as silk, wool, and feathers, {{as well as}} the {{synthetic}} polyamide fiber, nylon, can be dyed with acid dyes. As may be expected from the name, acid dyes are effective at acidic (low) pH, where they form ionic bonds with the fiber. Acid dyes are also relatively safe (some are used as food dyes) and simple to use. Vat dyes, including indigo, are a third class of dyes that are effective on cellulosic fibers and silk. Vat dyes are insoluble in water in their unreduced form, and the vat dye must be chemically reduced before they can be used to color fabric. This is accomplished by heating the dye in a strongly basic solution of sodium hydroxide (lye) or sodium carbonate (caustic potash) containing a reducing agent such as sodium hydrosulfite or thiourea dioxide. The fabric is immersed in the dye bath, and after removal the vat dye oxidizes to its insoluble form, binding with high wash-fastness to the fiber. However, vat dyes, and especially indigo, must be treated after dyeing by 'soaping' to prevent the dye from rubbing (<b>crocking)</b> off. Vat dyes can be used to simultaneously dye the fabric and to remove underlying fiber-reactive dye (i.e., can dye a black cotton fabric yellow) because of the bleaching action of the reducing bath (see below). The extra complexity and safety issues (particularly when using strong bases such as lye) restrict use of vat dyes in tie-dye to experts.|$|E

In this study, colorfastness to washing and <b>crocking</b> of fabrics dyed with wood-staining fungal pigments was compared to colorfastness of commercial dyes using an alternative mechanical testing method. Overall, wood-staining fungal pigments out performed commercial dyes for colorfastness to washing and wet and dry <b>crocking.</b> Xylindein was the most colorfast dye. Draconin red yielded inconsistent results, and the yellow pigment required a mordant to achieve any colorfastness. This study showed that the mechanical color reading method, along with statistical analysis, provided an objective, repeatable gauge of colorfastness, although visual inspection is also needed for practical purposes...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 59 - 62) Dandelion roots, dock roots, English walnut hulls, eucalyptus bark, eucalyptus hulls, eucalyptus leaves, juniper berries, mistletoe, kelp {{and onion}} skins were the natural dye materials selected for this study. Five colorfastness tests were performed using these ten natural dyes and four mordants. The {{study was designed}} to obtain qualitative information on the colorfastness properties of the ten natural dyes to light, laundering, <b>crocking,</b> perspiration and drycleaning and to determine the effect of the mordants on these colorfastness properties. Alum, chrome, iron and tin were the mordants used. For the most part, the ten natural dyes rated satisfactory on the <b>crocking,</b> laundering, drycleaning and perspiration tests. A few dye/mordant combinations rated satisfactory to light. These included: juniper berries mordanted with tin, mordanted English walnut hulls, eucalyptus hulls and leaves mordanted with iron, eucalyptus bark mordanted with chrome and iron plus all kelp samples except those mordanted with tin. The lightfastness of dock roots, mistletoe and eucalyptus hulls was poor. Generally, colorfastness was increased by applying mordants. Iron mordanted samples averaged lower ratings than the other mordanted samples on all colorfastness tests except light and averaged lower ratings the the unmordanted samples on the <b>crocking</b> and laundering tests. Alum, tin and chrome did very well on the colorfastness tests except for lightfastness, in which case they did average compared with the other samples...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} natural dye {{extracted from}} stink bean pod (Parkia speciosa Hassk.) which was dyed on the silk fabric. The mordants as aluminum potassium sulfate, iron chloride, sodium hydroxide and mud {{were used to}} dye fabric using three different dyeing methods: pre-mordanting, meta-mordanting and post-mordanting. The color fastness to washing, water, perspiration, light and <b>crocking</b> of the dyed samples was determined according to AATCC test methods. In this study the UV-protection properties on silk fabrics were investigated. The chemical functional groups of the dyes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results revealed that the dyeing silk fabrics with stink beans pod were fair to good fastness to washing and <b>crocking</b> and very poor to poor light fastness {{with the exception of}} samples mordanted with iron chloride. The water and perspiration fastness ratings were fair to good. Silk fabrics mordanted with iron chloride and dyed with stink bean usually showed good UV-protection levels even if undyed. These extracts gave polyphenolic, betalain dye and chlorophyll content. Therefore, it was suggested that stink bean pod has the potential in producing functional dyes that could be imparted into the silk dyeing natural colorant system...|$|E
40|$|To improve {{adhesion}} {{and wear}} durability at {{the interface between}} copper (Cu) film and polyester fabric, the Cu coated polyester fabric was treated by two commercial solutions of polyester-polyurethane (PP) and aqueous acrylate (AC) as finishing process respectively. Both finishing agents with 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 %, 35 % and 40 % concentrations were. coated on the Cu-coated fabrics by a padding method in this study. The surface morphologies of the coated polyester fabric before and after finishing were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The adhesion of Cu-coated film {{before and after the}} finishing treatments was measured with scotch tape method; the durability was evaluated by colorfastness to washing, <b>crocking</b> and perspiration. Additionally, Ultraviolet (UV) shielding, water repellency and CM L*a*b of the Cu-coated polyester fabric before and after the finishing treatments were determined.

40|$|Digital textile {{printing}} is over-taking the printing industry with eco-friendly processes {{and ability to}} produce short runs. With its rapid growth, {{there is a constant}} need to reproduce consistent colors throughout different print runs and crucial for these colors to perform well and up hold under certain conditions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to research the colorfastness digitally printed reactive and pigment inks printed on cotton fabrics. Fabric swatches printed using the reactive and pigment inks were tested according to the AATCC standards for laundering, <b>crocking,</b> light, and perspiration. The digital {{textile printing}} industry has slowly started transitioning from printing with reactive inks to primarily pigment inks. Printing with pigment inks is more cost effective and cheaper than reactive inks and has had a large impact on the printing industry. While reactive inks are printed on natural fibers, such as cotton and silk pigment inks, have the ability to be printed on natural and synthetic fibers. To test the textiles, a Mimaki TX 2 1600 digital textile printer was used to print the reactive ink samples while an outside printing company was used to print the pigment ink samples. One hundred and twenty-eight test samples sizes 2 ”x 6 ”printed with a red, blue, and green geometric pattern were tested. Both the pigment and reactive samples were testing according to the AATCC standards for colorfastness to laundering, <b>crocking,</b> light, and perspiration. Using a spectrophotometer, the samples were tested and the CIELAB color and ΔE* color change were obtained. The samples were also tested using the AATCC gray scale and 9 -step chromatic transference scale. Using the Wilcoxin rank sum test the pigment and reactive samples were compared to record any statistical significance in color change. The results revealed that the colors printed using pigment inks perform better than reactive inks. Pigment inks experienced much less color loss than the reactive inks in laundering, <b>crocking,</b> and perspiration. Light had little to no impact on the color of both the reactive and pigment samples. Evaluating the reactive and pigments ink types and their colorfastness benefits academia and the industry. This research provides recommendations of how these ink types may be best suited for certain types of apparel and products...|$|E
