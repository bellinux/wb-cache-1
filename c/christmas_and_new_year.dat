5|$|After {{undertaking}} {{a series}} of friendlies, Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur in the Charity Shield and drew 0–0 to share the honour. Defeats by Everton and Aston Villa {{set the tone for}} the league season as the team were left with much to do; a poor run of form during the <b>Christmas</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> period effectively ruled the team out of retaining the championship. Arsenal finished the season strongly however – unbeaten in 16 matches, to end the campaign in fourth place. Wright was Arsenal's top goalscorer with 26 goals.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd custom was {{performed}} during wither festivities, specifically around {{the dates of}} <b>Christmas</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year.</b> However, the precise date on which the custom {{was performed}} varied between villages, and {{in a number of}} cases the custom was carried out for several consecutive nights. There is a unique example provided by an account from Gower in which the head was kept buried throughout the year, only being dug up for use during the Christmas season.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{who could}} leave their body in spirit during sleep were called burkudzäutä among the Ossetians of the Caucasus, {{and they were}} called mazzeri in parts of Corsica. The burkudzäutä, mounted on animals or {{household}} objects, flew on a night between <b>Christmas</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> to burku, {{the land of the}} dead described as a great meadow. There they collected the seeds of agricultural plants and took them to their village, thus ensuring a rich harvest. The dead pursued and shot arrows at them as they flew back home. The wounded burkudzäutä would fall sick after the return, and some of them would die. The mazzeri of neighbouring villages fought each other in spirit on the night between 31July and 1August. The village of the defeated mazzeri would suffer more deaths during the next year.|$|E

25|$|Some ancient {{traditional}} festivals {{have been}} Christianised and merged with existing Christian rituals. The Afia Nkwu and (eight days later) the Kamanu festivals in late December and early January for example, which {{marked the end}} of the old Igbo calendar have been largely superseded by the <b>Christmas</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> celebrations of the present day. Some ancient traditional festivals celebrated in the town have been adapted to fit present needs and context such as the Iwa Ji (New Yam festival) in August.

25|$|Infrastructure {{problems}} have affected performance. According to Network Rail, the main {{problems have}} been track-circuit failures, broken rails, track faults, points failures and overhead line equipment (OLE) failures. Network Rail, {{which is responsible for}} the infrastructure, intended to improve performance by work carried out during a planned closure of London Liverpool Street station over <b>Christmas</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> 2007/8. This allowed much of the outer London overhead line equipment to be replaced by modern, self-tensioning lines. The work was carried out, but overran at short notice by some 24 hours, causing ridicule in the national press.|$|E

Her {{calendar}} always included a <b>Christmas</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> cruise, typically to islands in the Atlantic and perhaps the North African coast. That was followed each year by a Winter Cruise, which was longer and could be up to two months. The length of the Winter Cruise allowed to Andes to sail farther from her home port of Southampton, to any ocean that was exotic and warm while the Northern Hemisphere was in winter.|$|E
25|$|This unusual winter general {{election}} {{was caused by}} a motion of no confidence passed by the House of Commons on November 28, 2005, with Canada's three opposition parties contending that the Liberal government of Prime Minister Paul Martin was corrupt.

The last set January 23, 2006, as election day and February 13 as the date for return of the writs.
