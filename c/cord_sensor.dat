40|$|There is a {{continuous}} {{need for the}} monitoring of engineering structures, especially when scheduled inspections are difficult to perform or if they are too expensive. The present paper gives some results {{on the performance of}} sensors on the basis of percolation thresholds that are able to detect leakage of diverse harmful liquids, such as water, hydraulic liquids, kerosene and jet engine oils. The focus here lies on sensor systems that give semi-quantitative, fuse-like information on the presence of harmful liquids, which indirectly gives evidence on the presence of structural damage. The common underlying principle is the interruption of percolation conductivity when the respective sensing material is exposed to harmful liquids; that is, the electrical conductivity is essentially lost by sorption and swelling of a dedicated matrix material. The temperature dependence and response times give valuable information on the usability of the sensor in the respective environments. The sensor can be manufactured as a <b>cord</b> <b>sensor</b> or as self-adhesive patches where the functional layer is deposited by screen printing. status: publishe...|$|E
5000|$|This first {{electronic}} device made decisions {{not only as}} to whether the ball landed within the boundaries of the playing zones, but also was wired to make foot fault and service net-cord legal serve decisions. The foot fault judge used directional microphones to detect the striking of the ball by the player’s racquet, when serving the ball, that functioned in conjunction with a timing circuit to detect if the players foot had activated the baseline line ‘IN’ sensor immediately prior to, or during, the striking of the ball. The net <b>cord</b> ‘Let’ <b>sensor</b> was a simple piezoelectric device, initially a guitar pickup, to detect if the tennis ball touched the net during the service delivery. The service line sensors, net-cord sensor, legal serve and foot fault devices were turned [...] "on" [...] in unison during the process of a player serving the ball {{at the beginning of each}} point and then turned [...] "off" [...] as the opponent returned the ball.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} adenosine production in the spinal cord during motor activity, and its possible contribution to the temporal modulation of motor patterns, a sensor sensitive to adenosine at concentrations as low as 10 nm was devised. When pressed against {{the outside of the}} spinal <b>cord,</b> the <b>sensor</b> detected slow changes in the levels of adenosine during fictive swimming that ranged from 10 to 650 nm. In four embryos where particularly large signals were recorded due to favourable probe placement, the adenosine levels continued to rise for up to a minute following cessation of activity before slowly returning to baseline. In the remaining thirteen embryos, levels of adenosine started to return slowly to baseline almost immediately after activity had stopped. Inhibitors of adenosine uptake increased the magnitude of the signal recorded and slowed the recovery following cessation of activity. A realistic computational model of the spinal circuitry was combined with models of extracellular breakdown of ATP to adenosine. ATP and adenosine inhibited, as in the real embryo, the voltage-gated K+ and Ca 2 + currents, respectively. The model reproduced the temporal run-down of motor activity seen in the real embryo suggesting that synaptic release of ATP together with its extracellular breakdown to adenosine is sufficient to exert time-dependent control over motor pattern generation. The computational analysis also suggested that the delay in the rise of adenosine levels is likely to result from feed-forward inhibition of the 5 ′-ectonucleotidase in the spinal cord. This inhibition is a key determinant of the rate of run-down...|$|R
50|$|Vivitar {{also offered}} {{a new type}} of semi-professional flash unit from National/Panasonic under the Vivitar label called the Vivitar 260. The flash was {{acclaimed}} for its innovative design, but criticized for its use of expensive 9 volt batteries. Recognizing the problem, Max Ponder travelled to Japan to meet with the manufacturer, offering suggestions for improvements based on the feedback received from customers. The improved flash was introduced in 1970 as the Vivitar 283. The Vivitar 283 quickly became the number one professional and enthusiast flash unit, outselling all its competitors combined and selling 3,000,000 by 1973. In production for over 30 years, it was twice returned to production after being discontinued in response to customer demand. The 283's sister flash was called the 285, and featured a zoom head to cover different focal length lenses and a built-in variable power setting. Earlier made-in-Japan Vivitar flashes have a trigger voltage of 250v, which can damage the circuits of some digital cameras. Newer units made in China and Korea are low-voltage units producing 5 to 12 volts. A point of note is the 283 has a removable sensor (as has the 285) and coupled the optional remote <b>sensor</b> <b>cord,</b> off-camera flash is possible with the gun still in auto mode.|$|R
