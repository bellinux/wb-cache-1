From the study, it is concluded that the thickness of the blade determines the total flow area and flow rate delivered. When the internal blade angle is at 90 °, shock free entry is incurred and maximum flow rate can be achieved. The external blade angle should be within 20 to 45 degrees, to avoid rapid drop of pressure coefficient and efficiency. Lastly, the formation of the eccentric vortex zone inside the <b>cross</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> and flow field pattern are observed.

The application of a cross-flow fan as the propulsion source for a fan-wing vertical takeoff and landing vehicle has drawn attention in recent years. Previous investigations have demonstrated the performance characteristics of multiple cross-flow fan configurations. During this experiment a cross-flow fan with 30 blades, a 6 inch diameter and a 4 inch span was tested. The performance and stall characteristics were determined and plotted along constant speed and constant throttle setting lines. Comparison of the tested cross-flow fan was made against two previously tested cross-flow fans with similar design and 1. 5 inch and 6 inch span lengths. Performance parameters of the three <b>cross</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fans</b> were compared and plotted for constant speed curves.

40|$|The work {{reported}} centres on {{the application}} of <b>cross</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> units to provide forced air flow over the radiator used for engine cooling. It is shown that a cooling {{system in which the}} airflow is ducted through the vehicle would lead to a significant reduction in vehicle drag. A ducted system allows more exact prediction of performance, and can be more easily designed in conjunction with across flow fan, that has rectangular inlet and outlet sections, and an ability to form 'S', 'L' and 'U' airflow geometries. This shape advantage of the <b>cross</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> also allows the use of radiators with a higher aspect ratio that could in turn permit lower bonnet lines on vehicles with a further reduction in aerodynamic drag. At higher vehicle speeds adequate cooling is usually provided by ram airflow through the cooling system. An airflow by-pass arrangement controlled by a balance valve has been devised and tested. The operation of this valve was found to be stable and smooth, and extremely beneficial in reducing the total system resistance and increasing fan performance under ram airflow conditions. A computer model has been developed and a programme produced to facilitate matching of the air circuit, fan and motor.

For the entire engine and all its components, a cycle model was established in order to derive realistic operating conditions for all components. The model was validated against experimental data taken by the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) at the aircrafts last shop visit at Lufthansa Technik. Furthermore the engines nacelle and major fan components including its disk, casing, Outlet Guide Vanes (OGV) and Booster-Inlet Guide Vanes (IGV) etc. were optically scanned and transferred to surfaced based CAD models in a reverse engineering approach to obtain the geometry in a most accurate manner. This allowed for dedicated CFD studies of the fan itself and by including the nacelle its interaction with ground induced inlet distortions at realistic engine operating conditions as being derived from the cycle analysis.

40|$|The <b>cross</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> {{consists}} of a cylindrical rotor closed at the ends with a cascade of axial blades around its curved surface. The rotor is mounted in a housing which defines the suction and discharge arcs. The housing extends {{the full length of}} the rotor and the throughflow is in a plane at right angles to the rotor axis. This fan is a unique type of turbo-machine which differs significantly from axial flow, centrifugal and mixed flow machines, in that each blade passage experiences a continuosly varying flow each time it makes a revolution through the flow field. In this thesis, experimental results are presented which describe the internal flow regime of a large <b>cross</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> of rotor length 1. 0 m and outside diameter 0, 625 m. Details of the flow field are examined for a range of dimensionless flow coefficient Ф between 0, 4 and 0. 8, which is taken to be the usual operating range for reasons of efficiency and stability of flow. The measurements are transformed into streamlines for the purpose of illustration and the corresponding variations of a dimensionless total pressure coefficient are also given. Flow visualization techniques have been applied to a dynamically similar model to a reduced scale of 1 : 6. 25 operating in water and photographs representing the flow have been examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. A Rankine-type vortex centered near the inner periphery is confirmed but the core was found to remain virtually stationary over the flow range investigated. The total pressure distribution indicates the spatial growth and weakened circulation of the forced vortex core as the flow rate reduces. A depression of total pressure has been identified in a region diametrically opposite the vortex core which intensifies as the flow rate increases. These data are broadly interpreted and are used to improve a previous theoretical model, in which the location of the vortex is used to define the operating point on the fan characteristic...|$|E

The Counter Flow Heat Recovery Fan (CHRF) provides the ability to meet these requirements by using only one <b>cross</b> <b>flow</b> <b>fan</b> {{with a large number}} of blades to generate both airflows and which simultaneously acts as a regenerative counter flow heat exchanger. The successful development of the first laboratory prototype has shown the potential of this ventilation system.

Hence the CHRF provides the possibility to avoid the need for frost protection and condensate drain. Through the implementation of system-specific solutions for flow balancing and summer bypass the required functionality is assured. The scalability of the CHRF concept allows the use in renovation as well as in new buildings from single-room devices through to systems for office buildings.

Cross Flow Fans (CFFs) are used in air conditioning and ventilation technology because of their compact design and low noise. In addition, CFFs can provide a uniform velocity profile along {{the width of the}} fan. This offers an enormous advantage in applications with large width to diameter ratios as needed. However, as the flow pattern inside a CFF is very complex, classical fan design is not applicable. At present, the design of CFFs is most often based on experimental investigation and empirical experience.
