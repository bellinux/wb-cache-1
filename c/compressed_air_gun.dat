40|$|Previous work {{showed that}} {{the total number of}} insects {{sticking}} to an aluminum surface was reduced by coating the aluminum surface with elastomers. Due to a large number of possible experimental errors, no correlation between the modulus of elasticity, the elastomer, and the total number of insects sticking to a given elastomer was obtained. One of the errors assumed to be introduced during the road test is a variable insect flux so the number of insects striking one surface might be different from that striking another sample. To eliminate this source of error, the road test used to collect insects was simulated in a laboratory by development of an insect impacting technique using a pipe and high pressure compressed air. The insects are accelerated by a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> to high velocities and are then impacted with a stationary target on which the sample is mounted. The velocity of an object exiting from the pipe was determined and further improvement of the technique was achieved to obtain a uniform air velocity distribution...|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{instability}} of early high explosives, it was impractical to fire an explosive-filled shell from a conventional gun. The violent deflagration of the propellant charge and the sudden acceleration of the shell would set off the explosive in {{the barrel of the}} weapon. By using <b>compressed</b> <b>air,</b> the dynamite <b>gun</b> was able to accelerate the projectile more gradually through the length of the barrel.|$|R
50|$|Multi-stroke {{pneumatic}} <b>air</b> <b>guns</b> {{require the}} pumping of an on-board lever to store <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> within the <b>gun.</b> Variable {{power can be}} achieved through this process, as the user can adapt the power level for long, or short-range shooting. This <b>air</b> <b>gun</b> are usually single-shot, which each shot requires approximately 5 strokes. However, up to five shots are possible, usually requiring around 10 to 20 strokes {{as long as the}} air reservoir is enough to store higher pressure. For safety reasons, most multi-stroke guns are usually designed to have its pump lever jammed when the reservoir has reached its maximum pressure limit, which the user can no longer pump the gun until it's discharged. The maximum pressure limit for the reservoir is approximately 20 to 30 strokes.|$|R
50|$|Prior to a {{test run}} commencing, a {{membrane}} separates the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> from the <b>gun</b> barrel breech. A rifle (or similar) {{is used to}} rupture the membrane. <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> rushes into the breech of the gun barrel, forcing a small projectile to accelerate rapidly down the barrel. Although the projectile is prevented from leaving the barrel, the air {{in front of the}} projectile emerges at hypersonic velocity into the working section. Naturally the duration of the test is extremely brief, so high speed instrumentation is required to get any meaningful data.|$|R
40|$|Orbital {{emphysema}} {{and associated}} pneumocephalus usually result from trauma to orbital bones or due to sinus disease, allowing air {{to travel from}} paranasal sinus into orbit and brain.

In our case, a young male was admitted with severe eye pain, diminution of vision due to sudden exposure of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun.</b> Examination revealed proptosed, emphysematous right eye with conjunctival laceration. Computed tomography scan of the head and orbit revealed multiple radiolucencies with air in the right orbit and brain extending up to the spinal canal without any evidence of orbital sinus or cranial bone fracture. Visual acuity recovered completely on follow–up; however, 2 weeks following injury, the patient developed disabling flashes of light which the patient perceived as central in location and resolved finally over a period of 3 months.

40|$|Carbon foam showed good {{ballistic}} performances {{for relatively}} small fragment impacts: low density samples (0. 56 g/cm 3 and 0. 24 g/cm 3) {{were able to}} stop {{and in some cases}} hold a 5 mm diameter stainless steel sphere shot at a speed up to 240 m/s by a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>gun.</b> The results were used to calibrate and benchmark an Ls-Dyna model which had to be based only on a few and easy-to-measure material parameters. Therefore, performing only static compressive loading characterization tests, a suitable cellular Ls-Dyna material model was chosen. To justify the promising energy dissipation results, which cannot only be due to the static performances, a strain rate dependency was supposed. Based on ceramic materials which have inhomogeneities of the same size of the foam pores, a strain rate law typical of these was applied. Similar relations were applied to both the foams, and a calibrating coefficient was made on a single impact velocity test. The same model was then used to reproduce the impact at different impact velocities and very good agreement between experimental results and simulation was achieved...|$|E

5000|$|He {{was the son}} of a vicar {{who became}} a school master in his mid-twenties. After writing {{freelance}} articles in his spare time, he joined a newspaper for a short spell, then authored a series of secular pamphlets including Ananias, The Atheist's God: For the Attention of Charles Bradlaugh. After the success of Admiral Philip H. Colomb's The Great War of 1892 (itself a version of the more famous The Battle of Dorking), Griffith, then on the staff of Pearson's Magazine as a clerk addressing envelopes and mailing labels, submitted a synopsis for a story entitled The Angel of the Revolution. It remains his best and most famous work. It was among the first of the so-called marvel tales, epitomised by Jules Verne. Marvel tales featured such things as heavier than <b>air</b> flying machines, <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>guns,</b> submarines, profoundly convenient political developments, wooden heroes with no readily apparent sexual tastes, and spectacular aerial combat along with other forms of combat, such as battle under the sea. Later novels, such as 'The Gold Finder' developed the heroes' romantic interests. His short stories were very similar to the future war tales of George Chesney and his imitators along with the political utopianism of William Morris's News from Nowhere. He wrote a sequel, serialised as The Syren of the Skies in Pearson's Magazine. It was later published as a novel titled with the name of its main character, Olga Romanoff. Although overshadowed by H. G. Wells in the United States, Griffith's epic fantasies of romantic utopians in a future world of war, dominated by airship battle fleets, and grandiose engineering provided a template for steampunk novels a century before the term was coined. Michael Moorcock claims that the works of George Griffith had a dramatic impact on his own writing. The concept of revolutionaries imposing [...] "a pax aeronautica over the earth", at the center of Angel of the Revolution, was taken up by Wells many years later, in The Shape of Things to Come. Wells himself once wrote that Griffith's Outlaws of the Air was an [...] "aeronautical classic." ...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{findings}} in other research areas it was reasoned that water slugs of substantial size (up to 1 / 2 lb) traveling at moderate velocities (< 800 fps) could impinge on rock with fragmenting pressure. To substantiate this reasoning, a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> launching <b>gun</b> {{was designed and}} built and an extensive series of impact tests was made on a steel-mounted pressure transducer and on sandstone and limestone targets. In a very few tests pressure values measured on the steel target exceeded the nominal compressive load limits of the rocks, but on actual rock targets significant fragmentation failed to occur. The basic difficulty was related to an inability to maintain a suitable air-water interface on a traveling water slug containing high kinetic energy. This, together with higher-than-anticipated dynamic failure values in the rook, prevented effective fragmentation. Pilot tests which replaced the water with spherical slugs of steel (3 / 16 to 2 in. diam.) resulted in spalling fragmentation and excellent specific energy values. Minimum values of specific energy appeared to occur with velocities below 500 fps. However, the evidence for the 2 -inch spheres was limited {{by the fact that}} the 12 -inch target cubes (sandstone, granite, basalt) shattered at velocities below 400 fps. The tests suggest that moderate-velocity large slugs of water are not satisfactory for fragmentation of rock, but heavy large-sized solid impactors are very effective at moderate velocities.
