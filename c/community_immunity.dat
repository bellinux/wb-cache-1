In a population in which a large number of individuals are immune, chains of infection are likely to be disrupted, which stops or slows the spread of disease.

If {{the vast majority of the}} population is immune to a particular agent, the ability of that pathogen to infect another host is reduced; the cycle of transmission is interrupted, and the pathogen cannot reproduce and dies out. This concept, called <b>community</b> <b>immunity</b> or herd immunity, is important to disease eradication, because it means that it is not necessary to inoculate 100% of the population—a goal that is often logistically very difficult—to achieve the desired result.

In our study, we used Illumina MiSeq sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR to compare the microbial <b>community</b> and <b>immunity</b> genes expression in the foregut, midgut and hindgut of Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). Our results indicated that the community richness of the midgut is higher than in the foregut or the hindgut, although the bacterial diversity in the hindgut is higher. The predominant phyla were Tenericutes and Firmicutes in the foregut, Tenericutes and Proteobacteria in the midgut and Proteobacteria, Tenericutes and Bacteroidetes in the hindgut. When compared with the midgut, the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were significantly elevated in the hindgut (P[*]<[*] 0.05), and the gene expression of EsRelish (IMD pathway) was higher than the Toll signaling pathway genes. Actinobacteria and Lactobacillus had negative correlationship with the expression of AMPs, although Acinetobacter, Bacteroides, Flavobacterium can up-regulate the expression of AMP genes. Collectively, our data indicate that microbiota are site-specific within the digestive tracts of crabs and the bacterial <b>community</b> and intestinal <b>immunity</b> have a close relationship in E. sinensis.|$|R

40|$|The measles {{outbreak}} of early 2015 {{is symptomatic of}} a larger societal problem–the growing number of parents who decide against vaccinating their children. This failure is causing the resurgence of childhood diseases once eliminated from the United States. This article explores the legal and ethical landscape of vaccine exemptions. While all states require childhood vaccinations, they differ significantly {{in the types of}} religious and/or philosophical exemptions permitted, the rigor of the application process, and available review mechanisms. States with relaxed exemption policies disproportionately experience more outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease. Vaccine exemptions are an illustration of the “tragedy of the commons,” in which parents choose not to vaccinate their children, relying on the fact that other parents will vaccinate their children, thus providing <b>community</b> <b>immunity.</b> However, the net result of many individual decisions not to vaccinate is the collapse of herd immunity and thus an upsurge in preventable disease and death. The failure to vaccinate puts others at risk, thus violating an important ethical principle. However, punishing individual parents could entrench political opposition to vaccine policy. The most ethical and effective solution is for state legislatures to tighten vaccination laws, making it more difficult to obtain non-medical exemptions...|$|E

Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews in 3 cystic fibrosis referral centres in Paris, France. The study included 42 patients with cystic fibrosis: 24 who refused the vaccine and 18 who were vaccinated. The two groups differed quite substantially in their perceptions of vaccine- and disease-related risks. Those who refused the vaccine were motivated mainly by the fears it aroused and did not explicitly consider the 2009 A/H 1 N 1 flu a potentially severe disease. People who were vaccinated explained their choice, first and foremost, as intended to prevent the flu’s potential consequences on respiratory cystic fibrosis disease. Moreover, they considered vaccination to be an indirect collective prevention tool. Patients who refused the vaccine mentioned multiple, contradictory information sources and {{did not appear to}} consider the recommendation of their local health care provider as predominant. On the contrary, those who were vaccinated stated that they had based their decision solely on the clear and unequivocal advice of their health care provider. Conclusions/Significance: These results of our survey led us to formulate three main recommendations for improving adhesion to new pandemic vaccines. (1) it appears necessary to reinforce patient education about the disease and its specific risks, but also general population information about <b>community</b> <b>immunity.</b> (2) it is essential to disseminate a clear and effective message about the safety of novel vaccines.

This project collected data on the local level to determine the degree of impact of low vaccination rates and segregated housing on African Americans in Southwest Michigan. Data regarding flu and pneumonia immunization status was collected from 816 residents in 13 nursing homes (NH) and homes for the aged (HFA) in two southwest Michigan counties. The populations of African Americans in the NH and HFA was much less dense than the population of African Americans in the counties where the nursing homes were found suggesting no potential increase risk on the basis of segregated housing for the erosion of <b>community</b> <b>immunity</b> at this local level.

The results of the investigations showed that the AFP patient, an unimmunized 10 -year-old boy, and five laboratory-confirmed contacts {{lived in the same}} village; one contact lived in a neighboring village. Only ∼ 27 % of children 5 to 10 years of age in the affected villages had received three or more doses of the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the cVDPV isolates differed from the Sabin 1 (S 1) isolate at 1. 4 to 2. 2 % of VP 1 nucleotide positions and shared 12 nucleotide substitutions within VP 1. All isolates were S 1 /S 2 /S 1 /S 3 recombinants sharing common recombination junctions. Key determinants of attenuation were replaced. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the cVDPV circulated locally for ∼ 12 months following the initiating OPV dose.

40|$|Schools {{are known}} to play a {{significant}} role in the spread of influenza. High vaccination coverage can reduce infectious disease spread within schools and the wider <b>community</b> through vaccine-induced <b>immunity</b> in vaccinated individuals and through the indirect effects afforded by herd immunity. In general, herd immunity is greatest when vaccination coverage is highest, but clusters of unvaccinated individuals can reduce herd immunity. Here, we empirically assess the extent of such clustering by measuring whether vaccinated individuals are randomly distributed or demonstrate positive assortativity across a United States high school contact network. Using computational models based on these empirical measurements, we further assess the impact of assortativity on influenza disease dynamics. We found that the contact network was positively assortative with respect to influenza vaccination: unvaccinated individuals tended to be in contact more often with other unvaccinated individuals than with vaccinated individuals, and these effects were most pronounced when we analyzed contact data collected over multiple days. Of note, unvaccinated males contributed substantially more than unvaccinated females towards the measured positive vaccination assortativity. Influenza simulation models using a positively assortative network resulted in larger average outbreak size, and outbreaks were more likely, compared to an otherwise identical network where vaccinated individuals were not clustered.

40|$|With {{the spread}} of {{chloroquine}} resistant Plasmodium falciparum the control of malaria has become increasingly complex. In recent years, particular concern has arisen over how best to prevent malaria in non-immune international travellers. Prior to {{the recognition of the}} potential toxicity of some antimalarial drugs, malaria preventive guidelines switched from chloroquine to the newer compound antimalarial drugs and to amodiaquine; this adjustment was made when sentinel cases alerted clinicians that breakthrough infections occurred in travellers to East Africa taking chloroquine prophylaxis. Changes were also supported by data derived from field studies illustrating the effectiveness of these drugs for therapy in indigenous populations. However, international studies have now documented serious adverse reactions to pyrimethamine/dapsone, pyrimethamine/sulphadoxine, and amodiaquine, and caution is required with their use. Rates in British users concur with international estimates. Specialists preparing malaria preventive guidelines have, therefore, preferred to recommend the use of relatively safe antimalarial drugs, like chloroquine and proguanil, provided they offer non-immune travellers adequate protection against P. falciparum infections. Substantial difficulty has arisen, however, in the definition of 'adequate protection'. Field studies in indigenous <b>communities</b> with partial <b>immunity</b> can provide concise biological measures of parasite resistance to drugs.

40|$|Introduction: Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} airways. It {{is the most common}} chronic disease of childhood and the leading cause of hospitalization among children. Asthma is a complex disease with genetic, developmental, and environmental factors contributing to the disease pathogenicity. The rapid increase in asthma rates in the last several decades has led us to focus on the environmental component in asthma. Children who grow up on small traditional family farms are protected against asthma and allergies. The asthma rates among the European farmers and non-farmers are recapitulated in two US based populations, Indiana Amish and South Dakota Hutterites. The two populations share similar farming lifestyles, have large families, have similar diets, and share a common ancestry. These two communities part {{in the way in which}} they farm. The Amish practice traditional, small single family farming, while the Hutterites use state of the art technology in their highly mechanized farms that are located at the edges of their colonies. Amish are strongly protected against asthma, while Hutterites have rates that are comparable to the ones in the general population. We hypothesized that environmental exposures impact innate immune responses leading to decreased asthma risk. Methods: We utilized murine models of experimental asthma to determine the effects of aqueous extracts prepared from barn and house dust samples collected from Amish and Hutterite farms. Results: Amish house dust extract reduced OVA-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation and serum IgE, while Hutterite house dust extract did not. Administration of Amish dust extract to mice lacking MyD 88 and TRIF, adaptors for TLR signaling, resulted in the abrogation of the protective effect seen in wild type animals. Investigation of the effects of Hutterite barn dust extract revealed that this extract was able to reduce house dust mite induced airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation to a degree comparable to Amish barn extract. Furthermore, a time-course analysis showed that the effects of the extracts became apparent after twelve days and include increases in airway inflammatory markers. Flow cytometry analysis of total lung cells revealed an increase in CD 3 +RORγt+γδcells that was accompanied by an increase in IL 17 expression. Lastly, transfer of gut microbiota from a healthy Amish child to germ free mice led to a time-dependent decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness and IL 13 expression in the lungs. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that Amish and Hutterite environmental products are sufficient to recapitulate profiles of asthma susceptibility seen among Amish and Hutterite children, therefore demonstrating that the environment plays an important role in asthma susceptibility in this <b>communities.</b> Innate <b>immunity</b> plays an essential role in mediating the protective effects of Amish dust extracts.

Measles typically is a disease that mainly affects children. We investigated a community outbreak in 2014 with measles virus transmission among adults without children serving as virus reservoirs. Our investigation highlights adult susceptibility to measles. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective active case search, and analyzed confirmed case data to describe person, place, and time characteristics of the outbreak. All individuals with measles with onset during the first 2 months of the outbreak were interviewed face-to-face to determine source(s) of infection and transmission route (from whom and to whom). ResultsAmong the 280 cases, 220 (77. 6 %) were among ≥ 20 -year-old adults, 24 (8. 6 %) were among 8 – 23 month olds, 22 (7. 9 %) were among < 8 -month-old infants, and the remaining 14 (5. 9 %) were among 2 – 19 year olds. Of the 83 cases in the early stage of the outbreak, 41 (49. 4 %) were acquired in the community, 24 (28. 9 %) were acquired nosocomially, 13 (15. 7 %) were acquired by family contact, and 5 were imported. Among 44 clearly determined transmission linkages, 37 (84. 1 %) were adult to other age-group (these include 29 adult-to-adult, seven adult-to-child, and one adult-to-infant), six were from infants to adult and children, and one was child-to-child. Outbreak response immunization activities were implemented by non-selective supplementary immunization activities, with 51. 3 % of targeted 5 – 19 -year-old children and adolescents, and 30. 2 % of targeted 20 – 49 -year-old adults being vaccinated.
