50|$|One {{method of}} {{drastically}} reducing <b>shift</b> <b>time</b> {{is to use}} a direct-shift gearbox which has two independent clutches that predict the next gear change making the <b>shift</b> <b>time</b> very small. Using a freewheel may reduce <b>shift</b> <b>time</b> as it may not be necessary to use the clutch. A shift kit is also intended to reduce the <b>shift</b> <b>time</b> of a manual vehicle.In simple terms, a DSG is two separate manual gearboxes (and clutches), contained within one housing, and working as one unit.It was designed by BorgWarner,and was initially licensed to the Volkswagen Group, with support by IAV GmbH.needed By using two independent clutches, a DSG can achieve faster <b>shift</b> <b>times</b> (8ms), and eliminates the torque converter of a conventional epicyclic automatic transmission.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the control {{strategy}} of <b>shifting</b> <b>time</b> involving multigroup clutches for a hydromechanical continuously variable transmission (HMCVT). The dynamic analyses of mathematical models are presented in this paper, and the simulation models are used to study the control strategy of HMCVT. Simulations are performed in Simulation X platform to investigate the <b>shifting</b> <b>time</b> of clutches under different operating conditions. On this basis, simulation analysis and test verification of two typical conditions, which play the decisive roles for the shifting quality, are carried out. The results show that {{there are differences in}} the <b>shifting</b> <b>time</b> of the two typical conditions. In the shifting process from the negative transmission of hydromechanical ranges to the positive transmission of hydromechanical ranges, the control strategy based on the <b>shifting</b> <b>time</b> is switching the clutches of shifting mechanism firstly and then disengaging a group of clutches of planetary gear mechanism and engaging another group of the clutches of planetary gear mechanism lastly.

40|$|The {{tractive}} force {{has to be}} interrupted during a gear-shifting operation in a manual vehicle transmission, leading into a decrease of speed while changing gears during the acceleration process. Therefore in a racing application, the <b>shifting</b> <b>time</b> has to be as short as possible so that the required performance of a racing car can be achieved. The following dissertation describes {{the development of a}} transmission control system to enable gear changes within a manual gearbox, which was designed for the Formula Student racing series. Various solutions were developed on the basis of reviewed literature, technical data of components and experiences of Formula Student teams. Following this, a comparison of the concepts by means of a utility analysis identified the pneumatic actuation of selector forks to be the most suitable concept. This was mainly due to the expected <b>shifting</b> <b>time,</b> the weight, and its advantageous energy supply requirement. After the selection of the actuators and the position sensors, the system was implemented into the drivetrain to check the tment and the technical feasibility. To draw conclusions regarding the <b>shifting</b> <b>time</b> and to prove the functionality of the system, an open test bench was constructed. Additionally, the hardware and software had to be developed to enable the test run. After the manufacturing and assembling of the test bench, the optimal settings for the test run were determined. By comparing the achieved <b>shifting</b> <b>time</b> of alternative solutions, an improvement in the driving performance of a Formula Student race car is probable...|$|R

The sequence of <b>time</b> <b>shifts</b> computed by this method are a globally optimal solution to a non-linear optimization problem with linear inequality constraints that may be directly related to subsurface properties.

40|$|The {{validity}} {{and accuracy of}} television programme ratings are critical to media planners and broadcasters alike. Media planners use ratings to select programmes that will satisfy certain reach and frequency objectives, which in turn contribute to an advertising campaign's overall goals. Broadcasters deliver audiences to advertisers, and base programme scheduling and pricing decisions on ratings data. At present, ratings are delivered within 24 hours of viewing and do not include adjustments for <b>time</b> <b>shift</b> viewing. <b>Time</b> <b>shifting</b> occurs when a television programme is videotaped and replayed at a later date. Given that VCR penetration in New Zealand has increased to over 75 percent of households, {{it is clear that}} programme ratings may be higher than the current overnight ratings suggest. This thesis explored the extent and measurement of <b>time</b> <b>shifting</b> in New Zealand. More specifically, it used AGB McNair's people meter data to examine: the scale of <b>time</b> <b>shifting,</b> the current methods of measuring <b>time</b> <b>shifting,</b> and future methods of estimating <b>time</b> <b>shift</b> viewing. The study aimed to identify whether patterns of <b>time</b> <b>shifting</b> behaviour exist, and whether these patterns could be used to model more inclusive overnight ratings. The findings suggest that, although the overall effect of <b>time</b> <b>shifting</b> on programme ratings is small, some programmes have very high levels of <b>time</b> <b>shift</b> viewing, prompting the need to include <b>time</b> <b>shift</b> viewing in the overnight ratings. The main constraint impeding the inclusion of VCR ratings in the overnight ratings is the difficulty in estimating <b>time</b> <b>shift</b> audiences overnight. This study proposed a number of methods of estimating VCR ratings overnight, including the recording level adjustment method, the same day playback adjustment method, and the genre/station correction method. While further research is required to compare the predictive ability of the methods, in the meantime implementing any of the methods is likely to provide more accurate overnight estimates of total audiences...|$|R

Then, we present a extremely low-rate (single packet) denial-of-service attack that an off-path attacker, located anywhere on the network, can use to disable NTP clock synchronization on a client.

We discuss the implications on these attacks on other core Internet protocols, quantify their attack surface using Internet measurements, and suggest a few simple countermeasures that can improve the security of NTP.
