We have identified 49 <b>cosmids</b> (9 % of those tested) that contain multiple rare restriction-endonuclease sites. The <b>cosmids</b> were digested with several common cutting restriction endonucleases to liberate small fragments which were tested as unique-sequence chromosome 3 -specific hybridization probes and for evolutionary sequence conservation. Unique-sequence hybridization probes isolated from the <b>cosmids</b> were hybridized to a somatic cell hybrid deletion mapping panel to subchromosomally localize the <b>cosmids.</b> Fragments from many of these <b>cosmids</b> demonstrated conservation of sequence through evolution, and these fragments hybridize to distinct transcripts.

The lateral transfer of DNA from the mitochondria to the nucleus {{appears to be a}} continuing process and is more frequent in plants than in animals. Our laboratory has documented extensive variation in the nuclear-mitochondrial sequences (NUMTs) among maize inbred lines using total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as probes onto mitotic metaphase chromosomes, a technique known as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The mitochondrial genome has been cloned into 20 <b>cosmids,</b> which were used to examine the insertions of individual segments. The focus of the current study was to use FISH with the 20 individual mtDNA-containing <b>cosmids</b> to locate mtDNA within the nuclear chromosomes of the Mo 17 inbred line of maize and to compare these locations with those of the B 73 line. We studied Mo 17 because this line and its derivatives are used in crosses with B 73 -derived lines to create the most commonly used corn hybrids. Fifteen NUMTs had been detected on the Mo 17 chromosomes using a mixture of 19 mtDNA-containing <b>cosmids.</b> However, only nine of the 15 NUMTs were seen when applying individual mtDNA-containing <b>cosmids,</b> suggesting that the portions of nuclear DNA corresponding to the individual mtDNA-containing <b>cosmids</b> were too small to be detected until many <b>cosmids</b> were combined. A large NUMT was previously detected on the long arm of chromosome 9 by 14 of the 20 individually tested <b>cosmids</b> in the B 73 inbred line. However, a NUMT present at the same site in Mo 17 was detected by only 2 of the 20 <b>cosmids</b> (5 and 20).
