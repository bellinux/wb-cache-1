In order to control these {{cloud services}}, we need to monitor and control the various units deployed across multiple clouds, dealing with cloud-specific protocols to support an end-to-end cloud service perspective. In this paper we present an approach for multi-cloud control, which evaluates relationships among different units deployed across heterogeneous clouds, and generates action plans necessary for <b>controlling</b> <b>service</b> elasticity. We show experiments of the end-to-end control and sensitivity analysis for a service deployed across {{two different types of}} clouds. Keywords—multi-cloud, end-to-end, elasticity control I...|$|E

To Internet telephony, this is an issue of vital importance to become accepted by users accustomed to the high reliability of traditional, circuit switched telephony. Currently, there are many proposals on mechanisms inside the network for <b>controlling</b> <b>service</b> quality.

A prototype system has been implemented, which may be used as a simulation tool for further research and development. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

We have established large-scale virtualized data-center to meet this requirement. To provide efficient and reliable services to all its user data centers consumes large amount of computation power. Due to large consumption of electrical energy has increased cost for the service provider as well as service users. Large consumption of electrical energy Couse large amount of carbon dioxide to emitted, due to this global warming is affected. We concluded that, from our studies we can reduced the power consumption by live migration of the Virtual machine (VM) by turning off idle machines. To fulfill this entire requirement we proposed a dynamic threshold based approach for CPU utilization for host at data center. This will work on dynamic and unpredictable workload to avoid unnecessary power consumption. Because of this we will achieve energy efficiency with quality of service to the user by <b>controlling</b> <b>service</b> level Agreement violation (SLA...|$|E
