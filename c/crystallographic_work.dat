40|$|International audienceWe report {{here the}} {{substitution}} of Se by Te in the Mott insulator GaTa 4 Se 8 -yTey, a lacunar spinel compound containing Ta 4 tetrahedral clusters. Our synthetic and <b>crystallographic</b> <b>works</b> show that Te atoms occupy successively two different crystallographic sites and that the substitution reaches a limit for GaTa 4 Se 1. 5 Te 6. 5. Band structure calculations and transport measurements demonstrate that this substitution induces for low Te doping (0 ≤ y ≤ 4) an increase of the band gap related to a narrowing of the d bands (i. e., a negative chemical pressure effect). Conversely, for higher Te doping (y ≥ 4), a decrease of the band gap is observed, while the bandwidth of the d bands stays almost constant. This result suggests that the partial declusterization of Ta 4 tetrahedra observed at high Te doping (y ≥ 4) leads to a very unusual reduction of the electronic repulsion energy (U) that opens {{the gap between the}} lower and upper Hubbard bands. The GaTa 4 Se 8 -yTey compounds therefore provide, to our knowledge, the first example of a U-controlled tuning of electronic properties in a Mott insulator. Moreover, we show that {{the substitution of}} Se by Te in GaTa 4 Se 8 -yTey does not affect drastically the reversible and nonvolatile electric pulse-induced resistive switching phenomena discovered recently in the nonsubstituted compound GaTa 4 Se 8...|$|R

In their physiologically relevant, magnesium-complexed form, tetracyclines induce allosteric rearrangements in the TetR homodimer, leading to its {{release from the}} promoter and derepression of transcription. According to earlier <b>crystallographic</b> <b>work,</b> recognition of the tetracycline-associated magnesium ion by TetR is crucial and triggers the allosteric cascade. Nevertheless, the derivative 5 a, 6 -anhydrotetracycline, which shows an increased affinity for TetR, causes promoter release {{even in the absence}} of magnesium. To resolve this paradox, it has been proposed that metal-free 5 a, 6 -anhydrotetracycline acts via an exceptional, conformationally different induction mode that circumvents the normal magnesium requirement. We have tested this hypothesis by determining crystal structures of TetR– 5 a, 6 -anhydrotetracycline complexes in the presence of magnesium, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or high concentrations of potassium. Analysis of these three structures reveals that, irrespective of the metal, the effects of 5 a, 6 -anhydrotetracycline binding are indistinguishable from those of canonical induction by other tetracyclines.

More recently, this adduct found independent <b>crystallographic</b> support in <b>work</b> on formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, work which further found evidence of the same adduct on re-examination of deposited electron densities of ALDH 2. Although the experimental data showed that this adduct was reversible, several mechanistic questions arise {{from the fact that}} it forms at all. Here, we present results from further quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations toward understanding the mechanistic implications of adduct formation. These simulations revealed formation of the oxyanion thiohemiacetal intermediate only when the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ is oriented away from the active site, contrary to prior arguments. In contrast, and in seeming paradox, when NAD is oriented to receive the hydride, disassociation of the oxyanion intermediate to form the dead-end adduct is more thermodynamically favored than maintaining the oxyanion intermediate necessary for catalysis to proceed. However, this disassociation to the adduct could be avoided through proton transfer from the enzyme to the intermediate.

We apply a combination of micro-Raman spectroscopy, electron beam induced current, defect etching and electron backscatter diffraction techniques that enables us to correlate internal stresses, recombination activity and microstructure on the micrometer scale. The stress fields of defect structures {{are considered to be}} too small (several tens of MPa) to influence directly the electrical activity, but they can enhance it via stress-induced accumulation of metallic impurities. It is commonly found that not all recombination-active dislocations on grain boundaries (GBs) and within grains are accompanied by internal stresses. The {{reason for this is that}} dislocations interact with each other and tend to locally rearrange in configurations of minimum strain energy in which their stress fields can cancel partially, totally or not at all. The outcome is a nonuniform distribution of electrical activity and internal stresses along the same GB, along different GBs of similar character as well as inside the same grain and inside different grains of similar <b>crystallographic</b> orientations. Our <b>work</b> has implications for developing crystal growth procedures that may lead to reduced internal stresses and consequently to improved electrical quality and mechanical stability of mc-Si materials by means of controlled interaction between structural defects.

40|$|The {{structure}} of rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b, an important regulatory enzyme in glycogen metabolism, {{has been studied}} by X-ray <b>crystallographic</b> techniques. This <b>work</b> was carried out {{as part of a}} group project, and the crystal {{structure of}} the enzyme had already been solved to 3 Å resolution, using the technique of Multiple Isomorphous Replacement. A search for additional heavy atom isomorphous derivatives was carried out, and photographic data to 3 Å resolution were collected for a further ethylmercurythiosalicylate derivative, using a screenless oscillation camera. The collection and reduction of this data, and the refinement of the heavy atom positions is described. The inclusion of this data allowed a new electron density map (with figure of merit = O. 63) to be calculated, which enabled previously ambiguous areas in the electron density to be interpreted. Data to 2 Å resolution have been collected on an oscillation camera, using a synchrotron radiation source and cylindrical film cassettes. An intensity gain of up to 13 O times, compared to a GX 6 rotating anode source, was obtained with the synchrotron radiation source. A reduction in radiation damage, was also observed. The collection and reduction of the 2 Å data is described. The final overall merging R-factor was 15 %. Some systematic errors remain in the data, and possible sources of these errors are discussed, and improvements to the data processing procedure suggested. The 2 Å data were empirically scaled to the 3 Å data and have been used in the first stages of the refinement of the phosphorylase b structure. The contribution of the crystallographic results towards an understanding of phosphorylase b as an allosteric protein is discussed. </p...|$|R

Previous solid- and solution-state research, focusing on hydrogen-bonded C-alkylpyrogallol[4]arenes (PgC 6) nanocapsules, have shed light on the host-guest-relationship potential of these materials. Investigations of these nanocapsules with different fluorophores were undertaken to better understand the guest properties (e. g., size, shape, molecular volume, and functionality) needed to facilitate robust encapsulation. In addition, another relatively new nanocapsule containing metal ions in place of some of the hydrogen bonds was also examined. UV-Visible absorption and steady-state and dynamic fluorescence spectroscopic techniques were used to examine the host-guest interactions between the capsule interior and the fluorescent reporter molecule pyrene butanol that became encapsulated in the PgC 6 nanocapsule. Solution-state spectroscopic data was compared with solid-state, single-crystal, X-ray <b>crystallographic</b> results. This <b>work</b> supported the hypothesis that the tail functionality of the encapsulated guest is a critical feature for encapsulation and potentially ensures the robustness of that association. The research laid the foundation for understanding how to achieve successful encapsulation of future entities. The work advanced the understanding of the goodness-of-fit criterion between guest and host for these PgC 6 supramolecular, self-assemblies...|$|R
