25|$|Upon Bangladesh's independence, {{the value}} of the Bangladeshi taka was set between ৳7.5 and ৳8.0 to US$1. Except for fiscal year 1978, the taka's value {{relative}} to the US dollar declined every year from 1971 through the end of 1987. To help offset this phenomenon, Bangladesh first used the <b>compensatory</b> <b>financing</b> <b>facility</b> of the International Monetary Fund in fiscal year 1974. Despite the increasing need for assistance, the Mujib government was initially unwilling to meet the IMF's conditions on monetary and fiscal policy. By fiscal year 1975, however, the government revised its stance, declaring a devaluation of the taka by 56 percent and agreeing to establishing the Bangladesh Aid Group by the World Bank.|$|E
50|$|The {{transformation}} of finance priorities has {{brought with it}} problems in administration. No sound project-appraisal system was in place to identify viable borrowers and projects. Lending institutions did not have adequate autonomy to choose borrowers and projects and were often instructed by the political authorities. In addition, the incentive system for the banks stressed disbursements rather than recoveries, and the accounting and debt collection systems were inadequate {{to deal with the}} problems of loan recovery. It became more common for borrowers to default on loans than to repay them; the lending system was simply disbursing grant assistance to private individuals who qualified for loans more for political than for economic reasons. The rate of recovery on agricultural loans was only 27 percent in FY 1986, and the rate on industrial loans was even worse. As a result of this poor showing, major donors applied pressure to induce the government and banks to take firmer action to strengthen internal bank management and credit discipline. As a consequence, recovery rates began to improve in 1987. The National Commission on Money, Credit, and Banking recommended broad structural changes in Bangladesh's system of financial intermediation early in 1987, many of which were built into a three-year <b>compensatory</b> <b>financing</b> <b>facility</b> signed by Bangladesh with the IMF in February 1987.|$|E
50|$|However, {{from the}} very beginning, Kafka {{made it clear that}} he was not going to focus {{narrowly}} on relations between his constituency and the Fund. Rather, he was going to speak out for the interests of the developing world and make sure that their voices were heard. In 1966, the <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Financing</b> <b>Facility</b> (CFF) was just beginning to be a major source of financing for commodity-exporting countries. Some of his earliest interventions aimed to strengthen its role. Throughout his tenure on the Board, he fought to expand the usefulness of the CFF and to prevent it from being reduced to a standard conditional facility. In the 1960s, he helped formulate the special drawing rights (SDR) system in a way that would benefit developing as well as industrial countries. In the 1970s, he was instrumental in the creation and design of the Extended Fund Facility, and he helped build a consensus for the oil facilities of 1974 and 1975. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, he served as Vice-Chairman of the Deputies of the Committee of Twenty, the forerunner of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC). In the 1980s, he stressed the importance of enlarged access to Fund resources, insisted that the international debt crisis could not be solved until the developed countries assumed more responsibility for it, and worked for the creation and expansion of concessional lending facilities for low-income countries. In the 1990s, he continued to advocate systemic solutions to the problems of the developing world, through innovations such as the HIPC Initiative.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} to the competitiveness of sustainable economic development is a country's global economic position. Small and medium industries, supposed to be drivers of economic development of a country, receive much of negative impact following the global economic uncertainty environment. This includes facing increasingly critical financial facilities. This study seeks to analyze the empirical relationship between small and medium industries and the <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> in the short-run and long-run {{in the state of}} Sabah, Malaysia. The ARDL bound testing approach was applied, using annual time series data for the years between 1976 through 2005. The successes of small and medium industries have been related to availability of <b>financing</b> <b>facilities.</b> Results show that the relationships between small and medium industries and <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> seem to exist in the long-run. In addition, there is a causal relation between small and medium industries and financial loan. The conclusion is that <b>financing</b> <b>facilities</b> {{may not be the most}} important factor in the development of small and medium scale industries, but small and medium industries on the other hand functions as the paramount important factor in the development of <b>financing</b> <b>facilities.</b> SMI, <b>Financing</b> <b>facilities,</b> ARDL, Sabah...|$|R

To {{determine the extent}} to which the facility served its intended purpose of stabilizing foreign exchange earnings of member countries experiencing temporary export shortfalls, a methodology is developed for evaluating the CFF's stabilizing role. The evidence is used to evaluate the facility's role in stabilizing demand for international reserves and its contribution to net welfare gain. The results suggest the CFF has helped stabilize earnings, and net benefits from its use have been substantial. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to examine the}} concept of the New International Economic Order. This was done by providing a back ground statement; examining the legality of the concept; discussing the various elements defining the concept; and describing the following quantitative issues affecting the movement—compensation, borrowing rule, <b>compensatory</b> <b>financing</b> <b>facility,</b> conditionality, emergency fund, structural adjustment facility and buffer stocks. The thesis relied on a literature survey of the material on the NIEO to attain the objective. The following components of the Botswana National Develop ment Plan were examined {{in the context of the}} developing world order [...] the debt problem, mineral development, economic growth, industry and commerce, regional cooperation, agriculture, structural adjustment, and economic liberalization. The paper draws the following conclusions: 1) Developing countries have fallen into debt and continue to do so. 2) Developing countries have not been able to diversify their economies. 3) Economic growth as was experienced during the development decade has been reversed and stagnation has set in. 4) The necessary industrialization of the developing countries that was anticipated has not occurred. 5) Free trade has not been achieved even though both developed and developing countries agree on the concept. 6) Regional efforts to foster economic cooperation and develop ment have had discouraging results...|$|E
40|$|The IMF’s {{primary purpose}} in lending to its member {{countries}} {{is to provide}} short-term balance of payments assistance. The preceding two chapters have described how the Fund’s policies evolved to help ensure that borrowers would adjust their policies to restore viability to their economies and external accounts, and how special lending operations were developed to handle the problems of lowincome countries. Now the focus shifts to the other special windows that provided assistance in particular circumstances during the 1980 s. First, the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) —the most general of these windows, established in 1974 —offered countries the option of longer-term credits. Second, the <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Financing</b> <b>Facility</b> (CFF) —the oldest special window, established in 1963 —offered credits {{to compensate for the}} effects of temporary fluctuations in the value of exports or imports. The 1988 successor to the CFF, the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF), also provided incremental financing in case of certain unforeseeable events. Third, the Buffer Stock Financing Facility (BSFF) began in 1969 to offer credits to assist countries participating in specified international arrangements for marketing primary commodities. Fourth, although no separate facility was ever created for the purpose, the Fund has on numerous occasions since the early 1960 s provided emergency financing to countries hit by natural disasters. Each of these operations is reviewed in the following sections of this chapter. (For a complete summary of the Fund’s lending operations in the 1980 s, se...|$|E

40|$|The {{supply of}} {{external}} financing {{to developing countries}} generally tends to increase in periods when export earnings are booming and thus, in periods of increasing government revenues. Conversely, Stabex and IMF <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Financing</b> transfers are primarily designed {{to take place in}} response to a fall in export earnings, and thus, in periods when government revenues are decreasing. However, these transfers occur in an unsteady way with respect to the cycle of government revenues. When occurring in periods of decreasing government revenues, only Stabex transfers are used to finance additional primary expenditures (i. e. expenditures other than interest on public debt). This effect contrasts with the effects usually reported for other instruments of external financing. In periods of increasing government revenues, Stabex and <b>Compensatory</b> <b>Financing</b> transfers have no impact on fiscal deficit. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

Second, the facility was faulty in design - in terms of sectors targeted, pricing of instruments, and consistency of objectives, and instruments.
