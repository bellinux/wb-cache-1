50|$|Generally {{the tubes}} {{are made of}} {{stainless}} steel, copper alloys such as brass or bronze, <b>cupro</b> nickel, or titanium depending on several selection criteria. The use of copper bearing alloys such as brass or <b>cupro</b> nickel is rare in new plants, due to environmental concerns of toxic copper alloys. Also depending on the steam cycle water treatment for the boiler, it may be desirable to avoid tube materials containing copper. Titanium condenser tubes are usually the best technical choice, however the use of titanium condenser tubes has been virtually eliminated by the sharp increases in the costs for this material. The tube lengths range to about 85 ft (26 m) for modern power plants, {{depending on the size}} of the condenser. The size chosen is based on transportability from the manufacturers’ site and ease of erection at the installation site. The outer diameter of condenser tubes typically ranges from 3/4 inch to 1-1/4 inch, based on condenser cooling water friction considerations and overall condenser size.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} reduce the {{co-evaporation}} time of Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 (CIGSe) thin film absorber, a sequential approach has been investigated. CIGSe layers have been grown using the three-step based <b>CUPRO</b> (Cu-Poor/Rich/Off) process at substrate temperature of 600 and 500 ^oC. The first step consists in the growth of Cu-poor ([Cu]/[In+Ga]= 0. 9) precursor layers. This paper aims at investigating the impact of this layer deposition duration on the CIGSe and respective solar cell properties. It is observed that for the two substrate temperatures investigated, the morphological and structural properties of the CIGSe layers do not change with increasing precursor deposition speed, even when it is increased by ten. Furthermore, the respective device performance also appears not affected by this reduction of the precursor growth time; all cells demonstrate 15 % efficiency. From this work, the duration of our standard deposition process could be decreased from 23 to 14 min without performance loss independently of the substrate temperature...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCo-evaporated CuIn(0, 5) Ga(0, 5) Se(2) {{thin film}} solar cells were grown using a {{sequential}} Cu-Poor/Rich/Poor process (<b>CUPRO).</b> During the growth process, the substrate temperature was either kept constant at 570 degrees C (iso-CUPRO) or decreased {{during the first}} step to either 360 or 430 or 500 degrees C (bi-CUPRO). According to atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, the lower the temperature is in the first step the smoother the final CIGS surface becomes. By decreasing the first step temperature, cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and theta- 2 theta x-ray diffraction (XRD) do not reveal clearly any important changes of morphology and crystallographic preferred orientation.

40|$|Nickel-based alloys can be {{machined}} using techniques {{similar to}} those employed to cut ferrous materials, however, additional requirements are imposed due to the poor machinability of these alloys. Through a series of cutting tests, the authors have applied techniques to optimise the cutting conditions for high speed steel circular saw blades machining materials from three principal categories of nickel-based alloy. The current paper considers the resultant wear mechanisms and the suitability of these tools for this application. Cutting tests were undertaken in which <b>Cupro</b> 107, Inconel 600 L 1 and Nimonic PK 31 1 workpieces were machined over a range of cutting speeds and feeds to determine the optimum cutting conditions. Test results showed considerable variation in blade performance when cutting these materials. These variations were reflected {{in the rate of}} wear and the predominant wear mechanisms associated with the machining of each material. Since both tool and material costs are high, identification of the dominant wear mechanisms is of importance to both manufacturing engineer and end-user when assessing the suitability of using circular saw blades for this application, and when selecting the cutting conditions to maximise tool life. The work will also be of interest to the surface coating engineer when evaluating tooth geometry and substrate material requirements...|$|E
40|$|In the past, semiconductive {{textiles}} including yarns and fabrics, {{have been}} produced by incorporating conductive fillers (particularly carbon, metal powder or conductive polymers) into the fibre structure or by coating fibres with metals or thin films of conductive polymers. Incorporation of large amounts of conductive fillers results in a deterioration of mechanical properties and processing problems of the fibres. Conductive polymers, such as polypyrrole (Ppyr), deposited on textile substrates, are highly susceptible to oxidation and abrasion. Recent research carried out in our laboratories, shows that polypyrrole can be embedded in natural and man made cellulose-based fibres, such as cotton, viscose, <b>cupro</b> and lyocell, by means of internal polymerisation {{taking place in the}} amorphous region of the fibres. In this work, pyrrole was applied by simple finishing process at room temperature from an aqueous solution of the monomer that penetrates into the fibre similarly to a non-reactive dye. Subsequent polymerisation caused its permanent insolubility in the internal fibre structure, leading to high levels of fastness to washing and to light exposure, without significant modification of the mechanical properties. This low cost technological application is of particular interest for developing new technical apparel, such as antistatic fabrics for work clothing, sportswear, heating and cooling equipment, etc...|$|E
40|$|Inspection of {{non-ferrous}} {{cast material}} is routinely carried {{out looking for}} casting defects inherent for the manufacturing process. The NDT methods employed are Radiography and Ultrasonics, primarily for sub-surface or internal defects and Penetrants fo r surface breaking defects. Electromagnetic techniques have not been used on cast material except maybe for conductivity determination. This limitation resulting fi 7 om the surface roughness normally associated with cast surfaces and the fact the other techniques mention above have been very successful in finding and evaluating the discontinuities sought. The possible application of Electromagnetic techniques on surfaces in the as-cast condition of non-ferromagnetic material came about because of specific problems experienced by industry. Two major investigations were offered namely; 1) Investigation of CNC material - CuNiCr [1. 6 %Cr] castings exhibiting oxide entrapment {{in the form of}} networks. 2) Investigation of NAB - Nickel Aluminium Bronze exhibiting selective phase corrosion on immersion in seawater. The detection and measurement of both oxide entrapment and phase selective corrosion was difficult and in cases impossible with conventional NDT methods employed for quality control of these material/component types. Time of Flight DiMaction Ultrasonics did give some 50 % detectability of phase selective corrosion, but the method was found to be expensive and very time consuming. The metallurgical properties of the material and morphology of the defects have been studied for both <b>Cupro</b> Nickel Chromium and Nickel Aluminium Bronze cast alloys. An investigation was then conducted to study the effects of eddy current signals and their potential in detecting, both linear and cluster type defects which were predominantly interdendritic with some reported as intergranular in nature. For inspecting <b>Cupro</b> Nickel Chromium castings two successful eddy current methods have been developed. Detection of surface flaws was achieved by high frequency [2 MHzj examination and subsurface flaws by using low frequencies [1 [...] 'IKHz] but using specifically developed sensors that provided good penetration but maintained sensitivity to the fine defects. In the case of Nickel Aluminium Bronze material, the investigation was to look at electromagnetic techniques, which best utilizes the inherent feature of permeability/conductivity associated with this non- ferromagnetic material and any changes that phase selective corrosion may produce. Some meaningful results were obtained using a combination of edd'y current excitation with detection via magneto -re s istive sensors. Testing through 30 - 40 mm of material to detect small magnetic variation produced by only 1 - 2 mm of corrosion penetration was difficult to quantify. Detection and assessment however appeared hopeful when examination was carried out from the corroded surface. With quantifiable samples a meaningful technique using eddy current excitation and magneto-resistive sensor for detection can be developed.

Their structures, mechanical, thermal and surface properties and performances as well as anti-bacterial behavior are measured and compared. It {{has been found that}} the polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) filament yarn has adequate thermal and mechanical properties for normal textile and coloration/finishing processes. The Young's modulus of polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) multi-filament yarn is the lowest among all the candidates investigated except for polyamide 6 (PA 6). The dyed polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) fabric has the highest softness rating among all the fabrics. Single jersey knitted fabrics from the polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) filament yarn have a bursting strength, extension and recovery that satisfy the industrial requirement. In addition, after fully relaxation, the dyed polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) knitted fabrics exhibit an outstanding pilling resistance, favorable snagging property, as well as good air permeability, Qmax and smoother surface.
