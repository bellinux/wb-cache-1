40|$|Two n-dimensional {{manifolds}} M 1 and M 2 are cobordant {{if there}} is an (n + 1) -dimensional manifold W with the disjoint union of M 1 and M 2 as its boundary. Such a simple definition can lead to very interesting results in many different areas of mathematics. Algebraic topology is perhaps the most obvious one, with cobordism being central to surgery theory and the study of high-dimensional manifolds. Cobordisms and Morse Theory have a very intimate relationship, whilst at the same time cobordisms are having fun being the domains of TQFTs (topological quantum field theories). Cobordism theories can be made into extraordinary cohomology theories, and they are also playing a central role in modern-day knot theory. Contrary to what Wikipedia says, cobordism {{has nothing to do with}} “a Danish modern art movement based on gluing <b>carboard</b> boxes to your face”. In this talk I will show why 1, 2 and 3 -manifolds are all null-cobordant (i. e. cobordant to an empty manifold), with the 3 -dimensional case obviously taking the majority of the time. Interestingly, the proof hinges on showing that we can construct every 3 -manifold from S 3 by surgery on a link, a result which is very beautiful in its own right...|$|E

40|$|Student Number : 9104308 Y - Msc Eng {{research}} report - School of Mining Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentAfrican Explosives Limited (AEL) {{is involved with}} the Hybrid Stress Blast Model (HSBM) project in the characterisation of its bulk explosives and part of this involves the collection of unconfined detonation velocities (VoD). Historical methods of unconfined VoD measurements and earlier measurements taken for the HSBM project did not attribute significance {{to the strength of}} the light containment media used, which was either cardboard or PVC, in various wall thicknesses. The main focus of this exercise was to investigate this significance and to make recomendations to the HSBM on the choice of pipes for future tests. ANFO was used in order to avoid complexities of manufacturing and density variation, which arise with emulsion explosives. Plastic sleeves were used as a control in defining a medium of negligible confinement in order to compare the results in PVC and cardboard pipes. The cardboard pipes selected had wall thicknesses of 2 mm and 4 mm, while the PVC pipes had pressure ratings of 4 Bar and 9 Bar with wall thicknesses from 1. 5 mm to 8. 5 mm. The inner diameters ranged between 45 mm and 253 mm. The following findings have been made in this report. - Plastic sleeves were not effective in comparing the effects of confinement, but the results suggests that thin walled <b>carboard</b> pipes are probably very close to unconfined, even near the critical diameter. - PVC pipes affect VoD more than cardboard pipes and the confinement provided by both types of pipes increases with their wall thickness. - Critical diameter increases with weaker confinement and vice versa. - VoDs in the different types of confinement converge as diameter increases. - Future unconfined VoD tests should take cognisance of the findings of this project. A similar confinement investigation would be benificial to determine whether similar trends prevail with Emulsion and Emulsion-ANFO blend explosives. However if such an evaluation is not conducted, the minimum requirements for further tests should be to apply the confinement and diameter relationships as determined for ANFO during this investigation...|$|E
40|$|Ignacy Leon Kotkowski – a landowner, industrialist, {{grandfather}} of Witold Gombrowicz, married to Aniela Kotkowska from the Kotkowski family – bought in 1838 from the Małachowski family {{the village of}} Bodzechów together with the manor house and over 1400 acres of fertile lands, woods and meadows. On these lands he built very profitable ironworks with a puddling furnace, a paper mill, a brickyard, a lumber mill, mills and a nailery. In 1885 the squire of the estate of Bodzechów and Małoszyce, Ignacy Kotkowski, purchased in the neighbouring village of Doły Biskupie a brick mill, {{as well as the}} nearby lands. The village of Doły Biskupie situated at the Świślina River abounded in rich stone deposits (dolomite). Therefore he established an enterprise there called “Ignacy Kotkowski’s ‘Doły and Święcie’ Sandstone Mines, Factory of Stone Products”. He built three state-of-the-art water mills on the Świślina River. Banked up waters of the river enclosed in the built by Kotkowski channels powered the mills’ wheels. Sandstone was extracted with the use of modern technologies. Cutting of stone took place in three lumber mills. Huge marble slabs were transported by a narrow-gauge railway. Apart from extracting the sandstone, it was machined, and many products were manufactured from it, for instance: carved windows, doors, tower ornaments, cornices, balconies, staircases, floors, entrance gates, tables and others. Mills, the factory of stone products, sandstone mines together with the nearby factory housing estate, constitued the property, which was entered in the records as “Doły” Mill Settlement. The development of the factory rewuired constant investments, i. e. building of the subsequent buildings which were intended for workshops, or flats for managers and workers. Efficient transport, in turn, required bulding of a road that would connect the factory with the iron railway, as well as bridges on ravines and the channel leading to the factory in Nietulisk. The speedy development of the factory provided employment and wages to a considerable number of inhabitants. Ignacy Kotkowski died in 1901. In 1902 the estate of “Doły” Mill Settlement became the property of his daughter, Marcelina Antonina Gombrowiczowa, née Kotkowska. The Doły Biskupie settlement is the proof of utilizing the waters of the Świślina River for almost 400 years in one and the same place. In te course of those years water systems, which set in motion respectively the mill, industrial mills, the stone factory, as well as the <b>carboard</b> factory, have been perfected. Such a long and coherent industrial tradition was possible thanks to Ignacy Kotkowski’s ability to use the local raw materials and natural sources of energy. The history of this town as well as the industried activity of one landowning family shows the difficult process of industrialization of our country. The invasions, wars, crises, or floods forced entrepreneurs to react quickly to the changing economic situation, to market needs, and required resistance and determination. Cataclysms would ruin any new investment. That is why plants were rebuilt so often, and the range of products would change...|$|E
