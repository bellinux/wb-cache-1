500|$|The next day, September 2, {{the battle}} ended when federal troops under General Harry Hill Bandholtz arrived. [...] <b>Chafin</b> and his army went home, and <b>Chafin</b> became [...] "a {{hero in the}} eyes of the coal operators" [...] for his role in {{stopping}} the march. [...] While the operators regarded <b>Chafin</b> as a hero, the miners placed the blame for the bloodshed on <b>Chafin.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Chafin</b> reorganized and {{enlarged}} his forces, {{and volunteers}} {{from around the}} state arrived to join his army. [...] The Governor of West Virginia, Ephraim Morgan, also helped <b>Chafin</b> recruit men to join his forces, and sent an unofficial national guard unit to join him. Governor Morgan then named William Eubanks as a colonel of the National Guard, and ordered him to take command of the forces from <b>Chafin.</b> [...] <b>Chafin</b> officially passed command to Eubanks, but [...] "the army remained Chafin's in popular perception." ...|$|E
5000|$|From {{this time}} to 27 October, the {{regiment}} was doing picket duty most of the time. On that day a reconnaissance was made in force on the Darbytown road, in front of Richmond, the 115th taking a prominent part in charging the rebel works, and losing quite heavily. Among the number killed was Sergeant lde of Company F., the idol of his comrades. Returning to camp, the regiment had five days comparative rest. On 8 December, the 115th embarked on board the propeller [...] "Haze," [...] and participated in the abortive attempt to capture Fort Fisher, N. C. In the afternoon of 30 December, the regiment debarked at Jones Landing, on the James river, Va., and just after dark was again in the old camp on <b>Chafins</b> farm.|$|R
50|$|On the 20th it {{returned}} to the old camp at Bermuda, with only one hundred and twenty men fit for duty. Comparative rest was the happy lot of the decimated regiment until the 28th, when it marched to Petersburgh again and occupied the trenches {{in front of that}} city. The regiment had a little rest, doing only trench and camp duty until 28 September, when it broke camp and marched to {{the north side of the}} James. On the 29th the 115th participated in the capture of two redoubts on <b>Chafins</b> farm, known by some as Spring Hill. Here the losses of the regiment were very severe, among the dead being the loved and lamented Capt. W. H. McKittrick, of Co. C. During this engagement in charges, counter charges, victories and repulses, the enemy lost three times the number that the 115th did.|$|R
500|$|In 1905, <b>Chafin</b> married Mary Mounts, {{with whom}} he {{eventually}} had 10 children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. [...] Three years later, in 1908, <b>Chafin</b> was appointed the tax assessor of Logan County. [...] In 1912, <b>Chafin</b> was elected sheriff of Logan County for the first time, and in 1920 he was elected county clerk as well.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} later, Chafin's illegal {{activities}} {{led to his}} arrest. One of his deputies, Tennis Hatfield, was arrested for violation of the Volstead Act, and [...] he implicated <b>Chafin</b> at his trial. [...] <b>Chafin</b> was tried and convicted of violation of the Volstead Act at the federal courthouse in Huntington, West Virginia on October 14, 1924. [...] He was given the maximum sentence of two years in prison, and ordered to pay a fine of $10,000. [...] The judge in the case also took special precautions to protect the witnesses against <b>Chafin,</b> due to his potentially violent nature. <b>Chafin</b> appealed the verdict, but it was upheld in April 1925, and {{he was sent to}} the federal penitentiary in Atlanta. [...] He served part of his term before being paroled back to Logan County. While <b>Chafin</b> was in prison, he lost much of his influence in Logan County, and his political opponents took power. After his release from prison, <b>Chafin</b> moved to Charleston and retained some of his influence in the Democratic Party of West Virginia while lobbying for the coal industry.|$|E
500|$|<b>Chafin</b> {{was born}} on June 26, 1887, {{near the town of}} Kermit in present-day Mingo County, West Virginia, the sixth of eleven children. [...] His father, Francis Marion <b>Chafin,</b> was the sheriff of Logan County, and <b>Chafin</b> grew up in the town of Logan. (He was related to the Hatfield family of West Virginiahis great aunt Levisa [...] "Levicy" [...] <b>Chafin</b> was the wife of Anderson Hatfield). [...] For two years he studied in the preparatory {{department}} of Marshall College– without taking college courses– but did not graduate. [...] He also attended the Mountain State Business College, before teaching at the Dingress School in Mingo County.|$|E
500|$|Chafin's anti-union {{activities}} did successfully {{keep the}} United Mine Workers out of Logan County, {{but they also}} aroused the anger of UMW officials. [...] <b>Chafin</b> also established a record of violent and unpleasant confrontations with union officials outside of Logan County. [...] In one such incident in September 1919, <b>Chafin</b> entered {{the office of the}} UMW in Charleston, West Virginia while he was [...] "drunk armed and very belligerent." [...] William Petry, the vice-president of the local union, asked <b>Chafin</b> to leave, but <b>Chafin</b> responded by brandishing a revolver. [...] Petry then shot <b>Chafin</b> in the chest with a 22-caliber pistol. [...] Petry was later cleared of criminal wrongdoing on the grounds that his action was self-defense, but he expressed no remorse about the shooting and later remarked [...] "That's what happens when a man carries a toy pistol. [...] That goddamned son of a bitch is liable to get well. [...] I should have had my old 'forty-four.'" ...|$|E
500|$|As {{it became}} clear that battle was imminent, and <b>Chafin</b> printed {{leaflets}} for his biplanes to drop on the miners, ordering them one last time to disperse. [...] The effort produced no results, and both sides prepared for the conflict. [...] Not long after the leaflets were dropped, the battle [...] "erupted in hot warfare." [...] <b>Chafin</b> served as Eubanks's second in command, and helped organize forces. [...] The next day, September 1, as the fighting intensified, <b>Chafin</b> left the front lines to establish a second line of defense around the town of Logan in case the miners broke through the first line. That same day, <b>Chafin</b> also equipped his biplanes with pipe bombs and tear gas, which they dropped on the miners, though they inflicted no serious casualties.|$|E
500|$|Faced {{with the}} {{oncoming}} miner army, <b>Chafin</b> {{put into place}} plans he had been forming since early summer. [...] <b>Chafin</b> had formed {{a small army of}} several hundred volunteers, composed of his deputies, mine guards, and members of the Logan County middle class, and had begun to train them in June. He established large weapons caches, including a stockpile of machine guns, and erected breastworks on the slopes of Blair Mountain. [...] At around 2 a.m. on August 25, <b>Chafin</b> turned on the fire siren in the town of Logan, calling together his army. [...] By morning, 700 members of his volunteer army were assembled on the slopes of Blair Mountain. In addition to his land forces, <b>Chafin</b> established a small air force, composed of three biplanes that he rented from private owners for use in reconnaissance.|$|E
500|$|Don <b>Chafin</b> (June 26, 1887– August 9, 1954) was {{the sheriff}} of Logan County, West Virginia and a {{commander}} in the Battle of Blair Mountain. [...] As sheriff of Logan County, <b>Chafin</b> was a fierce opponent of unionization and received {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars from coal mine operators in return for his violent suppression of the United Mine Workers union.|$|E
500|$|In a third incident, {{a disgruntled}} {{constituent}} {{walked into his}} office, with a gun drawn and reportedly said [...] "Don <b>Chafin,</b> I'm gonna' shoot you dead." [...] <b>Chafin</b> reached into his desk drawer {{and pulled out a}} pistol of his own, and said, [...] "Go ahead. [...] We'll hop into Hell together." [...] The man left without firing a shot.|$|E
500|$|After {{becoming}} sheriff of Logan County, <b>Chafin</b> {{became known}} as [...] "the boss" [...] of Logan County or [...] "the czar", and its [...] "best known citizen". [...] His authority extended so far into every aspect of public life that he reportedly controlled every judge and jury in the county. According to Howard B. Lee, the former Attorney General of West Virginia, <b>Chafin</b> was so powerful that [...] "no schoolteacher was employed without his approval." ...|$|E
500|$|Chafin's vast power {{attracted}} the attention of mine operators, who paid him to keep the unions out of Logan County. [...] The operators bribed <b>Chafin</b> with large payments, and paid many of the expenses of the sheriff's department. [...] While the exact payments to <b>Chafin</b> are unknown, a special commission ordered by Governor John Cornwell found that he received a payment of at least $32,700 per year in return for keeping the union out of Logan County. [...] Other estimates of the bribes paid to <b>Chafin</b> range as high as $61,571 in 1921, and other evidence suggests the possibility of even higher figures. [...] The historian Robert Shogan reports that although Chafin's annual salary was only $3,500 per year, his net worth by 1921 was in excess of $350,000, suggesting that he received bribes of at least $50,000 annually.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Hatfield's death, a {{large group}} of miners began to {{assemble}} south of Charleston along Lens Creek, and prepared to march south to Mingo County, and free their fellow miners who had been imprisoned under the martial law decree for violent acts. [...] The path of the march would take the miners directly across Logan County, causing fear for <b>Chafin</b> and his backers. <b>Chafin</b> declared [...] "No armed mob will cross Logan County", and prepared to stop the miners as they crossed Blair Mountain. [...] Chafin's pronouncements and preparations were regarded with contempt by the miners, who took up the cry, [...] "We'll hang Don <b>Chafin</b> to a sour apple tree." [...] One {{of the leaders of the}} miners, Ed Reynolds, later testified that a central aim of the march was [...] "to kill Sheriff Don Chafin".|$|E
500|$|The {{operators}} also directly {{paid the}} salary {{of at least}} forty of Chafin's deputies, ensuring control over the department and favorable treatment. [...] The bribes from the mine owners did indeed result in favors from Chafin; <b>Chafin</b> stationed one of his deputies at every railway station in Logan County [...] to [...] "guard against union organizers". [...] Upon suspicion that someone entering the county was a union organizer, Chafin's deputies would either force him to leave, arrest him, or beat him. [...] In one case, <b>Chafin</b> mistook J. L. Heiser, the Chief Clerk of the West Virginia Department of Mines, for a union organizer, then threatened him with a gun, hit him {{over the head with}} a blackjack, and forced him to leave the county. [...] After the incident, realizing his mistake, <b>Chafin</b> paid Heiser $1,000 in compensation, but never faced any other consequences for his actions.|$|E
500|$|Regardless of {{his role}} in the events, <b>Chafin</b> {{remained}} sheriff after the battle and began to round up and arrest a number {{of the leaders of the}} miners. [...] While some of the top leaders arranged to be arrested in other jurisdictions to stay out of Chafin's hand, others including Frank Keeney, a top UMW official, and Bill Blizzard, the so-called general of the miners, surrendered to <b>Chafin</b> and were put in jail in Logan County. [...] The trials eventually were transferred to other jurisdictions, and the prisoners passed out of Chafin's hands without incident.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, <b>Chafin</b> {{moved to}} Huntington, where he {{purchased}} {{a number of}} properties including the Guaranty Bank, on top of which he built a penthouse as his home. [...] He lived in semi-retirement there {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
500|$|In {{a second}} {{shooting}} incident, a miner walked into Chafin's sheriff office in Logan and, without a word, {{shot him in}} the chest. [...] <b>Chafin</b> walked the two blocks to Logan General Hospital with a bullet lodged in his chest two inches from his heart.|$|E
500|$|In {{his later}} days, <b>Chafin</b> trained coon dogs, and {{was known as}} [...] "one of Huntington's wealthiest men" [...] and a [...] "familiar figure" [...] in the city. [...] He {{suffered}} several heart attacks in his later life, and eventually died on August 9, 1954 in a Huntington hospital after a surgical procedure.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, <b>Chafin</b> {{was arrested}} in {{connection}} with moonshining and sentenced {{to two years in}} prison. [...] After his release, he became an important figure in the Democratic Party of West Virginia, and a lobbyist for the coal industry. [...] In 1936, he moved to Huntington, West Virginia, where he was a wealthy and well-known figure until his death in 1954.|$|E
500|$|After the battle, <b>Chafin</b> {{went back}} to his normal work as sheriff of Logan County and [...] "became more arrogant", believing his {{position}} to be unassailable. He became involved in a number of illegal ventures, including a moonshining operation. He also became increasingly important within the West Virginia Democratic party, due to his celebrity status after the battle. [...] He was frequently present in the state capitol, and attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention {{as a member of the}} West Virginia delegation.|$|E
500|$|Chafin's {{most notable}} anti-union {{measures}} {{came during the}} 1921 Battle of Blair Mountain, when he organized an effort to prevent armed miners from crossing through Logan County. [...] He assembled a force of thousands of local townspeople, sheriff's deputies, and national guardsmen. [...] His forces successfully prevented the advance of the miners until federal troops intervened and forced the latter to disperse. [...] As {{a result of his}} actions, <b>Chafin</b> became a hero of the mine operators and an enemy of the miners.|$|E
500|$|After initial skirmishes on August 25 and August 26 between Chafin's {{forces and}} the miners, UMW {{officials}} managed to defuse the tensions in the area, and convinced the miners to go home. [...] <b>Chafin</b> recalled his troops and told them [...] "You have been in defense of our rights. [...] Logan County will never forget it." [...] Before the miners dispersed, however, the West Virginia State Police attempted to arrest a group of their leaders, and the attempt escalated into a shootout in which several miners died. Suddenly the rebellion reignited, and {{it became clear that}} a major battle was coming.|$|E

A few months later, on January 11, 2007, Moe's Southwest Grill closed for remodeling. The quick-casual restaurant later reluctantly announced that it was, in fact, moving to a nearby location on 9th Street. [...] On March 17 Runway Couture opened next to Inspired, featuring west coast-inspired fashions; both are owned by Deneene <b>Chafin.</b> [...] Moe's Southwest Grill maintained goodfaith talks with Pullman Square and after protracted negotiations Metropolitan Partners agreed to Moe's corporate lease arrangements and subsequently surrendered {{the keys to the}} former location on November 5, 2007.|$|E
500|$|The musical shift {{occurs when}} the singer pronounces the words [...] "Core", during which, as {{described}} by Nikki Debben in her essay included in the Manual Edition of Biophilia, the [...] "modality switches from minor to major". The lecturer noted that [...] "the close, dark sound of the verse {{is partly due to}} the minor mode which has a flattened third degree, compared to the brighter sound of the chorus in the major mode which has the [...] "normal" [...] third degree of the chord". This part of the song uses a Plagal cadence, which involves a movement [...] "from a chord built on the fourth degree of the scale to one built on the first degree of the scale". The chorus of the song features a vocal crescendo performed by the choir, which juxtaposes with breakcore-influenced beats, which display elements from dub. Chris <b>Chafin</b> of Capital compared the sound of the chorus to the work of The Chemical Brothers and stated that tracks like [...] "Crystalline" [...] and [...] "Mutual Core" [...] recall previous works from Björk's discography, especially Post (1995) and Homogenic (1997).|$|E

2500|$|Mitchell was {{dispatched}} by President Harding to West Virginia to {{stop the}} warfare that had broken out between the United Mine Workers, Stone Mountain Coal Company, the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency, and other groups after the Matewan Massacre. Miners outraged by the ambush slaying of Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield by agents for the coal company marched on Mingo and Logan County leading to the Battle of Blair Mountain, August 25 to September 2, 1921. On August 26, Mitchell commanded Army bombers from Maryland to Charleston, West Virginia. Mitchell told the press that Army bombers alone could end the [...] "Mingo War" [...] by dropping tear gas on the miners. A private army of 3,000 led by Sheriff Don <b>Chafin</b> and financed by the Coal Operators Association engaged in gun battles and used private planes to drop dynamite charges and World War I surplus gas and explosive bombs against an estimated 13,000 miners. Neither side responded to President Harding's August 30 proclamation to cease hostilities. In {{the last days of}} the civil disturbance, Mitchell's bombers flew several reconnaissance missions but did not engage in combat; one bomber crashed on a return flight, killing three crew members. On September 3, surrounded by 2,000 Army troops, Chafin's force dispersed and most miners went home although some surrendered to the Army. Later, Mitchell cited the [...] "Mingo War" [...] as an example of the potential for air power in civil disturbances.|$|E
