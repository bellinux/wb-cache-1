5|$|In 1983, {{classification}} for swimmers with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> was {{governed by}} CP-ISRA. There were five <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> classifications. Class 1 competitors could {{compete in the}} 25 metre freestyle event with flotation devices with or without flotation devices. Class 2 competitors could compete in the same events, but only against class 2 competitors. That year, 80 to 85 per cent of all competitors with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> competed in the same classification in international competitions.|$|E
5|$|Ataxia – Ataxia is an {{impairment}} {{that consists}} {{of a lack of}} coordination of muscle movements (e.g. <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> Friedreich’s ataxia, multiple sclerosis).|$|E
5|$|Athetosis – Athetosis is {{generally}} characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture (e.g. <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> choreoathetosis).|$|E

5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication {{methods used to}} supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those {{with a wide range}} of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> intellectual impairment and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.|$|E

5|$|Paralympic Boccia is open {{to players}} with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> and other major {{physical}} disabilities. Four players were selected to compete at the Games, including Sydney gold medallist Nigel Murray. Murray advanced to the final where, despite at one stage taking a 3–1 lead, {{he was unable to}} beat Karen Hoi Ying Kwok and so won the silver medal. Murray was also a part of the four-person team that won the gold medal in the mixed BC1/BC2 event, beating the defending champions Portugal in the final.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2004, a 53-year-old, 5' 2", 230lb (104.5kg) {{man from}} Bloomfield, Connecticut, {{fell out of}} his coaster seat during the last turn and was killed. Reports show that the ride {{attendant}} had not checked that the guest's ride restraint was secure as his girth was too large for the T-bar-shaped ride restraint to close properly. The victim's family said that due to his various medical conditions, such as <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> he shouldn't {{have been allowed to}} ride. The park stated that the federal Americans with Disabilities Act forbids them from denying a ride to a person with a disability as long as the person can get on the ride by themselves.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} AAC {{can be traced}} to the days of {{classical}} Rome and Greece, with the first recorded use of augmentative strategies with the deaf. The use of manual alphabets and signs was recorded in Europe from the 16th century, as was the gestural system of Hand Talk used by Native Americans to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups. The first known widely available communication aid was a letter and word-based communication board developed for, and with, F. Hall Roe, who had <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy.</b> This communication board was distributed in the 1920s by a men's group in Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{won four}} medals in 1992—one gold, one silver and two bronze. Michael Milton, an amputee alpine skier, won {{gold in the}} slalom and silver in the super-G. In {{paraplegic}} sit-skiing, David Munk won bronze in the super-G, and Michael Norton won bronze in the downhill. In 1994, Australia won three gold, two silver and four bronze medals. Milton won gold in the giant slalom, silver in the slalom and bronze in the downhill and super-G, and Norton won gold in the slalom and super-G. James Patterson, a skier with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> won silver in the downhill and bronze in the giant slalom. Munk won another bronze, {{this time in the}} giant slalom. In 1998, Australia won two medals, both through Paterson: gold in the downhill and bronze in the slalom.|$|E
5|$|Koechlin's {{continued}} {{association with}} such commercial films {{as the political}} drama Shanghai (2012) and the supernatural thriller Ek Thi Daayan (2013) sustained her success, as she continued to draw praise for her performances in independent films, including the comedy drama Waiting (2015) and the thriller A Death in the Gunj (2016). She won universal acclaim and a National Film Award – Special Jury Award for her performance {{as a young woman}} with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> in the coming of age drama Margarita with a Straw (2014). Koechlin also uses YouTube as a platform or forum for issues for which she advocates, appearing in videos including AIB's It's Your Fault, Culture Machine's Printing Machine and Noise and Y-Films's web-series entitled Man's World.|$|E
5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the eight}} sports contested in the first Paralympics, the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome. Both the rules for the sport and for the {{approval}} of swimmers' classifications were set by the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA). In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) formally became the governing body for disability swimming. Four different sporting bodies, the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), International Sports Federation of the Disabled (ISOD), International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (ISMWSF) and the <b>Cerebral</b> <b>Palsy</b> International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA), assisted the IPC in governing swimming at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC Classification Code and IPC Swimming govern the classification process. Classification of swimmers is performed by classifiers that are recognised by the IPC.|$|E
5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those {{who might be able}} to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
25|$|Ataxic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> is {{clinically}} {{observed in}} approximately 5-10% {{of all cases}} of <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> making it the least frequent form of <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> diagnosed. Ataxic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> is caused by damage to cerebellar structures, differentiating it from the other two forms of <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> which are spastic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> (damage to cortical motor areas and underlying white matter) and athetoid <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> (damage to basal ganglia).|$|E
25|$|<b>Cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> sport {{classification}} - {{describes the}} disability sport classification for <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Preterm birth. Low {{birth weight}} and preterm birth are {{strongly}} associated with many health problems, such as visual impairment and <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> and children born after IVF are roughly {{twice as likely to}} have <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the damage}} to the cerebellum, which is {{essential}} for coordinating muscle movements and balance, patients with ataxic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> experience problems in coordination, specifically in their arms, legs, and trunk. Ataxic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> is known to decrease muscle tone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> has {{affected}} humans since antiquity. A decorated grave marker dating {{from around the}} 15th to 14th century BCE shows a figure with one small leg and using a crutch, possibly due to <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy.</b> The oldest likely physical evidence of the condition comes from the mummy of Siptah, an Egyptian Pharaoh who ruled from about 1196 to 1190BCE and died at about 20 years of age. The presence of <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> has been suspected due to his deformed foot and hands.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{impaired}} balance, patients {{suffering from}} ataxic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> often walk {{with their feet}} unusually far apart (a wide gait). In addition, the low muscle tone caused by ataxic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> causes people suffering from the disease to appear very unsteady, as their body is constantly trying to counterbalance itself. Infants with the disease often take a significantly longer {{amount of time to}} be able to walk without support, and over 50% of all children with ataxic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> experience some form of a learning disability or speech impediment.|$|E
25|$|In this classification, skiers with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> have {{difficulty}} walking in ski boots and sometimes require assistance when walking in them. When going up hill, {{they often have}} their weaker side on the uphill side. In learning to ski, a ski bra {{is often used to}} teach the proper technique. Skiers sometimes {{have difficulty}} with the snowplough technique. In teaching skiers with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encourage as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. Some skiers with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> may tie more quickly.|$|E
25|$|Spastic <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> or <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy</b> where {{spasticity}} (muscle tightness) is {{the exclusive}} or almost exclusive impairment present, {{is by far}} the most common type of overall <b>cerebral</b> <b>palsy,</b> occurring in upwards of 70% of all cases. People with this type of CP are hypertonic and have what is essentially a neuromuscular mobility impairment (rather than hypotonia or paralysis) stemming from an upper motor neuron lesion in the brain as well as the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex. This damage impairs the ability of some nerve receptors in the spine to receive gamma-Aminobutyric acid properly, leading to hypertonia in the muscles signaled by those damaged nerves.|$|E
