Isobutane is partly made available from the Catalytic reforming and from the Atmospheric distillation, although {{the proportion of the}} isobutane produced in a refinery is rarely sufficient to run the unit at full capacity and additional isobutane needs therefore to be brought to the refinery.

40|$|International audienceA <b>commercial</b> <b>butane</b> micron troch {{was used}} to enhance plasma optical {{emissions}} in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Fast imaging and spectroscopic analyses were used to observe plasma evolution in the atmospheric pressure for LIBS without and with using a micro torch. Optical emission intensities and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as functions of delay time were studied. Enhanced optical emission and SNRs were obtained by using a micro torch. The effects of laser pulse energy on the emission intensities and SNRs were studied. The same spectral intensity could be obtained using micro torch with much lower laser pulse energy. The investigation of SNR evolution with delay time at different laser pulse energies showed that the SNR enhancement factor is higher for plasmas generated by lower laser pulse energies than those generated by higher laser energies. The calibration curves of emission line intensities with elemental concentrations showed that detection sensitivities of Mn I 404. 136 nm and V I 437. 923 nm were improved by around 3 times. The limits of detection for both Mn I 404. 136 nm and V I 437. 923 nm are reduced from 425 and 42 ppm to 139 and 20 ppm, respectively, after using the micro torch. The LIBS system with micro torch was demonstrated to be cost-effective, compact, and capable of sensitivity improvement, especially for LIBS system operating with low laser pulse energy...|$|E

The hydrouorocarbonR 134 a is nonammable, difcult to synthesize, has zero ozone depletion and high global warming. LPG refrigerants are highly ammable, occur naturally, have zero ozone de-pletion and negligible global warming. In Germany, most new refrigerators use R 600 a and many heat pumps and air conditioners now use R 290 with measured energy consumption 10 to 20 % lower than R 12, R 134 a or R 22. LPG mixtures have successfully replaced R 12 and R 134 a in over 100, 000 US car air-conditioners. Abboud (1994) measured the air-conditioner performance of ve popu-lar Australian cars with R 12 and then LPG mixtures in our laboratory. He recommended 60 % by mass commercial propane from Bass Strait and 40 % <b>commercial</b> <b>butane.</b> This gave typically 10 % more cooling than R 12 with satisfactory superheat and typically 8 % higher condenser pressure. Refrigerant property parameters show that R 600 a has half the leakage, pressure loss and condenser pressure and double the heat transfer properties of R 12 and R 134 a. This explains the energy consumption savings of R 600 a refrigerators. Redesign of heat pumps and car air-conditioners for R 600 a could yield greater benets. The insurance risk increment from LPG ammability for domestic re-frigerators is zero. The increment for car air-conditioners is negative {{because of the high}} cost of R 12 and R 134 a repairs. For large systems, ventilation of plantrooms and other LPG safety precautions can make insurance risk incre-ment zero or negative if required...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} successes in the mathematical modelling of lift-off distances and plume heights of fuel jet flames, and in correlating these parameters experimentally. A dimensionless flow number, or jet velocity, has been developed, with which experimental dimensionless plume heights and flame lift-off distances {{have been successfully}} correlated. However, the prediction of blow-off heights presents significantly more difficulty. This {{is because of the}} strong non-linearities at blow-off, involving complexities of mixing, strain rates, flamelet burning velocities and curvatures, with localised flame extinctions. Because of these, it is difficult to obtain consistency in the measurement of blow-off heights. Consequently, the practice adopted by Kalghatgi of measuring dimensionless fuel jet velocities at blow-off was followed in the present study. Just before blow-off, strong instabilities and flame oscillations develop, and a correlation of blow-off is proposed in terms of the the last stable dimensionless flow number, before blow-off occurs. The study covers acetylene, <b>commercial</b> <b>butanes,</b> ethylene, hydrogen, methane and propane. Blow-off is characterised from plots of the dimensionless flame lift-off distance against the flow number for each fuel, with identification of the last stable dimensionless flow number prior to blow-off. This enables the dimensionless flow numbers for blow-off to be identified for the different fuels, along with the associated dimensionless lift-off distance...|$|R
40|$|Inhalants are {{a diverse}} group of {{volatile}} substances whose chemical vapors can be inhaled to produce psychoactive (mind-altering) effects. While other abused substances can be inhaled, the term “inhalants ” is used to describe substances that are rarely, if ever, taken by any other route of administration. A variety of products common in the home and workplace contain substances that can be inhaled to get high; however, people do not typically think of these products (e. g., spray paints, glues, and cleaning fluids) as drugs because they were never intended to induce intoxicating effects. Yet young children and adolescents can easily obtain these extremely toxic substances, and are among those most likely to abuse them. In fact, more 8 th graders have tried inhalants than any other illicit drug. 1 What Types of Products are Abused as Inhalants? Inhalants generally fall into the following categories: Volatile solvents—liquids that vaporize at room temperature Industrial or household products, including paint thinners or removers, degreasers, dry-cleaning fluids, gasoline, lighter fluid Art or office supply solvents, including correction fluids, felt-tip marker fluid, electronic contact cleaners, glue Aerosols—sprays that contain propellants and solvents Household aerosol propellants in items such as spray paints, hair or deodorant sprays, fabric protector sprays, aerosol computer cleaning products, and vegetable oil sprays Gases—found in household or commercial products and used as medical anesthetics Household or <b>commercial</b> products, including <b>butane</b> lighters and propane tanks, whipped cream aerosols or dispensers (whippets), and refrigerant gases Medical anesthetics, such as ether, chloroform, halothane, and nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) Nitrites—a special class of inhalants that are used primarily as sexual enhancers Organic nitrites are volatiles that include cyclohexyl, butyl, and amyl nitrites, commonly known as “poppers. ” Amyl nitrite is still used in certain diagnostic medical procedures.

40|$|Definition: Although other abused {{drugs can}} be inhaled, the term inhalants is {{reserved}} for {{the wide variety of}} substances—including solvents, aerosols, gases, and nitrites—that are rarely, if ever, taken via any other route of administration. (See below for a list of examples.) Many products readily found in the home or workplace—such as spray paints, markers, glues, and cleaning fluids—contain volatile substances that have psychoactive (mind-altering) properties when inhaled. People do not typically think of these products as drugs because they were never intended for that purpose. However, these products are sometimes abused in that way. They are especially (but not exclusively) abused by young children and adolescents, and are the only class of substance abused more by younger than by older teens. How Are Inhalants Abused? Abusers of inhalants breathe them in through the nose or mouth {{in a variety of ways}} (known as “huffing”). They may sniff or snort fumes from a container or dispenser (such as a glue bottle or a marking pen), spray aerosols (such as computer cleaning dusters) directly into their nose or mouth, or place a chemical-soaked rag in their mouth. Abusers may also inhale fumes from a balloon or a plastic or paper bag. Although the high produced by inhalants usually lasts just a few minutes, abusers often try to prolong it by continuing to inhale repeatedly over several hours. People tend to abuse different inhalant products at different ages. New users ages 12 – 15 most commonly abuse glue, shoe polish, spray paints, gasoline, and lighter fluid. New users ages 16 – 17 most commonly abuse nitrous oxide or “whippets. ” Adults most commonly abuse a class of inhalants known as nitrites (such as amyl nitrites or “poppers”). How Do Inhalants Affect the Brain? Most abused inhalants other than nitrites depress the central nervous system in a manner not unlike alcohol. The effects are similar—including slurred speech, lack of coordination, euphoria, and dizziness. Inhalant abusers may also experience light-headedness, hallucinations, and delu-sions. With repeated inhalations, many users feel less inhibited and less in control. Some may feel drowsy for several hours and experience a lingering headache. Unlike other types of inhalants, nitrites enhance sexual pleasure by dilating and relaxing blood vessels. Although it is not very common, addiction to inhalants can occur with repeated abuse What Are the Other Health Effects of Inhalants Chemicals found in different types of inhaled products may produce a vari-ety of other short-term effects, such as nausea or vomiting, as well as more serious long-term consequences. These may include liver and kidney damage, hearing loss, or bone marrow damage. Effects may also include loss of coordination and limb spasms due to damage to myelin—a protective sheathing around nerve fibers that helps nerves transmit messages in the brain and peripheral nervous system. Inhalants can also cause brain damage by cutting off oxygen flow to the brain. Inhalants can even be lethal. Sniffing highly concentrated amounts of the chemicals in solvents or aerosol sprays can directly cause heart failure within minutes. This syndrome, known as “sudden sniffing death,” can result from a single session of inhalant use by an otherwise healthy young person. High concentrations of inhal-ants may also cause death from suffocation, especially when inhaled from a paper or plastic bag or in a closed area. Even when using aerosols or volatile products for their legitimate purposes like painting or cleaning, it is wise to do so in a well-ventilated room or outdoors. Nitrites are a special class of inhalants that are abused to enhance sexual pleasure and performance. They can be associated with unsafe sexual practices that increase the risk of contracting and spreading infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.
