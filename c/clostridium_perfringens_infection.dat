40|$|SUMMARY: Gas {{gangrene}} is {{a severe}} form of gangrene (tissue death) that usually {{is caused by}} Clostridium perfringens. It generally occurs {{at the site of}} trauma or a recent surgical wound. We report the case of a 45 -year-old woman with sphenoid-ridged meningioma who received preoperative transarterial embolization with polyvinyl alcohol. The patient later developed an intratumoral C perfrin-gens infection and died despite intensive medical care. The case represents an extremely rare complication following transarterial embolization of meningioma. Preoperative embolization of meningiomas is consideredvaluable to allow simpler resection by reducing intraoper-ative blood loss and decreasing surgery time. Though the em-bolization procedures are quite safe with careful techniques in our general practice, 1 reports of some rare complications— such as tumoral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, scalp necro-sis, retinal embolus, facial nerve palsies, and occlusion of the vasa nervorum of cranial nerves—have been published.

40|$|The proper {{choice of}} {{antibiotic}} for <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> <b>infections</b> in patients allergic to penicillin is not clear; the usual recommendations and recent {{in vitro studies}} disagree. We tested the susceptibility of 57 strains of C. perfringens to eight penicillins, seven cephalosporins, two tetracyclines, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and rifampin by the agar dilution method. All strains were inhibited by (per milliliter) 4 μg or less {{of any of the}} penicillins, chloramphenicol, or clindamycin and 8 μg or less of any of the cephalosporins tested. Penicillin G and amoxicillin inhibited all strains at 0. 12 μg or less per ml. Only 54 % of the strains were inhibited by 1 μg of tetracycline per ml. Penicillin G remains the drug of first choice for infections with C. perfringens; it need not be added to a regimen containing a penicillinase-resistant penicillin given parenterally in high doses. The cephalosporins should be considered as alternative drugs for penicillin-allergic patients. Clindamycin and chloramphenicol are also effective. Tetracyclines cannot be depended upon in clostridial infections without in vitro testing, which is impracticable for initial empirical therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} animal models {{used to study}} <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> <b>infections</b> in humans and animals are {{reviewed}} here. The classical C. perfringens-mediated histotoxic disease of humans is clostridial myonecrosis or gas gangrene {{and the use of}} a mouse myonecrosis model coupled with genetic studies has contributed greatly to our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Similarly, the use of a chicken model has enhanced our understanding of type A-mediated necrotic enteritis in poultry and has led to the identification of NetB as the primary toxin involved in disease. C. perfringens type A food poisoning is a highly prevalent bacterial illness in the USA and elsewhere. Rabbits and mice are the species most commonly used to study the action of enterotoxin, the causative toxin. Other animal models used to study the effect of this toxin are rats, non-human primates, sheep and cattle. In rabbits and mice, CPE produces severe necrosis of the small intestinal epithelium along with fluid accumulation.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The common {{marmoset}} {{is widely}} used in neuroscience and regenerative medicine research. However, information concerning common marmoset disorders, particularly infectious diseases, is scarce. Here, we report {{a case of a}} female common marmoset that died suddenly due to gas gangrene. The animal presented with gaseous abdominal distention at postmortem, and Clostridium perfringens type A was isolated from several tissues. Vacuoles, a Gram-positive bacteremia and intravascular hemolysis were observed microscopically in the muscles, liver and lungs. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed nontraumatic gas gangrene caused by Clostridium perfringens type A in this common marmoset.

40|$|Uterine gas {{gangrene}} caused by Clostridium perfringens is a serious, often life-threatening infection that is rarely {{encountered in the}} practice of gynecologic oncology. However, the hypoxic nature of gynecologic cancers due to necrosis and/or prior radiation therapy creates a microenvironment optimal for proliferation of anaerobic bacteria such as the Clostridium species. Early recognition and aggressive treatment with IV antibiotics and surgical debridement remain the cornerstones of management in order to decrease morbidity and mortality. Here we present the case of a 52  year-old woman with a remote history of cervical cancer who was previously treated at our institution with primary chemotherapy and radiation and was then admitted decades later with Clostridium perfringens bacteremia and CT evidence of intrauterine abscess. The patient received a prolonged course of IV antibiotic therapy and subsequently underwent definitive surgical management with a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small bowel resection with anastomosis for a utero-ileal fistula identified intraoperatively.

Whole cell protein analysis {{was done by}} SDS-PAGE while toxin gene typing was achieved by extracting DNA by boiling, DNA concentration and purity was determined by spectrophotometer and nanodrop while separation {{was carried out by}} checking it on gel electrophoresis. Multiplex PCR was used to identify the toxigenic gene-type. C. perfringens B and C. perfringens EE with established profiles were used as control strains. Isolates typed included strains cp 296, 309, 12872 (from dogs) and 304, 305, 306, 341, 342, 10754, 12218 - 2, 12218 - 3, 12473 (from calves).

40|$|The enteric heath {{of growing}} poultry is {{imperative}} to success of the production. The basic role of poultry production is turning feed stuffs into meat. Any changes in this turning process, due to mechanical, chemical or biological disturbance of digestive system (enteric disorders) is mostly accompanied with high economic losses due to poor performance, increased mortality rates and increased medication costs. The severity of clinical signs and course of the disorders are influenced several factors such as management, nutrition and the involved agent(s). Several pathogens (viruses, bacteria and parasites) are incriminated as possible cause of enteric disorders either alone (mono-causal), in synergy with other micro-organisms (multi-causal), or with non-infectious causes such as feed and /or management related factors. In addition, excessive levels of mycotoxins and biogenic amines in feed lead to enteric disorders. Also factors such as high stocking density, poor litter conditions, poor hygiene and high ammonia level and other stressful situation may reduce {{the resistance of the}} birds and increases their susceptibility to infections. Under field conditions, however, under filed conditions {{it is difficult to determine}} whether the true cause of enteric disorders, is of infectious or non-infectious origin. In recent years and since the ban of use of antimicrobial growth promoters in several countries the incidence of intestinal disorders especially those caused by clostridial infection was drastically increased.

40|$|Both {{mycotoxin}} {{contamination of}} feed and Clostridium perfringens-induced necrotic enteritis have an increasing global economic impact on poultry production. Especially the Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) {{is a common}} feed contaminant. This study aimed at examining the predisposing effect of DON {{on the development of}} necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens. An experimental <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> <b>infection</b> study revealed that DON, at a contamination level of 3, 000 to 4, 000 µg/kg feed, increased the percentage of birds with subclinical necrotic enteritis from 20 ± 2. 6 % to 47 ± 3. 0 % (P< 0. 001). DON significantly reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance in duodenal segments (P< 0. 001) and decreased duodenal villus height (P =  0. 014) indicating intestinal barrier disruption and intestinal epithelial damage, respectively. This may lead to an increased permeability of the intestinal epithelium and decreased absorption of dietary proteins. Protein analysis of duodenal content indeed showed that DON contamination resulted in a significant increase in total protein concentration (P =  0. 023). Furthermore, DON had no effect on in vitro growth, alpha toxin production and netB toxin transcription of Clostridium perfringens. In conclusion, feed contamination with DON at concentrations below the European maximum guidance level of 5, 000 µg/kg feed, is a predisposing factor for the development of necrotic enteritis in broilers. These results are associated with a negative effect of DON on the intestinal barrier function and increased intestinal protein availability, which may stimulate growth and toxin production of Clostridium perfringens...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of group A and C rotaviruses (RVA and RVC) in {{the pathogenesis of}} diarrhea in Belgian suckling pigs is poorly investigated, {{and it is not}} known which strains are circulating in the Belgian suckling pig population. Obtaining better insights in the occurrence of both viral species in the swine population is essential in order to develop accurate diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to protect suckling pigs against diarrhea in a durable manner. In the present study, viral loads of RVA and RVC were quantified in diarrhea samples of suckling piglets less than 2 weeks old, collected on 36 different Belgian farms. On 22 of 36 farms tested (61 %), high viral loads of RVA (6. 96 - 11. 95 log 10 copies/g feces) and/or RVC (5. 40 - 11. 63 log 10 copies/g feces) were detected. Seventeen RVA isolates were genotyped for their outer capsid proteins VP 7 and VP 4. Four different G-genotypes (G 3, G 4, G 5 and G 9) for VP 7 were found together with 4 different P-genotypes (P[6], P[7], P[13] and P[23]) for VP 4, in 8 different G/P combinations. All characterized RVC strains belonged to genotype G 6 (VP 7), except for one strain possessing the G 1 genotype. VP 4 genes of Belgian RVC strains were genetically heterogeneous, but were classified in the genotype P 5. Most rotavirus positive samples also contained Escherichia coli, whereas <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> <b>infections</b> were mainly detected in rotavirus negative samples. Results of the present study offer better insights in the occurrence of RVA and RVC infections in Belgian diarrheic suckling piglets. As a conclusion, routine diagnostic testing for both viral species in cases of diarrhea in suckling pigs is highly recommended. Furthermore, the present findings also offer valuable information for the development of new prophylactic measures against rotavirus.

We analysed caecal microbiota of 4 groups of broilers (n = 12) using deep pyrosequencing of 16 S rDNA amplicons: (1) control chicks fed a control diet, (2) Eimeria infected chicks fed control diet, (3) chicks fed fishmeal supplemented diet and lastly (4) both fishmeal fed and Eimeria infected chicks. We found that the high-protein fishmeal diet had a strong effect on the intestinal microbiota similar to the previously reported effect of C. perfringensinfection. We noted major changes in the prevalence of various lactobacilli while the total culturable Lactobacillus counts remained stable. The uminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, unknown Clostridiales and Lactobacillaceae families were most affected by fishmeal with increases in a number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that had previously been linked to Crohn’s disease and reductions in OTUs known to be butyrate producers. Eimeria induced very different changes in microbiota; Ruminococcaceae groups were reduced in number and three unknown Clostridium species were increased in abundance. Additionally, Eimeria did not significantly influence changes in pH, formic, propionic or isobutyric acid while fishmeal induced dramatic changes in all these measures.

The infection decreased the number of Observed species, Chao 1, and ACE of ileal microbiota and increased Chao 1 of cecal microbiota of broilers, whereas L. acidophilus supplementation decreased the Shannon index of the ileal microbiota. Shannon index and Simpson indices were lower in the ileal microbiota than in the cecal microbiota. In the ileal microbiota, the control group had higher relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae in comparison with the other groups; however, the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was significantly higher in the challenge group than in the other groups. C. perfringens infection tended to increase lactate concentration and decreasedconcentrations of formate, acetate and propionate in the ileum; decreased isobutyrate concentration; and tended to decrease isovalerate concentration in the cecum. Besides, L. acidophilus supplementation increased the concentration of lactate and butyrate and decreased concentrations of formate and propionate in the ileum, and increased concentrations of lactate and valerate in the cecum. In conclusion, C. perfringens infection and/or dietary supplementation with L. acidophilus modulated the relative abundance of some bacteria taxa, and the L. acidophilus supplementation helped to restore the microbial community disrupted by C. perfringens infection...|$|E

This report describes the purification and the characterization of a bacteriocin from a necrotic enteritis associated <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> strain exhibiting antibacterial activity against other <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> strains. This report describes the purification and the characterization of a bacteriocin from a necrotic enteritis associated <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> strain exhibiting antibacterial activity against other <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> strains. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the bacteriocin is a 11. 5 kDa fragment of a 22. 91 kDa protein and that it constitutes the C-terminal part of this protein. The antibacterial activity of the purified bacteriocin was abolished by proteolytic enzymes trypsin and proteinase K and by heat treatment (10 min at 80 °C). The purified bacteriocin showed inhibitory activity over a wide pH-range (4. 0 to 10. 0). Since the antibacterial activity of the purified bacteriocin against other <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> strains had a narrower spectrum than the secreting strain, most probably additional bacteriocins are produced by the strain. The bacteriocin gene was identified in 20 % (10 / 50) of the poultry derived strains (22 / 50 netB positive), and was not found in 45 netB negative C. perfringens type A, B, C, D and E strains isolated from cattle, sheep, pigs, and humans. Southern blotting showed that the bacteriocin gene is not located on a plasmid. Despite the fact that the 10 strains carrying the bacteriocin gene are all netB positive strains, Perfrin and NetB are not located on the same genetic element since NetB is plasmid encoded...|$|R

In the present study, broilers were inoculated with a combination of Eimeria maxima or overdose coccidial vaccine (one inoculation) with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> (repeated inoculations). Single <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens,</b> Eimeria maxima or overdose live coccidial vaccine inoculations did not result in grossly visible necrotic gut lesions, while combined inoculation resulted in typical necrotic lesions at approximately 4 days after inoculations with <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> in approximately half of the inoculated animals. Semi-quantitative histological lesion scoring was done to evaluate gut damage in gut sections of animals in which no gross necrotic lesions were detected. This included scoring of hyperemia, haemorrhages, the amount of red blood cells and protein precipitate in the lumen, villus fusion and epithelial defects. Villus length and villus length/crypt depth ratio were also analysed. This approach proved to be discriminative between single Eimeria maxima, overdose coccidial vaccine or <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> inoculations and the non-inoculated control group, and between the double and single inoculated groups. In general, highest histological scores for gut lesions were observed in the double inoculated groups, but the single inoculated groups had higher scores compared to the control group. It was concluded that oral inoculation of broilers with an overdose of live coccidial vaccine in combination with multiple oral <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> inoculations is a suitable model for necrotic enteritis without inducing mortality of the animals. <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> and Eimeria act synergistically in inducing grossly visible gut damage...|$|R
