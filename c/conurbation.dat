5|$|In the High Middle Ages, {{the county}} was {{relatively}} urbanised by medieval standards, but because towns follow roads and Hertfordshire had many small roads {{rather than a}} few large ones, there was no large <b>conurbation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Theme 2 At {{the end of}} the eighties, several French <b>conurbations</b> {{considered}} {{calling on}} private companies to construct public transport lines with right of way 1. Some ten years after the signature of the first statutory contracts, and faced with a growing number of public transport projects in French <b>conurbations,</b> we feel it necessary to take stock of how these contracts have weathered and how other French <b>conurbations</b> intend to construct their metros, LRTs and bus lines with right of way. Therefore this study recounts the organisation of promoters and the financing of public transport with right of way in sixteen French <b>conurbations</b> with populations from 125, 000 to 1, 150, 000. It appears that the great majority of French <b>conurbations</b> no longer commit themselves to public-private partnerships and <b>conurbations</b> such as Toulouse or Rouen have reversed their choice regarding the statutory contracts that they had granted for a first line. Growing numbers of public partners are asked to finance projects, leading to financing of certain projects by more than five such bodies. This is particularly the case of projects for bus lines with right of way for which the part remaining to be financed by the public transport authority is less than 60...|$|R

5|$|Dorset {{is largely}} rural with many small villages, few large towns and no cities. The only major urban {{area is the}} South East Dorset <b>conurbation,</b> which is {{situated}} at the south-eastern end of the county and is atypical of the county as a whole. It consists of the seaside resort of Bournemouth, the historic port and borough of Poole, the towns of Christchurch and Ferndown plus many surrounding villages. Bournemouth, the most populous town in the <b>conurbation,</b> {{was established in the}} Georgian era when sea bathing became popular. Poole, the second largest settlement (once the largest town in the county), adjoins Bournemouth to the west and contains the suburb of Sandbanks which has some of the highest land values by area in the world.|$|E

The Central Belt is where most of the main towns and cities are located, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth. Scotland's only major city outside the Central Belt is Aberdeen.|$|E

5|$|The Local Government Act 1958 {{designated}} the south east Lancashire area (which, despite its name, included part of north east Cheshire), a Special Review Area.

The review was abolished in favour of the Royal Commission on Local Government before issuing a final report.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{route to}} the town centre is the A338 spur road, a dual carriageway that connects to the A31 close to the Hampshire border. The A31 joins the M27 at Southampton and from there the M3 to London and the A34 to the Midlands and the North can be accessed. The main road west is the A35 to Honiton in Devon which runs through the South East Dorset <b>Conurbation</b> and continues east as far as Southampton, albeit as a non-primary route. The A350 in the neighbouring borough of Poole provides the only northern route out of the <b>conurbation.</b> National Express coaches serve Bournemouth Travel Interchange & Bournemouth University. There are frequent departures to London Victoria Coach Station and Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. Local buses are provided mainly by two companies, Wilts & Dorset, the former National Bus Company subsidiary and now owned by the Go-Ahead Group, and Yellow Buses, the former Bournemouth Council-owned company and successors to Bournemouth Corporation Transport, which began operating trams in 1902. Other operators serving the town include Damory Coaches and the Shaftesbury & District bus company.|$|E
