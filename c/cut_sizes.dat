They are engineered for long spans and are doubled up in places where a wall will be aligned over them, and sometimes tripled where heavy roof-loaded support walls are placed above them. They consist of a top and bottom chord or flange made from dimensional lumber with a webbing in-between made from oriented strand board (OSB). The webbing can be removed up to certain sizes or shapes according to the manufacturer's or engineer's specifications, but for small holes, wooden I-joists come with [...] "knockouts", which are perforated, pre-cut areas where holes can be made easily, typically without engineering approval. When large holes are needed, they can typically be made in the webbing only and only in the center third of the span; the top and bottom chords lose their integrity if <b>cut.</b> <b>Sizes</b> and shapes of the hole, and typically the placing of a hole itself, must be approved by an engineer prior to the cutting of the hole and in many areas, a sheet showing the calculations made by the engineer must be provided to the building inspection authorities before the hole will be approved.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} k-BALANCED PARTITIONING problem {{in which the}} {{vertices}} of a graph are to be partitioned into k sets of size at most ceil(n/k) while minimising the <b>cut</b> <b>size,</b> which {{is the number of}} edges connecting vertices in different sets. The problem is well studied for general graphs, for which it cannot be approximated within any factor in polynomial time. However, little is known about restricted graph classes. We show that for trees k-BALANCED PARTITIONING remains surprisingly hard. In particular, approximating the <b>cut</b> <b>size</b> is APX-hard even if the maximum degree of the tree is constant. If instead the diameter of the tree is bounded by a constant, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the <b>cut</b> <b>size</b> within n^c, for any constant c< 1. In the face of the hardness results, we show that allowing near-balanced solutions, in which there are at most (1 +eps) ceil(n/k) vertices in any of the k sets, admits a PTAS for trees. Remarkably, the computed <b>cut</b> <b>size</b> is no larger than that of an optimal balanced solution. In the final section of our paper, we harness results on embedding graph metrics into tree metrics to extend our PTAS for trees to general graphs. In addition to being conceptually simpler and easier to analyse, our scheme improves the best factor known on the <b>cut</b> <b>size</b> of near-balanced solutions from O(log^{ 1. 5 }(n) /eps^ 2) [Andreev and Räcke TCS 2006] to 0 (log n), for weighted graphs.

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{precedence}} constraints among vertices, the partitioning {{problem for}} time-multiplexed field-programmable gate arrays (TMFPGAs) {{is different from}} the traditional one. In this paper, we first derive logic formulations for the precedence-constrained partitioning problems and then transform the formulations into integer linear programs (ILPs). The ILPs can handle the precedence constraints and minimize <b>cut</b> <b>sizes</b> simultaneously. To enhance performance, we also propose a clustering method to reduce the problem size. Experimental results based on the Xilinx TMFPGA architecture show that our approach outperforms the list-scheduling (List), the network-flow-based (FBB-m) (Liu and Wong, 1998), and the probability-based (PAT) (Chao, 1999) methods by respective average improvements of 46. 6 %, 32. 3 %, and 21. 5 % in <b>cut</b> <b>sizes.</b> Our approach is practical and scales well to larger problems; the empirical runtime grows close to linearly in the circuit size. More importantly, our approach is very flexible and can readily extend to the partitioning problems with various objectives and constraints, which makes the ILP formulations superior alternatives to the TMFPGA partitioning problems.

The Bisection problem {{asks for}} a {{partition}} of the vertices of a graph into two equally sized sets, while minimizing the <b>cut</b> <b>size.</b> This {{is the number of}} edges connecting the two vertex sets. Bisection has been thoroughly studied in the past. However, only few results have been published that consider the parameterized complexity of this problem. We show that Bisection is FPT w. r. t. the minimum <b>cut</b> <b>size</b> if there is an optimum bisection that cuts into a given constant number of connected components. Our algorithm applies to the more general Balanced Bisep-arator problem where vertices need to be removed instead of edges. We prove that this problem is W[1]-hard w. r. t. the minimum <b>cut</b> <b>size</b> and the number of cut out components. For Bisection we further show that no polynomial-size kernels exist for the <b>cut</b> <b>size</b> parameter. In fact, we show this for all parameters that are polynomial in the input size and that do not increase when taking disjoint unions of graphs. We prove fixed-parameter tractability for the distance to constant cliquewidth if we are given the deletion set. This implies fixed-parameter algorithms for some well-studied parameters such as cluster vertex deletion number and feedback vertex set. ...|$|R

40|$|Melons are an {{important}} component of fresh fruit salads, however, they suffer from limited shelf life. Processing of melon fruit for use in fruit salads induces a number of changes including alterations in colour and texture. In addition, respiration rate and ethylene production are affected. Processing also elicits changes in flavour (sweetness) and aroma (production of volatile organic compounds – VOCs), of critical importance to the consumer. Several parameters govern shelf life; temperature is a critical factor. In this study we tested whether cut size is another parameter that can affect quality indicators. Melon (Cucumis melo ‘Arapaho’) cubes of three sizes were stored at 4 °C and assessed for quality at five time-points over a 15 -day period. We assessed a number of parameters including firmness, loss of fresh weight, respiration rate, antioxidant capacity, phenolic compounds and carotenoid content. In addition we measured VOC profiles to assess whether there were any qualitative changes associated with storage period and/or cut size. Fresh weight (FW) loss and respiration rate increased significantly with storage time and FW loss was affected by cut size. Total carotenoid levels remained stable during the storage time as did antioxidant capacity in all <b>cut</b> <b>sizes.</b> However, cinnamic acid levels tended to decrease in the last stage of the storage period and changes in β-carotene content correlated with cut size (though not significantly).
