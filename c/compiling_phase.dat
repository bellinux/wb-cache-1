Supporting hierarchy, domain specific building blocks, functional simulation and automatic code-generation, makes it well-suited {{for the design}} of control and signal processing systems. In this work, we propose an automated translation methodology for a subset of Simulink models to Synchronous dataflow Graphs (SDFGs) including the automatic code-generation of SDF-compatible embedded code. A translation of Simulink models to SDFGs, is very suitable due to Simulink actor-oriented modeling nature, allowing the application of several optimization techniques from the SDFG domain. Because of their well-defined semantics, SDFGs can be analyzed at <b>compiling</b> <b>phase</b> to obtain deadlock-free and memory-efficient schedules. In addition, several real-time analysis methods exist which allow throughput-optimal mappings of SDFGs to Multiprocessor on Chip (MPSoC) while guaranteeing upper-bounded latencies.

40|$|Buffer {{overflow}} {{happens when}} the runtime process loads more data into the buffer than its design capacity. Bad programming style and lack of security concern cause overflow vulnerabilities in almost all applications on all the platforms;Buffer overflow attack can target any data in stack or heap. The current solutions ignore the overflowed targets other than return address. Function pointer, for example, is a possible target of overflow attack. By overflowing the function pointer in stack or heap, the attacker could redirect the program control flow when the function pointer is dereferenced to make a function call. To address this problem we implemented protection against overflow attacks targeting function pointers. During <b>compiling</b> <b>phase,</b> our patch collects {{the set of the}} variables that might change the value of function pointers at runtime. During running phase, the set is protected by encryption before the value is saved in memory and decryption before the value is used. The function pointer protection will cover all the overflow attacks targeting function pointers;To further extend the protection to cover all possible overflowing targets, we implemented an anomaly detection which checks the program runtime behavior against control flow checking automata. The control flow checking automata are derived from the source codes of the application. A trust value is introduced to indicate how well the runtime program matches the automata. The attacks modifying the program behavior within the source codes could be detected;Both function pointer protection and control flow checking are compiler patches which require the access to source codes. To cover buffer overflow attack and enforce security policies regardless of source codes, we implemented a runtime monitor with stream automata. Stream automata extend the concept of security automata and edit automata. The monitor works on the interactions between two virtual entities: system and program. The security policies are expressed in stream automata which perform Truncation, Suppression, Insertion, Metamorphosis, Forcing, and Two-Way Forcing on the interactions. We implement a program/operating system monitor to detect overflow attack and a local network/Internet monitor to enforce honeywall policies...|$|E

One of the main concepts of XMG {{is the concept of}} dimensions. They are used to separate the different levels of linguistic description (syntax, semantics [...] .). The purpose of the STSM was to integrate a frame semantics dimension, which would allow to generate a Tree Adjoining Grammar where each tree is paired with a frame. 2 Description of the work carried out during the STSM The extensibility of XMG allows to add new levels of linguistic representation, with dedicated description languages and compiling modules (like solvers). We were concerned with the design of a dimension for frame representations, i. e. typed feature structures. The work therefore consisted of the following steps: The first step was to choose a description language for typed feature structures, adapted to describe frame fragments like the ones proposed in [1]. The unification of two typed feature structures implies the unification of their types, according to general type constraints or a given type hierarchy. The type unification rules used in [1] are given by the means of general fea-ture structure constraints. 1 The second step was to implement these constraints into the XMG processor, compute the set of valid types, and handle type unification. The last step was to connect these <b>compiling</b> <b>phases</b> together and write a toy metagrammar to illustrate some examples of frame fragments combination, including multi word expressions. This work was done thanks to constant collaboration with Timm Lichte and regular meetings with Laura Kallmeyer and Rainer Osswald (about one meeting every two days).

40|$|Introduction and rationale: Clinical {{experience}} with infants presenting with feeding difficulties and increasing referrals of infants with colic {{led to this}} study. There is uncertainty whether the speechlanguage therapist should {{play a role in}} the management of this condition. Despite extensive clinical research into the multiple factors related to the condition, the etiology of infantile colic has not yet been established. Suck- swallow-breathing coordination (SSBC), which is key to successful feeding, has not yet been investigated as a factor in this condition. Goals: The goal of the study was to give a comprehensive description of the symptoms and the SSBC of a group of young infants with colic. Sub-goal 1 was to compile a list of symptoms based on a description by parents of infants with infantile colic, which could be used to compare symptoms of a group of infants with the condition to a group without the condition. Sub-goal 2 was to describe SSBC, in a group of infants with the condition, by conducting a clinical assessment. Sub-goal 3 was to compare SSBC in a group of infants with colic to a group without the condition of the same age. Method: A descriptive survey design and interview guide was used in Phase 1. The parents of 60 infants with colic participated in this study. A correlation research design (Phase 2) and the List of symptoms for Infantile Colic (<b>compiled</b> in <b>Phase</b> 1) as well as the Assessment Protocol for SSBC (<b>compiled</b> in <b>Phase</b> 2) were used. A new research group of 50 participants with infantile colic and a control group of 28 participants with the condition, whose ages correlated with those of the research group, was selected. An interview was conducted with the parents of all participants. SSBC was clinically assessed in all the participants. Results: Parental description of infantile colic resulted in a comprehensive list of 27 symptoms. Audible swallowing of air and a feeding duration of more than 20 minutes were described more by parents than found in the literature. Statistically significant differences were found when the postural control and SSBC of the research group were compared with the control group. The difficulties with SSBC differed across the age categories of the participants. Conclusion: The study indicated that infantile colic is related to a disturbance in postural control and components of SSBC, and infants with the condition have subtle feeding difficulties. The speech-language therapist therefore has a role to play in the clinical assessment of infantile colic and the development of treatment strategies.

The results show that, at a given mass flow rate, the pressure drop nonlinearly increases as the vapor quality rises; At the low mass flow rate, with the increasing of vapor quality, the flow pattern is transferred to wavy flow from stratified flow and then transfer to stratified wavy flow, while the heat transfer coefficient decreases with the increasing of vapor quality. At the high mass flow rate, with the increasing of vapor quality, the flow pattern is transferred to annular flow from slug flow, while the heat transfer coefficient increases with the increasing of vapor quality. The simulation results agree well with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the development of}} an information system used to manage corrosion of metals and alloys by high temperature gases found in many different oil refining, petrochemical, power generation, and chemical processes. The database currently represents about 7. 9 million h of exposure time for about 5, 500 tests with 89 commercial alloys for a temperature range of 200 - 1, 200 °C. The system manages corrosion data from well-defined exposures and determines corrosion product stabilities. New models used in the analysis of thermochemical data for the Fe-Ni-Cr-Co-C-O-S-N-H system are being <b>compiled.</b> All known <b>phases</b> based upon combinations of the elements have been analyzed to allow complete assessments of corrosion product stabilities. Use of these data allows prediction of stable corrosion products and hence identification of the possible dominant corrosion mechanisms. The system {{has the potential to be}} used in corrosion research, alloy development, failure analysis, lifetime prediction, and process operations evaluations. The corrosion mechanisms emphasized are oxidation, sulfidation, sulfidation/oxidation, and carburization...|$|R
