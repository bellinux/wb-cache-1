50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1917, at the time Friz {{was working at the}} drawing board on his {{groundbreaking}} engine, the outlook for Rapp Motorenwerke was bad. The Army High Command wanted to commit itself to <b>a</b> few types <b>of</b> aircraft and aeroengine and then get these built under license by several companies. In the spring <b>of</b> 1917 <b>a</b> <b>commission</b> from the Reichswehr therefore inspected the Rapp engine plant. They had to decide which engines would in future have to be produced under license in Munich. In the end, the Rapp management was faced with the choice of manufacturing either Daimler or Benz engines. However, Franz Josef Popp seized the opportunity of presenting the new engine to the <b>commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts,</b> <b>an</b> engine which up to now had only existed in Max Friz’s drawings.|$|R

40|$|The thesis called "Expert proofs" {{deals with}} one of the types of proper {{evidence}} which is applied in cases when <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> report is necessary to clarify facts important for criminal trial proceedings. Thesis is divided into 5 basic chapters. The first chapter is introductory and talks about some of the general problems of expert laws - evaluation of the current legal regulations of expert's function - expert law and expert ordinance, especially {{from the point of view}} of the changes that these legal regulations have undergone as well as the forthcoming changes in the form of updating of the current law and preparation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brand new law. It also talks about definition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert,</b> especially the difference between a witness and a consultant, then briefly about their rights and duties in the criminal trial proceedings in general. The second chapter deals with the presence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> explicitly in criminal trial proceedings and is divided into three parts. The first one provides basic information about admitting <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> and its form. The second one concerns the definition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert's</b> assignment and the third one concerns preparation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> report, in which the expert familiarizes themselves with the criminal case.

40|$|The {{first step}} in the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> system is the extraction and charac-terization of the knowledge and skills <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert.</b> This step is widely regarded as the major bottleneck in the system develop-ment process To assist knowledge engi-neers and others who might be interested in the development <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> system, I offer (1) <b>a</b> working classification <b>of</b> meth-ods for extracting <b>an</b> <b>expert’s</b> knowledge, (2) some ideas about the types of data that the methods yield, and (3) <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> criteria by which the methods can be compared relative {{to the needs of the}} system develop-er The discussion highlights certain issues, including the contrast between the empiri-cal approach taken by experimental psy-chologists and the formalism-oriented approach that is generally taken by cognitive scientist...|$|R

30|$|Another {{important}} {{question is whether the}} Ease values can accurately predict diagnosis performance of the lesion images. If the Ease values are <b>a</b> good predictor <b>of</b> the diagnosis difficulty of the lesion images, participant performance should correlate with the predictions. It was also hypothesized that the MDT items’ accuracy should not correlate significantly with the Ease value in the pretest MDT, but the correlation should be significantly larger with same items in the post MDTs. The Ease algorithm effectively constitutes <b>a</b> simple model <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert.</b> Before training, participant performance should correlate poorly with the predictions <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> model. In contrast, trained participant performance should correlate highly with the predictions <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> model.|$|R
