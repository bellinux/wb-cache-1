5000|$|Early 5.45×39mm {{ballistics}} tests {{demonstrated a}} pronounced tumbling effect with high speed cameras. Some Western authorities believed this bullet {{was designed to}} tumble in flesh to increase wounding potential. At the time, {{it was believed that}} yawing and cavitation of projectiles were primarily responsible for tissue damage. Martin Fackler conducted a study with an AK-74 assault rifle using live pigs and ballistic gelatin; [...] "The result of our preset test indicate that the AK-74 bullet acts in the manner expected of a full-metal-cased military ammunition - it does not deform or fragment when striking soft tissues". Most organs and tissue were too flexible to be severely damaged by the temporary <b>cavity</b> <b>effect</b> caused by yaw and cavitation of a projectile. With the 5.45 mm bullet, tumbling produced a temporary cavity twice, at depths of 100 mm and 350 mm. This is similar to (but more rapid than) modern 7.62×39mm ammunition and to (non-fragmenting) 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition.|$|E

40|$|In many submillimeter-wave optical systems {{performance}} {{is in some}} way affected {{by the presence of}} standing waves. Usually these effects are studied empirically or only modeled to first-order by assuming a quasi-sinusoidal variation with distance and wavelength. In this paper we present an analytical technique to calculate the coupling between two corrugated horns including the total transmission and reflection properties. In our model we have combined the waveguide mode matching technique with a Gaussian beam mode description of the free space propagation. We illustrate the approach for the case of two coupled corrugated horns as the distance between them is varied. We furthermore present experimental test results confirming that multiple reflections do not always result in a classical periodic standing wave pattern. In particular when the horns are close together and the fields are not well matched, high Q <b>cavity</b> <b>effects</b> are observed resulting in irregular standing wave patterns. These <b>cavity</b> <b>effects</b> can be attributed to high-order modes which get trapped between transmitting and receiving horn.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} of traumatic ocular injury is helpful to make accurate diagnoses before the symptoms emerge and to develop specific eye protection. The comprehension {{of the dynamics of}} primary blast injury (PBI) mechanisms is a challenging issue. The question is whether the pressure wave propagation and reflection alone could cause ocular damage. To date, there are dissenting opinions and no conclusive evidence thereupon. A previous numerical investigation of blast trauma highlighted the dynamic effect of pressure propagation and its amplification by the geometry of the bony orbit, inducing a resonance <b>cavity</b> <b>effect</b> and a standing wave hazardous for eye tissues. The objective of the current work is to find experimental evidence of the numerically identified phenomenon.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the use of}} multispectral thermal imagery to retrieve land surface emissivity and temperature. Conversely to concurrent methods, the temperature emissivity separation (TES) method simply requires single overpass without any ancillary information. This is possible since TES makes use of an empirical relationship that estimates the minimum emissivity epsilon-min from the emissivity spectral contrast captured over several channels, so-called maximum-minimum difference (MMD). In previous studies, the epsilon-min-MMD empirical relationship of TES was calibrated and validated for various sensor spectral configurations, where the proposed calibrations involved single or linearly mixed spectra of emissivity at the leaf or soil level. However, <b>cavity</b> <b>effect</b> {{should be taken into}} account at the vegetation canopy level, to avoid an underestimation of emissivity, especially for intermediate vegetation conditions between bare soil and full vegetation cover. The current study aimed to evaluate the performances of the TES method when applied to vegetation canopies with <b>cavity</b> <b>effect.</b> We used the SAIL-Thermique model to simulate a library of emissivity spectra {{for a wide range of}} soil and plant conditions, and we addressed the spectral configurations of recent and forthcoming sensors. We obtained good results for calibration and validation over the simulated library, except for full cover canopies because of the TES gray body problem. Consistent with previous studies, the calibration/validation results were better with more channels that capture emissivity spectral contrast more efficiently. Our TES calibrations provided larger epsilon-min values as compared to former studies, especially for intermediate vegetation cover. We explained this trend by the simulated spectral library that involved numerous vegetation canopies with <b>cavity</b> <b>effect,</b> thereby shifting up the epsilon-min-MMD empirical relationship. Consequently, our TES calibration provided larger (respectively lower) estimates of emissivity (respectively radiometric temperature) that were likely to be more realistic as compared to previous calibrations. Finally, SAIL-Thermique simulations permitted to show that increasing Leaf Area Index induced a displacement of the (epsilon-min, MMD) pairs along the empirical relationship. This was consistent with the TES underlying assumption, where any change in epsilon-min induces changes in MMD since epsilon-max is bounded on [0. 98 - 1]. Further investigations should focus on validating the outcomes of the current study against ground-based measurements, and on assessing TES performances when accounting for instrumental and atmospheric perturbations...|$|E
