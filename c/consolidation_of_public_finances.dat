40|$|After {{ten years}} of {{relative}} respite, Belgium currently has to strengthen its fiscal policy in order to comply with new European requirements.

40|$|The report {{provides}} updated forecasts {{and analyses}} of the macroeconomic situation for the Euro area. •	The structural problems in emerging economies, the still mild recovery in the USA and the on-going crisis in the euro area will probably keep world economic growth subdued {{at least for the}} rest of 2013. •	Current and expected future monetary policy in Japan and, in particular, in the USA have heightened volatility in global bond and stock markets, including those of the euro area, though much less than during the crisis episodes. •	The process <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> in many euro area countries has become slightly less ambitious but it will continue to weigh on the economy in 2013, though less than in 2012. For this reason and for the lower expected global growth, we have revised downward our GDP forecasts for 2013 from previous reports. Now, we expect GDP to be - 0. 5 per cent lower in 2013 than in 2012, with considerable risks of an even stronger contraction. •	In 2014, when fiscal policy might be close to neutral, and if reforms continue to be, by and large, successfully implemented, the euro area economy should start to close its wide output gap with an expected GDP growth of about 1. 2 %, again subject to downwards risks. Moreover, this will not be sufficient to lower the unemployment rate, which actually could further increase to about 12. 5 %. •	The interest rates cut in May 2013 shows the will of the ECB to keep monetary policy expansive, but credit conditions and lending rates remain quite heteroge-neous across the member countries. •	Despite the interest rate cut, euro area inflation is still very likely to remain significantly below the ECB target throughout our forecasting period. Our inflation expectations for 2013 have moderated to a y-o-y rate of 1. 5 %, and they remain subdued also in 2014, at about 1. 4 %...|$|R

For the former the smoothing argument may be appropriate, but not for the latter. In the case of longevity, a trade-off between consolidation and increasing retirement ages becomes relevant, and there are strong arguments why the latter should be pursued by e. g. linking retirement ages to longevity. fertility; fiscal sustainability; longevity; Tax smoothing...|$|E

The global financial crisis and economic downturn have focused attention on the role of infrastructure renewal and development in economic recovery and stimulus.

This article analyses the context and emergent infrastructure funding and financing approaches, models and practices being formulated as part of a review of the City Deals in the UK. The experience of the City Deals raises critical questions about the emergent and recombinant forms of urban leadership and governance in cities and city-regions and the nature of centre-local relationships in the austerity state.|$|E

These institutions, created or reformed in depth in a context of large public deficits and increasing public debt-to-GDP ratios coupled with the regionalization of the Belgian state, are the result of a maturing process. The National Accounts Institute covers the positive side of the budgetary process, while the High Council of Finance deals with the normative side. Concerning the former domain, the creation of an independent institution to provide unbiased forecasts undeniably contributed to the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>finances</b> in Belgium. In the context of the revised Stability and Growth Pact, lessons drawn from the Belgian experience can certainly be useful for other Member States willing to improve their fiscal institutional settings.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{financial}} and economic crisis of 2008 / 2009, public debt in almost all OECD countries has increased significantly. The European debt crisis has further intensified {{over the past few}} weeks. Private households with high levels of wealth and income could be enlisted to help with refinancing and reducing this public debt through forced loans and one-off capital levies, without a risk of slowdown in consumer demand. This would also counteract the increased inequality in the distribution of wealth. Imposing such levies is not easy, however, since it involves valuation of assets and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. It is difficult to estimate the revenue effects of such a levy for the countries in crisis due to the current lack of sufficient data. For Germany, simulations by DIW Berlin based on a personal allowance of 250 000 euros (500 000 euros for married couples) give a tax base of 92 percent of the GDP. A forced loan or a levy of, for example, ten percent of this tax base could thus mobilize just over nine percent of the GDP-around 230 billion euros. This would affect the richest eight percent of the adult population. It would presumably also be possible to generate considerable revenue in the European crisis countries in the same way. This would be an important step towards <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>finances,</b> and would facilitate reforms to promote growth...|$|E
40|$|For some time, {{quite a few}} {{countries}} have been facing a serious crisis of public finances. This crisis fundamentally determines their everyday lives; therefore, {{it comes as no}} surprise that the changes within the field of public budgeting are labelled as priorities. In this context, the questions of advancement of the public sector management, the process of making more quality decisions about public spending and the increase in the responsibility of the budget users become particularly important. The introduction and the gradual improvement of performance budgeting is an indisputable manifestation of an effort to reform the area of financing public spending. Performance budgeting, as an advanced model of public budgeting, is a huge step forward in the direction of providing a better usage of budget funds, achieving <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>finances</b> and being more successful in meeting the public needs. As the financing of the public sector entities (organisations, institutions) is closely related to their performance, performance budgeting is also, to some extent, a suitable way to eliminate the shortcomings and modify the traditional 'philosophy' underlying the operation of the public sector, to rationalise the system of public expenditures and to manage them more successfully. Performance budgeting is complex by its nature and may not easily be performed in certain segments of the public sector. In many developed countries, it has been implemented for more than half a century. Monitoring and measuring the public sector performances, the increase in the scope and the improvement in the quality of public goods and provided public services are highly ranked goals in these countries, which are highly committed to instituting a more adequate control over the public funds and innovating their budget system in the direction of attaining the highest level of development...|$|E

40|$|Fiscal {{sustainability}} {{and economic}} growth are key concerns at the current juncture. The focus of tax policy has now shifted away from stimulus measures towards a much needed <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>finances,</b> made even more necessary {{in light of the}} difficulties currently faced by some Member States in refinancing their sovereign debt. At the same time, tax policies may {{play an important role in}} enhancing the growth potential of the EU economy, which is a goal per se but also a condition for making public finance sustainable. A growth-friendly tax structure is particularly important to cope with today's policy challenges. As a background for the analysis, the 2011 issue of the report ‘Tax reforms in EU Member States’, subtitled this year as ‘Tax policy challenges for economic growth and fiscal sustainability’, provides an overview of recent trends in tax revenues and of tax measures adopted in Member States in 2010 and the first half of 2011. In addition to these descriptive chapters, this year's report provides an analytical focus on two topics of particular relevance at the current juncture. The first analytical chapter of the report addresses the multi-faceted concept of the quality of taxation – particularly relevant for any future tax reforms – with a particular focus on the tax structure. A ‘good’ tax system should design taxes so as to reduce distortions to the minimum possible and, where appropriate, correct market failures. Well-designed tax reforms promoting employment and growth can go hand in hand with social equity. To avoid adverse interaction between cross-country tax systems, tax policies should benefit from an efficient coordination at the EU level. The second analytical chapter discusses three types of potential challenges in the area of tax policy currently faced by EU Member States: (i) addressing severe fiscal consolidation challenges also on the revenue side, (ii) making the overall tax structure more growth friendly and (iii) improving the design of the tax system for individual types of taxes. Applying an indicator-based approach, the report identifies in which euro-area Member States higher tax revenues might potentially contribute to consolidation and which countries might benefit from a shift from labour taxes, in particular those bearing on vulnerable groups, to consumption and real estate taxes. Analysing more specific horizontal challenges related to the design of individual taxes, the report concludes that almost all euro-area Member States face at least one challenge. financial crisis, tax policy, taxation, fiscal consolidation...|$|E
40|$|Das europäische Wirtschaftsmodell schein einen doppelten Wettbewerbsproblem ausgesetzt zu sein. Einerseits existieren enorme Niveauunterschiede hinsichtlich der Konkurrenzfähigkeit der diversen Mitgliedsländer der Eurozone und der EU untereinander was sich langfristig zu einem dramatischen Schuldenproblem stilisierte. Die erweiterten Staatsschulden sind nichts anderes als ein Symptom der mangelnder Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Auf der anderen Seite scheint das Europäische Wirtschaftsmodell der {{aggressive}} Entwicklungsorientierung des Fernen Ostens langfristig nicht folgen, zu können. Dieses externe Wettbewerbsproblem versucht man in Europa vorwiegend durch lohnpolitische Massnahmen wie Lohnsenkungen, durch Minderung der Staatsquote oder sogar durch reale Abwertung zu behandeln. Die Begrenzung auf die Konsolidierung der öffentlichen Finanzen kommt allerdings einem Versuch gleich allein die Symptome eines Problems zu behandeln. Dabei wird ein politisches Legitimationsproblem in die Welt gerufen das vorwiegend zwei Aspekte hat. Auf der einen Seite ein Problem der Souveränität in dem Sinne das die übertragenen Entscheidungskompetenzen der Einzelstaaten auf EU Instanz nicht etwa demokratisch legitimierten Gremien zugute kommt wie das Europaparlament sondern künstlich geschaffenen Gremien der Finanzüberwachung wie die Troika die direkter oder indirekter Weise unter dem Einfluss der mächtigsten Mitgliedstaaten steht. Somit entsteht auf der anderen Seite ein gewaltiges Demokratiedefizit. Dies kommt darin zum Ausdruck das von demokratisch gewählten Regierungen verlangt wird unpopuläre Sparprogramme durchsetzen selbst wenn sie dabei ihre Parlamente, Institutionen und Verfassungen umgehen müssen. Apparently the European {{economic model}} {{being subjected to}} a double competition problem. On the one hand, there are enormous differences {{in the level of}} competitiveness of the various member countries of the euro area and the EU among themselves. In the long term this Problem stylized to a dramatic debt crisis for one Part of the EU member States like Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy The advanced state debt are nothing more than a symptom of a lack of competitiveness. On the other hand, the European economic model seems to be not able not in the long term to follow the aggressive development orientation of the Far East. The dominant Forces into the EU tries to handle with this external competition problem mainly with wage policy measures such as wage cuts, a reduction in government expenditure or even with real depreciation. However, the limitation of political measures on the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>finances,</b> is an attempt to deal only with the symptoms of the problem. The Result is, that a political problem of legitimacy is called into the world that has mainly two aspects.

40|$|The global {{economic}} recovery which {{had begun in}} mid 2009 has continued, though its strength has varied from one region to another. The emerging economies have been the driving force, propelling the revival of international trade. The upturn is more gradual in the advanced economies, as is generally the case after an economic recession accompanied by a financial crisis. Moreover, {{there has been some}} loss of momentum {{in the past few months}} owing to the difficult transition to a self-sustaining recovery, as the fiscal stimuli initially introduced in the midst of the crisis are giving way to a general move towards the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>finances.</b> In the euro area, significant divergences have become apparent between the performance of the economies which have been able to take advantage of the strengthening foreign demand and that of countries facing major structural adjustments. In that context, the projections indicate that the recovery will be maintained, but will be weaker for a time than at the beginning of 2010. In Belgium, too, the hesitant revival in activity which had begun in the second half of 2009 was consolidated and has since been maintained. So far it has been slightly stronger than previously expected. Overall, following a contraction of 2. 7 p. c. in 2009, growth is forecast at 2. 1 p. c. in 2010 and 1. 8 p. c. in 2011, slightly outpacing growth in the euro area. In view of the slump in GDP during the recession, the resilience of the labour market was a welcome surprise. The decline in employment was both limited and short-lived: altogether, job losses totalled 38, 400 units between the end of 2008 and the end of 2009. These losses were already more or less offset by jobs created during the first two quarters of 2010. According to the projections, job creations are likely to exceed 56, 000 units during 2010, with a further 15, 000 units in 2011. The resilience of employment is due to the use of flexible arrangements during the period of the economic slowdown and to a decline in the hourly productivity. In that context, the unemployment rate increased from 7 p. c. in 2008 to 7. 9 p. c. in 2009 and 8. 5 p. c. in 2010. It is projected at 8. 6 p. c. in 2011. The recovery was initiated in 2009 by the end of the movement towards stock reduction and by the export revival triggered by the marked strengthening of international trade. Domestic demand excluding the change in stocks is also likely to gain momentum, boosted initially by private consumption. Households are in fact expected to reduce their savings ratio to its pre-crisis level, as uncertainties regarding the labour market prospects and the value of financial assets have receded. In 2011, housing and business investments will also start contributing to the growth of domestic demand. Inflation measured by the HICP is forecast to dip slightly during the coming year, so that – as an annual average – it will increase from the rate of 0 p. c. recorded in 2009 to 2. 3 p. c. this year before subsiding to 2. 1 p. c. in 2011. According to the latest data, Belgium’s public finances will end the year 2010 with a deficit of 4. 8 p. c. of GDP, which is a 1. 2 percentage point improvement on 2009. In the absence of a budget for the federal government and social security for 2011, assuming no policy change, and given the continuing consolidation of economic conditions, the deficit is forecast at 4. 7 p. c. The government debt ratio is projected to continue rising in 2010 and 2011, but at a much more modest pace than in the two previous years. In 2010, the debt ratio is estimated at 97. 6 p. c. of GDP. In 2011 it will rise further, to 99. 8 p. c. of GDP. Belgium, macroeconomic projection, Eurosystem...|$|E

It {{focuses on the}} role that <b>public</b> <b>finance</b> and fiscal policy can play to sustain economic growth, employment and competitiveness {{in the context of}} European strategy (Lisbon strategy and, now, Europe 2020). Stemming from a normative and theoretical framework we built a questionnaire to make an assessment of the Quality <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Finance</b> disclosure offered by a series of selected European Union members in their Stability and Convergence Programmes, released in 2007, 2009 and 2011. The empirical research allows us to identify an index to evaluate the fairness and reliability of the Quality <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Finance</b> disclosure provided by the European countries. The Quality <b>of</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Finance</b> disclosure does not appear satisfactory since any country goes beyond the index average, even though a tendency towards an enhancement emerged in 2011, also enforced by the launch of the European Semester.
