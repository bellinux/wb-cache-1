25|$|Bank vaults are {{typically}} made with steel-reinforced concrete. This material was not substantially {{different from that}} used in construction work. It relied on its immense thickness for strength. An ordinary vault {{from the middle of}} the 20th century might have been 18 in (45.72cm) thick and was quite heavy and difficult to remove or remodel around. Modern bank vaults are now typically made of modular concrete panels using a special proprietary blend of concrete and additives for extreme strength. The concrete has been engineered for maximum <b>crush</b> <b>resistance.</b> A panel of this material, though only 3 in (7.62cm) thick, may be up to 10 times as strong as an 18 in-thick (45.72-cm) panel of regular formula concrete.|$|E
25|$|The Allawi government, with {{significant}} numbers of holdovers from the Coalition Provisional Authority, began to engage in attempts to secure control of the oil infrastructure, the source of Iraq's foreign currency, {{and control of the}} major cities of Iraq. The continuing insurgencies, poor state of the Iraqi Army, disorganized condition of police and security forces, as well as the lack of revenue hampered their efforts to assert control. In addition, both former Ba'athist elements and militant Shia groups engaged in sabotage, terrorism, open rebellion, and establishing their own security zones in all or part of a dozen cities.

25|$|Civil {{wars in the}} 19th {{century and}} in the early 20th century tended to be short; civil wars between 1900 and 1944 lasted on average one and half years. The state itself formed the obvious center of {{authority}} in the majority of cases, and the civil wars were thus fought for control of the state. This meant that whoever had control of the capital and the military could normally <b>crush</b> <b>resistance.</b> A rebellion which failed to quickly seize the capital and control of the military for itself normally found itself doomed to rapid destruction. For example, the fighting associated with the 1871 Paris Commune occurred almost entirely in Paris, and ended quickly once the military sided with the government at Versailles and conquered Paris.|$|E
40|$|Background: Recent models {{suggest that}} {{escalating}} reciprocal selection among antagonistically interacting species {{is predicted to}} occur in areas of higher resource productivity. In a putatively coevolved interaction between a freshwater snail (Mexipyrgus churinceanus) and a molluscivorous cichlid (Herichthys minckleyi), we examined three components of this interaction: 1) spatial variation in two putative defensive traits, <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> and shell pigmentation; 2) whether abiotic variables or frequency of molariform cichlids are associated with spatial patterns of <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> and shell pigmentation and 3) whether variation in primary productivity accounted for small-scale variation in these defensive traits. Results: Using spatial autocorrelation to account for genetic and geographic divergence among populations, we found no autocorrelation among populations at small geographic and genetic distances for the two defensive traits. There was also no correlation between abiotic variables (temperature and conductivity) and snail defensive traits.

However, <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> and frequency of pigmented shells were negatively correlated with molariform frequency. <b>Crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> and levels of pigmentation were significantly higher in habitats dominated by aquatic macrophytes, and both traits are phenotypically correlated. Conclusion <b>Crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> and pigmentation of M. churinceanus exhibit striking variation at small spatial scales often associated with differences in primary productivity, substrate coloration {{and the frequency of}} molariform cichlids. These local geographic differences may result from among-habitat variation in how resource productivity interacts to promote escalation in prey defenses. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{geographic}} mosaic {{theory of}} coevolution predicts 1) spatial variation in predatory structures {{as well as}} prey defensive traits, and 2) trait matching in some areas and trait mismatching in others mediated by gene flow. We examined gene flow and documented spatial variation in <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> in the freshwater snails Mexipyrgus churinceanus, Mexithauma quadripaludium, Nymphophilus minckleyi, {{and its relationship to}} the relative frequency of the crushing morphotype in the trophically polymorphic fish Herichthys minckleyi. <b>Crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> and the frequency of the crushing morphotype did show spatial variation among 11 naturally replicated communities in the Cuatro Ciénegas valley in Mexico where these species are all endemic. The variation in <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> among populations was not explained by geographic proximity or by genetic similarity in any species. We detected clear phylogeographic patterns and limited gene flow for the snails but not for the fish. Gene flow among snail populations in Cuatro Ciénegas could explain the mosaic of local divergence in shell strength and be preventing the fixation of the crushing morphotype in Herichthys minckleyi. Finally, consistent with trait matching across the mosaic, the frequency of the fish morphotype was negatively correlated with shell <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> likely reflecting the relative disadvantage of the crushing morphotype in communities where the snails exhibit relativel...|$|R

Early in February 1918 General Jan Christiaan Smuts (a member of the Imperial War Cabinet) was sent to confer with Allenby regarding the implementation of the Joint Note. The French imposed an important qualification on the Joint Note; that no British troops in France could be deployed to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Smuts informed Allenby the intention was to reinforce the Egyptian Expeditionary Force with one and possibly a second Indian cavalry division from France, three divisions from Mesopotamia and more artillery and aeroplanes. Smuts also suggested crossing the Jordan, capturing the Hejaz Railway and using it to outflank Damascus.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the shell}} {{material}} in snails is composed of calcium carbonate but the organic shell matrix determines the properties of calcium carbonate crystals. It {{has been shown that}} the deposition of calcium carbonate is affected by the ingestion of organic compounds. We hypothesize that organic compounds not synthesized by the snails are important for shell strength and must be obtained from the diet. We tested this idea indirectly by evaluating whether the abundance of the organic matter that snails eat is related to the strength of their shells. We measured shell <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> in the snail Mexipyrgus churinceanus and the abundance of the most common aquatic macrophyte, the water lily Nymphaea ampla, in ten bodies of water in the valley of Cuatro Ciénegas, Mexico. We used stable isotopes to test the assumption that these snails feed on water lily organic matter. We also measured other factors that can affect <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance,</b> such as the density of crushing predators, snail density, water pH, and the concentration of calcium and phosphorus in the water. The isotope analysis suggested that snails assimilate water lily organic matter that is metabolized by sediment bacteria. The variable that best explained the variation in <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> found among sites was the local abundance of water lilies. We propose that the local amount of water lily organic matter provides organic compounds important in shell biomineralization, thus determining <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance.</b> Hence, we propose that a third trophic level could be important in the coevolution of snai...|$|R
