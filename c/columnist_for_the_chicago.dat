500|$|In 2003, Robert Feder, a <b>columnist</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> Sun-Times, said, [...] "It's {{the divorce}} that just keeps on giving: A decade after Steve Dahl and Garry Meier severed their legendary radio partnership, their breakup remains {{a source of}} {{bitterness}} and anger for them — and continuing fascination for their fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, Dahl {{broadcast}} with Detroit stations WABX and WWWW {{and later}} with Chicago stations WCKG, WDAI, WLUP, WMVP and WLS. He {{also served as}} a <b>columnist</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> Tribune in their Live section as the resident [...] "vice advisor" [...] until November 2010. Additionally, Dahl has served on the Board of Trustees at Columbia College Chicago.|$|E
500|$|The {{promotion}} {{met with}} some positive reviews. Time called it [...] "clever", and a <b>columnist</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> Tribune stated that Herb was [...] "one {{of the most}} famous men in America". Ultimately, however, the Herb promotion {{has been described as a}} flop. The advertising campaign lasted three months before it was discontinued. [...] One Burger King franchise owner stated that the problem was that [...] "there was absolutely no relevant message". Although some initial results were positive, the mystique was lost after Herb's appearance was revealed during the Super Bowl. Burger King's profits fell 40% in 1986. As a result of the poorly received campaign, Burger King dropped J. Walter Thompson from their future advertising. The US$200 million account was initially given to N. W. Ayer. After 18 months it went to another agency, as Ayer was having problems, and Burger King wanted to improve the bottom line.|$|E

5000|$|According to his New York Times {{obituary}} of January 23, 1999, Lederer {{was selling}} hats at T. S. Martin Department Store in Sioux City, Iowa, {{when he met}} Esther Pauline [...] "Eppie" [...] Friedman, who was engaged to another man; she and her identical twin sister Pauline Esther [...] "Popo" [...] were shopping for bridal veils for their double wedding. Jules and Esther fell in love and were married in a double ceremony. The two sisters would eventually become the writers of the widely syndicated advice columns, Ask Ann Landers and Dear Abby, respectively. Lederer's daughter Margo also became a newspaper <b>columnist,</b> writing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> Daily News.|$|R
500|$|Overall, {{reviews of}} the film were highly positive. Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman awarded the film an [...] "A" [...] grade, hailing the film as a [...] "procedural thriller for the {{information}} age" [...] that [...] "spins your head in a new way, luring you into a vortex and then deeper still." [...] Nathan Lee in his review for The Village Voice wrote that director Fincher's [...] "very lack of pretense, coupled with a determination to get the facts down with maximum economy and objectivity, gives Zodiac its hard, bright integrity. As a crime saga, newspaper drama, and period piece, it works just fine. As an allegory {{of life in the}} information age, it blew my mind." [...] Todd McCarthy's review in Variety praised the film's [...] "almost unerringly accurate evocation of the workaday San Francisco of 35–40 years ago. Forget the distorted emphasis on hippies and flower-power that many such films indulge in; this is the city as it was experienced by most people who lived and worked there." [...] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek magazine, wrote, [...] "Zodiac is meticulously crafted – Harris Savides's state-of-the-art digital cinematography has a richness indistinguishable from film – and it runs almost two hours and 40 minutes. Still, the movie holds you in its grip from start to finish. Fincher boldly (and some may think perversely) withholds the emotional and forensic payoff we're conditioned to expect from a big studio movie." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film 4 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "The film is a police procedural crossed with a newspaper movie, but free of most of the cliches of either. Its most impressive accomplishment is to gather a bewildering labyrinth of facts and suspicions over a period of years, and make the journey through this maze frightening and suspenseful." [...] Ebert also praised the casting (critical in an ensemble film) and, as a longtime <b>columnist</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Chicago</b> Sun-Times, asserted Zodiac was [...] "intriguing in its accuracy" [...] in showing the operation of a major newspaper.|$|E
2500|$|That fall, Paige faced {{off against}} major league star Dizzy Dean, who that season had won 30 regular season games plus two {{more in the}} World Series, in several {{exhibition}} games. In Cleveland, Paige struck out 13 while beating Dean 4–1, although for that game Dean was playing with a minor league team. Later, while playing in the California Winter League, Paige faced Dean in front of 18,000 fans in Los Angeles, with Dean's team including major league stars like Wally Berger. The two teams battled for thirteen innings, with Paige's team finally winning 1–0. Bill Veeck, future owner of the Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Browns, and Chicago White Sox, was watching the game and many years later described it as [...] "the greatest pitchers' battle I have ever seen." [...] Paige and Dean would continue to barnstorm against each other until 1945. Later, when Dean was a sports <b>columnist</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> Tribune, he called Paige [...] "the pitcher with the greatest stuff I ever saw." ...|$|E
