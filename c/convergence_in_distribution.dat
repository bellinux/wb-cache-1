40|$|Re-licensing {{requirements}} for professionals that move across borders {{is a widespread}} phenomenon. Yet, {{there is very little}} research that examines the effects of re-licensing requirements on immigrant welfare. This paper measures the importance of professional licensing requirements using unique data on the early labor market outcomes of Soviet immigrant physicians in Israel. Instrumental variables estimates that correct for nonrandom selection into licensing status, in a constant-effects model, yield an increase in monthly earnings due to license acquisition that is significant and considerably higher than indicated by OLS. However, examination of licensing effects on different quantiles of the distribution of immigrant earnings, using a quantile treatment effects model, indicates a more complex pattern in biases. The estimated quantile treatment effects model is also used to examine <b>convergence</b> <b>in</b> earnings <b>distribution</b> between immigrants and comparable natives. The contribution of license acquisition to <b>convergence</b> <b>in</b> earnings <b>distribution</b> is small, suggesting that licensing requirements do not merely serve as a barrier to entry that protects native professionals from competition...|$|R

Based on the convergence theorems, we propose a patch-based weighted means filter for removing an impulse noise and its mixture with a Gaussian noise by combining the essential idea of the trilateral filter {{and that of the}} non-local means filter. Experiments show that our filter is competitive compared to recently proposed methods. We also introduce the notion of degree of similarity to measure the impact of the similarity among patches on the non-local means filter for removing a Gaussian noise, as well as on our new filter for removing an impulse noise or a mixed noise. Using again the <b>convergence</b> theorem <b>in</b> <b>distribution,</b> together with the notion of degree of similarity, we obtain an estimation for the PSNR value of the denoised image by the non-local means filter or by the new proposed filter, which is close to the real PSNR value...|$|R
