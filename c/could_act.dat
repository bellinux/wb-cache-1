5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.|$|E
5|$|During {{the casting}} process, Parker and {{producer}} Alan Marshall began scouting locations in New York City. On January 20, 1986, he travelled to New Orleans, where he continued writing the script. Parker looked at unused buildings located on Royal Street that <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as a hotel, and an abandoned house on Magazine Street {{that would serve}} {{as the home of}} Margaret Krusemark (Rampling). He returned to New York City where he looked at Staten Island and Coney Island. Parker's script required a total of 78 locations in New York and New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Maya {{households}} interred {{their dead}} underneath the floors of their houses, with offerings {{appropriate to the}} social status of the family. There the dead <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as protective ancestors. Maya lineages were patrilineal, so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasized, often with a household shrine. As Maya society developed, and the elite became more powerful, Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs of their ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{benefits}} of more defensible forts are evident: they <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as temporary refuges for overwhelmed local troops during barbarian incursions, while they waited for reinforcements. The forts were difficult for the barbarians to take by assault, as they generally lacked the necessary equipment. The forts could store sufficient supplies to enable the defenders to hold {{out for a few}} weeks, and to supply relieving troops. They could also act as bases from which defenders could make sorties against isolated groups of barbarians and to cooperate with relieving forces.|$|E
5|$|The AV-8A's {{abilities}} in air-to-air combat were {{tested by the}} Marine Corps by conducting mock dogfights with McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs; these exercises trained pilots to use the vectoring-in-forward-flight (VIFF) capability to outmanoeuvre their opponents and showed that the Harriers <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as effective air-to-air fighters at close range. The success of Harrier operations countered scepticism of V/STOL aircraft, which had been judged to be expensive failures in the past. Marine Corps officers became convinced of the military advantages of the Harrier and pursued extensive development of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Regency Acts {{allow for}} regencies {{in the event}} of a monarch who is a minor or who is {{physically}} or mentally incapacitated. When a regency is necessary, the next qualified individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or incapacitated. Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that the Duke of Edinburgh (the Queen's husband) <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as regent in these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{conversion}} in 1625 onwards, Baltimore took care to cater for the religious needs of his colonists, both Catholic and Protestant. He had asked Simon Stock to provide priests for the 1625 expedition, but Stock's recruits arrived in England after Aston had sailed. Stock's own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded Baltimore's: in letters to De Propaganda Fide in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as a springboard for the conversion of natives not only in the New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number of 230873. She trained as a driver and mechanic and was awarded the rank of honorary junior commander five months later.|$|E

5|$|Land {{transport}} remained {{much more}} expensive than river or sea transport during the period. Many towns in this period, including York, Exeter and Lincoln, were linked to the oceans by navigable rivers and <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as seaports, with Bristol's port coming to dominate the lucrative trade in wine with Gascony by the 13th century, but shipbuilding generally remained on a modest scale and economically unimportant to England at this time. Transport remained very costly {{in comparison to the}} overall price of products. By the 13th century, groups of common carriers ran carting businesses, and carting brokers existed in London to link traders and carters. These used the four major land routes crossing England: Ermine Street, the Fosse Way, Icknield Street and Watling Street. A large number of bridges were built during the 12th century to improve the trade network.|$|E
5|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{questioned}} whether a royal affinity could actually {{work in the same}} way as a noble one. It has been suggested that since the king had to be a lord to his retainers and provide good lordship, but also king to the entire people, a contradiction existed, resulting in a decline in local stability where this occurred. At the same time, even powerful magnates such as Gaunt could cause local dissatisfaction by retaining some and, inevitably, excluding others. On the other hand, it has also been pointed out how, particularly for kings, recruitment into the affinity was a clear promotion which <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as an encouraging loyalty or offered a political amnesty.|$|E

5|$|The Postclassic Period {{was marked}} by changes from the {{preceding}} Classic Period. The once-great city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after continuous occupation of almost 2,000 years. Across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast, long-occupied cities in exposed locations were relocated, apparently due to a proliferation of warfare. Cities came to occupy more-easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines, with ditch-and-wall defences sometimes supplementing the protection provided by the natural terrain. One {{of the most important}} cities in the Guatemalan Highlands at this time was Q'umarkaj, the capital of the aggressive K'iche' kingdom. The government of Maya states, from the Yucatán to the Guatemalan highlands, was often organized as joint rule by a council. However, in practice one member of the council <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as a supreme ruler, while the other members served him as advisors.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, castles {{tended to}} lose their {{military}} significance due to the advent of powerful cannons and permanent artillery fortifications; as a result, castles became more important as residences and statements of power. A castle <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as a stronghold and prison but was also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers. Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle's appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still provided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences.|$|E
5|$|When Jebe and Subutai {{heard of}} the Rus' movements, they began moving east, away from the Rus, which was the only {{direction}} {{in which they could}} move. However, they left a rearguard of 1,000 under the command of an officer, Hamabek, to report of the Rus movements and act as bait. Soon, Mstislav the Bold reached the river opposite the rearguard, and it became apparent that no prince had been appointed commander-in-chief. Thus, all the princes <b>could</b> <b>act</b> as they pleased. Eventually, Mstislav crossed the river under heavy arrow fire. When the Rus landed, however, the Mongol numbers were too great, and the Rus' were killed to the last man.|$|E
