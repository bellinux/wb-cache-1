5|$|Baltimore's {{most famous}} {{institute}} of higher music {{education is the}} Peabody Institute's <b>Conservatory</b> of Music, founded in 1857 though instruction did not begin until 1868. The original grant from George Peabody funded an Academy of Music, which became the <b>Conservatory</b> in 1872. Lucien Southard was the first director of the <b>Conservatory.</b> In 1977, the <b>Conservatory</b> became affiliated with Johns Hopkins University.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of <b>conservatories</b> within South African climatic landscape. It {{discusses}} several <b>conservatories</b> built in South Africa, their design and function. <b>Conservatories</b> are an enclosed ‘intermediate area’ used as a design measure to create a passive solar environment for a climate responsive measure. The design and use of climate responsive technology and materials in buildings reduces the need for space air-conditioning. Thus, then enhances efforts towards designing and operating energy efficient buildings. An attempt {{should be made to}} take advantage of the natural phenomena surrounding the building, instead of fighting the influence of nature with expensive and often environmentally destructive heating, cooling, and lighting equipment and the energy they consumes. The importance of this paper is to give to a literature review on <b>conservatories</b> built in South Africa. It highlights the potential of using <b>conservatories</b> within South African climatic conditions, and provides a structural observation on the integrity of such a system. The paper looks at three <b>conservatories</b> constructed in the country, their application and the principal of the greenhouse effects within <b>conservatories...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg <b>Conservatory.</b> His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up teaching in the <b>Conservatory.</b> He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with tremendous vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having {{one of his own}} {{in the midst of the}} enemy camp.|$|E

5|$|Loving's early {{adulthood}} involved several stints in the U.S. Army as a musician, and later regimental bandleader.

5|$|Not {{long after}} Rimsky-Korsakov's dismissal, a student {{production}} of his opera Kashchey the Deathless was followed {{not with the}} scheduled concert but with a political demonstration, {{which led to a}} police ban on Rimsky-Korsakov's work. Due in part to widespread press coverage of these events, an immediate wave of outrage against the ban arose throughout Russia and abroad; liberals and intellectuals deluged the composer's residence with letters of sympathy, and even peasants who had not heard a note of Rimsky-Korsakov's music sent small monetary donations. Several faculty members of the St. Petersburg <b>Conservatory</b> resigned in protest, including Glazunov and Lyadov. Eventually, over 300 students walked out of the <b>Conservatory</b> in solidarity with Rimsky-Korsakov. By December he had been reinstated under a new director, Glazunov; Rimsky-Korsakov retired from the <b>Conservatory</b> in 1906. The political controversy continued with his opera The Golden Cockerel. Its implied criticism of monarchy, Russian imperialism and the Russo-Japanese War gave it little chance of passing the censors. The premiere was delayed until 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death, and even then it was performed in an adapted version.|$|E
50|$|It {{was thought}} that adding south-facing <b>conservatories</b> to British houses would reduce energy {{consumption}} by providing extra insulation and warmth from the sun. However, people tended to use the <b>conservatories</b> as living areas, installing heating and ultimately increasing overall energy consumption.|$|R

The billiard-room, which connected {{the house with the}} <b>conservatories,</b> was converted into an attractive greenhouse and the billiard table consigned to the basement. Shuttered windows in the State Dining Room could then be opened for dinner guests to look into the <b>conservatories.</b> This eliminated the billard table which many Americans regarded as either a gambling device or a rich man's toy.|$|R

5|$|The {{consequences}} of the decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among those who}} were dismissed from the <b>Conservatory</b> altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the <b>Conservatory</b> experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work to be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} an historical {{case study of}} the seven American independent <b>conservatories</b> of music still operating independently {{at the turn of}} the 20 th century, and why they, as opposed to more than 40 other <b>conservatories,</b> survived as independent entities. Historical background is provided about other institutions created as private and independent <b>conservatories,</b> but, due to financial exigencies and/or lack of enrollment during the 20 th century, ceased to exist or became part of more comprehensive institutions. ^ A variety of chief administrative officers, as well as key, long-term current and former faculty members were interviewed regarding each of the seven schools 2 ̆ 7 history, mission, leadership, and the nature of faculty and students related to the respective institutions. The data collection process involved use of unpublished books and dissertations, and archival materials, including school catalogs and accreditation reports. ^ Historical information was analyzed for similar patterns or clusters of historical circumstance (e. g., founding, endowments, faculty, etc.) which existed among the seven <b>conservatories</b> studied. Case study transcripts were coded and analyzed to determine whether there were emerging themes and whether it was possible to discern ways to reduce data to recurring themes. ^ Future research is warranted on those 40 or more <b>conservatories</b> which did not remain independent, student satisfaction at the present seven remaining independent <b>conservatories</b> of music, as well as contrasting those findings with students matriculating in music schools associated with or part of colleges and universities. Further study also is warranted on the full-time faculty of those seven remaining institutions, most of whom are underpaid in relation to their college and university counterparts. Also, it is important to learn what happens to the seven surviving music <b>conservatories</b> as their current faculty retires and faculty positions need to be filled. Finally, study of the application, enrollment, and outcome patterns of students matriculating at independent <b>conservatories</b> and college/university <b>conservatories</b> and music schools would help in understanding the differences, attractions, and relative appeal of the two types of institutions. ...|$|R

5|$|Between 1871 and 1874, {{while he}} lectured at the <b>Conservatory,</b> Rimsky-Korsakov {{thoroughly}} grounded himself in Western compositional techniques, {{and came to}} believe in the value of academic training for success as a composer. Once Rimsky-Korsakov had made this turn-around, Tchaikovsky considered him an esteemed colleague, and, if not the best of friends, was at least on friendly terms with him. When the other members of The Five became hostile toward Rimsky-Korsakov for his change of attitude, Tchaikovsky continued to support Rimsky-Korsakov morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing, and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Beginning in 1876, Tchaikovsky was a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home during his trips to Saint Petersburg. At one point, Tchaikovsky offered to have Rimsky-Korsakov appointed to the directorship of the Moscow <b>Conservatory,</b> but he refused.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his growing}} talent, Prokofiev's parents hesitated over {{starting}} their son on a musical career {{at such an}} early age, and considered the possibility of his attending a good high school in Moscow. By 1904, his mother had decided instead on Saint Petersburg, and she and Prokofiev visited the then capital to explore the possibility of moving there for his education. They were introduced to composer Alexander Glazunov, {{a professor at the}} Saint Petersburg <b>Conservatory,</b> who asked to see Prokofiev and his music; Prokofiev had composed two more operas, Desert Islands and The Feast during the Plague, and was working on his fourth, Undina. Glazunov was so impressed that he urged Prokofiev's mother to have her son apply for admission to the <b>Conservatory.</b> He passed the introductory tests and enrolled that year.|$|E
