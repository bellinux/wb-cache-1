40|$|A widely {{abundant}} and invasive forest shrub, Eupatorium adenophorum, was pyrolyzed in a cost-efficient flame <b>curtain</b> <b>kiln</b> to produce biochar. The resulting biochar fulfilled all {{the requirements for}} premium quality, according to the European Biochar Certificate. The biochar was either applied alone or mixed with fresh cow urine (1 : 1 volume) to test its capacity to serve as slow release fertilizer in a pumpkin field trial in Nepal. Treatments included cow-manure compost combined with (i) urine-only; (ii) biochar-only or (iii) urine-loaded biochar. All materials were applied directly to the root zone at a biochar dry matter content of 750 kg·ha− 1 before seeding. The urine-biochar treatment led to a pumpkin yield of 82. 6 t·ha− 1, an increase of more than 300 % compared with the treatment where only urine was applied, and an 85 % increase compared with the biochar-only treatment. This study showed {{for the first time}} that a low-dosage root zone application of urine-enhanced biochar led to substantial yield increases in a fertile silt loam soil. This was tentatively explained by the formation of organic coating of inner pore biochar surfaces by the urine impregnation, which improved the capacity of the biochar to capture and exchange plant nutrients...|$|E
40|$|A {{life-cycle}} assessment (LCA) using {{end point}} methods was performed for the generation and sequestration of one kg biochar by various pyrolysis methods suitable for rural tropical conditions. Flame <b>curtain</b> <b>kilns,</b> a novel, simple and cost-effective technology of biochar generation, {{were compared to}} earth mound non-improved kilns, retort kilns with off-gases combustion, pyrolytic cook-stoves allowing {{the use of the}} gas flame for cooking purposes, and iv) gasifiers with electricity production. The impact categories of climate change, particulate matter emissions, land use effects, minerals and fossil fuels were combined to provide the overall impact of biochar generation. In the LCA ranking, earth mound kilns were shown to have negative potential environmental impacts because of their gas and aerosol emissions. Flame <b>curtain</b> <b>kilns</b> had slightly lower potential impact than retort kilns and much lower impact than earth-mound kilns because of the avoidance of start-up wood and low material use and gas emissions. Making biochar from flame <b>curtain</b> <b>kilns</b> was observed to be environmentally neutral in a life-cycle perspective, as the production emissions were compensated for by carbon sequestration. Pyrolytic cook-stoves and gasifiers showed the most positive potential environmental impact in the LCA due to avoided firewood consumption and emissions from electricity generation, respectively. The generation and sequestration of biochar per se by flame <b>curtain</b> <b>kilns</b> was not found to result in direct environmental benefits. Co-benefits in the form of rural applicability, cost-efficiency and agricultural effects due to soil improvement are needed to warrant biochar implementation by this method...|$|R
40|$|Pyrolysis {{of organic}} waste or woody {{materials}} yields charcoal, a stable carbonaceous product {{that can be}} used for cooking or mixed into soil, in the latter case often termed "biochar". Traditional kiln technologies for charcoal production are slow and without treatment of the pyrolysis gases, resulting in emissions of gases (mainly methane and carbon monoxide) and aerosols that are both toxic and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. In retort kilns pyrolysis gases are led back to a combustion chamber. This can reduce emissions substantially, but is costly and consumes a considerable amount of valuable ignition material such as wood during start-up. To overcome these problems, a novel type of technology, the Kon-Tiki flame curtain pyrolysis, is proposed. This technology combines the simplicity of the traditional kiln with the combustion of pyrolysis gases in the flame curtain (similar to retort kilns), also avoiding use of external fuel for start-up. A field study in Nepal using various feedstocks showed char yields of 22 ± 5 % on a dry weight basis and 40 ± 11 % on a C basis. Biochars with high C contents (76 ± 9 %; n = 57), average surface areas (11 to 215 m 2 g- 1), low EPA 16 -PAHs (2. 3 to 6. 6 mg kg- 1) and high CECs (43 to 217 cmolc/kg) (average for all feedstocks, mainly woody shrubs) were obtained, in compliance with the European Biochar Certificate (EBC). Mean emission factors for the flame <b>curtain</b> <b>kilns</b> were (g kg- 1 biochar for all feedstocks); CO 2 = 4300 ± 1700, CO = 54 ± 35, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) = 6 ± 3, CH 4 = 30 ± 60, aerosols (PM 10) = 11 ± 15, total products of incomplete combustion (PIC) = 100 ± 83 and NOx = 0. 4 ± 0. 3. The flame <b>curtain</b> <b>kilns</b> emitted statistically significantly (p< 0. 05) lower amounts of CO, PIC and NOx than retort and traditional kilns, and higher amounts of CO 2. With benefits such as high quality biochar, low emission, no need for start-up fuel, fast pyrolysis time and, importantly, easy and cheap construction and operation the flame curtain technology represent a promising possibility for sustainable rural biochar production...|$|R
40|$|Biochar {{application}} to soils {{has been investigated}} {{as a means of}} improving soil fertility and mitigating climate change through soil carbon sequestration. In the present work, the invasive shrub "Eupatorium adenophorum" was utilized as a sustainable feedstock for making biochar under different pyrolysis conditions in Nepal. Biochar was produced using several different types of kilns; four sub types of flame <b>curtain</b> <b>kilns</b> (deep-cone metal kiln, steel shielded soil pit, conical soil pit and steel small cone), brick-made traditional kiln, traditional earth-mound kiln and top lift up draft (TLUD). The resultant biochars showed consistent pH (9. 1 ± 0. 3), cation exchange capacities (133 ± 37 cmolc kg- 1), organic carbon contents (73. 9 ± 6. 4 %) and surface areas (35 to 215 m 2 /g) for all kiln types. A pot trial with maize was carried out to investigate the effect on maize biomass production of the biochars made with various kilns, applied at 1 % and 4 % dosages. Biochars were either pretreated with hot or cold mineral nutrient enrichment (mixing with a nutrient solution before or after cooling down, respectively), or added separately from the same nutrient dosages to the soil. Significantly higher CEC (P 0. 05). At a dosage of 1 % biochar, the hot nutrient-enriched biochar led to significant increases of 153 % in above ground biomass production compared to cold nutrient-enriched biochar and 209 % compared to biochar added separately from the nutrients. Liquid nutrient enhancement of biochar thus improved fertilizer effectiveness compared to separate application of biochar and fertilizer...|$|R
