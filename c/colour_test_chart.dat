40|$|For many low-end applications, it {{is beyond}} reach to follow {{accepted}} procedures for making colour profiles for cameras. A camera colour profile {{for use in a}} colour management system usually involves photographing a carefully measured <b>colour</b> <b>test</b> <b>chart.</b> There still may be need to improve colour rendition of a camera even if one is without the luxury of a well-characterized reflective colour target. Computer displays may hold the key to a “poor man’s ” camera calibration chart. Even a display in good calibration raises the caution of those familiar with issues concerning instrumental metamerism. Several experiments described here show use of LCD displays for creating camera profiles and demonstrate that under best circumstances, the profiles are of fair quality. Even when using uncalibrated LCD displays, camera performance improves with colour profiles made from targets presented on screen. 1...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{follows the}} {{degradation}} of inkjet print by ultraviolet radiation and ozone effect for different types of papers. <b>Colour</b> <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> {{for the evaluation of}} accelerated ageing effect of ultraviolet light and gas fading were designed. These <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> were printed by dye-based inks on selected receiving media and exposed to ozone-enriched environment, UV radiation and their combination. The colorimetric values L* a* b* were calculated from spectral data of all patches of the <b>test</b> <b>charts.</b> The ozone effect on the prints was evaluated in the terms of total colour difference and dye concentration. The degradation of dye caused by ozone was observed also in a long-term period, after the contact of sample with ozone was terminated. Results of printed samples accelerated ageing by UV radiation and those that were influenced by the ozone effect were evaluated in the same way. It was found out that UV radiation and ozone treatment have a different effect on {{the degradation of}} dyes. The degradation rate is also strongly influenced by the receiving layer composition of papers used for inkjet printing. Also the catalytic effect of dyes was evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{present an}} {{assessment}} method to evaluate how the spectral power distribution of light influences {{the perception of}} colours and small colour differences. Included in the method {{are several ways to}} measure properties of reflected light with a spectroradiometer, visual assessments of perceived colours, and a visual performance test that aims at identifying an individual minimum colour contrast visibility threshold. In a first application of the assessment method, we used a <b>colour</b> contrast <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> printed on paper and studied it under the illumination of three LED light sources, halogen light and daylight. We concluded that the visual performance test was effective for reviling visibility thresholds for colour contrasts and that the method has potential for understanding the influence of spectral power distribution on perceived colour and visual performance. The methodology can be useful for optimizing illumination for individual needs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only Subjects in this stiudy were {{classified}} {{into one of}} three groups, age related maculopathy (ARM) pre-age related maculopathy (PARM) and age-matched contraols. we measured glare recovery time, contrast threshold, colour discrimination (using the desaturated version of D- 15 <b>colour</b> vision <b>test),</b> Amsler <b>charts</b> (conventional and at threshold) and questioned subjects regarding adaption difficulties. Those subjects designated as ARM and PARM, show significantly worse perfomance than age-matched norma;s on glare timre, contrast threshols and colour discrimination. They also report a greater incidence of subjective adaption difficulties in their daily lives. Total glare recovery time significantly correlated with contrast threshold, color discrimination loss, pressence of pigmentary disturbance at the macula, subjective adaption difficulties at at night and visual acuity loss. Glare recovery measurements in subjects with age related masulopathy provide a sensitive indicator of functional change which correlate well with many other clinical measures...|$|R

40|$|As printers, it is {{important}} to be able to produce accurate proofs before going to press. It is not a rare occurrence that a file looks different, depending on the output device used. This poses a problem for all parties involved with maintaining the accuracy of the print. The DocuColor 12 is a digital proofing device that has been SWOP (Specifications for Web Offset Publication) certified. SWOP certified machines should be able to print <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> that will have very similar, if not identical color measurements. This paper looks to verify this certification by printing a <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> and measuring the color patches. The DocuColor 12 was used to create a new profile, which was applied to the IT 8. 7 / 3 chart and these patches measured. The charts were measured with a GretagMacbeth SpectroScan spectrophotometer. The DocuColor 12 was profiled by printing an ECI 2002 <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> and calculating the profile with GretagMacbeth ProfileMaker 5. 01. The results showed that some of the colors had the same values as those specified by SWOP but some others were very different.

40|$|This thesis {{has focused}} on color {{reproduction}} processes in the graphics field {{and is based on}} theoretical research and practical studies. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate how new tools and tools adapted to a specific production set-up can be used to raise awareness regarding the quality and workflow of images and image processing for sheet-fed offset within the graphic industry. The work is divided in to the following three study areas with several sub-studies: 1) The first research goal of the thesis is to identify knowledge levels regarding color separation of images and demand specifications within printing houses. 2) The second research goal is to investigate whether novel tools and new terminology can help to increase the knowledge level regarding color management 3) The third goal is to investigate whether process specific adaptation of key color control tools can improve quality levels Three surveys about color reproduction (focusing on level of knowledge concerning color separation, the use of ICC-profiles and demand specifications for controlled color reproduction) at printing companies in Sweden were made between 2000 and 2004. The surveys indicated a serious problem in the graphic arts industry, involving both an insufficient understanding of color management and a lack of communication. An important part of the work was to assist in make color management understandable for users and thereby optimize printing. For this purpose, digital test forms have been developed. The developed tools, together with descriptive material, will facilitate the understanding of color management issues. Definitions within the field of color separations have been examined, and changes have been suggested. A new term for separation “Compensation by Black”, CB, has been suggested, instead of e. g. GCR and UCR. Is it possible to adapt the different parts of the process chain in order to achieve an improved production? Yes! This work has developed the method for adaptation of the scanne rtest <b>chart,</b> the printing <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> for image categorization and the control strip forsheet-fed offset using gray balance. This thesis suggests {{that it is possible to}} produce a custom-made IT 8 target <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> for scanners and achieve a result at least similar to or even better than the standard <b>test</b> <b>charts</b> on the market. This work has also shown that itis possible to adapt the <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> for printing to image category. The result showed that low-key image separated by the image-adapted <b>test</b> <b>chart</b> showed more detail in the dark areas than a low-key image separated by the standard <b>test</b> <b>chart,</b> in the prints on a coated paper. The result from the adaptation of a control strip for sheet-fed offset showed that gray balance can be used as a control parameter for quality control in sheet-fed offset. QC 2010061...|$|R
