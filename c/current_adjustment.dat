25|$|Adjustment {{of status}} (AOS) – Adjustment of status is {{for when the}} {{immigrant}} is in the United States and entered the U.S. legally. Except for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, the immigrant must also be in legal status {{at the time of}} applying for adjustment of status. For immediate relatives and other relative categories whose visa numbers are <b>current,</b> <b>adjustment</b> of status can be filed for at the same time with the petition (step 1 above). Adjustment of status is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. The USCIS conducts a series of background checks (including fingerprinting for FBI criminal background check and name checks) and makes a decision on the application. Once the adjustment of status application is accepted, the alien is allowed to stay in the United States even if the original period of authorized stay on the Form I-94 is expired, but he/she is generally not allowed to leave the country until the application is approved, or the application will be abandoned. If the alien has to leave the United States during this time, he/she can apply for travel documents at the USCIS with form I-131, also called Advance parole. If there is a potential risk that the applicant's work permit (visa) will expire or become invalid (laid off by the employer and visa sponsor) or the applicant wants to start working in the United States, while he/she is waiting for the decision about his/her application to change status, he/she can file form I-765, to get Employment Authorization Documents (also called EAD) and be able to continue or start working legally in the United States. In some cases, the applicant will be interviewed at a USCIS office, especially if it is a marriage-based adjustment from a K-1 visa, in which case both spouses (the US citizen and the applicant) will be interviewed by the USCIS. If the application is approved, the alien becomes an LPR, and the actual green card is mailed to the alien's last known mailing address.|$|E

Its patented gate switch technology, called Muxcapacitor, is pre-regulation capacitive voltage reduction technology which uses cascading capacitors to more efficiently store power on a chip.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{outcomes}} of open economy macroeconomics refers to a crucial importance of an investment-saving relation affecting a current account determination. However, despite a relative diversity in exchange rate regimes in European transition economies, {{there is still a}} substantial potential to analyze price effects of real exchange rate dynamics on <b>current</b> account <b>adjustments.</b> Rigorous investigation of relative changes in real exchange rates leading paths and associated <b>adjustments</b> in <b>current</b> accounts may reveal causal relationship between real exchange rate dynamics and international competitiveness in order to observe its redistributive effects. This purpose is even more significant provided that economic crisis has intensified cross-country expenditure shifting effects that still provide quite diverse and thus spurious effects on <b>current</b> account <b>adjustments.</b> In the paper we analyze main aspects of <b>current</b> account <b>adjustments</b> in European transition economies.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the impact of <b>current</b> account <b>adjustment</b> on the {{tradable}} and nontradable sector in member countries of currency union - Euro zone. The <b>current</b> account <b>adjustment</b> associated with the adjustment of the net export's deficit caused by the drop in the domestic absorption evokes the increase in the relative price of the nontradable sector. The paper discusses this hypothesis within framework of the Portuguese <b>current</b> account <b>adjustment,</b> which is the result of European financial integration in catching-up countries. The common monetary policy and common currency cannot offset the negative impact of nontradable price increase within the internal expenditure switching effect and also can not support exporters within the external expenditure effect [...] The Portuguese <b>current</b> account <b>adjustment</b> was not followed by the currency depreciation and the tradable price increase. The cost of the currency asymmetric response were born by the tradable mark-up decrease, the falling decrease in nontradable wages and employment and finally by the nontradable mark-up and employment decrease. current account, common currency, tradable sector, nontradable sector...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{standard}} model of international transfer is augmented by {{the introduction of}} firm heterogeneity. The increase in aggregate exports in response to the transfer reflects extensive and intensive adjustments, as the sales of new exporting firms (extensive margin) contribute to the <b>current</b> account <b>adjustment</b> along with the sales of existing exporting firms (intensive margin). The relative size of the intensive and extensive margins of the adjustment is determined by the size dispersion of firms. The model calibrated to the observed distribution of firm sizes shows that the intensive margin is the predominant channel of the <b>current</b> account <b>adjustment.</b> The dampening effect of the extensive margin has therefore very little impact on the exchange rate adjustment. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{episodes of}} <b>current</b> account <b>adjustment</b> in industrial countries {{over the past}} 30 years. We find that they were typically associated with a sizeable slowdown in domestic growth and a large exchange rate depreciation. There was no discernable change {{in the nature of}} capital flows in the period just prior to an adjustment, {{with the possible exception of}} non-residents' holdings of currency and deposits. This suggests that a <b>current</b> account <b>adjustment</b> may be an endogenous event - responding to the resolution of domestic imbalances - rather than an exogenous event where the size of the current account deficit itself precipitates the adjustment in the domestic economy and the exchange rate. Econometric evidence suggests that global developments trigger the adjustment, possibly because they trigger the unwinding of the domestic imbalances. We find that the bulk of the ex post adjustment of the financial account was in private sector flows, primarily on the part of foreign investors. Finally, we document some notable differences in the <b>adjustment</b> of the <b>current</b> account in the United States in 1987 compared with that observed in the other episodes.

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about {{prospects}} for U. S. <b>current</b> account <b>adjustment,</b> including the possibility of what is sometimes referred to as a "disorderly correction": a sharp fall in the exchange rate that boosts interest rates, depresses stock prices, and weakens economic activity. This paper assesses some of the empirical evidence bearing on the likelihood of the disorderly correction scenario, drawing on the experience of previous <b>current</b> account <b>adjustments</b> in industrial economies. We examined the paths of key economic performance indicators before, during, and after the onset of adjustment, building on the analysis of Freund (2000). We found little evidence among past adjustment episodes of the features highlighted by the disorderly correction hypothesis. Although some episodes in our sample experienced significant shortfalls in GDP growth after the onset of adjustment, these shortfalls were not associated with significant and sustained depreciations of real exchange rates, increases in real interest rates, or declines in real stock prices. By contrast, it was among the episodes where GDP growth picked up during adjustment that the most substantial depreciations of real exchange rates occurred. These findings do not preclude the possibility that future <b>current</b> account <b>adjustments</b> could be disruptive, but they weaken the historical basis for predicting such an outcome.
