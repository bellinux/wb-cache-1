5000|$|In {{this new}} growth {{period of the}} early 1990s the company led the way and {{did a lot of}} new {{innovative}} things in the map industry. They were the first map company to start a map education foundation that trained teachers on geography and interesting map lessons and donated map materials to area schools. They were also the first map publishing company to set up a <b>computer</b> <b>map</b> database that could have sections checked out by cartographers, updated, and them checked back in to a live digital map library with date stamps to keep track of what was edited. They also solved many software digital mapping problems that other companies still use today. And they were the first map company to set up a digital map page and grid look-up system for the whole world. Many old-time TBM map book users can still tell you what page and grid they live on, even though they stopped using the map books years ago. [...] After conversion and completion of all of their pen and ink map atlases to digital format in the mid-1990s, map data became a significant part of TBM company sales. The company had large data contracts in the 1990s with the California CHP, large utilities, and many area cities and counties. The Thomas Brothers map database had a monopoly in the 1990s, since they had the best street address indexes in them, making them very good for address matching for businesses. Because sales of its last produced guidebooks for Washington, D.C., and Virginia did not sell as expected and much money was lost on the Web site store design, the company was in major debt, and was purchased by and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Rand McNally in 1999. The company took a new radical direction in November 2003 and let go many of Thomas Brothers' most skilled cartographers and employees.|$|E

A known solution technique for networks with both directed and undirected arcs (both one-way and two-way streets) in which the degree of each vertex is an even number is also reviewed. A solution technique for these mixed networks in which some vertices have odd degree is presented. This technique is based on the before mentioned technique and requires the solution of a minimum cost flow problem on a network that is an extension of the original network. Some of the additional arcs in this network have gain factors (i. e., the flow leaving these arcs equals the flow entering times the gain factor) and the flows are required to be integer valued. networks/graphs, transportation, mathematics: combinatorics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Computer</b> <b>mapping</b> is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} technique that can assist police departments {{in a variety}} of ways. <b>Computer</b> <b>mapping</b> techniques can be classified into three general categories: descriptive, analytical and interactive mapping. Descriptive mapping shows data in a pin map or shaded area format. Analytical mapping starts with analysis of data followed by automatically displaying the results on a map. such as the identification and display of crime "hot spots " in a city. Interactive mapping allows a user to cycle through a series of steps starting with making queries against a database, mapping the results, making a decision from the maps and starting anew with another query. This chapter provides examples of each type, with emphasis on how <b>computer</b> <b>mapping</b> can assist police operations. The final sections discuss the steps necessary to establish a <b>computer</b> <b>mapping</b> system, and what we can expect in the future. Computerized mapping is a rapidly developing technology that assists police departments in strategic planning, operations and crime analysis. In this chapter, we explore the benefits of computerized mapping by describing a variety of applications for police departments. These applications range from the production of simple pin maps to interactive mapping for geographical analysis. This chapter has four major sections. First, an overview of the evolution of mapping technology in the law enforcement field is presented. Second, several mapping techniques used by law enforcement agencies are dis...|$|R
40|$|Geometrically {{corrected}} and temporally registered Landsat {{data collected}} over Vigo and Tippecanoe Counties, Indiana {{have been used}} to produce computer-aided soil maps at 1 : 24, 000 scale. A tabulation was made of selected soil properties such as soil color tones, drainage parameters, available water capacity, water permeability, erosion, drought resistance, organic matter content, fertilizer and lime requirement, and topography. These observations were recorded and used as a basis for grouping soil mapping units into a 2 ̆ 2 comprehensive, interpretive 2 ̆ 2 <b>computer</b> <b>map</b> using the 2 ̆ 2 Printresults 2 ̆ 2 LARSYS processor. Soil maps obtained with such data have considerable implications in agricultural planning, in utilization of land resources, and especially in yield prediction for each soil unit after soils are identified and mapped. The yield prediction obtained by satellite data can be easily extended geographically from one area to another. A comprehensive soil map can be very useful for showing salt and sodium accumulation on the soil surface or for indicating levels of organic matter in cropping systems as a guide to fertilizer usage. The conclusions of the study are that the use of Landsat MSS data for automatic mapping of soil information appears very feasible. The information maps based on soil characteristics are relevant to farmers, planners, economists and other users interested in evaluation of soil resources...|$|E
40|$|Dental {{impression}} {{materials are}} used to create an inverse replica of the dental hard and soft tissues, and are used in processes such as the fabrication of crowns and bridges. The accuracy and dimensional stability of impression materials are of paramount importance {{to the accuracy of}} fit of the resultant prosthesis. Conventional methods for assessing the dimensional stability of impression materials are two-dimensional (2 D), and assess shrinkage or expansion between selected fixed points on the impression. In this study, dimensional changes in four impression materials were assessed using an established 2 D and an experimental three-dimensional (3 D) technique. The former involved measurement of the distance between reference points on the impression; the latter a contact scanning method for producing a <b>computer</b> <b>map</b> of the impression surface showing localised expansion, contraction and warpage. Dimensional changes were assessed as a function of storage times and moisture contamination comparable to that found in clinical situations. It was evident that dimensional changes observed using the 3 D technique were not always apparent using the 2 D technique, and that the former offers certain advantages in terms of assessing dimensional accuracy and predictability of impression methods. There are, however, drawbacks associated with 3 D techniques such as the more time-consuming nature of the data acquisition and difficulty in statistically analysing the data...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} an empirical model {{based on a}} GIS approach, which was constructed to estimate the large-scale carbon ¯uxes over the entire Russian tundra zone. The model has four main blocks: (i) the <b>computer</b> <b>map</b> of tundra landscapes; (ii) data base of long-term weather records; (iii) the submodel of phytomass seasonal dynamics; and (iv) the submodel of carbon ¯uxes. The model uses exclusively original in situ diurnal CO 2 ¯ux chamber measurements (423 sample plots) conducted during six ®eld seasons (1993 ± 98). The research sites represent the main tundra biome landscapes (arctic, typical, south shrub and mountain tundras) in the latitudinal diapason of 65 ± 74 °N and longitudinal pro®le of 63 °E± 172 °W. The greatest possible diversity of major ecosystem types within the different landscapes was investigated. The majority of the phytomass data used {{was obtained from the}} same sample plots. The submodel of carbon ¯uxes has two dependent [GPP, Gross Respiration (GR) ] and several input variables (air temperature, PAR, aboveground phytomass components). The model demonstrates a good correspondence with other independent regional and biome estimates and carbon ¯ux seasonal patterns. The annual GPP of Russian tundra zone for the area of 235 ¥ 106 ha was estimated as ± 485. 8 K 34. 6 ¥ 106 tC, GR as + 474. 2 K 35. 0 ¥ 106 tC, and NF as ± 11. 6 K 40. 8 ¥ 106 tC, which possibly corresponds to an equilibrium state of carbon balance during the climatic period studied (the ®rst half of the 20 th century).

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with how to measure and investigate changes in the recreational behaviour and the required recreational space in Polish seaside recreational areas in last few years. Spatial information {{is an integral part}} of the identification and analysis of recreational behaviour and required recreational space. We postulate, therefore, that spatial information should be fully incorporated in integrated object-oriented GIS and Decision Support Technology. We argue in this paper that the existing theoretical approaches with their descriptive and technical basis do not offer directions for its application and evaluation. They do not seek to explain the processes undergone by spatial information, nor define appropriate data models. New approaches to GIS use object-oriented structures and expert systems concepts, and they will become increasingly helpful in understanding GIS. It is not unreasonable to expect that the most important issue is to use a data model or object-oriented models which closely represent the user's concept of the geographic object for representing spatial phenomena. We have discovered that most Polish users in this field are unable to collect the data they require directly. Thus they have to use methods and techniques, which cannot be found in GIS such as SWOT analysis. According to our experiences, the identification and analysis of the recreational behaviour and the required recreational space should be defined as a system approach where: (i) recreational space requires an object, (ii) state of recreational space is defined by the set of values of recreational space features, and (iii) the utility of the recreational space is defined by a set of features. The identification and analysis of the recreational behaviour in the presented approach are based on the features/utilities matrix of the recreational space and the <b>computer</b> <b>map.</b> The development of such a system needs many organizational changes. It is shown that in many applications organizational rather than the technical aspects of GIS determine their future and open the way to new spatial analytical techniques...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} change in the U. K. government policy regarding the establishment of new towns. The emphasis is now on the redevelopment of existing cities rather than on building new ones. This has created an urgent need to carry out detailed surveys and inventories of many aspects of urban land use in metropolitan areas: this study concentrates on just one aspect - urban open space. In the first stage a comparison was made between 1 : 10, 000 scale black and white and 1 : 10, 000 scale colour infra-red aerial photographs, to compare the type and amount of open space information which could be obtained from these two sources. The advantages of using colour infra-red photography were clearly demonstrated in this comparison. The second stage was the use of colour infra-red photography as the sole source of data to survey and map the urban open space of a sample area in Merseyside Metropolitan County. This sample area comprised eleven 1 / 4 km 2 squares, on each of which a 20 m x 20 m grid cell was placed to record, directly from the photography, 625 sets of data. Each set of data recorded the type and amount of open space, its surface cover, maintenance status and management. The data recorded were fed into a computer and a suite of programs was developed to provide output in both <b>computer</b> <b>map</b> and statistical form, for each of the eleven - 1 / 4 km 2 -sample areas. The third stage involved a comparison of open space data with socio-economic status.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{continuous}} and retrospective passive monitoring techniques have been employed {{in this study}} {{to carry out a}} comprehensive assessment of heavy metal dispersion and deposition from a secondary lead smelting complex. The principal period of monitoring was designed to coincide with contemporaneous changes in the operation of the complex involving, the incorporation of new smelting and refining centres. The initial phase of the sampling programme began with a preliminary multi-element survey to establish the degree of communality between different metals in smelter emissions and their interrelationships with background factors. Heavy metal deposition was monitored at bimonthly intervals over a two year period at 40 bulk precipitation sites located within an area of 250 km[sup]- 2. In a complementary survey suspended moss-bags were collected at bimonthly intervals from 60 sites over a period of one year. Bimonthly levels of Pb deposition at these sites ranged from 7. 0 to 1148 g ha[sup]- 1 in bulk precipitation and 31 to 1792 mg kg[sup]- 1 in moss-bags. The longer term pollution effects resulting from smelter emissions were assessed by determining retrospective heavy metal accumulations in saxicolous lichens and coniferous woodland soil profiles. The results of these surveys have been subjected to a range of interactive computer application packages including statistical analysis, computer mapping and plotting techniques. In the largest of these exercises, a series of 68 two-dimensional and 3 -dimensional <b>computer</b> <b>map</b> projections are used to model patterns of heavy metal dispersion and deposition from the smelting complex. The surface profiles produced in these map projections reveal distinctive patterns of severe fugative pollution close to their source region and highly consistent linear stack emission trends largely moderated by the effects of local topographic relief. Local topographic expression is considered {{to be the most important}} single determinant influencing the atmospheric dispersion and deposition of heavy metal emissions. The development of locally induced wind patterns appear to largely suppress the vertical dispersion of emissions, leading to higher incident levels of heavy metal pollution within the local system of valleys. Relatively low levels of metal pollution were encountered away from these areas of low elevation during the early monitoring phase, but were later supplanted by more acute pollution effects, up to 500...|$|E
