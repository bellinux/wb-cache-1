40|$|Migratory {{orientation}} in birds involves an inclination <b>compass</b> <b>based</b> on radical-pair processes. Under certain light regimes, however, “fixed-direction” responses are observed {{that do not}} undergo the seasonal change between spring and autumn typical for migratory orientation. To identify the underlying transduction mechanisms, we analyzed a fixed-direction response under a combination of 502 nm turquoise and 590 nm yellow light, with migratory orientation under 565 nm green light serving as the control. High-frequency fields, diagnostic for a radical-pair mechanism, disrupted migratory orientation without affecting fixed-direction responses. Local anaesthesia of the upper beak where magnetite is found in birds, in contrast, disrupted the fixed-direction response without affecting migratory orientation. The two types of responses are thus based on different physical principles, with the <b>compass</b> response <b>based</b> on a radical pair mechanism and the fixed-direction responses probably originating in magnetite-based receptors in the upper beak. Directional input from these receptors seems to affect the behavior only when the regular inclination compass does not work properly. Evolutionary considerations suggest that magnetite-based receptors may represent an ancient mechanism that, in birds, {{has been replaced by}} the modern inclination <b>compass</b> <b>based</b> on radical-pair processes now used for directional orientation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{a kind of}} {{pedestrian}} {{navigation system}} (PNS) that based on Earth’s magnetic field is introduced, and the error of the build-in electronic compass is analyzed, and an efficient calibration algorithm is presented. The PNS is determined pedestrian’s movement locus by calculating the heading angle and analyzing the movement characteristic, and then using the dead reckoning algorithm to combine the information together. The precision of PNS {{is affected by the}} error of the electric compass, because the heading angle is calculated from the magnetic field data measured by the compass. In order to reduce the measure error, a direct method which is used to calibrate the <b>compass,</b> <b>based</b> on ellipsoid fitting, is developed...|$|R
40|$|The Radical Pair Model {{proposes that}} the avian {{magnetic}} <b>compass</b> is <b>based</b> on spin-chemical processes: since the ratio {{between the two}} spin states singlet and triplet of radical pairs depends on their alignment in the magnetic field, it can provide information on magnetic directions. Cryptochromes, blue light-absorbing flavoproteins, with flavin adenine dinucleotide as chromophore, are suggested as molecules forming the radical pairs underlying magnetoreception. When activated by light, cryptochromes undergo a redox cycle, {{in the course of}} which radical pairs are generated during photo-reduction as well as during light-independent re-oxidation. This raised the question as to which radical pair is crucial for mediating magnetic directions. Here, we present the results from behavioural experiments with intermittent light and magnetic field pulses that clearly show that magnetoreception is possible in the dark interval, pointing to the radical pair formed during flavin re-oxidation. This differs from the mechanism considered for cryptochrome signalling the presence of light and rules out most current models of an avian magnetic <b>compass</b> <b>based</b> on the radical pair generated during photo-reduction. Using the radical pair formed during re-oxidation may represent a specific adaptation of the avian magnetic compass...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical studies {{indicating}} {{the presence of}} long-lived coherence in the avian compass system have engendered the question of sustained coherence in the realistic radical pair system. In this manuscript we investigate this question along with the study of coherence dynamics in these systems. We show, for a realistic compass system, the sustenance of long-lived coherence is highly unlikely and depends strongly on the interactions with the nuclear hyperfine environment. We also study the role of various hyperfine interactions on the coherence and compass sensitivity and establish hyperfine anisotropy as an essential quantity for sensitive functioning of the <b>compass.</b> <b>Based</b> on this study we propose a regime of compass parameters where it shows good sensitivity without having sustained coherence. This work weakens the role of sustained coherence in {{the functioning of the}} avian compass...|$|R

More information is available at www. ucalgary. ca/~ygao. In Inertial Navigation System (INS) attitude estimation dominates the accuracy of velocity and position estimation. Traditional gyro-based attitude estimation assisted with Kalman filtering is subject to unbound error growth with time especially as using low-cost Micro-Electro-Mechanical System-based (MEMS-based) sensors for land vehicle application.

40|$|International audienceIn {{an outdoor}} {{autonomous}} navigational context, classic compass sensors such as magnetometers {{have to deal}} with unpredictable magnetic disturbances. In this paper, we propose to get inspiration from the insect navigational abilities to design a celestial <b>compass</b> <b>based</b> on linear polarization of ultraviolet (UV) skylight. To compute the solar meridian relative orientation, our 3 D-printed celestial compass uses only two pixels created by two UV-light photo-sensors topped with linear polarizers arranged orthogonally to each other, in the same manner that was observed in insects' Dorsal Rim Area ommatidia. The compass was then embedded on our hexapod walking robot called Hexabot. We first tested the UV-polarized light compass to compensate for yaw random disturbances. We then used the compass to maintain Hexabot's heading direction constant in a straightforward task, knowing the robot has important yaw drifts. Experiments under various meteorological conditions provided steady state heading direction errors from 0. 3 ° under clear sky conditions to 1. 9 ° under overcast sky, which suggests interesting precision and reliability to make this optical compass suitable for robotics...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that more than 50 species use the Earth's {{magnetic}} field for orientation and navigation. Intensive studies particularly behavior experiments with birds, provide support for a chemical <b>compass</b> <b>based</b> on magnetically sensitive free radical reactions {{as a source of}} this sense. However, the fundamental question of how quantum coherence plays an essential role in such a chemical compass model of avian magnetoreception yet remains controversial. Here, we show that the essence of the chemical compass model can be understood in analogy to a quantum interferometer exploiting global quantum coherence rather than any subsystem coherence. Within the framework of quantum metrology, we quantify global quantum coherence and correlate it with the function of chemical magnetoreception. Our results allow us to understand and predict how various factors can affect the performance of a chemical compass from the unique perspective of quantum coherence assisted metrology. This represents a crucial step to affirm a direct connection between quantum coherence and the function of a chemical compass. Comment: 6 pages, published version, references adde...|$|R

40|$|The {{orientation}} {{system of}} migratory birds {{consists of a}} magnetic <b>compass</b> and <b>compasses</b> <b>based</b> upon celestial cues. In many places, magnetic compass directions and true or geographic compass directions differ (referred to as magnetic declination). It has been demonstrated experimentally in several species that the innate preferred direction of magnetic orientation can be calibrated by celestial rotation, an indicator of geographic directions. This calibration process brings {{the two types of}} compass into conformity and provides the birds with a mechanism that compensates for the spatial variation in magnetic declination. Calibration of magnetic orientation has heretofore been demonstrated only with hand-raised birds exposed to very large declination (90 ° or more). Here we show that the magnetic orientation of wild birds from near Albany, New York, USA (declination = 14 ° W) was N–S, a clockwise shift of 26 ° from the NNW–SSE direction of birds raised entirely indoors. Hand-raised birds having visual experience with either the daytime sky or both day and night sky orientated N–S, similar to wild-caught birds. These data provide the first confirmation that calibration of magnetic orientation occurs under natural conditions and in response to modest declination values...|$|R
