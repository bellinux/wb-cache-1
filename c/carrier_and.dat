40|$|The {{discrete}} element {{method is}} used to investigate adhesive particle mixing {{in a system that}} includes large <b>carrier</b> particles <b>and</b> fine particle agglomerates in a Couette mixer. The simulation starts with 200 <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> 10 agglomerates with 1000 fine particles each. During mixing, the agglomerates are broken, fractions adhere to the <b>carriers,</b> <b>and</b> there is continuous redistribution of fines between carriers. The focus is to obtain information on {{the quantity and quality of}} fine particles adhered to carriers by postprocessing the simulation data. Variation in the structure of agglomerates due to shearing is studied over mixing time. Findings indicate that major fraction of fine particles are dispersed evenly onto the surface of <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> the rest are in form of free debris. A time-dependent index is introduced to predict the degree of mixing. Finally, the adhesion force between <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> coated layers is observed to have a peak at 1 nN...|$|R

50|$|Large shippers {{of goods}} by rail also wished {{to have more}} {{flexibility}} in the rail market. The net result of compromise between the <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> the shippers, and the Carter administration’s push for a more competitive transport was the Staggers Act of 1980. The Staggers Act worked from the 4R Act template but extended its provisions. One of the key changes from the 1976 Act was allowance of secret contracts between <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> shippers, not limited to large-investment situations and not effectively subject to regulatory review. According to former Congressional Budget Office analyst Christopher Barnekov, such contracts allowed the rail <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> their shippers much more opportunity readily to develop more efficient transport arrangements, which lowered costs for the carriers, yielding better returns for the <b>carriers</b> <b>and</b> lower rates for the shippers.|$|R

5|$|In the mid-1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{decided to}} build a class of two {{submarine}} tenders which could be converted into light aircraft carriers or fleet oilers. The first ship, Tsurugizaki, was commissioned into service in 1939. Construction of the second, Takasaki, was stopped soon after launch and she was completed as an aircraft carrier. The ship was commissioned as Zuiho in December 1940.
