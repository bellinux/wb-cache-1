50|$|Troentorp <b>Clogs</b> are wooden <b>clogs</b> {{handcrafted}} in Troentorp, Sweden, a {{small village}} approximately three kilometers from Båstad, Skåne in southern Sweden. Troentorp <b>Clogs</b> (formerly known as Båstad <b>Clogs)</b> have gained international recognition, especially during the 1970s when Swedish <b>clogs</b> became a widely popular footwear. The <b>clogs</b> {{have been made by}} Troentorp Toffelfabrick (Troentorp <b>Clog</b> Factory) in the same location since 1907 and continue to be produced with the original wood and leather design.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} {{and development of}} managed aquifer recharge (MAR) have been limited by the <b>clogging</b> attributed to physical, chemical, and biological reactions. In application field of MAR, physical <b>clogging</b> is usually the dominant type. Although numerous studies on the physical <b>clogging</b> mechanism during MAR are available, studies on the more detailed suspended <b>clogging</b> types and its prediction methods still remain few. In this study, a series of column experiments were inducted to show the process of suspended solids <b>clogging</b> process. The suspended solids <b>clogging</b> was divided into three types of surface <b>clogging,</b> inner <b>clogging</b> and mixed <b>clogging</b> based on the different <b>clogging</b> characteristics. Surface <b>clogging</b> indicates that the suspended solids are intercepted by the medium surface when suspended solids grain diameter is larger than pore diameter of infiltration medium. Inner <b>clogging</b> indicates that the suspended solids particles could transport through the infiltration medium. Mixed <b>clogging</b> refers to the comprehensive performance of surface <b>clogging</b> and inner <b>clogging.</b> Each suspended solids <b>clogging</b> type has the different <b>clogging</b> position, different changing laws of hydraulic conductivity and different deposition profile of suspended solids. Based on the experiment data, the ratio of effective medium pore diameter (Dp) and median grain size of suspended solids (d 50) was proposed as the judgment index for suspended solids <b>clogging</b> types. Surface <b>clogging</b> occurred while Dp/d 50 was less than 5. 5, inner <b>clogging</b> occurred while Dp/d 50 was greater than 180, and mixed <b>clogging</b> occurred while Dp/d 50 was between 5. 5 and 180. In order to improve the judgment accuracy and applicability, Bayesian method, which considered more ratios of medium pore diameter (Dp) and different level of grain diameter of suspended solids (di), were developed to predict the potential suspended solids types...|$|R

5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are <b>clogged</b> with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, {{upper part of the}} chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E

Polderhoek Château was captured but then relinquished because many weapons were <b>clogged</b> by mud and the position made an awkward salient. The Germans promptly reoccupied the château, swept the area to the west with massed machine-gun fire and counterattacked, which pushed the brigade back to the start line.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to <b>clogged</b> milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction <b>clogged</b> meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and {{move to a new}} building {{at the north end of}} campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion regarding what to do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E

40|$|Porous asphalt {{mixture is}} one of the {{alternative}} solutions to increase pervious surface area due to urbanization. The uniqueness of porous asphalt surface textures and internal structures allows the mixture to become a temporary storm-water retention and capable to channel excessive storm water. However, one of the major problems that affect the performance of porous asphalt mixtures is the <b>clogging.</b> Therefore, this study aims to determine the effect of <b>clogging</b> towards the permeability of porous asphalt. A total of 30 gyratory compacted samples were fabricated according to aggregate gradation recommended by Malaysia Public Works Department. The <b>clogging</b> materials were collected from two different location, residential area and major highway. The composition and characteristics of the <b>clogging</b> materials were investigated using Plastic Limit, Liquid Limit and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The permeability test was conducted to investigate the permeability rate of the compacted samples based on different <b>clogging</b> material types, <b>clogging</b> concentrations and <b>clogging</b> cycles. In addition, the compacted samples were scanned using X-ray Computed Tomography to obtain the air voids distribution throughout the samples for comparison. It was found that higher concentration of <b>clogging</b> materials and <b>clogging</b> cycles reduced the rate of permeability. <b>Clogging</b> material collected from residential area has higher tendency to <b>clog</b> the void spaces compared to the one obtained from highway...|$|R
5|$|Forest {{and river}} {{habitats}} in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining {{began in the}} 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become more prone to erosion; even {{in areas that are}} no longer logged and have seen secondary forest growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious erosive threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming <b>clogged</b> and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these fish for spawning. Along the South Fork, this problem has been exacerbated by the inherently unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.|$|E
5|$|The {{ash fall}} created some {{temporary}} major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane {{was closed for}} a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and <b>clogged</b> air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{gradually}} became <b>clogged</b> with weed, and the railway took {{much of the}} trade. Between 1870 and 1874, income dropped from £2,500 to £1,700. Three years later, the Bristol and Exeter Railway merged with the Great Western Railway. The new owners were remote, and {{were more interested in}} the water supply for Taunton station and for the Bridgwater Dock, than running the canal as a going concern, with the result that the canal deteriorated further. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, but had little hope of any improvements being made.|$|E

5|$|The {{landing at}} Juno was delayed because of choppy seas, {{and the men}} arrived ahead of their {{supporting}} armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking. Most of the offshore bombardment had missed the German defences. Several exits from the beach were created, but not without difficulty. At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls of fascine, which were then covered by a temporary bridge. The tank remained in place until 1972, when it was removed and restored {{by members of the}} Royal Engineers. The beach and nearby streets were <b>clogged</b> with traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the nearby tropical cyclone caused the delaying of two flights and the cancellation of another at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport. On Guam, the United States Navy ordered the release of ships from the local harbor. There, peaked at 251mm (9.90in) over a 24-hour period at Piti. At the National Weather Service office in Tiyan, a gauge observed 100mm (3.95in) of rain. Gusty winds were also associated with Saomai's outer rainbands, with gusts peaking at a measured 105km/h (66mph) on September4. The winds caused power outage in localized areas and downed two telephone poles. Severe flooding occurred in Merizo after a storm drain became <b>clogged</b> with debris, inundating six houses.|$|E
5|$|A few {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were issued {{in anticipation of}} Fay's impact on Bermuda, and public schools were closed as a precaution. Despite its modest strength, Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda. Winds gusting over 100mph (155km/h) <b>clogged</b> roadways with downed trees and utility poles, and left {{a majority of the}} island's electric customers without power. The terminal building at L.F. Wade International Airport was flooded after the storm compromised its roof and sprinkler system. Along the coast, the storm unmoored and destroyed numerous boats. Immediately after the hurricane, 200Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs. Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for the approach of the stronger Hurricane Gonzalo, which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage. Fay and Gonzalo marked the first recorded instance of two Bermuda hurricane landfalls in one season.|$|E

5|$|At Devil's Gate {{the rescue}} party {{unloaded}} the baggage {{carried in the}} wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that had been following the Martin Company so the wagons {{could be used to}} transport the weakest emigrants. A small group led by Daniel Webster Jones remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. On November 4 the company had to cross the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 90 to 120 feet (27 to 37 m) wide. The stream was <b>clogged</b> with floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days at Martin's Cove, a few miles west of Devil's Gate.|$|E
5|$|For the XI Corps, {{it was a}} sad {{reminder}} of their retreat at Chancellorsville in May. Under heavy pursuit by Hays and Avery, they <b>clogged</b> the streets of the town; no one in the corps had planned routes for this contingency. Hand-to-hand fighting broke out in various places. Parts of the corps conducted an organized fighting retreat, such as Coster's stand in the brickyard. The private citizens of Gettysburg panicked amidst the turmoil, and artillery shells bursting overhead and fleeing refugees added to the congestion. Some soldiers sought to avoid capture by hiding in basements and in fenced backyards. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig was one such person who climbed a fence and hid behind a woodpile in the kitchen garden of the Garlach family {{for the rest of the}} three-day battle. The only advantage that the XI Corps soldiers had was that they were familiar with the route to Cemetery Hill, having passed through that way in the morning; many in the I Corps, including senior officers, did not know where the cemetery was.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 {{the fort}} was decommissioned, but was {{subsequently}} recommissioned by Mary I. In {{addition to the}} fort's military role, it hosted a court to oversee the oysterfields along the East Mersea coast, which were particularly lucrative but at risk of overfishing. In 1566, Colchester introduced new rules to govern the oyster trade, which were enforced by an admiralty court, held when necessary in Mersea Fort; the location was chosen so as to demonstrate the town's authority {{all the way up}} to the top of the estuary. A survey in 1586 showed the fort had been abandoned by the military once again: the defences were in a poor state, the guns' barrels were <b>clogged</b> with dirt and the site had been occupied by an elderly woman. It was brought back into use in 1588 and 1631 to defend against first the Spanish Armada and then the Dunkirker privateers.|$|E
