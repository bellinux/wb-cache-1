A few grasslands on the heavy clays of south- and mid-Essex are still grazed according to traditional methods, supporting a mixture of pasture and fen. Some brownfield sites, often on contaminated soil, have populations of nationally scarce species, particularly invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Even at {{the start}} of the Middle Ages the English {{landscape}} had been shaped by human occupation over many centuries. Much woodland was new, the result of fields being reclaimed by brush after the collapse of the Roman Empire. Human intervention had established wood pastures, an ancient system for managing woods and animals, and <b>coppicing,</b> a more intensive approach to managing woodlands. Other agricultural lands included arable fields and pastorage, while in some parts of the country, such as the South-West, waste moorland remained testament to earlier over-farming in the Bronze Age. England's environment continued to be shaped throughout the period, through the building of dykes to drain marshes, tree clearance and the large-scale extraction of peat. Managed parks for hunting game, including deer and boars, were built as status symbols by the nobility from the 12th century onwards, but earlier versions of parks, such as hays, may have originated as early as the 7th century.|$|E

25|$|<b>Coppicing</b> of willow, alder and poplar {{for energy}} wood has proven commercially successful. The Willow Biomass Project in the United States {{is an example}} of this. In this case the <b>coppicing</b> is done in a way that an annual or more likely a tri-annual cut can happen. This seems to {{maximize}} the production volume from the stand. Such frequent growth means the soils can be easily depleted and so fertlizers are often required. The stock also becomes exhausted after some years and so will be replaced with new plants.

25|$|During the 1970s the Forestry Commission {{had begun}} {{a shift in}} focus to {{conservation}} and amenity value of their woods. The 1975 symposium considered the history and ecology of Bedford Purlieus and discussed how to retain and enhance {{the elements of the}} woods of greatest ecological value. The resulting publication, edited by G.F. Peterken and R.C. Welch, produced a detailed management plan. Among its recommendations were the restoration of areas of <b>coppicing,</b> and the reduction of conifers. The plan provided a basis for an ecological management of Bedford Purlieus within commercial constraints. Its designation as a national nature reserve in 2000 is a recognition {{of the extent to which}} the policy shift had been made. In 2005 it received an injection of funding from landfill tax credits arising from the nearby Augean landfill. This has facilitated the Forestry Commission to re-instate areas of <b>coppicing,</b> open up grassland glades and remove conifers and other introduced species.|$|E
25|$|M. oleifera can be {{cultivated}} for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for {{oil extraction}} and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation. Harvest is done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks attached. Pollarding, <b>coppicing</b> and lopping or pruning are recommended to promote branching, increase production and facilitate harvesting.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that <b>coppicing</b> has been continuously practised since pre-history. Coppiced stems are characteristically curved at the base.

The curve may allow the identification of coppice timber in archaeological sites. Timber in the Sweet Track in Somerset (built in the winter of 3807 and 3806 BC) has been identified as coppiced lime.|$|E
40|$|International audience& Context One {{eighth of}} Europe's forests are still managed as <b>coppice.</b> In some European countries, {{more than half}} of the forest {{exhibits}} <b>coppice</b> structures from the past or present <b>coppice</b> management. Many of these forests grow in the broadleaf zone of mountainous regions, often on steep slopes. Here, they play an important role in rockfall protection. However, it remains unclear how <b>coppice</b> forests should be structured for optimal rockfall protection or how the protection effect changes during the aging of the <b>coppice.</b> & Aim A few studies have applied rock trajectory analyses, but so far, no process-based model has been used to quantify the protective effect of differently structured <b>coppice</b> forests. The present study compared 40 <b>coppice</b> patches from two chronosequences in South Tyrol, North Italy, regarding their protective effect against rocks of two sizes using the rockfall simulation model Rockyfor 3 D. & Results The results indicate that <b>coppice</b> stands older than 30 years better protect against rockfall than medium-aged and young stands, although the old ones have lower stem densities. Surprisingly, a random stem distribution had a better protective effect than the clumped stem distribution typical for <b>coppice</b> stands. & Conclusion Implications for future management are discussed in detail, including the relevance of standards in <b>coppice</b> forests...|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} {{forestry}} in German speaking Europe has defined silvicultural systems broadly as Hochwald - High forest, Mittelwald - <b>Coppice</b> with standards (and Compound <b>coppice),</b> Short rotation <b>coppice</b> and Niederwald - <b>Coppice.</b> There are other systems too. These varied silvicultural systems include several harvesting methods, {{which are often}} wrongly {{said to be a}} silvicultural systems, but may also be called rejuvenating or regenerating method depending on the purpose.|$|R
25|$|The shoots (or suckers) {{may be used}} {{either in}} their young state for {{interweaving}} in wattle fencing (as is the practice with coppiced willows and hazel) or the new shoots may be allowed to grow into large poles, as was often the custom with trees such as oaks or ashes. This creates long, straight poles which {{do not have the}} bends and forks of naturally grown trees. <b>Coppicing</b> may be practiced to encourage specific growth patterns, as with cinnamon trees which are grown for their bark.|$|E
25|$|Typically a coppiced {{woodland}} is {{harvested in}} sections or coups on a rotation. In this way, a crop is available each year {{somewhere in the}} woodland. <b>Coppicing</b> {{has the effect of}} providing a rich variety of habitats, as the woodland always has a range of different-aged coppice growing in it, which is beneficial for biodiversity. The cycle length depends upon the species cut, the local custom, and the use to which the product is put. Birch can be coppiced for faggots on a three- or four-year cycle, whereas oak can be coppiced over a fifty-year cycle for poles or firewood.|$|E
25|$|As in <b>coppicing,</b> the {{tradition}} of pollarding is to encourage the tree to produce new growth {{on a regular basis}} to maintain a supply of new wood for various purposes, particularly for fuel. In some areas, dried leafy branches are stored as winter fodder for stock. Depending upon the use of the cut material, the length of time between cutting will vary from one year for tree hay or withies, to five years or more for larger timber. Sometimes, only some of the regrown stems may be cut in a season – this is thought to reduce the chances of death of the tree when recutting long-neglected pollards.|$|E
25|$|Another, more {{complicated}} system is called compound <b>coppice.</b> Here {{some of the}} standards would be left, some harvested.

40|$|Aims: Growers of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. {{plantations}} {{can establish}} second and later rotations from <b>coppice</b> or by replanting with seedlings. At most locations where E. globulus is grown commercially, water availability {{is a major}} driver for productivity. Thus growers must consider which reestablishment technique will maximize productivity whilst sustaining site resources for subsequent rotations. In this study we aimed to compare the stand-scale water balance components of young <b>coppice</b> and seedling E. globulus. Methods: A second rotation E. globulus <b>coppice</b> and seedling trial was monitored for two successive seasonal cycles. <b>Coppice</b> and seedling plots were instrumented with sap flow- and meteorological-sensors so that stand-scale water balance components could be estimated on a daily time step. Results: Stand-scale transpiration rate (E) and rate of interception (EI) were larger in <b>coppice</b> compared to seedlings, but the rate of soil evaporation (ES) was lower. At approximately 2 years of age each <b>coppice</b> stump {{was reduced to a}} single dominant stem, a standard management practice for E. globulus growers, which reduced stem biomass by approximately 70 % and caused E to fall to a value approximating that in seedlings. The cumulative transpiration of <b>coppice</b> was 425 mm greater than seedlings up to 34 months of age. Without the <b>coppice</b> reduction (down to one stem/stump), we estimate that the difference would have been much greater. The water-use efficiency of stem production (WUEstem) was greater in young <b>coppice</b> compared to seedlings but this benefit is likely to be offset by the loss of biomass (and thus transpired water) during <b>coppice</b> stem reduction. Conclusion: Under the conditions of this study, which included reducing <b>coppice</b> to a single stem, reestablishment with seedling E. globulus resulted in a higher water-use efficiency of stem biomass production compared to <b>coppice</b> of a similar age...|$|R
25|$|The {{vast amounts}} of wood needed to produce glass in this way {{dictated}} that glasshouses be located in forest areas and that the woodland be managed carefully by <b>coppicing</b> and pollarding to maximise the wood resource and to optimise the size of wood pieces used. Even so, periodically the glasshouse would have to relocate, as the woodland was depleted. The glass industry had to compete for wood supplies with other industries such as mining, and domestic demand. In sixteenth-century England, an embargo {{was placed on the}} use of wood for fuel for glassmaking. Glasshouses often were located in forests owned by the church. One of the main uses of forest glass was for ecclesiastical stained glass windows.|$|E
25|$|As with <b>coppicing,</b> only {{species with}} {{vigorous}} epicormic growth {{may be made}} into pollards. In these species (which include many broadleaved trees but few conifers), removal of the main apical stems releases the growth of many dormant buds under the bark on {{the lower part of}} the tree. Trees without this growth will, of course, die without their leaves and branches. Some smaller tree species do not readily form pollards, because cutting the main stem stimulates growth from the base, effectively forming a coppice stool instead. Examples of trees that do well as pollards include broadleaves such as beeches (Fagus), oaks (Quercus), maples (Acer), black locust or false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), hornbeams (Carpinus), lindens and limes (Tilia), planes (Platanus), horse chestnuts (Aesculus), mulberries (Morus), redbud (Cercis canadensis), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), willows (Salix), and a few conifers, such as yews (Taxus).|$|E
25|$|Originally, the {{silvicultural}} system now called <b>coppicing</b> was practiced solely for small wood production. In German {{this is called}} Niederwald, which translates as low forest. Later on in Mediaeval times farmers encouraged pigs to feed from acorns and so some trees were allowed to grow bigger. This different {{silvicultural system}} is called in English coppice with standards. In German this is called Mittelwald (middle forest). As modern forestry (Hochwald in German, which translates as High forest) seeks to harvest timber mechanically, and pigs are generally no longer fed from acorns, both systems have declined. However, there are cultural and wildlife benefits from these 2 silvicultural systems so both can be found where timber production or some other main forestry purpose (such as a protection forest against an avalanche) is not the sole management objective of the woodland.|$|E

Later, when the canopy closes again, many other specialised animals such as the Eurasian woodcock find a suitable habitat. All game that is typical of German forests (for example hare, roe, red fox, and squirrel) are present in Hesselberg's woods. The drumming of woodpeckers and the crying of cuckoos contribute to {{the mood of the}} wood as well as the singing of countless birds. Various Ranunculaceae—such as liverworts and wood anemones—are the signs of spring in Hesselberg's forests. In May ramsons turn the ground of the deciduous forest into a carpet of green and white blooms. After blooming the intense odour of garlic fills the air. The various species of orchids such as the red helleborine have become increasingly rare.

25|$|Some {{argue that}} almost all of the above is based on an unhistorical {{projection}} of present concerns, onto the past. This alternative view argues that there are immense complexities of time, space, climate, geology and topography which, when combined with our extremely fragmentary information, makes generalizations almost impossible. Tree crops, dates, figs, olives, chestnuts etc, played a very important role in Roman agriculture. Grains were often intercultivated with these tree crops. Almost all species of trees grow again when cut down. Cutting down a wood does not, by itself, destroy woodland. <b>Coppicing</b> is one way in which wood could be harvested on a sustainable basis for example. Hypocausts were pre-adapted to burn poor quality fuels like straw as well as coal. There is good reason to believe that both straw and coal were important fuels in antiquity, especially in Roman Britain where coal was abundant in many areas. A great deal of protection against soil erosion arises from terracing hillsides. We do not know how extensive terraces were in antiquity but {{a good deal of the}} soil erosion, here assumed to be caused by the Romans, may well date to the dark ages when the maintenance of terraces broke down. Changes in tree cover may well arise from differences in climate, which are still not well understood. But there is some evidence that the decline of the Roman West is linked to climate change.|$|E

Felling time was significantly longer at the <b>coppiced</b> site (8 % more time than at the planted site) because the operator had to spend more time manoeuvring the harvester head to avoid or remove small shoots at the base of many <b>coppiced</b> trees. Stump height and volume were significantly greater at the <b>coppiced</b> site (7. 7 m 3 /ha) compared with those at the planted site (4 m 3 /ha) because the shape of the <b>coppiced</b> stumps and the design of the harvester head did not allow the stumps to be cut shorter...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade the South African {{forestry}} industry has gradually experienced the ramifications of labour scarcity, increases in labour costs, the effect of HIV and AIDS and increasing timber demand. Consequently, {{this has led to}} an increase in the mechanisation rate, especially in timber harvesting operations. Due to the labour challenges in South Africa, mechanised forestry equipment has increasingly been required to operate in complex forest conditions, such as <b>coppiced</b> compartments, where they have not operated before. It therefore occurs that harvesters are either used in certain <b>coppiced</b> compartments with uncertain productivity expectations, or the harvesters are not used in these compartments {{due to a lack of}} productivity knowledge. The influence that certain factors have on harvester productivity and stump volume loss – factors such as <b>coppice</b> regeneration practices and stem form – is poorly understood and has not been quantified. No scientific research exists regarding the effects of <b>coppice</b> compartments on the productivity of a harvester and the amount of stump volume waste. This research aimed at determining the influence of tree volume, tree form, stem felled first and distance between stems on the productivity of an excavator based harvester in <b>coppiced</b> double, <b>coppiced</b> single and planted Eucalyptus grandis pulpwood compartments. Furthermore, the research determined whether there was any stump volume waste, and quantified how much of it was due to excessive stump heights by the harvester. Through regression analysis, productivity equations were derived to make productivity predictions in both <b>coppiced</b> and planted compartments. All stumps were evaluated for waste and the average stump volume waste in <b>coppiced</b> double, <b>coppiced</b> single and planted trees was determined. The research results showed that planted trees had the highest productivity across all tree sizes, followed by <b>coppiced</b> single trees and then <b>coppiced</b> double stems. When harvesting a 0. 2 m 3 tree, the mean harvester productivity was 8. 7 m 3 per PMH in <b>coppiced</b> double trees, 13. 8 m 3 per PMH in <b>coppiced</b> single trees and 16. 1 m 3 per PMH in planted trees. In <b>coppiced</b> double stems the productivity was not significantly influence by the distance between stems. However, the productivity was significantly influenced by the stem felled first. The regression results showed that if the smaller stem was felled first, the productivity would increase if the larger stem’s volume was less than 0. 18 m 3; however where the larger stem was greater than 0. 18 m 3, the relationship was reversed. In addition, the productivity for both <b>coppiced</b> single trees and <b>coppiced</b> double stems were significantly influenced by stem form. The poorly formed trees had low productivity compared to the trees with good form. The stump volume findings showed that <b>coppiced</b> double stems had the highest average stump volume waste per stump, with 0. 00307 m 3 waste, followed by <b>coppiced</b> single trees (0. 001954 m 3) and planted trees (0. 001650 m 3). The average stump volume waste per stump with waste for the planted trees was negligible. This research provides forestry companies and harvesting contractors with information on the effect of tree volume, tree form and stem felled first on harvester productivity in E. grandis <b>coppiced</b> double, <b>coppiced</b> single and planted compartments.
