40|$|This letter {{introduces}} {{a new series}} of multilevel (ML) converters based on the ML clamping concept. By applying this technique, a ML <b>clamping</b> <b>unit</b> (MCU) conveys additional levels for synthesizing the output waveforms of a diode-clampedML dc– ac power converter. The basic building block of the ML clamping scheme is the ML clamping cell, which is composed of a pair of dc sources associated with one single-pole/triple-throw type of switch arrangement. The number of series-connected ML-clamping cells will set the number of levels of the synthesized waveform. By depending on the MCU arrangements, different converter configurations can be derived, namely, the common clamping and the modular types. Both approaches can be accomplished by employing classical three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) technology. Thus, the overall structure of the resultant converter is kept simple, wherein the number of parts count can be reduced, when compared with conventional NPC counterparts. In this letter, emphasis is given on the common clamping converter configuration. The attractiveness of the proposed ML concept is evidenced by conducting a comparative cost analysis. Experimental results are presented as a practicality proof of the proposed ML power converter. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

The working principle and major functions of key constituent parts of test apparatus, including the servo drive <b>unit,</b> <b>clamping</b> <b>unit</b> and test system, were introduced. Based on the finite element method, biaxial tensile and tension-bending-combined mechanical performances of the test-piece were studied as guidance to learn the distribution of elastic deformation and plastic deformation of all sites of the test-piece and to better plan test regions. Finally, this test apparatus was used to conduct a biaxial tensile test under different pre-bending loading and a tensile test at different rates; the image of the fracture of the test-piece was acquired by a scanning electron microscope and analyzed. It was indicated that as the pre-bending force rises, the elastic deformation phase would gradually shorten and the slope of the elastic deformation phase curve would slightly rise so that a yield limit would appear ahead of time. Bending speed could exert a positive and beneficial influence on tensile strength but weaken fracture elongation. If bending speed is appropriately raised, more ideal anti-tensile strength could be obtained, but fracture elongation would decline...|$|R
50|$|An HSK {{connection}} {{depends on}} a combination of axial clamping forces and taper-shank interference. All these forces are generated and controlled by the mating components’ design parameters. The shank and spindle both must have precisely mating tapers and faces that are square to the taper’s axis. There are several HSK clamping methods. All use some mechanism to amplify the clamping action of equally spaced collet segments. When the toolholder is clamped into the spindle, the drawbar force produces a firm metal-to-metal contact between the shank and the ID of the <b>clamping</b> <b>unit.</b> An additional application of drawbar force positively locks the two elements together into a joint {{with a high level of}} radial and axial rigidity. As the collet segments rotate, the clamping mechanism gains centrifugal force. The HSK design actually harnesses centrifugal force to increase joint strength. Centrifugal force also causes the thin walls of the shank to deflect radially at a faster rate than the walls of the spindle. This contributes to a secure connection by guaranteeing strong contact between the shank and the spindle. The automotive and aerospace industries are the largest users of HSK toolholders. Another industry that is seeing increasing use is the mold and die industry.|$|R
40|$|The {{drilling}} {{length is}} an important parameter {{in the process of}} horizontal directional drilling (HDD) exploration and recovery, but there has been a lack of accurate, automatically obtained statistics regarding this parameter. Herein, a technique for real-time HDD length detection and a management system based on the electromagnetic detection method with a microprocessor and two magnetoresistive sensors employing the software LabVIEW are proposed. The basic principle is to detect the change in the magnetic-field strength near a current coil while the drill stem and drill-stem joint successively pass through the current coil forward or backward. The detection system consists of a hardware subsystem and a software subsystem. The hardware subsystem employs a single-chip microprocessor as the main controller.

Accordingly, measurement techniques along with accurate data interpretation have been required to study space charge behaviour in insulation materials and to provide solid bases for simulation activities. In this work, a high temperature space charge measurement system for mini-cables has been developed based on the Pulsed Electro-Acoustic (PEA) method. In parallel, simulation tools for space charge accumulation, based on non-linear unipolar charge transport models, the acoustic signal formation, transmission of acoustic waves, and their detection, have been developed for PEA measurement on mini-cables to provide an alternative way for interpreting the raw experimental data rather than the traditional approaches of reconstructing space charge information by signal processing and calibration. The simulation uses 2 -D simulation tools and includes the <b>clamping</b> <b>unit</b> of the PEA cell to provide, for the first time, a detailed comparison of the two commonly used shapes, flat and curved, of the base electrode. Benefiting from the ability of applying isothermal experimental conditions of 20 – 70 °C, the transient of ‘intrinsic’ space charge accumulation due to the field and temperature dependent conductivity has been studied by means of a novel experimental data analysis method proposed in this work. In addition, the analysis provides a way to assess conductivity models by matching the simulation results with the experimental space charge results. By applying the simulation tools, the effect of the possible cable defects of non-concentricity and a mismatch between the insulation and semicon layers could be assessed. Furthermore, the origin of the bulk space charge signal experimentally observed in a mini-cable was found to be consistent with a radius dependent conductivity which may be a consequence of incomplete degassing...|$|R

40|$|In this work, a mini-robot {{based on}} {{parallel}} kinematic architecture is presented. It consists on a mobile platform, which can translate vertically along the axis normal {{to the base}} plane and rotates alternatively around the two other orthogonally axes. The structure has overall dimensions of few centimetres with promising applications in the optical field. As the miniaturisation increases, the requirement of high precision becomes {{one of the most}} critical point. For this aim, the application of Parallel Kinematic architecture at millimetre and sub-millimetre range offers new solutions, since they can achieve very high positioning accuracy and stiffness, also at high dynamics working conditions. Moreover, all types of architectures that have single plane motion drivers and that use constant length legs are particularly attractive for MEMS applications thanks their production feasibility based on IC-technologies [1] [2] [3]. Furthermore, characteristic limitations reducing their employment in industry, as the dimension of work space with respect to the total volume occupied by the device, become less important at small scale and can be avoided with appropriated design. The present work describes the design and development of the mini PKM. Firstly, different kinematics configurations were analysed and then the feasibility study of the robot - manufactured using silicon based technologies - was performed. These results are reported in previous publications [4] [5]. In particular, two interesting configurations were selected. The first one has 3 DoFs, the kinematic chain is P-R-S (Prismatic, Rotational, Spherical joints), and the legs are arranged symmetrically around the central platform in order to guarantee a better stress distribution. The second one has 2 DoFs, the kinematic chain is P-R-U (Universal joint) and the legs are arranged at T-shape in order to optimise the mobility of the mechanism with respect to the overall stiffness. Although the latter configuration doesn’t distribute stress equally and introduces a mutual constraint between the rotational DoFs, it offers other valuable advantages: such as a simple control system due to the decoupling of the rotations and an easier manufacture because of the intrinsic difficulty of realizing spherical joints at small scale. In this paper, the feasibility study of this second kinematic configuration at millimetre range will be explained more in details. The components have been re-designed in order to be manufactured by traditional precision machine tools, like turning, milling and drilling, thus the dimensions were scaled to millimetre range.
