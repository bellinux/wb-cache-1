"Since the 1960's the Quebec {{government}} has assumed a more commanding presence in university policy than was previously the case, allocating resources, standardizing procedures, setting broad policies objectives {{and attempting to}} rationalize the university system {{in the interest of}} the common good" [...] In December 2006, the Institute for Governance of Private and Public Organizations, announced the creation of a study group on the governance of Quebec universities. [...] The mandate of the group was three-fold. The first was to assess <b>current</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> for the proper governance of universities in Quebec and elsewhere. Second was to assess various principles and practices put in place to improve the quality of university governance in Quebec and around the world, and the final mandate was to make specific recommendations that are likely to enhance the quality of university governance in Quebec. [...] The eleven member group consisted of university rectors, chancellors and principals as well as board members of various universities across the province. Their report was released in September 2007. It was rejected by the Fédération québécoise des professeures et professeurs d'université (FQPPU) as well as the McGill Association of University Teachers (MAUT) and the Concordia University Faculty Association (CUFA). [...] In February 2008, representatives of CUFA and MAUT denounced the report's recommendations in a written response to the study group's report. The report recommended a fifteen-member board of governors, where ten members are to be external. The board would also be responsible for hiring and compensation of senior administration as well as strategic planning and establishment of performance measures for teaching and research. The report did not take into account the current bicameral system of a board of governors as well as a senate, a system in place across North American universities. CUFA and MAUT were concerned about the lack of academic presence, both in teachers and in students, as well as the overwhelming presence of corporate and business interests on the proposed structure of the board.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{diagnostic}} work-up for heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) {{can take}} several days. Consequently patients may be speculatively switched onto replacement anticoagulant therapy before a diagnosis is confirmed. On-demand immunoassay diagnostic testing enables timely treatment decisions, based on test results. ObjectiveTo estimate the clinical and cost {{impact of the}} use of on-demand versus batched diagnostic tests for HIT. MethodsLiterature was reviewed to identify test performance, clinical and cost data. Semi-structured interviews (n= 4) and a survey (n= 90) provided insights into <b>current</b> <b>practice</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges.</b> Flow diagram models were developed to estimate the potential impact of on-demand testing. ResultsModelling estimated more HIT-related outcomes for patients maintained on heparin whilst awaiting test results and patients switched onto replacement anticoagulant therapy awaiting test results, compared with on-demand testing and treatment based on the results. The budget impact model estimated that on-demand testing reduced replacement anticoagulant therapy costs from $ 39, 616 to $ 12, 799 per patient. There are limitations to the data available to inform modelling and the estimates should be treated with caution. ConclusionsUsing on-demand testing may drive positive effects on clinical and cost outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Although {{training}} {{evaluation is}} a very important stage for a successful Training and Development (T&D) programme, this activity is the most neglected and problematic. As a result, T&D has been considered in many organisations as a waste of money and time, a cost which needs to be minimised and is often perceived as an ineffective process. This study sought to explore the <b>current</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> of the T&D evaluation stage within Jordanian banking organisations through a combination of semi structured interviews and a survey questionnaire, which was administered to the persons responsible for the T&D within the organisations. The study findings reveal, that although the majority of the organisations evaluate their training programme, usually there is an absence of systematic and effective procedures for evaluation, and most of the organisations rely on external providers to evaluate their T&D programmes. The most popular evaluation tools and technique used are questionnaires, and the most common model used is the Kirkpatrick model, however, the most common level of evaluation is the reaction level.

40|$|Purpose: In {{this era}} of rising {{antimicrobial}} resistance, slowly refilling antibiotic development pipelines, and an aging population, we need to ensure that randomized clinical trials (RCTs) determine {{the added benefit of}} new antibiotic agents effectively and in a valid way, especially for severely ill patients. Unfortunately, universally accepted endpoints for the evaluation of new drugs in severe infections are lacking. Methods: We review and discuss the <b>current</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> regarding endpoints in RCTs in this field and propose novel approaches. Results: Usual endpoints actually recommended for drug development suffer from important flaws. Mortality requires large sample size and only partly related to the infectious process. Clinical cure rate is highly subjective in critically ill patients where symptoms may be related to other intercurrent events. Currently, composite endpoints, hierarchical nested designs, and competing risks analysis seem to be the most promising new tools for designing and analyzing clinical trials in this area, although they require further validation. Conclusion: Regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical companies, and clinicians need to agree on the most appropriate clinical endpoints for severe infections to ensure efficient approval of new, effective antibiotic agents...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, service-oriented {{architectures}} {{are more}} popular than ever, {{and more and more}} companies and organizations depend on services offered through Web APIs. The capabilities and complexity of Web APIs differ from service to service, and therefore the impact of API errors varies. API problem cases related to Adyen’s payment service were found to have direct considerable impact on API consumer applications. With more than 60 thousand daily API errors the potential impact is enormous. Similarly, API consumers of any API can experience errors, and depending on the application the impact can be costly. In an effort to reduce the impact of API related problems, we analyze 2. 43 million API error responses to identify the underlying faults and derive 11 generic categories that describe them. We quantify the occurrence of faults in terms of the frequency and impacted API consumers. We investigate the impact of API faults on API consumer applications and illustrate this with 3 case studies. Furthermore, an overview is given of the <b>current</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> to avoid and reduce the impact of API errors by API consumers. Using the results, we introduce 16 recommendations for API providers and API consumers to reduce the impact of API related faults. Computer Scienc...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSickle cell disease (SCD) is {{a genetic}} blood {{disorder}} affecting red blood cells, with high {{morbidity and mortality}} rates. The United Nations has recognized SCD as a global public health concern, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that 50 % of member states will have established SCD control programs by 2020 (World Health Organization, 2006). This paper presents an integrative review of 63 references related to SCD among children less than 18 years of age in Africa, published between 2000 and 2015. The review focuses on the incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality; <b>current</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> related to screening, diagnosis, and treatment; and recommendations for practice, policy, and research to improve health outcomes of children with SCD in Africa. There have been significant improvements in the morbidity and mortality rates for children with SCD in high resource countries such as the United States due to factors such as early diagnosis through newborn screening programs, prophylactic therapy, comprehensive care programs including hydroxyurea therapy, and bone marrow transplant. Many of these interventions can confer the same benefits to SCD patients in Africa. Newborn screening for SCD, developing partnerships between high resource countries and countries in Africa to support training of healthcare workers, research, and sharing of knowledge can help to reduce the SCD burden in Africa...|$|E
40|$|Investments {{in urban}} {{transport}} should deliver the maximum economic, {{social and environmental}} benefits; in times of constrained budgets, projects' economic viability is often the deciding factor. This paper discusses the <b>current</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> facing cities in assessing urban transport interventions. On this basis, it develops options for decision-makers to appraise small-scale, sustainable urban transport policy measures. The analysis of current appraisal practice shows that data requirements and complexity are cities’ main obstacles appraising projects and comparing potential alternatives. Additionally, {{there is often a}} risk that project appraisal enters the planning process too late to play any meaningful role. Conducting a Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) ex-ante is often only approved if the implementation of the measure in question is already likely. Often, a CBA is a means to access funds rather than a basis for decision-making. Project appraisal of small-scale and non-infrastructure-based measures is often simply too expensive. On the basis of these findings, the paper discusses the following alternatives to comprehensive CBAs: 1) learn from others, 2) use a simplified assessment method, 3) rely on norms and values. All of these options aim to cope with the trade-off between effort and certitude. In practice, some policy-makers may already apply {{one or more of these}} options, but this has not been documented in a systematic manner. A systematic documentation of such practices could be a major step forward for implementation of sustainable and integrated urban transport projects, as it would shed some light on the reasoning behind decisions, from which conclusions could be drawn on the likely follow-on effects thereof and also possible improvements to the process...|$|E
40|$|Integrated {{environmental}} modeling (IEM) {{is inspired}} by modern environmental problems, decisions, and policies and enabled by transdisciplinary science and computer capabilities that allow the environment {{to be considered in}} a holistic way. The problems are characterized by the extent of the environmental system involved, dynamic and interdependent nature of stressors and their impacts, diversity of stakeholders, and integration of social, economic, and environmental considerations. IEM provides a science-based structure to develop and organize relevant knowledge and information and apply it to explain, explore, and predict the behavior of environmental systems in response to human and natural sources of stress. During the past several years a number of workshops were held that brought IEM practitioners together to share experiences and discuss future needs and directions. In this paper we organize and present the results of these discussions. IEM is presented as a landscape containing four interdependent elements: applications, science, technology, and community. The elements are described from the perspective of their role in the landscape, <b>current</b> <b>practices,</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> that must be addressed. Workshop participants envision a global scale IEM community that leverages modern technologies to streamline the movement of science-based knowledge from its sources in research, through its organization into databases and models, to its integration and application for problem solving purposes. Achieving this vision will require that the global community of IEM stakeholders transcend social, and organizational boundaries and pursue greater levels of collaboration. Among the highest priorities for community action are the development of standards for publishing IEM data and models in forms suitable for automated discovery, access, and integration; education of the next generation of environmental stakeholders, with a focus on transdisciplinary research, development, and decision making; and providing a web-based platform for community interactions (e. g., continuous virtual workshops). ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainable}} development {{is used as a}} basis for enhancing understanding of sustainable construction. Principles of sustainable construction cover four attributes: social, economic, biophysical and technical. The research examined these concepts, principles and attributes in understanding sustainable and green construction as well as <b>current</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> of sustainable construction in Lagos, Nigeria. The research embraced both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. The sample frame is the total number of built industry registered and practising professionals in Lagos. A total number of 85 respondents were randomly selected for study from each group. A 5 -point likert scale was used to assess respondents’ judgement on the identified social, economic, bio-physical and technical indicators. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were also conducted with all the above professional groups to corroborate the primary information. For a wider coverage, three different construction sites are selected to reflect income neighbourhoods-Lekki (high income), Yaba (medium income) and Bariga (low income). Data Collected were analysed using the mean item score. A multi- stage framework which required the application of environmental assessment and environment management systems for construction projects was utilised. Research findings indicate that the most important factors considered for sustainable construction with their mean item scores are quality of working conditions (0. 852) strengthening and enforcement of relevant law and regulations(0. 872), encouraging construction waste management(0. 819) and design for flexibility and adaptability. Results from the FGDs indicate that the current practice on sustainable construction does not take into consideration integrated design process, acoustic and visual comfort in the planning and construction of sustainable projects. The research therefore concludes that government should improve existing laws to enhance quality of working life, education, training as well as knowledge management for all stakeholders in sustainable construction. </p...|$|E
40|$|Training {{in general}} is {{receiving}} more attention in the new evolving work environment and companies invest a lot of time, money and effort into training activities. The aim of this research {{study was to explore}} the nature of Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) training practices within companies in the Western Cape. In order to obtain the goal of the study the following objectives were formulated: ? To explore the content of EAP related training currently being presented at companies in the Western Cape. ? To explore if the current EAP related training is meeting the goals as set out by the Standards Committee of EAPA-SA. ? To explore the most beneficial EAP related training presented at companies in the Western Cape. ? To explore the current challenges that companies in the Western Cape experience regarding EAP related training of employees. ? To make recommendations regarding EAP related training practices in order to improve training practices and to proactively address training challenges. Against this background the study was guided by the following research question: ? What is the nature of EAP related training practices in companies in the Western Cape? A qualitative research approach was adopted {{for the purpose of this}} study. It was applicable because the goal was to seek a better understanding of a complex situation and to explore and to use observations to build theory from the ground up. By gathering meaningful information such as the perceptions, experiences and opinions of key role players in relation to the phenomenon of EAP related training practices in companies, the researcher explored and described the <b>current</b> <b>practices</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges.</b> The researcher utilised an applied research approach, since it sought to understand and alleviate a demanding problem in practice (EAP related training) and provided policymakers with well-grounded guides for remedial action. As the study was grounded in the collective case study design, the researcher chose a number of cases (companies) to make comparisons between cases (companies) and concepts to extend and validate theories. The researcher purposely selected information-rich participants who provided the information needed. By using non-probability, purposive sampling the researcher purposively selected a subset of four companies in the Western Cape and studied them to make estimations and predictions about the larger population. Within the four selected companies, 13 (two to four in each of the four organisations) participants were purposively selected from which the researcher collected information. Semi-structured interviewing was used as the most appropriate method of data collection for this study. An interview schedule with some predetermined questions was utilised to guide the interviews and the questions were formulated to be open-ended to generate more in-depth responses. The interviews were conducted by the researcher herself. The study was also concluded with some useful and relevant recommendations from the employees responses on what programmes are currently being presented, the most beneficial programmes and how to ensure more effective EAP related training practices. One of the crucial recommendations drawn from the findings of this research study was that to ensure effective training, an assessment of the current state of affairs within companies, should always be completed. Training will be workable if it is grounded on a formal assessment of what is in place and what is needed to meet the specific company s business strategies and objectives. Another recommendation is that formal EAP related supervisory training should be compulsory on an on-going basis. Supervisors should be well-informed and even trained in the skills that the employees are due to be trained in. If managers are well-informed about the benefit of training and the impact thereof it might increase their insight, leading to their buy-in, and it might in addition address the attendance issue.
