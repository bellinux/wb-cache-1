50|$|SeSaM {{has been}} {{developed}} by Prof. Schwaneberg and his group in order to overcome several of the major limitations encountered when working with standard mutagenesis methods based on simple error-prone PCR (epPCR) techniques. By non-specific introduction of universal or degenerate bases at every position in the gene sequence, SeSaM overcomes the polymerase bias favoring transitory substitutions at specific positions but opens the complete gene sequence to a diverse array of amino acid exchanges,. With <b>continous</b> research by SeSaM-Biotech and the Schwaneberg group, several modifications of the SeSaM method were introduced that especially allowed for the introduction of consecutive mutations and a further shift of the mutational bias towards transversion substitutions, generating a versatile tool for protein engineering and evolution.|$|E

5000|$|Difficult {{to apply}} in pasture systems - as a <b>continous</b> animal is {{pediment}} for a optimal {{utilization of the}} AMS unit, AMS works at their best in zero-grazing systems, in which the cow is housed indoors {{for most of the}} lactation period. Zero-grazing suits areas (e.g. the Netherlands) where land is at a premium, as maximum land can be devoted to feed production which is then collected by the farmer and brought to the animals in the barn. In pasture systems, cows graze in fields and are required to walk to the milking parlour. It has been found that it can be challenging to make cows maintain a high milking frequency if the distance to walk between pasture and milking unit is too great. Maintaining production on pasture has, however, been shown to be possible in amongst others the AUTOGRASSMILK project. There are currently research projects at the Dexcel facility in New Zealand, University of Sydney's FutureDairy site, Michigan State University's Kellogg Biological Station and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences's research facility Lövsta Livestock Research Center, where cattle are on pasture and milked by AMS.|$|E

40|$|Sports {{medicine}} {{is a field}} in constant renewal. During the last century {{research has been done}} to improve the performance of elite athletes. Findings have led to new questions. One question today is regarding the optimal training program. Our goal with this report has been to make a review of traditional sports physiology and compare papers reporting training programs of high intensity training (HIT) and <b>continous</b> training on this background. METHOD: This assignment consists of two parts: first general endurance training physiology and then a evaluation and discussion of five articles comparing HIT and <b>continous</b> training, selected by predefined criteria. In the first part sources are textbooks and journal articles. DISCUSSION: Evidence suggested similar effects of HIT and endurance traning on changes in VO 2 -kinetics, cardiovascular variables and muscle enzymes. One study found similar competitional results after both training programs. Lack of time is often reported as the main reason for low activity. Our main finding is that HIT is a highly time-efficient training method that leads to the same physiological changes as <b>continous</b> training. Therefore, it may be an alternative to consider for general recommendations. CONCLUSION: HIT and <b>continous</b> training lead to similar changes measured with cardiorespiratory variables. HIT is also a very time efficient training method compared to <b>continous</b> training, and could be an alternative for everyone from top athletes to the general population. There are, however, still questions remaining to be answered, for instance regarding differences between the training programs on long-term effects and possibly other variables still not studied...|$|E

As input any set of matrixes may be submitted which represent "snap-shots" of a function of two discrete variables proceeding in time in a <b>continous</b> or piece-wise <b>continous</b> manner. By linear or square time interpolations, the code computes a sequence of intermediate function fields. These are then plotted as a consecutive series of pictures in a perspective three-dimensional representation an the 16 mm film.

40|$|We analyse a {{discretization}} {{method for}} a class of degenerate parabolic problems that includes the Richards ’ equation. This analysis applies to the pressure-based formulation and considers both variably and fully saturated regimes. To overcome the difficulties arising from the lack in regularity, we first apply the Kirchhoff transformation and then formulate a <b>continous</b> mixed variational formulation for a time-integrated version of the equation. Based on this we discretize using in time a scheme equivalent with backward Euler and in space the lowest order Raviart-Thomas elements. Simultaneously, a <b>continous</b> and a semidiscrete (<b>continous</b> in time) conformal variational formulations are stated and the equivalence between the corresponding mixed and conformal schemes is proved. This allows the use of techniques specific for conformal elements to get error estimates for the mixed finite element approach. Numerical results are presented to confirm our theoretical analysis, in particular showing the convergence of the scheme. The advantage of our approach is that the convergence was obtained without any extra regularity assumptions...|$|E

Because of the tight competition, the company is challenged to do <b>continous</b> improvement in order to fulfill customer expectations. In doing <b>continous</b> improvements, a good monitoring and evaluation system is needed because results of monitoring and evaluation can provide informations for the company in determining actions for improvements. Clay-Making Departments are departments in PT Doulton, which formed and shaped the wares. But, there are problems in monitoring and evaluation in these departments. Monitoring is done only when the production is over and it can not show whether a proccess is running well or not. Evaluation only focused on quality aspect. As the result, <b>continous</b> improvements in other aspects can not be done because there is no information about them.

The possibility to buy and sell stocks introduces a new dimension to the dynamics of the problem. By using the Itoo calculus we derive the basic properties of the <b>continous</b> model.

In the control group the nerve was not repaired at all. After 6 weeks the dogs were killed and the nerve was studied by light and electronic microscopes.
