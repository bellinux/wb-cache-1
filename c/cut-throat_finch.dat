50|$|Males have vibrant red {{heads and}} chests while the females are duller. The {{resemblance}} to the <b>cut-throat</b> <b>finch</b> is unmistakable. The red-headed and <b>cut-throat</b> <b>finch</b> are the only members of the genus Amadina. Amadinas with their heavy beaks resemble members of the Lonchura, so they are actually {{more closely related to}} the Pytilias such as the Melba finch.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cut-throat</b> <b>finch</b> (Amadina fasciata) is {{a common}} species of estrildid finch found {{throughout}} Africa; it {{is also known as}} the bearded finch, the ribbon finch, the cut throat, and the weaver finch.|$|E
5000|$|The genus name Amadina is a {{corrupted}} diminiutive of {{the genus}} name Ammodramus, the genus of several American sparrows. Swainson thought the <b>cut-throat</b> <b>finch</b> formed a link between that genus and the genus Estrilda, and created the name to reflect that linkage.|$|E
25|$|Chestnut sparrows (Passer eminibey) {{sometimes}} drive grey-capped social weavers {{from their}} nests {{to take them}} over. <b>Cut-throat</b> <b>finches</b> (Amadina fasciata) however only use deserted nests.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cut-throat</b> <b>finches</b> usually use nests {{constructed}} by other birds [...] A clutch usually consists of 4 to 6 white eggs, which hatch after an incubation period of 12 days.|$|R
40|$|A microspectrophotometric {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the retinal photoreceptors of four species of bird: <b>cut-throat</b> <b>finches</b> (Amadina fasciata), gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae), white-headed munias (Lonchura maja) and plum-headed finches (Neochmia modesta). Spectral characteristics of the photoreceptors in all four species were very similar. Rods contained a medium-wavelength-sensitive visual pigment with a wavelength of maximum absorbance at 502 - 504 nm. Four spectrally distinct types of single cone contained a visual pigment with wavelength of maximum absorbance at either 370 - 373 nm (ultraviolet-sensitive), 440 - 447 nm (short-wavelength-sensitive); 500 nm (medium-wavelength-sensitive) or 562 - 565 nm (long-wavelength-sensitive). Oil droplets in the ultraviolet-sensitive single cones showed no detectable absorption between 330 nm and 800 nm. Oil droplets in the short-, medium-, and long-wavelength-sensitive single cones had cut-off wavelengths at 415 - 423 nm, 510 - 520 nm and 567 - 575 nm, respectively. Double cones contained the visual pigment with wavelength of maximum absorbance at 562 - 565 nm observed in long-wavelength-sensitive single cones. Only the principal member of the double cone pair contained an oil droplet (P-type, cut-off wavelength at 414 - 489 nm depending on species and retinal location). Spectral transmittance of the intact ocular media of each species was measured along the optic axis. Wavelengths of 0. 5 transmittance for all species were very similar (316 - 318 nm) ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>cut-throat</b> <b>finch</b> has plumage that is pale, sandy {{brown with}} flecks of black all over. They have a black-brown tail, a thick white chin and cheeks, and a {{chestnut}} brown patch on the belly. The legs are a pink fleshy colour. The adult male has {{a bright red}} band across its throat (thus the name [...] "cut throat"), while the male juveniles have a slightly duller red band.|$|E
