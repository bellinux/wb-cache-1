The norm AISI 2007 was used because it is the most recent one when developing the research. The Screen Design Aid and the Spreadsheet were prepared in Microsoft Excel because it is a useful tool for arising complex procedures and multiple equations appear when using cold formed structures. Tables and figures are obtained for target sections, where data regarding the moment of resistance, compression, shear and tension are shown. Also, a Spreadsheet that allows to introduce new profiles for immediate analysis is added. The situations later mentioned are resolved; however, aspects like joint designs or the analysis of other kinds of failures like web crippling are not covered. In addition, it is used for the analysis of individual members and structures of the sort.

This methodology can be considered an `Expert Design System' for <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> <b>sections.</b> A different method of determining section properties of profiles was introduced, using the properties of line and circular elements. Graphics were introduced to show the outline of the profile on screen. The analysis of beam loading has been expanded to beam loading conditions where the number of supports, point loads, and uniform distributive loads can be specified by the designer. The profile can then be checked for suitability for the specified type of loading. Artificial Intelligence concepts have been introduced to give the designer decision support from the computer, in combination with the computer aided design facilities. The more complex decision support was adopted through the use of production rules. All the support was based on the British standards. A method has been introduced, by which the appropriate use of stiffeners can be determined and consequently designed by the designer. Finally, the methodology by which the designer is given assistance from the computer, without constraining the designer, was developed.

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} is an {{investigation}} on the response of hot-finished and <b>cold</b> <b>formed,</b> hollow and concrete-filled circular hollow section braces in earthquake resisting concentrically braced frames. The role of these braces is to act as structural ‘fuses’ in the frame, dissipating the seismic energy by undergoing plastic deformations. Circular hollow sections offer aesthetic and structural advantages over conventional rectangular hollow sections owing to the uniformity of the section geometry. Distinct behaviour is observed between <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> and hot-finished tubes, since the <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> <b>sections</b> retain {{a higher degree of}} residual stresses from manufacturing. Braces subjected to cyclic loading fail after the occurrences of global and local buckling, but the performance can be enhanced by employing concrete infill. The concrete-filled steel tube is an optimum combination of the two materials, resulting in an efficient, economic and practical structural member. Experiments were performed in which cyclic axial loading was applied to hollow and composite braces of each section type. Hot-finished specimens exhibited superior ductility to <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> members. Concrete infill enhanced the tensile resistance for members of all lengths, the compressive resistance of shorter members and the number of cycles to failure. Finite element models were subsequently developed with ABAQUS® software, using the inbuilt nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model and the damaged plasticity model to define the steel and concrete characteristics. Reliable simulations were achieved for the hollow braces but further work is required for the composite braces. Both local and global slenderness values influenced the specimen response. Expressions were proposed to predict the displacement ductility and energy dissipation capability of hollow braces in terms of these parameters. The findings suggest that distinct guidelines could be developed for introduction into Eurocode 8 for each steel section type, and that the benefits of concrete infill could be taken into account in dissipative design...|$|R

This study presents and discusses the behavior of composite beam with <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel <b>section</b> and innovative shear connectors. The composite beam comprises two <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel of lipped C-sections oriented back to back to form I-steel beam and perpendicular metal decking concrete slab. Three types of bracket shear connectors namely single bracket (SBSC), double bracket (DBSC) and hot rolled plate (HPSC) shear connectors were developed and used; the proposed shear connectors were fixed to the web of steel beam by bolts. In addition, headed stud (HSSC) shear connector welded to the top flange of <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel beam was also investigated. Push tests in accordance with Eurocode 4 were carried out to determine the strength capacity and ductility of the proposed shear connectors. Sequentially, full-scale beam tests were conducted to investigate the actual behavior of the composite beam with the proposed shear connectors. The length of full-scale specimen between supports is 4000 mm. Theoretical validation for the experimental results was performed based on the plastic analysis of composite beam. The experimental results of push tests showed very good strength with extreme deformation capacity for all bracket shear connectors suggesting that they are strong and ductile enough to provide composite action between steel beam and concrete slab. Also, it was observed that strength capacity of shear connector increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. For headed stud shear connectors, the stud possess strength capacity as high as its predicted strength. The results of full-scale beam tests showed very good agreement as compared to theoretical values that predicted based on push test results. The bending resistance and stiffness of the composite beams were improved up to 170 % and 270 % respectively as compared to non-composite <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel beam.

Image analysis techniques {{can be applied to}} many different applications and assessing the quality and the accuracy of <b>cold</b> roll <b>formed</b> steel <b>sections</b> is no exception. The operations detailed within this paper are both traditional image processing methods and novel neural network based techniques which are combined together to give a bespoke alternative to the manual processing currently employed to test these sections. The results show the suitability of using image analysis and image processing to aid in the quality control of <b>cold</b> steel roll <b>forming</b> and initial tests have demonstrated great potential for this work. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed {{steel is}} a {{lightweight}} construction material generally in C or Z shaped produced by cold rolling from strip steel. It {{can be applied}} in the Industrialized Building System (IBS) {{in order to reduce}} the time and cost in construction project. Partial strength connection is a connection whereby the moment resistance of the connection is less than that of the moment capacity of the connected beam. In this paper, Numerical simulation is conducted by using ANSYS Workbench 14. 0 in order to predict the structural behaviors of <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel partial strength connection. The objective of this study is to develop moment rotation curve for flange-web-cleat connection using double channel <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel <b>section</b> under monotonic loading. Experiment test results are then used to compare and validate the results from the finite element modeling. This study aims to understand the behaviour of cold-formed steel connections under monotonic loading. The beam section of 1. 5 -meter length and column of 3 -meter length is modeled in this study. Three different beam depth have been selected in this study, which is 150 mm, and the depth of column section is fix to 250 mm. Brackets connections were chosen and all connections were formed using bolts. The monotonic load is applied at 1000 mm from the column surface. The stiffness and moment capacity is obtained from the moment rotation curve which plotted from the modeling results. As a conclusion, The FEM initial results showed good agreement with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Part 2 {{presents}} the cost optimization, comparison and competitiveness between three different composite floor systems: composite beams produced from duo-symmetrical welded I <b>sections,</b> composite trusses <b>formed</b> from rolled channel sections and composite trusses made from <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> hollow <b>sections.</b> In order {{to carry out}} a precise comparison between the mentioned composite systems, we applied the structural optimization method rather than classical structural analysis. The optimization was performed by the non-linear programming approach, NLP. The parametric optimization was made for simply supported beams of different spans, loads, steel costs (prices) and different hourly labour costs. An accurate cost objective function of the self-manufacturing material, power and labour costs, described in Part 1, we redefined for the optimization and subjected to the design, stress and deflection (in) equality constraints in order to satisfy the requirements of both the ultimate and the serviceability limit state. The composite structures were designed in accordance with Eurocode 4. The aim of the comparison was to define the spans and loads, at which each of the presented composite structures shows its advantages. Comparative diagrams, displayed {{at the end of the}} paper, can be usefully applied for choosing the optimal type of structure...|$|R
40|$|Residual {{stresses}} in cold-formed {{members may}} {{play a significant role}} in determining their behaviour and strength, and have traditionally been obtained by laboratory measurements. This paper presents the results of research which forms part of a larger study on the theoretical predictions of residual stresses in cold-formed sections. The paper is concerned with residual stresses that arise from the coiling and uncoiling process experienced by steel sheets before they are <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> into <b>sections.</b> In this paper, a closed-form solution is presented for these residual stresses, in which the coiling and uncoiling process is modelled as an elastic-plastic plane strain pure bending problem with the steel assumed to obey the von Mises yield criterion and the Prandtl-Reuss flow rule. To facilitate its application in subsequent finite element simulation of the cold-forming process, the prediction of equivalent plastic strains is also addressed in this solution. The accuracy of the solution is demonstrated by comparing its predictions with those from a finite element simulation. Numerical results from the analytical solution are also presented to illustrate the development process of residual stresses and the effects of coiling curvature and yield stress on the final residual stresses.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the experimental tests {{carried out to}} evaluate the behaviour {{of different types of}} shear connectors proposed for <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel (CFS) <b>section</b> integrated with ferrocement slab as potential used for composite beam. Ten push-out test specimens of cold-formed steel lipped channel sections connected with ferrocement slab were tested. Three types of shear connectors were studied comprised of bolts, self-drilling-screw and bar angle. The connection behavior is analysed in terms of its load-slip relationship and the failure mode. The parametric studies were performed to investigate the effect on the shear connector’s capacity by varying the number of layers of wire mesh used in ferrocement slab and types of shear connector used. A theoretical analysis (Eurocode 4) were carried out to verify the experiment results. The results show that the experimental and theoretical proved to have good agreement with each other...|$|R
