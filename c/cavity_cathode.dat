40|$|A pseudospark-sourced {{electron}} beam is a promising candidate for driving a THz millimeter wave radiation source. However, the physics governing the {{electron beam}} density profile and the beam center {{deviation from the}} axis of the structure, which {{may be caused by}} the randomness in the pseudospark discharge process, remains still unclear especially for the high energy component of the pseudospark-sourced electron beam which is usually non-mono-energetic. It is essential to study the electron beam density profile and the beam center position distribution for optimizing the pseudospark discharge configuration. In this paper, images of some single-shot electron beam pulses have been captured using a 50 μm thickness stopping copper foil and a phosphor screen coated with P 47 scintillator to study the electron beam density profile and the beam center position distribution of the high energy component of the electron beam. The experiments have been carried out on two pseudospark discharge configurations with two different size hollow <b>cathode</b> <b>cavities.</b> The influence of the cathode aperture of each configuration has also been studied according to the beam images.

40|$|Emittance {{compensation}} {{using the}} static axial magnetic field from a solenoid surrounding an rf photoinjector {{has been used}} to reduce the rms emittance of the electron beam by up to an order of magnitude, for photoinjectors ranging from 433 MHz to 8 GHz. The residual emittance after standard solenoidal compensation depends primarily on how linear the space-charge force is along the electron bunch in terms of an axial Taylor expansion, and is typically a strong function of both solenoid position and focusing strength. In this paper, the authors investigate the concept of second-order emittance compensation using the combination of a solenoid and radial rf focusing. They numerically demonstrate that (1) lower residual emittances are possible if second-order compensation is introduced by adding radially focusing rf forces in the first photoinjector <b>cavity</b> near the <b>cathode,</b> (2) the residual emittance is less sensitive to solenoid position, (3) the residual emittance is less sensitive to solenoid strength, and (4) the optimal solenoid position is further from the photoinjector cathode, leading to less stringent design requirements, especially at high frequencies...|$|R

The essence of the method is that the thyratron grid and the hollow cathode of the auxiliary discharge has to be grounded and the trigger pulse is applied to the ring anode of the trigger unit. In the proposed method, an undesirable high-voltage spike at the thyratron grid, which can appear with a usage of the other methods of triggering, is absent. It is shown that to trigger the thyratron a critical pulsed current to the main <b>cathode</b> <b>cavity</b> at a level of 0. 8 A and higher should be provided.

Therefore, we have investigated the static current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the MHCD for discharge currents up to l 5 mA and argon pressures up to 900 mbar. For the planar geometry, a scaling law of the microhollow cathode effect was found as function of the reduced pressure pD. On the contrary, for the closed cathode geometry a solely positive slope over the entire I-V characteristics is obtained. This result can be {{very important for the}} parallel operation of identical MHCD without ballast resistors. We have also shown that in the whole existence domain of the self-sustained MHCD, a strong low-frequency instability occurs for both the microhollow cathode geometries.

40|$|RF {{electron}} {{guns are}} capable of producing electron bunches with high brightness, which outperform DC electron guns and may {{even be able to}} provide electron beams for the ILC without the need for a damping ring. However, all successful existing guns for polarized electrons are DC guns because the environment inside an RF gun is hostile to the GaAs cathode material necessary for polarization. While the typical vacuum pressure in a DC gun is better than 10 {sup - 11 } torr the vacuum in an RF gun is in the order of 10 {sup - 9 } torr. Experiments at BINP Novosibirsk show that this leads to strong ion back-bombardment and generation of dark currents, which destroy the GaAs cathode in a short time. The situation might be much more favorable in a (super-conducting) SRF gun. The cryogenic pumping of the gun cavity walls may make it possible to maintain a vacuum close to 10 {sup - 12 } torr, solving the problem of ion bombardment and dark currents.

The objective of this task is to develop a superconducting gun capable of accelerating 100 mA to 10 MeV with sufficiently low emittance. The development work is initially based on the 3 cell superconducting RF photocathode gun developed at Forschungszentrum Rossendorf (FZR). The FZR gun is designed for CW operation mode producing a 1 mA average current of 1 nC electron bunches accelerated up to energy of 9. 5 MeV and is due to be installed at the ELBE superconducting electron linear accelerator [1]. The gun has a 3 cell niobium cavity operating at 1. 3 GHz. The cavity consists of 3 TESLA-type cells and a specially designed half-cell in which the photocathode will be placed. Typical ERL-based projects require ~ 100 mA average current, and therefore suitable upgrade paths are required.

40|$|In a {{positive}} polarity induction adder {{each of the}} induction <b>cavities</b> is a <b>cathode,</b> which emits electrons at a unique potential. These broad spectrum electrons strongly affect Magnetically Insulated Transmission Line (MITL) behavior. Electron flow decreases the cavity-to-MITL coupling efficiency, and reduces the power transport efficiency along the system. Also the operating impedance of the MITL is lowered, reducing the diode impedance required for good coupling and good total system power efficiency [l- 4]. It is therefore imperative to understand the details of MITL electron flow. In previous work, measurement of MITL electron flow for a twenty-stage linear induction adder (Hermes III), operated in positive polarity, was compared with simulations [l]. There was qualitative agreement, hut some differences were noted. For example, measured electron flow in the first cavities was greater than in the simulations. We have extended the work on this subject with detailed current measurementson a ten-stage linear induction adder (SABRE). Time resolved electron flow is determined from the difference between anode and cathode currents at several axial locations. A time-resolved mapping of electron flow versus adder length is constructed. Measurements of electron flow in the initial cavities agreed well with simulations. Electron flow for times near the current peak exhibits a monotonic increase with length, except at the adder end. : : : u”clu*u E Figure 1. SABRE ten-stage adder. Arrows denote B-dot locations.

40|$|International audienceThe failure {{mechanisms}} of micro hollow cathode discharges (MHCD) in silicon {{have been investigated}} using their I-V characteristics, high speed photography and scanning electron microscopy. Experiments were carried out in helium. We observed I–V instabilities {{in the form of}} rapid voltage decreases associated with current spikes. The current spikes can reach values more than 100 times greater than the average MHCD current. (The peaks can be more than 1 Ampere for a few 10 ’s of nanoseconds.) These current spikes are correlated in time with 3 – 10 μm diameter optical flashes that occur inside the cavities. The SEM characterizations indicated that blister-like structures form on the Si surface during plasma operation. Thin Si layers detach from the surface in localized regions. We theorize that shallow helium implantation occurs and forms the ‘blisters’ whenever the Si is biased as the cathode. These blisters ‘explode’ when the helium pressure inside them becomes too large leading to the transient micro-arcs seen in both the optical emission and the I–V characteristics. We noted that blisters were never found on the metal counter electrode, even when it was biased as the cathode (and the Si as the anode). This observation led to a few suggestions for delaying the failure of Si MHCDs. One may coat the Si <b>cathode</b> (<b>cavities)</b> with blister resistant material; design the MHCD array to operate with the Si as the anode rather than as the cathode; or use a gas additive to prevent surface damage. Regarding the latter, tests using SF 6 as the gas additive successfully prevented blister formation through rapid etching. The result was an enhanced MHCD lifetime...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{photocathode}} rf guns {{have been proven}} to be successful for providing very high quality electron beams required for vacuum ultraviolet and x-ray free-electron lasers. Beam dynamics simulations show that the electron beam quality in a rf gun depends strongly on the beam dynamics {{in the vicinity of}} the cathode. Therefore, the injection process plays a significant role in the beam performance. Several codes are available to simulate the beam dynamics in the gun. They are able to track the beam under the influence of external fields and space charge forces, but details of the emission processes are still missing in these simulations. In photocathode rf guns, the electron beams have a high charge density. Especially during emission from the cathode, the electrons have a very low velocity and experience high longitudinal space charge forces counteracting the applied accelerating field. Because of the space charge field, some part of the electrons emitted from the cathode might move backward to the cathode where they can produce secondary electrons. A high electric field in the gun cavity, on the other hand, generates a large amount of dark current. If the field-emitted electrons from the cathode or any other surface inside the <b>cavity</b> hit the <b>cathode,</b> secondary electrons can be produced as well. For a detailed understanding of the electron beam and dark current in a rf gun, simulations including a model of the secondary electron emission are necessary. In this paper, a simple model is discussed with an application to the beam dynamics at high emission phases in rf guns. Detailed simulations have been done in comparison to measurements at the Photo Injector Test Facility at DESY in Zeuthen.

In an e ort to explore research and development areas required for future ERL design and operation, the demonstration facility BERLinPro will be built at Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin. It will demonstrate feasibility of the ERL concept in a parameter scale envisaged for X ray facilities.

40|$|Summary In this work, {{several aspects}} around {{headspace}} (HS) sampling and detection hyphenated with gas chromatography (GC) were covered. Regarding HS sampling, {{the results of}} three studies were reported around the problems encountered with the analysis of aqueous samples and/or high boiling analytes with a high affinity for the matrix in chapters 2 to 4 in this manuscript, whilst the final chapter covers the development and characterization of a novel GC detector. In chapter 2, {{the use of the}} full evaporation technique (FET) for the analysis of high boiling analytes with a high affinity for apolar matrices was evaluated and compared with the conventional static HS (sHS) sampling approach. A FET method has been developed and validated for the analysis of typical high boiling analytes (bp. > 200 °C) including camphor, menthol, methyl salicylate and ethyl salicylate that are often used in various topical formulations. Data have shown that FET is an excellent approach to circumvent matrix effects that are often encountered with sHS methods. The method showed excellent recovery and repeatability during validation and was finally applied on commercial formulations such as Radosalil , ThermoCream , Vicks Vaporub  and Reflexspray . In chapter 3, acetone acetals were employed as water scavengers for the analysis of aqueous samples using HS-GC. After optimization of the scavenging reaction conditions, the approach was used for FET analysis of various typical high boiling polar residual solvents that are miscible with water. The procedure enabled sample enrichment which provided a significant gain in sensitivity of the FET analysis of these analytes and it was finally applied on a cefotaxime sample for the quantification of residual N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). During experiments it was revealed that the same procedure can be used for the quantitative derivatization of ethylene glycol (EG) in aqueous samples. The formation of the significantly more volatile 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane (2, 2 -DD) enabled determining EG using sHS sampling. In chapter 4, a novel HS approach for the analysis of quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) in aqueous samples is presented in which the reported water scavenging method from chapter 3 is used for the removal of water and sample enrichment. Screening experiments revealed that QAS substituted with benzyl and methyl groups degrade to form benzyl chloride and chloromethane under the used experimental conditions. By using chloromethane and benzyl chloride for quantification of such QAS, matching calibration standards are not needed. This means that one kind can be used for the determination of other QAS that also yield chloromethane and benzyl chloride as reaction products. The methodology was used for the analysis of denatonium benzoate (DB) in EG based cooling liquids and the analysis of benzoxonium chloride (BZOCL) or benzethonium chloride (BZTCl) in mouth sprays. Finally in chapter 5, work around the development and characterization of a novel GC detector is presented. The detector used a micro <b>cavity</b> hollow <b>cathode</b> discharge (µCHCD) plasma as ion source combined with an either positively or negatively biased capture electrode. Typical advantages of the used low power µCHCD are the increased ionization efficiency compared to the hydrogen flame used in the flame ionization detector (FID) and operation at atmospheric pressure without the need for additional gasses. During development of the µCHCD ion source {{it was found that the}} detector geometry was of great influence on the obtained signal. By adapting to a geometry with a wide anode clearance angle, a sensitive response in the pg range was obtained for various analytes including carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) which is poorly detected with the FID. It was noticed that halogenated analytes were possibly subjected to a different ionization mechanism than the non-halogenated species. Halogenated ones most likely form negative ions in the electron rich plasma as these were most efficiently detected by a positively biased capture electrode. status: publishe...|$|R

Five of the eight volumes comprise the electron beamline. They are the 5 -cell Superconducting RF Cavity, Superconducting e-gun, injection, loop and beam dump. Two vacuum regions are the individual cryostats insulating the 5 -cell Superconducting RF Cavity and the Superconducting e-gun structures. The last ERL vacuum volume not shown in the schematic is the laser transport line. The beamline vacuum regions are separated by electropneumatic gate valves. The beam dump is common with loop beamline but is considered a separate volume due to geometry and requirements. Vacuum in the 5 -cell SRF cavity is maintained in the {approx} 10 {sup - 9 } torr range at room temperature by two 20 l/s ion pumps and in the e-gun SRF cavity by one 60 l/s ion pump. Vacuum in the SRF cavities operated at 2 {sup o}K is reduced to low 10 {sup - 11 } torr via cryopumping of the <b>cavity</b> walls. The <b>cathode</b> of the e-gun must be protected from poisoning, which can occur if vacuum adjacent to the e-gun in the injection line exceeds 10 - 11 torr range in the injection warm beamline near the e-gun exit. The vacuum requirements for beam operation in the loop and beam dump are 10 - 9 torr range. The beamlines are evacuated from atmospheric pressure to high vacuum level with a particulate free, oil free turbomolecular pumping cart. 25 l/s shielded ion pumps distributed throughout the beamlines maintain the vacuum requirement. Due to the more demanding vacuum requirement of the injection beamline proximate to the e-gun, a vacuum bakeout of the injection beamline is required. In addition, two 200 l/s diode ion pumps and supplemental pumping provided by titanium sublimation pumps are installed in the injection line just beyond the exit of the e-gun. Due to expected gas load a similar pumping arrangement is planned for the beam dump. The cryostat vacuum thermally insulating the SRF cavities need only reduce the convective heat load such that heat loss is primarily radiation through several layers of multi-layer insulation and conductive end-losses which are contained by 5 {sup o}K thermal transitions. Prior to cool down rough vacuum {approx} 10 {sup - 5 } torr range is established and maintained by a dedicated turbomolecular pump station.

40|$|Advances of {{elemental}} analysis in geology {{are defined by}} the development and improvement ofphysical, instrumental methods of chemical analysis. New instrumental methods - emission spectrometry and mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP) sources {{are the most popular}} in the area of {{elemental analysis}} in recent years. These methods have a very high sensitivity and wide range of elements analyzed (up to 70 items at a time). Both of these methods have been developed and demonstrate their high analytical performance only when analyzing liquids. Consequently, when using these methods in geology, solid samples must be completely transferred into liquid. This complicates the analysis, especially in the analysis of sparingly soluble objects. In some cases, analyzed geological objects are generally insoluble in acids and other solvents (e. g. such as black shales are not dissolved till the end in any acids). Naturally, {{there is a need to}} develop an analytical method, wherein the step of dissolution of the sample can be avoided. Such instrumental methods exist but are not used because of low sensitivity. Method of glow discharge mass spectrometry has the greatest potential today, but its use is hampered by lack of a recognized certified ion source capable of converting analyzed (in most cases - not conductive) geological sample into low-temperature plasma. In this paper, the glow discharge source on the basis of the hollow cathode is used as an external source. The hollow cathode has been long and successfully used in analytical practice in emission spectral analysis. However, for use in mass spectrometry, its design has been considerably modified. The analyzed sample, which was formerly in the form of powder or fine particles located at the bottom of the hollow cathode, in a new cathode is installed as a rod along the axis of the inner <b>cathode</b> <b>cavity</b> - it is the emitter of sputtered neutral particles. Hollow cathode source is set on the high resolution mass - spectrometer of ELEMENT 2 type instead of the ICP source. In sample preparation a geological sample is transformed into ultrafine state (particle size of about one micron), this thin layer of powder is applied to the emitter. Particles are held on the emitter (cathode) by van der Waals and electrostatic forces, are bombarded with argon ions, they can be also effected by electrostatic forces - between the emitter and the anode voltage of several hundred volts is applied. As a result, the charged ultra-disperse particles break away from the - emitter and diffuse into the glow discharge. Getting into the negative glow particles are heated by the electron current, then evaporate and ionize. The low-temperature plasma is formed. Mass spectral line of each element consists of many individual spikes lasting 10 - 30 msec. Each spike is the result of evaporation and ionization of individual particles. Mass spectral lines can be smoothed in the summation series of mass spectra. The proposed method allows direct analysis of geological samples with sensitivity ppb or less without dissolving the sample, without concentration of impurities...|$|R
40|$|The system {{built to}} {{characterize}} electrodes and, consequently, deposited fine films are constituted by a hollow cathode {{that works to}} discharges and low pressures (approximately 10 - 3 to 5 mbar), a source DC (0 to 1200 V), a cylindrical camera of closed borossilicato for flanges of stainless steel with an association of vacuum bombs mechanical and spread. In the upper flange it is connected the system of hollow cathode, which possesses an entrance of gas and two entrances for its refrigeration, the same is electrically isolated {{of the rest of}} the equipment and it is polarized negatively. In front of the system of hollow cathode there is a movable sample in stainless steel with possibility of moving in the horizontal and vertical. In the vertical, the sample can vary its distance between 0 and 70 mm and, in the horizontal, can leave completely from the front of the hollow cathode. The sample and also the cathode hollow are equipped with cromel-alumel termopares with simultaneous reading of the temperatures during the time of treatment. In this work copper electrodes, bronze, titanium, iron, stainless steel, powder of titanium, powder of titanium and silício, glass and ceramic were used. The electrodes were investigated relating their geometry change and behavior of the plasma of the <b>cavity</b> of hollow <b>cathode</b> and channel of the gas. As the <b>cavity</b> of hollow <b>cathode,</b> the analyzed aspects were the diameter and depth. With the channel of the gas, we verified the diameter. In the two situations, we investigated parameters as flow of the gas, pressure, current and applied tension in the electrode, temperature, loss of mass of the electrode with relationship at the time of use. The flow of gas investigated in the electrodes it was fastened in a work strip from 15 to 6 sccm, the constant pressure of work was among 2. 7 to 8 x 10 - 2 mbar. The applied current was among a strip of work from 0, 8 to 0, 4 A, and their respective tensions were in a strip from 400 to 220 V. Fixing the value of the current, it was possible to lift the curve of the behavior of the tension with the time of use. That curves esteem in that time of use of the electrode to its efficiency is maximum. The temperatures of the electrodes were in the dependence of that curves showing a maximum temperature when the tension was maximum, yet the measured temperatures in the samples showed to be sensitive the variation of the temperature in the electrodes. An accompaniment of the loss of mass of the electrode relating to its time of use showed that the electrodes that appeared the spherical cavities lost more mass in comparison with the electrodes in that didn't appear. That phenomenon is only seen for pressures of 10 - 2 mbar, in these conditions a plasma column is formed inside of the channel of the gas and in certain points it is concentrated in form of spheres. Those spherical cavities develop inside of the channel of the gas spreading during the whole extension of the channel of the gas. The used electrodes were cut after they could not be more used, however among those electrodes, films that were deposited in alternate times and the electrodes that were used to deposit films in same times, those films were deposited in the glass substrata, alumina, stainless steel 420, stainless steel 316, silício and steel M 2. As the eletros used to deposit films in alternate time as the ones that they were used to deposit in same times, the behavior of the thickness of the film obeyed the curve of the tension with relationship the time of use of the electrode, that is, when the tension was maximum, the thickness of the film was also maximum and when the tension was minimum, the thickness was minimum and in the case where the value of the tension was constant, the thickness of the film tends to be constant. The fine films that were produced they had applications with nano stick, bio-compatibility, cellular growth, inhibition of bacterias, cut tool, metallic leagues, brasagem, pineapple fiber and ornamental. In those films it was investigated the thickness, the adherence and the uniformity characterized by sweeping electronic microscopy. Another technique developed to assist the production and characterization of the films produced in that work was the caloteste. It uses a sphere and abrasive to mark the sample with a cap impression, with that cap form it is possible to calculate the thickness of the film. Through the time of life of the cathode, it was possible to evaluate the rate of waste of its material for the different work conditions. Values of waste rate up to 3, 2 x 10 - 6 g/s were verified. For a distance of the substratum of 11 mm, the deposited film was limited to a circular area of 22 mm diameter mm for high pressures and a circular area of 75 mm for pressure strip. The obtained films presented thickness around 2, 1 µm, showing that the discharge of arch of hollow cathode in argon obeys a curve characteristic of the tension with the time of life of the eletrodo. The deposition rate obtained in this system it is of approximately 0, 18 µm/minCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível SuperiorO sistema construído para caracterizar eletrodos e, conseqüentemente, filmes finos depositados é constituído por um cátodo oco que trabalha a altas e baixas pressões (aproximadamente 10 - 3 a 5 mbar), uma fonte DC (0 a 1200 V), uma câmara cilíndrica de borossilicato fechada por flanges de aço inox com uma associação de bombas de vácuo mecânica e difusora. No flange superior está conectado o sistema de cátodo oco, o qual possui uma entrada de gás e duas entradas para a sua refrigeração, o mesmo está eletricamente isolado do resto do equipamento e é polarizado negativamente. Em frente ao sistema de cátodo oco encontra-se um porta amostra em aço inox móvel com possibilidade de se mover na horizontal e vertical. Na vertical, o porta amostra pode variar a sua distância entre 0 e 70 mm e, na horizontal, pode sair completamente da frente do cátodo oco. Tanto o porta amostra como o cátodo oco são equipados com termopares de cromel-alumel com leitura simultânea das temperaturas durante o tempo de tratamento. Neste trabalho foram utilizados eletrodos de cobre, bronze, titânio, ferro, aço inox, pó de titânio, pó de titânio e silício, vidro e cerâmica. Os eletrodos foram investigados com relação a sua mudança de geometria e comportamento do plasma dentro da cavidade de cátodo oco e canal do gás. Quanto a cavidade de cátodo oco, os aspectos analisados foram o diâmetro e sua profundidade. Com o canal do gás, verificamos o diâmetro. Nas duas situações, investigamos parâmetros como fluxo do gás, pressão, corrente e tensão aplicada no eletrodo, temperatura, perda de massa do eletrodo com relação ao tempo de uso. O fluxo de gás investigado nos eletrodos foi fixado em uma faixa de trabalho de 15 a 6 sccm, a pressão constante de trabalho ficou entre 2. 7 a 8 x 10 - 2 mbar. A corrente aplicada foi entre uma faixa de trabalho de 0, 8 a 0, 4 A, e as suas respectivas tensões ficaram em uma faixa de 400 a 220 V. Fixando o valor da corrente, foi possível levantar a curva do comportamento da tensão com o tempo de uso. Essa curva estima em que tempo de uso do eletrodo a sua eficiência é máxima. As temperaturas dos eletrodos ficaram na dependência dessa curva mostrando uma temperatura máxima quando a tensão era máxima, já as temperaturas medidas nas amostras mostraram ser sensíveis a variação da temperatura no eletrodo. Um acompanhamento da perda de massa do eletrodo com relação ao seu tempo de uso mostrou que os eletrodos que apareceram as cavidades esféricas perderam mais massa em comparação aos eletrodos em que essas não apareceram. Esse fenômeno só é visto para pressões de 10 - 2 mbar, nestas condições uma coluna de plasma se forma dentro do canal do gás e em determinados pontos fica concentrado em forma de esferas. Essas cavidades esféricas evoluem dentro do canal do gás se propagando durante toda a extensão do canal do gás. Os eletros utilizados foram cortados depois que não puderam ser mais usados, no entanto entre esses eletrodos filmes que foram depositados em tempos alternados e os eletrodos que foram utilizados para depositar filmes em tempos iguais, esses filmes foram depositados nos substratos de vidro, alumina, aço inox 420, aço inox 316, silício e aço M 2. Tanto os eletros usados para depositar filmes em tempo alternado como os que foram usados para depositar em tempos iguais, o comportamento da espessura do filme obedeceu a curva da tensão com relação ao tempo de uso do eletrodo, isto é, quando a tensão era máxima, a espessura do filme também foi máxima e quando a tensão era mínima, a espessura foi mínima e no caso onde o valor da tensão foi constante, a espessura do filme tende a ficar constante. Os filmes finos que foram produzidos tiveram aplicações com nano bastão, bio-compatibilidade, crescimento celular, inibição de bactérias, ferramenta de corte, ligas metálicas, brasagem, fibra de abacaxi e decorativos. Nesses filmes foi investigada a espessura, a aderência e a uniformidade caracterizadas por microscopia eletrônica de varredura. Outra técnica desenvolvida para atender a produção e caracterização dos filmes produzidos nesse trabalho foi o caloteste. Ele se utiliza de uma esfera e abrasivo para marcar a amostra com uma impressão de calota, com essa forma de calota é possível calcular a espessura do filme. Através do tempo de vida do cátodo, foi possível avaliar a taxa de desgaste do seu material para as diferentes condições de trabalho. Valores de taxa de desgaste até 3, 2 x 10 - 6 g/s foram verificados. Para uma distância do substrato de 11 mm, o filme depositado ficou limitado a uma área circular de 22 mm de diâmetro para pressões altas e uma área circular de 75 mm para faixa de pressão. Os filmes obtidos apresentaram espessura em torno de 2, 1 µm, mostrando que a descarga de arco de cátodo oco em argônio obedece a uma curva característica da tensão com o tempo de vida do eletrodo. A taxa de deposição obtida neste sistema é de aproximadamente 0, 18 µm/mi...|$|R
