The purpose of the current study was to design a new Dutch licence plate that could be remembered well. A memory experiment was conducted, in which 16 different <b>character</b> <b>arrangements</b> were presented for both 450 and 550 ms to 48 participants with ages varying between 20 and 57 years. Participants had to rehearse the stimuli for 6 s, after which they had to be written down. Based on literature on short-term memory for serial order, <b>character</b> <b>arrangements</b> differed on three dimensions: 1) number of alternations between letters and digits; 2) letter to digit ratio; and 3) equality of group size. Results showed that number of alternations between characters of different categories affected memory performance the most. Letter to digit ratio and equality of group size affected memory performance to a lesser, but still significant, extent. A significant interaction between the latter two factors indicates that equal groups only lead to fewer memory errors when more than three letters are used. With three or fewer letters, group size is not a significant factor any more. Based on these results, a new licence plate for Dutch vehicles was recommended, which was subsequently adopted...|$|R
40|$|In {{a survey}} of the {{endophytic}} fungi from Pinus tabulaeformis in northeast China, approximately 11 % of isolates did not produce spores, although various techniques were employed to promote sporulation. These sterile mycelia were grouped into 74 morphotypes based on similar cultural <b>characters.</b> <b>Arrangement</b> of isolates into morphotypes does not reflect species phylogeny, and therefore they were further identified based on phylogenetic analysis of the 5. 8 S gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1 and ITS 2) regions, as well as sequence similarity comparison. Sequence analyses indicated that five morphotypes were Basidiomycota, while the other 69 morphotypes were Ascomycota. Further analyses resulted in two morphotypes being identified as Fusarium sporotrichioides and Schizophyllum commune. Twenty-two morphotypes were identified to generic level, seven to family (Lophiostomataceae and Valsaceae) level, and four to order (Helotiales and Pezizales) level. The 74 morphotypes were classified into 64 taxa, which indicates a high diversity of fungi on Pinus. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

While {{this is true for}} any individual and any keyboard, <b>character</b> <b>arrangement</b> can have a particularly profound impact on persons with disabilities who utilize only a single finger (or headstick, mouthstick, laser pointer, etc.) for key selection. We propose a new method for optimizing <b>character</b> <b>arrangement</b> on a fixed set of keys, based loosely on the pioneering work of Levine and Goodenough-Trepagnier. By repeatedly swapping the positions of different character pairs (or triplets) and re-evaluating the efficiency of the arrangement, our technique rapidly converges on the most efficient character layout.

And then the locally optimal adaptive binarization is utilized to make more accurate license plate localization. After the license plate localization, the segment method of vertical projection information with prior knowledge is used to slit characters and the statistical features are extracted. Then the multilevel classification RBF neural network is used to recognize characters using the feature vector as input. The results show that this method can recognize characters precisely and improve the ability of license plate character recognition effectively...|$|E

40|$|Steganography {{is the art}} {{of hiding}} {{information}} in ways that prevent the detection of hidden messages. It includes a vast array of secret communications methods that conceal the message’s very existence. These methods include invisible inks, microdots, <b>character</b> <b>arrangement,</b> digital signatures, covert channels, and spread spectrum communications. Steganography and cryptography are cousins in the spy-craft family. This paper information hiding and its applications, and image compression using proposed efficient encoding technique with the main focus being on hiding in the spatial domain are developed. Three information hiding methods are proposed, which are based on the encoding technique, are tested and the results are analyzed. Increase in tolerance level would allow using all range blocks so that more data can be stored. However low tolerance is desirable in order to give an image that is visually close to the original. Further research should go towards improving the watermarking program and adding extra functionality. One of these is looking at having multiple watermarks for a single image, so that different parts of the image have a different watermark. There is also the need to further develop the robustness of existing watermarking techniques to combat the ever-increasing attacks on watermarks. We used fixed partitioning scheme. Instead of this, adaptive partitioning scheme can be used, which would yield better results if used {{as the basis for the}} data hiding method...|$|E

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{several types}} of {{molecular}} markers and new microscale skeletal characters have shown potential as powerful tools for phylogenetic reconstructions and higher-level taxonomy of scleractinian corals. Nonetheless, discrimination of closely related taxa is still highly controversial in scleractinian coral research. Here we used newly sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes and 30 microsatellites to define the genetic divergence between two closely related azooxanthellate taxa of the family Caryophylliidae: solitary Desmophyllum dianthus and colonial Lophelia pertusa. Results: In the mitochondrial control region, an astonishing 99. 8 % of nucleotides between L. pertusa and D. dianthus were identical. Variability of the mitochondrial genomes of the two species is represented by only 12 non-synonymous out of 19 total nucleotide substitutions. Microsatellite sequence (37 loci) analysis of L. pertusa and D. dianthus showed genetic similarity is about 97 %. Our results also indicated that L. pertusa and D. dianthus show high skeletal plasticity in corallum shape and similarity in skeletal ontogeny, micromorphological (septal and wall granulations) and microstructural <b>characters</b> (<b>arrangement</b> of rapid accretion deposits, thickening deposits). Conclusions: Molecularly and morphologically, the solitary Desmophyllum and the dendroid Lophelia appear to be significantly more similar to each other than other unambiguous coral genera analysed to date. This consequently leads to ascribe both taxa under the generic name Desmophyllum (priority by date of publication). Findings of this study demonstrate that coloniality {{may not be a}} robust taxonomic character in scleractinian corals...|$|R
