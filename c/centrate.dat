5000|$|Large {{industrial}} centrifuges {{are commonly}} used in water and wastewater treatment to dry sludges. The resulting dry product is often termed cake, and the water leaving a centrifuge after most of the solids have been removed is called <b>centrate.</b>|$|E
50|$|This design {{allows the}} solid cake and the liquid <b>centrate</b> {{to leave the}} {{centrifuge}} bowl at opposite ends. For this design, the conveyor pushes the sludge towards the end streams and the supernatant liquid is allowed to exit over the weirs.|$|E
50|$|In the {{cylindrical}} {{section of}} the decanter centrifuge, the pool should ideally be shallow in order to maximise G-force for separation. Alternatively, a deeper pool is advantageous when the cake layer is too thick and the finer particles entrain into the fast liquid stream, since a thicker buffer liquid layer is present to help settle suspended solids. The compromise between cake dryness and clarity of <b>centrate</b> is to be considered. The reason behind this trade-off is that in losing fine solids to <b>centrate,</b> the cake with bigger particles is able to dewater more effectively which results in drier cake. Optimal pool for a particular application should be identified through the conduction of tests.|$|E
40|$|Size-segregated {{atmospheric}} particles {{were collected in}} Rome, Italy, using a low-pressure impactor. Twelve sampling campaigns were conducted under different meteorological conditions over a whole year covering 155 not consecutive days. The samples were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their nitro- and methyl- derivatives known for their toxicity. An assessment of the carcinogenic potency of the particles known to penetrate into lungs, liver, heart and nervous system was performed. The distribution of the classes of compounds was unimodal and <b>centrated</b> at 0. 4 pm size fraction for PAHs and bimodal and <b>centrated</b> at 0. 1 and 0. 4 pm for methyl- and nitro- derivatives. The 18 % of toxic organic compounds we analyzed was distributed into the ultrafine fraction (PM(0. 1)) and 76 % in the fine fraction; but substituted PAH distribution in the ultrafine particles shifted toward higher values during warm periods. In July, the 50 % of the total nitro-PAHs was found in PM(0. 1) and an average of 42 % of the total methyl-PAHs {{was found in the}} same fraction in summer and intermediate seasons. An evaluation of the potential toxicity of the measured compounds was tentatively assessed based on Potency Equivalency Factors (PEF). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Children who <b>centrated</b> focused on the length of the newly shaped Playdoh, or the width of the old Playdoh, and often said that one or the other was bigger. Those children who were able to focus on both dimensions, both length and width, were able to say that both clumps of Playdoh were still the same size.|$|R

50|$|Water {{content of}} sludge {{may be reduced}} by centrifugation, filtration, and/or {{evaporation}} to reduce transportation costs of disposal, or to improve suitability for composting. Centrifugation may be a preliminary step to reduce sludge volume for subsequent filtration or evaporation. Filtration may occur through underdrains in a sand drying bed or as a separate mechanical process in a belt filter press. Filtrate and <b>centrate</b> are typically returned to the sewage treatment process. After dewatering sludge may be handled as a solid containing 50 to 75 percent water. Dewatered sludges with higher moisture content are usually handled as liquids.|$|E
50|$|Sludge {{treatment}} {{technologies that}} are used for thickening or dewatering of sludge have two products: the thickened or dewatered sludge, and a liquid fraction which is called sludge treatment liquids, sludge dewatering streams, liquors, <b>centrate</b> (if it stems from a centrifuge), filtrate (if it stems from a belt filter press) or similar. This liquid requires further treatment as it is high in nitrogen and phosphorus, particularly if the sludge has been anaerobically digested. The treatment can {{take place in the}} sewage treatment plant itself (by recycling the liquid {{to the start of the}} treatment process) or as a separate process.|$|E

However, the blind children still showed a 3. 5 -year average delay in the appearance of the con-servative response compared to sighted children.

40|$|Summary. The {{motility}} of dog spermatozoa is depressed by high dilution. Dog spermatozoa survived {{best in a}} chloride diluent, buffered with phosphate.

Adding 2 to 25 % prostatic fluid to diluents partially prevented the effects of dilution on dog spermatozoa, but motility was depressed by neat prostatic fluid. There was little evidence for loss of protective substances from dog spermatozoa when left overnight, or after repeated freezing and thawing. Bovine globulin, casein, egg albumin and alanine were even more effective than prostatic fluid in preventing the dilution phenomenon, and motility in their presence {{was as good as}} in con¬ <b>centrated</b> suspensions.

Generally, freshwater strains were able to grow at high concentrations of <b>centrate,</b> with two strains, Neochloris pseudostigmata and N. conjuncta, demonstrating growth at up to 40 % v/v <b>centrate.</b> Fourteen of eighteen salt water Dunaliella strains also demonstrated growth in <b>centrate</b> concentrations at or above 40 % v/v.

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} a novel seawater-driven forward osmosis (FO) process to recover calcium phosphate precipitates from digested sludge <b>centrate</b> without any chemical addition and draw solute regeneration. The FO process effectively pre-concentrated phosphate and calcium in the digested sludge <b>centrate.</b> Spontaneous precipitation of calcium phosphate minerals in the digested sludge <b>centrate</b> {{was achieved by}} the sustained concentrative action of the FO process and the gradual pH increase due to the diffusion of protons to the draw solution. Pre-concentrating digested sludge <b>centrate</b> by three-fold resulted in a 92 % recovery of phosphate via precipitation. The phosphate precipitate only constituted 3 % of the total inorganic solids recovered, therefore subsequent treatment steps {{would be required to}} recover phosphorus in a useable form. A water flux decline of 30 % from the initial value was observed as the digested sludge was concentrated by three-fold. This observed water flux decline was mostly attributed to the decrease in the effective osmotic driving force due to the increasingly concentrated feed solution and diluted draw solution. It is also noteworthy that membrane fouling was readily reversible. By flushing the membrane with deionised water and subjecting the membrane to feed and draw solutions with the same osmotic pressure as the initial conditions, complete water flux recovery could be achieved...|$|E
