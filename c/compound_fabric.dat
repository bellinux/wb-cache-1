40|$|Clothes that retain and emanate {{body odor}} feel uncomfortable and unclean; subsequently, the adsorption, {{desorption}} and removal amounts of malodorous <b>compounds</b> from <b>fabrics</b> with different polarities were examined. 1 -Octen- 3 -one, octanal and isovaleric acid, which are important malodor compounds from the body, {{were used as}} volatile organic compounds (VOC). Samples were prepared with unfinished and β-CD finished cotton, nylon and PET fabrics. The amounts of VOCs retained on the fabrics were measured using headspace GC-MS; in addition, the odor intensity of the samples were evaluated by 10 trained pane-lists. The amounts adsorbed were estimated by weight gain; however, moisture {{was found to have}} a larger effect on the increase in weight than VOCs. The polarity of the VOCs decreased in the order of isovaleric acid, octanal and 1 -octen- 3 -one. Despite the exceptionally large amounts of octanal adsorbed on the nylon sample, the amounts of malodorous <b>compounds</b> adsorbed on <b>fabrics</b> increased with the decreasing VOC molecular weight. The unfinished PET sample adsorbed more VOCs than the unfinished-fabric samples. The odor intensity was mostly weaker in the β-CD finished fabrics than in the unfinished fabrics. The odor intensity of the β-CD finished fabrics was lower than unfinished fabrics. The amount of VOCs that remained on the soiled fabric samples after storing in air for 24 hrs decreased with the increasing VOC vapor pressure...|$|R

Although the adjective 2 ̆ 2 old fashioned 2 ̆ 2 as used in the title carries a certain amount of ironic wit, in fact my method of weaving is ancient and timeless. I chose it because it is the only way I can adequately convey the majority of my ideas about the textile world. I also work this way because I love the process itself I have tailored my ideas, and risked hobbling them, in order to continue to indulge in a way of working that suits me eminently. I weave objects which I call tapestries, although technically they are <b>compound</b> twill <b>fabrics</b> with images composed of discontinuous inlaid wefts. The structure is a threeharness twill; the ground is warp-faced and the inlaid areas are weft-faced. I selected the structure after studying the three-harness twill tapestry ofKashmiri shawls. The structure confers the ability to express acutely refined detail while yielding the drape necessary for a shawl 2 ̆ 7 s function. I adapted the weave to an inlay structure in order to economize on the time spent in weaving. In fact, I weave quite rapidly as a result, often more than 122 ̆ 2 a day. I am also able to exploit both warp and weft as design elements. The sett of my warp is relatively fine, 30 epi, which gives the work good detail and yet is a large enough scale to be able to see easily the interaction of colors between individual threads...|$|R

40|$|It is {{a matter}} of common {{observation}} that lignified plant materials are more slowly and less extensively decomposed than unlignified materials. Lignin, though not wholly unavailable, is utilized far less readily than the other cell-wall constituents, even under the most favorable circumstances. Plant tissues can-not be regarded as simple mixtures of organic <b>compounds.</b> The cell-wall <b>fabric,</b> though predominantly cellulosic, is a structure both infiltered and incrusted with lignin and polyuronide hemicelluloses, the presence and distribution of which may reasonably be expected to influence the extent of attack on the cellulose. The effects may not be directly proportionate to the amounts of the other constituents present. In general, however, above a certain point, the extent to which plant materials decompose decreases as the lignin content increases. Such a material as coir fiber, with a lignin content of over 35 per cent, is quite resistant even though the major constituent is cellulose. Olson, Peterson, and Sherrard (1937) examined the effect of the presence of lignin in wood pulps and similar products on the fermentation of the cellulose by thermophilic enrichment cul...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{measurements}} are presented {{of the performance}} of the Anaconda, a wave energy converter comprising a submerged water-filled distensible tube aligned with the incident waves. Experiments were carried out at a scale of around 1 : 25 with a 250 mm diameter tube, 7 m long, constructed of rubber and fabric, terminating in a linear power take-off of adjustable impedance. The paper presents some basic theory that leads to predictions of distensibility and bulge wave speed in a pressurised <b>compound</b> rubber and <b>fabric</b> tube, including the effects of inelastic sectors in the circumference, longitudinal tension, and the surrounding fluid. Results are shown to agree closely with measurements in still water. The theory is developed further to provide a model for the propagation of bulges and power conversion in the Anaconda. In the presence of external water waves the theory identifies three distinct internal wave components and provides theoretical estimates of power capture. For the first time, these and other predictions of the behaviour of the Anaconda, a device unlike almost all other marine systems, are shown to be in remarkably close agreement with measurements...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{examination}} of weft-faced <b>compound</b> non-silk <b>fabrics</b> found in Egypt (ca. 3 rd - 7 th century A. D.), in the Royal Ontario Museum collections, revealed many structural differences and similarities. Single, double and ply yarns with apparent variation {{in size and}} set density were observed. Some have their twist in 2 ̆ 2 S 2 ̆ 2 direction, others in 2 ̆ 2 Z 2 ̆ 2 direction, with diverse amount of twist. Wool yarns make {{up the majority of}} the constructions, but in many cases wool yarns alternate with cotton and sometimes linen yarns. Tabby and 1 / 2 twill weaves are employed as binding weaves, while the compound weave structures comprise 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 ratios of inner-warp to binding-warp ends. These variations provide a very interesting spectrum of textures executed in varying degrees of design complexity. The existence of many variables creates a necessity to seek: a quantitative and systematic methodology, through which identification, classification and interpretation of technical data would be possible. Reconstruction of weaving technologies has been selected as the principal criterion for the research. It requires analysis which must be detailed enough to determine the technological range of variations, and to indicate how and why weavers of different groups of civilization manipulated their weaving techniques. This paper mainly discusses the aspects considered in developing a protocol which records and confirms objectively the structural and technical parameters of the textiles under study. 1. 0. 0. The Objective: Concept and Rational A protocol for reconstructing early weaving technologies should consist of indispensable attributes to impart an integral system, thus elucidating the weaving details and mode of fabrication. It should not be devised for the mere gathering of technical data, but it should enclose a system organizing and employing these data to deal with basic and imperative questions. The data would provide information on what types of material were used; indicate how these materials were assembled in a textile form; and be utilized to explain why materials and processes changed at certain times of history in a certain way, in addition to what can be learned from textiles as to the resources, skills and knowledge of those who made it. Thus, further distinctions of early textiles can be drawn, not only on the basis of elements related to their outer appearance, but also by the indispensable attributes of their inner structures...|$|R
30|$|Wool {{and other}} hair fibres used for {{producing}} carpets, blanket and shawl etc. due to having properties like warmth, softness and flame retardancy. Specially, wool-based materials {{due to its}} protein content are prone to attack of moth and other insects. Moth is an insect and its larvae eat the protein present in wool. Cloths moth (Tineola bisselliella) and carpet beetle (Anthrenus verbasci) are common moths attacking the wool materials. DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), permethrin, permethrin/hexahydro pyrimidine derivative, cyhalothrin, etc. {{are some of the}} chemicals used as antimoth finishing agents. Nano TiO 2 particles were also utilized as an antifeeding <b>compound</b> on wool <b>fabric</b> against larvae of the carpet beetle, Anthrenus verbasci, feeds on protein fibers [133]. All the chemicals used for antimoth finishing are associated with ecological disturbance and so, natural colorants may be perfect substitutes for them. Shakyawar et al. screened saffron flower waste, onion skin, henna, myrobolan, silver oak leaf, madder, walnut, dholkanali and yellow root natural dye sources for antimoth finishing and found best results for silver oak leaves, walnut husk and pomegranate rind [134]. Natural dyes cochineal, madder, and walnut (quinines) and chestnut, fustic, indigo, and logwood (flavonoids) were applied on wool and tested for antimoth properties against black carpet beetles. All of the dyes, except indigo, increased the insect resistance of the wool fabric but flavonoid dyes were not so effective in enhancing insect resistance. Metallic mordants were found not having significant effect on insect resistance with all natural dyes used. The anthraquinone dyes including cochineal, madder, and walnut were found to be quite effective in protecting wool fabric against black carpet beetles [135].|$|R
30|$|Nanotechnology is a {{research}} hot spot in modern materials science. This technology is capable of providing miscellaneous novel applications that range from innovative <b>fabric</b> <b>compounds,</b> food processing, and agricultural production to sophisticated medicinal techniques [1]. It is considered as the synthesis, characterization, and exploration of materials in the nanometer region (1 – 100  nm). At this level, the properties and functions of living and anthropogenic systems are defined [2]. In this technology, the pertinent materials are those whose structures exhibit new and considerably enhanced physicochemical and biological properties as well as distinct phenomena and functionalities {{as a result of}} the nanoscale size [3]. This nanoscale size generally confers larger surface areas to nanoparticles (NPs) compared with macro-sized particles [4]. NPs are known as controlled or manipulated particles at the atomic level (1 – 100  nm). They show size-related properties significantly different from bulk materials [5]. Given their small size, NPs have larger structures in comparison with their counterparts. This distinct property allows their possible applications in many fields such as biosensors, nanomedicine, and bionanotechnology [4]. The intrinsic properties of metal NPs such as zinc oxide (ZnO), TiO 2, and silver are mostly characterized by their size, composition, crystallinity, and morphology. Reducing the size to nanoscale can modify their chemical, mechanical, electrical, structural, morphological, and optical properties. These modified features allow the NPs to interact in a unique manner with cell biomolecules and thus facilitate the physical transfer of NPs into the inner cellular structures [6]. Nanostructured materials have a larger percentage of atoms at their surface which lead to high surface reactivity. Thus, nanomaterials have witnessed recently significant importance in the basic and applied sciences as well as in bionanotechnology.|$|R

H 577 P ITC 2015 So 181 pages :color illustrationsBio-inspired by the {{remarkable}} adhesion of marine mussels' adhesive proteins (MAPs) {{to almost any}} surface in a tidal environment, a novel bio-adhesive based method was developed for colouration of various textile materials. The colouration of various materials was easily achieved at room temperature through a simple dip-coating procedure. This method showed the characteristics of substrate-independence and room temperature colouration. Compared to the traditional colouration, it has the advantages of easy to application and low energy consumption. 3, 4 -dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (DOPA), {{was found to be}} one of the amino acid responsible for the adhesion of the marine mussels. Due to the structural similarity to DOPA, dopamine was chosen as a biomimetic precursor for the adhesive colouration. On the one hand, dopamine-induced colouration was successfully developed through its in situ polymerization for various textile materials, organic and inorganic materials,and even materials resistant to colouration. The colour appearance of the dyed materials could be tuned in a controllable way through the incorporation of different nucleophilic species such as amino acid,aromatic and heterocyclic components. The properties of the dyed materials including colours, fastness, surface morphology, composition and wettability were studied using colorimetric analysis, fastness evaluation, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angle measurement, respectively. The results indicated that the various textile materials were successfully coloured. In order to achieve a wider range of colour on textiles materials, commercially available dyes, being natural or synthetic, were also incorporated in the colouration process, in addition to the above-mentioned nucleophilic <b>compounds.</b> The dyed <b>fabrics</b> were evaluated by colorimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy optical microscopic analysis and colour fastness tests. The obtained results showed that the fabrics were also successfully dyed with good colouration property. Furthermore, a novel kind of cateholamine dye was designed and synthesized for textile material colouration as an approach to enhance the versatility of the dyes and further enrich the colour gamut produced on textiles. In this approach, a commercially available dye of Acid Yellow 11 was exampled as a model of chromophore, and dopamine was introduced as an adhesive antenna to enhance the dye fixation on textile materials. The chemical structure of the synthesized dye was confirmed from the analyses of high resolution mass spectrometry, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the absorption spectra was tested by UV-visible spectroscopy. The UV-visible results showed that the introduction of the catechol group did not significantly change the absorption of the parent chromophore. The colouration results revealed that at room temperature the synthesized catechol dye had good colour yield on various textile fabrics, and the dyed fabrics had good fastness properties. This developed method showed the substrate-independence to some extent and was especially suitable for those textile materials difficult to be dyed with traditional method, such as polylactic acid and polypropylene. In addition,less energy consumption and colouration auxiliaries were needed by this colouration method. The biomimetic concept and its successful application represent a new step forward in textile material colouration and it is a promising alterative to the traditional process, which is substrate-dependent and high energy consumption.
