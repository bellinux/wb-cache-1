5000|$|In February 2008, a {{hard disk}} and two {{computers}} containing classified information {{were stolen from}} Petrobras while in Halliburton's custody. Allegedly, the content inside the stolen material was data on the recently discovered Tupi oil field. Initial police inquiries suggest {{that it could be}} a common <b>container</b> <b>theft</b> operation. The container was a ramshackle in complete disorder indicating that thieves were after [...] "valuables and not only laptops," [...] said an expert consulted by the daily newspaper Folha de S. Paulo.|$|E
5000|$|Beadie Russell, Roland [...] "Prez" [...] Pryzbylewski and Freamon notice another {{potential}} <b>container</b> <b>theft</b> from the docks - a Transco lines ship with Thomas [...] "Horseface" [...] Pakusa working as checker. This time the surveillance work runs {{in combination with}} the wiretaps and the detail tracks the container to the warehouse. When Frank Sobotka sends out a second container (a clean decoy), McNulty rushes to tail it. Beadie Russell arranges to slow down the rig with a fictitious traffic stop, until McNulty can get into position.|$|E
50|$|Around nightfall one musical act, a {{group of}} local musicians, took to the stage and played for a few hours. They {{would be the only}} act to perform. Afterwards it was {{announced}} that the festival would be postponed and that the attendees would be returned to Miami as soon as possible. Reports emerged of mishandling of guests' baggage, disaster relief tents with dirt floors, portable toilets, inadequate and poor quality food including cheese sandwiches made with slices of processed cheese on wheat bread served in styrofoam <b>containers,</b> <b>theft,</b> and heavy-handed security. Many attendees were reportedly stranded as flights to and from the island were cancelled after the postponement.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} vulnerability {{with any}} password <b>container</b> is <b>theft</b> {{or loss of}} the device. The chances of this happening, or happening unawares, can be reduced with physical security measures such as locks, electronic leash, or body sensor and alarm. Stolen tokens can be made useless by using two factor authentication. Commonly, in order to authenticate, a personal identification number (PIN) must be entered along with the {{information provided by the}} token {{the same time as the}} output of the token.|$|R
50|$|Returnable and {{reusable}} containers {{are used}} by the automotive industry to transport parts through the automotive supply chain. The AIAG has working groups and programs focused {{on the development of}} initiatives in returnable container visibility, tracking, and needs calculation, container and packaging standardization, and other best practices related to increasing efficiency in containers and packaging management. Efforts in this area focus on reducing the cost of shipping <b>containers,</b> and eliminating <b>theft</b> of empty <b>containers</b> which are valuable for the economic content of the component plastics they are made of. Efforts under study include pooling of use of containers (as is underway in European markets) and tagging of containers with RFID or bar codes for improved automation of container return.|$|R
40|$|Cleary [2007] {{divides the}} {{proliferation}} pathway into stages: diversion, facility misuse, transportation, transformation, and weapons fabrication. King [2010], using Cleary's methodology, compares a deepburn fusion-driven blanket containing weapons-grade plutonium with a PWR burning MOX fuel enrichments of 5 - 9 %. King considers {{the stages of}} theft, transportation, transformation, and nuclear explosive fabrication. In the current study of used fuel storage security, a similar approach is appropriate. First, one must consider the adversary's objective, which can be categorized as on-site radionuclide dispersion, theft of material for later radionuclide dispersion, and theft of material for later processing and fabrication into a nuclear explosive. For on-site radionuclide dispersion, only a single proliferation pathway stage is appropriate: dispersion. That situation will be addressed in future reports. For later radionuclide dispersion, the stages are theft, transportation, and transformation (from oxide spent fuel containing both fission products and actinides to a material size and shape suitable for dispersion). For later processing and fabrication into a nuclear explosive, the stages are theft (by an outsider or by facility misuse by an insider), transportation, transformation (from oxide spent fuel containing both fission products and actinides to a metal alloy), and fabrication (of the alloy into a weapon). It {{should be noted that}} the theft and transportation stages are similar, and possibly identical, for later radionuclide dispersion and later processing and fabrication into a nuclear explosive. Each stage can be evaluated separately, and the methodology can vary for each stage. For example, King starts with the methodology of Cleary for the theft, transportation, transformation, and fabrication stages. Then, for each stage, King assembles and modifies the attributes and inputs suggested by Cleary. In the theft (also known as diversion) stage, Cleary has five high-level categories (material handling during diversion, difficulty of evading detection by the accounting system, difficulty of evading detection by the material control system, difficulty of conducting undeclared facility modifications for the purpose of diverting nuclear material, and difficulty of evading detection of the facility modifications for the purposes of diverting nuclear material). Each category has one or more subcategories. For example, the first category includes mass per significant quantity (SQ) of nuclear material, volume/SQ of nuclear material, number of items/SQ, material form (solid, liquid, powder, gas), radiation level in terms of dose, chemical reactivity, heat load, and process temperature. King adds the following two subcategories to that list: SQs available for theft, and interruptions/changes (normal and unexpected) in material stocks and flows. For the situation of an orphaned surface storage facility, this approach is applicable, with some of the categories and subcategories being modified to reflect the static situation (no additions or removals of fuel or <b>containers).</b> In addition, <b>theft</b> would require opening a large overpack and either removing a full container or opening that sealed container and then removing one or more spent nuclear fuel assemblies. These activities would require time without observation (detection), heavy-duty equipment, and some degree of protection of the thieves from radiological dose. In the transportation stage, Cleary has two high-level categories (difficulty of handling material during transportation, and difficulty of evading detection during transport). Each category has a number of subcategories. For the situation of an orphaned surface storage facility, these categories are applicable. The transformation stage of Cleary has three high-level categories (facilities and equipment needed to process diverted materials; knowledge, skills, and workforce needed to process diverted materials; and difficulty of evading detection of transformation activities). Again, there are subcategories. King [2007] adds a fourth high-level category: time required to transform the materials. For the situation of an orphaned surface storage facility, the categories are applicable, but the evaluations of each category and subcategory will be significantly different for later radionuclide dispersion than for later processing and fabrication into a nuclear explosive. The fabrication stage of Cleary has three high-level categories (difficulty associated with design, handling difficulties, and knowledge and skills needed to design and fabricate). King replaces the first two high-level categories with the Figure of Merit for Nuclear Explosives Utility (FOM), with subcategories of bare critical mass, heat content of transformed material, dose rate of transformed material, and SQs available for theft. The next section of this report describes the FOM in more detail...|$|R
