Both analytical and kinetic data show that chlorothalonil significantly accelerates the decay of <b>cycloxydim</b> on wax films, promoting its oxidation, even at the lowest tested dose. Conversely, <b>cycloxydim</b> does not affect the fate of chlorothalonil. Moreover, the detection of oxidized forms of wax alkanes in the extracts demonstrates that chlorothalonil may have also a degrading effect on the leaves’ constituents under the action of solar light...|$|E
40|$|Cycloxydim-Tolerant Maize (CTM) was {{developed}} by researches at the University of Minnesota. CTM plants were regenerated from tissue culture selected for callus growth {{in the presence of}} <b>cycloxydim,</b> and the resulting plants were shown to contain a nuclear mutation, expressed as a single, partially dominant gene (known as Acc 1) that conferred tolerance to the herbicide. <b>Cycloxydim</b> is a systemic herbicide for post emergence application in dicot crops to selectively control grass weeds. Corn, like most grasses is susceptible to <b>cycloxydim</b> due to inhibited acetyl-coenzyimeA carboxylaze enzyme activity. There are two key benefits of this technology: first, <b>cycloxydim</b> applications in CTM hybrids can be delayed until the weed spectrum and population density exceed agro-economic threshold; second, <b>cycloxydim</b> can be applied at either stage of plant development with no effect on basic agronomic traits, compared to non treated plants. Nevertheless, this type of tolerance requires 2 genes to be fully effective, i. e. gene must be present in both inbred parents to provide complete tolerance in the resulting hybrid. Such type of tolerance doubles the chances for yield drag and doubles the number of inbred conversions needed. This also limits germplasm integration and increases time lag in developing hybrids. Despite these difficulties, many seed companies introduce tolerance to <b>cycloxydim</b> into their commercial inbreds, and many of them have already commercialized CTM hybrids. Finally, it came as a logical question what is more important – hybrid performance or new trait? Critical to the success of this technology has been yield performance of CTM hybrids. At the same time, performance and herbicide tolerance do not exclude each other and can surely co-exist. To be accepted, this coexistence must secure high profitability to corn producers. However, CTM hybrids will not replace conventional ones on a large scale, but {{could be used as a}} specific tool, or could enhance the use of alternative weed control options in corn production...|$|E

To decipher the population into the homo- and heterozygous sub-populations, individual plants of the resistant biotype were analyzed for the haplotype Leu 1781 by means of SNP analytics (pyrosequencing). For the entire population, significant different resistance factors (RF) of 8 and 153 resulted for clethodim and <b>cycloxydim,</b> respectively. For the heterozygous sub-population a RF of 6 was estimated for clethodim and 118 for <b>cycloxydim.</b> For the homozygous sub-population a RF of 10 for clethodim and 136 for <b>cycloxydim</b> was estimated. The RF between the homo- and heterozygous sub-populations for each herbicide were, however, not significantly different.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the {{mechanisms}} of herbicide resistance is important for designing long term sustainable weed management strategies. Here, we have used an integrated biology and molecular approach to investigate {{the mechanisms}} of resistance to acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibiting herbicides in a UK black-grass population (BG 2). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Comparison between BG 2 phenotypes using single discriminant rates of herbicides and genotypes based on ACCase gene sequencing showed that the I 1781 L, a novel I 1781 T, but not the W 2027 C mutations, were associated with resistance to <b>cycloxydim.</b> All plants were killed with clethodim and a few individuals containing the I 1781 L mutation were partially resistant to tepraloxydim. Whole plant dose response assays demonstrated that a single copy of the mutant T 1781 allele conferred fourfold resistance levels to <b>cycloxydim</b> and clodinafop-propargyl. In contrast, {{the impact of the}} I 1781 T mutation was low (Rf = 1. 6) and non-significant on pinoxaden. BG 2 was also characterised by high levels of resistance, very likely non-target site based, to the two cereal selective herbicides clodinafop-propargyl and pinoxaden and not to the poorly metabolisable cyclohexanedione herbicides. Analysis of 480 plants from 40 <b>cycloxydim</b> resistant black grass populations from the UK using two very effective and high throughput dCAPS assays established for detecting any amino acid changes at the 1781 ACCase codon and for positively identifying the threonine residue, showed that the occurrence of the T 1781 is extremely rare compared to the L 1781 allele. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study revealed a novel mutation at ACCase codon position 1781 and adequately assessed target site and non-target site mechanisms in conferring resistance to several ACCase herbicides in a black-grass population. It highlights that over time the level of suspected non-target site resistance to some cereal selective ACCase herbicides have in some instances surpassed that of target site resistance, including the one endowed by the most commonly encountered I 1781 L mutation...|$|E

This differential response may reflect differences in selection pressure caused by years of cropping system-related herbicide usage. The herbicide sensitivity of E. crus-galli populations from three divergent cropping systems was evaluated in dose-response pot experiments. Populations were collected from sandy fields with (i) a long-term organic cropping system, (ii) a conventional cropping system with maize in the crop rotation or (iii) a conventional cropping system with long-term monocropping of maize. Each cropping system was represented by six E. crus-galli populations. The effectiveness of three foliar-applied maize herbicides (nicosulfuron, <b>cycloxydim</b> and topramezone) and two soil-applied maize herbicides (S-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P) was tested at three doses and two runs. Foliar-applied herbicides were applied at the three true leaves stage. Soil-applied herbicides were applied immediately after sowing. The foliage dry weight per pot was determined 4 weeks after treatment. Plant responses were expressed as biomass reduction. Herbicide sensitivity was consistently lowest for populations from maize monocropping systems. Compared with populations from organic cropping systems, populations from monocropping systems showed 6. 9 %, 9. 8 % and 29. 3 % lower sensitivity to <b>cycloxydim,</b> topramezone and nicosulfuron respectively. Populations from the conventional crop rotation system showed intermediate sensitivity levels, which did not significantly differ from sensitivity levels of populations from the other cropping systems.

The field experiments were accompanied using molecular analysis leaf samples from the plots to seize the occurrence of black-grass with the Leu 1781 haplotype and to determine {{the frequency of the}} genotypes. The goal of the trials was to correlate the successes of blackgrass control with the occurrence of hetero- and homozygous resistant genotypes. It was shown in greenhouse trials that clethodim selects the haplotype Leu 1781 more weakly (and it shows a higher partial efficacy) than <b>cycloxydim</b> and that heterozygous plants have a lower resistance factor than homozygous plants. The question raised whether the frequency of heterozygous plants has influence on increased efficacy of clethodim under field conditions. At 5 sites target-site resistance was detected. At one location the high proportion of heterozygous plants correlated positive with relative higher control using Select EC 240 (80 %) compared to Focus Ultra (0 %). At two locations with high proportion of homozygous resistant plants Select EC 240 and Focus Ultra treatments without subsequent treatments with Kerb FLO were not sufficient in solo variants. The subsequent treatments with Kerb FLO provided partly, but not sufficient control of black-grass. At one location no resistance was identified. The effect of Select EC 240 and Focus Ultra to control black-grass were comparable high in all variants with and without subsequent treatments of Kerb FLO. The investigations showed clearly a higher degree of control by plants with the haplotype Leu 1781 by the active substance clethodim and pointed out the fact that the frequency of resistant genotypes (homo vs. heterozygous resistant plants) has a clear influence on the resistance selection. The use of DIMs at locations suspected to be resistant should be assured only with the help of propyzamide and nonchemical measurements (e. g. ploughing, crop rotation).

Here we investigated the photolysis of <b>cycloxydim</b> (CD) in acetonitrile and water, solvents in which CD is present as two distinct tautomeric forms: keto form in water and enol form with an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the enolic proton and the nitrogen atom of the oxime in acetonitrile O-HN. CD (E isomer) undergoes photoisomerization in water but not in acetonitrile. This difference is attributed to the inhibiting effect of the intramolecular hydrogen bond existing in acetonitrile. In both solvents, irradiation of CD leads to the cleavage of the N-O bond as evidenced by the imine formation. The iminyl radical could be detected in acetonitrile by nanosecond laser-flash photolysis (λmax = 280, 320 and 480 nm, τ [similar] 100 μs). This radical is unreactive toward oxygen but readily abstracts an H atom from methanol (k = 1. 8 × 105 M− 1 s− 1). Quantum calculations confirm the assignment of the transient species to the iminyl radical by showing that (i) the most stable structure of the iminyl carries a large spin density on the ring carbon and on the nitrogen atoms, (ii) the enolic H atom is transferred to the nitrogen atom and (iii) the intramolecular hydrogen bond OH-N is responsible for both the iminyl long wavelength absorption and its high hydrogen abstraction reactivity...|$|E

In the herbicide experiments two treatments were applied by PRE emergence herbicides (metribuzin, clomazone, dimethenamid and metribuzin, flufenacet, clomazone) and another two treatments were sprayed {{with a combination of}} PRE + POST emergence herbicides (metribuzin, flufenacet, thifensulfuron and pendimethalin, thifensulfuron, bentazone, <b>cycloxydim).</b> Furthermore, a POST herbicide treatment was implemented (thifensulfuron, bentazone, thifensulfuron and fluazifop-P-butyl). In the mechanical weed control experiments, treatments were: three times hoeing, PRE emergence harrowing plus three times hoeing, hoeing and harrowing in rotation or three times harrowing. In both experiments an untreated control was included. A 90 % weed control efficacy and 23 % yield increase was observed in the POST herbicide treatment. PRE + POST treatments resulted in 92 % to 99 % weed control efficiency and 15 % yield increase compared to the untreated control. In the mechanical weed control experiments the combination of PRE emergence harrowing and POST emergence hoeing resulted in 82 % weed control efficiency and 34 % higher yield compared to the untreated control. Less weed control efficiency (72 %) was observed in the harrow treatment, leading to 20 % higher yield compared to the control. The suitability of both strategies for implementation in “Integrated Weed Management” has been investigated...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the results of}} over fifteen years of {{experimentation}} are summarized, concerning the possibility of use of herbicides included in several chemical classes and with various mechanisms of action on poplar clones of different species, European and North American. The active ingredients were tested mainly singly or in commercial mixtures as well, applied before emergence (interpreted here as sprout of poplar cuttings not yet occurred and before weed infestation) or after emergence (interpreted here as cuttings with sprouts 20 - 25 cm long and after weed colonisation). Almost 50 % of the 43 tested formulations {{has proved to be}} unserviceable in poplar nursery because of the hard damage induced on plantlets, i. e. dicotyledonicides and those with a wide action range, especially applied after emergence. It was the case of acetolactate synthase inhibitors and synthetic auxins. About 25 % of formulations has proved to be utilizable with limited risks and 20 % without risk. After emergence, the lowest damage was caused by graminicide compounds included in the class of acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors (e. g. diclofop-methyl, cycloxydim); before emergence, very good applicative opportunities were showed by microtubule assembly inhibitors, especially propyzamide, and the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben. Among the herbicides utilizable with some risk after emergence, the photosynthesis inhibitors pyridate and phenmedipham (singly or in mixture) were interesting since they are the only ones that allow the control of broad-leaved weeds in the presence of herbaceous poplar shoots. Before emergence, flufenacet and isoxaflutole were remarkable as well, the latter being active versus hardly limited weeds. In summary, besides the two aforesaid compounds, the graminicide <b>cycloxydim</b> and - more cautiously - clodinafop and propaquizafop may be hopefully introduced in poplar nurseries after emergence, in association with the wide action range mixture of phenmedipham, desmedipham and ethofumesate...|$|E
40|$|In autumn 2009 and 2010, {{black-grass}} {{samples from}} different regions in Germany were sown {{into a field}} near Münster. The sandy soil of the field was free of black-grass seeds until the sowing date. The aim of the trial was to compare the fitness and resistance value of different black-grass populations under outdoor conditions. Particularly the impact of pre-emergence herbicides was of interest. Different efficiency factors of CADOU SC® (flufenacet) against the tested black-grass populations were observed. The disparities {{in the level of}} control were even greater under the use of STOMP AQUA® (pendimethalin), BOXER® (prosulfocarb) and ARELON TOP® (isoproturon). A hundred percent control of all black-grass populations in both seasons was only achieved by the use of KERB FLO® (propyzamide). It was visible that the black-grass populations that were difficult to control had a powerful constitution, even better than that of those populations {{that turned out to be}} highly susceptible to the herbicide treatments. The fall results in both seasons of the experiment (2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011) were consistent. This was also confirmed for the efficacy results for foliar herbicides in spring. Subject to field history, there was a wide range in sensitivity to the tested herbicides. Black-grass populations from coastal regions were poorly controlled by FOCUS ULTRA® (<b>cycloxydim)</b> or SELECT 240 EC® (clethodim) + PARA SOMMER® (paraffin oil), but were highly susceptible to MOTIVELL® (nicosulfuron). Contrary results were observed with reference to the blackgrass populations from the inland. These populations were derived from fields where the crop rotation contains of 66 % cereals and 33 % maize. The populations from the coast were sampled in crop rotations dominated by cereals or cereals followed by oil seed rape. Poor efficacy of ATLANTIS OD® (mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron) was observed in black-grass populations from the coastal regions as well as from the inland...|$|E
40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} {{is the result}} of an evolutionary process where a population gradually changes from being susceptible to being resistant to an herbicide. The resistance mechanism is usually a change in the biochemistry of the weed, but in some cases changes in morphology or growth rhythm. The change is caused by random mutations. Two resistance mechanisms are found in black-grass; target site resistance and metabolic resistance. Black-grass is a tufty, winter annual grass weed, which is mainly found in milder climates. Black-grass is a big problem in Southern Europe. In Sweden, it has its main extension in Skåne, Öland and Gotland. Herbicide {{resistance is}} increasing on a global level, especially in farming systems that strongly rely on chemical spraying. Four major factors affecting the build up of resistance are; length of life cycle, spreading, methods of weed control and also the seed bank in the soil. Integrated weed management is required for long-term control of black-grass. A varied chemical spraying should be complemented by other methods, e. g. in crop rotation and tillage methods, increased mechanical methods, clean machines etc. It’s important to alternate between different modes of action, since one reason for increased resistance is that the same herbicide or a few modes of action recurs frequently. There are several methods for testing herbicide resistance. This thesis includes a germination test in petri dishes. Four herbicide from different herbicide groups are tested in seven populations of black-grass, from three different countries. The experiment is a part of a comparative study between laboratories in several Nordic and Baltic countries. The evaluation of the test includes three methods; visual assessment of the coverage, frequency of the number of shoots over 1 cm and a dry matter test. The herbicides are; fenoxaprop-P (in the herbicide Event Super), <b>cycloxydim</b> (Focus Ultra), sulfometuron (Oust) and pendimethalin (Stomp). The result matched with the expected resistance level for some of the populations and herbicides, but not for all. This may be due to experimental mistakes. A repeating of the test would be optimal, to secure more accurate conclusions about the robustness of the test. Through this work I {{have come to the conclusion}} that it’s difficult to find a robust and fast method to detect metabolic resistance. Seed tests to detect target site resistance are often good, but as metabolic resistance usually occurs later in plant development, dose-response-tests in pots are preferred...|$|E
