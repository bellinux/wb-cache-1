40|$|The product Provita E®, Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134, is {{intended}} for the use as feed additive in accordance with Council Directive 70 / 524 /EEC. The strain is already authorised in the product Bonvital LE, {{being part of a}} mixture with Lactobacillus rhamnosus DSM 7133. The Commission received a request for provisional <b>Community</b> <b>authorisation</b> of this product under the conditions set out in the following table...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of computational and data grids {{has led to}} resources within a single organisation being exposed to other users within a ‘virtual organisation ’ (VO) that encompasses a dynamic distributed infrastructure. Due to this dynamic nature of VOs, {{there is a need}} for an infrastructure to facilitate the management of the constituent users and resources. We have been developing an easy to use and secure management infrastructure- the Virtual Organisation Management (VOM) Portal. We present how using the VOM portal, we are able to manage policies within Globus Toolkit, <b>Community</b> <b>Authorisation</b> Service (CAS) and Imperial College e-Science Networked Infrastructure (ICENI) middleware. ...|$|E

The EudraGMP system {{was launched in}} April 2007, for use by European Medicines Regulators. Access for the general public, via Internet, is available since 2009 using the URL : http://eudragmp.ema.europa.eu.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} {{is covered by}} the Determined Martu native title claim area (WC 96/78). A prescribed body corporate named the Western Desert Lands Aboriginal Corporation was registered for the Martu land on 17 July 2003. Future development at the <b>community</b> requires the <b>authorisation</b> of the prescribed body corporate.|$|R
40|$|The {{computational}} approaches used {{to predict}} toxicity are evolving rapidly, a process hastened on {{by the emergence of}} new ways of describing chemical information.

40|$|Abstract The {{computational}} approaches used {{to predict}} toxicity are evolving rapidly, a process hastened on {{by the emergence of}} new ways of describing chemical information. Although this trend offers many opportunities, new regulations, such as the European <b>Community's</b> 'Registration, Evaluation, <b>Authorisation</b> and Restriction of Chemicals' (REACH), demand that models be ever more robust. In this commentary, we outline the numerous factors involved in the evolution of quantitative structure-regulatory activity relationship (QSAR) models. Such models not only require powerful tools, but must also be adapted for their intended application, such as in using suitable input values and having an output that complies with legal requirements. In addition, transparency and model reproducibility are important factors. As more models become available, it is vital that new theoretical possibilities are embraced, and efforts are combined in order to promote new flexible, modular tools. </p...|$|R
3000|$|More {{recently}} I {{have rejected}} my previous ontological approach {{to understanding the}} nature of research, in favour of an explicitly socio-cultural approach (Biggs and Büchler [2011]). In a socio-cultural approach one does not look for fundamental definitions or criteria as one does in the ontological approach, and one looks instead for <b>community</b> endorsement and <b>authorisation</b> of certain practices. If one looks at research conducted in creative areas one will find that making a building or a design {{or a piece of}} music is regarded by some of the community as a legitimate research activity (JAR [2013]). In terms of the activity-theoretic model above, Position 2 is legitimized by the interpretative community who find the questions in Position 1 worth asking, and the answers in Position 3 satisfying. As a result, we need to ask what kind of research methods are legitimised by the community and lead to valid and significant research outputs such as buildings, designs and music? [...]...|$|R
