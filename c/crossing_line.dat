30|$|As {{automated}} {{collection of}} gap size {{has not been}} reported before in the literature, we detail on this type of data collection. To facilitate the collection of accepted and rejected gaps, we first manually drew a few lines from road markers as shown in Fig.  2. We consider that a vehicle A from the ramp entrance entered the roundabout when it <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 2. If this happened while there were other vehicles B in the other entrance (which has right-of-way) or inside the roundabout itself, we would collect one sample of accepted gap size, which is the travel time from when vehicle A <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 2 to when the other vehicle B <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 4. Similarly, to collect rejected gaps, we consider that vehicles A from the ramp entrance waited to enter the roundabout when they <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 3 but not line 2 yet. If there were vehicles B in the other entrance or inside the roundabout while vehicle A were in the waiting mode, we would collect one sample of rejected gap size, which is the travel time from when vehicle A <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 3 to when the vehicles B <b>crossed</b> <b>line</b> 4. If there are multiple vehicles B involved in accepted/rejected gap, {{the one with the}} shortest travel time is taken.|$|R

50|$|Pedestrians' advocates {{question}} the equitability of schemes if they impose extra {{time and effort}} on the pedestrian to remain safe from vehicles, for example overbridges with long slopes or steps up and down, underpasses with steps and addition possible risk of crime and at-grade crossings off the desired <b>crossing</b> <b>line.</b> Make Roads Safe was criticised in 2007 for proposing such features. Successful pedestrian schemes tend to avoid over-bridges and underpasses and instead use at-grade crossings (such as pedestrian crossings) close to the intended route. Successful cycling schemes by contrast avoid frequent stops even if some additional distance is involved, because cyclists expend more energy when starting off.|$|E

On 17 November, Portugal and Spain faced {{each other in a}} friendly to commemorate the 100th year of the modern Portuguese Republic and also to promote the joint Portugal-Spain bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In a shocking upset, Portugal were 4-0 victors over the reigning World and European champions. In the match Ronaldo should score a wonderful opening goal, only rued out as offside with a little kick by Nani in front of the <b>crossing</b> <b>line.</b> Portugal ended up winning all except one of their remaining qualifying games only losing to Denmark. They finished second in their group and had to qualify in a two-game playoff with Bosnia and Herzegovina.

50|$|On a map, Line 5 runs vertically, {{beginning}} with three {{stops in the}} far northern suburb of Tiantongyuan in Changping District, well beyond the 5th Ring Road, then <b>crossing</b> <b>Line</b> 13 at Lishuiqiao Station, and entering into the vast residential swaths of Chaoyang District {{on either side of}} the Yuan dynasty city wall. At Huixinxijie Nankou Station, it links up with Line 10. Further south, it skirts east of the Temple of Earth and meets Line 2 Loop at the Yonghegong, also known as the Lama Temple. Then Line 5 cuts through the old neighborhoods of Dongcheng District and the old foreign Legation Quarter between Dongdan and Chongwenmen. Further south, Line 5 stops at the eastern entrance to the Temple of Heaven in Chongwen District and eventually reaches Songjiazhuang in Fengtai District south of the city, where the station actually lies west-east, in contrast to other stops (where it lies north-south). It takes 49 minutes to cover all the 23 stations. Zhangzizhonglu Station, named after a general martyred in World War II, is the only eponymous station of the Beijing Subway.|$|E

The simulations consider a single line of identical cars, equally spaced, and with no obstacles after the signal <b>crossing</b> <b>line.</b> The flow dependence on vehicle's characteristics, as it's length and sensitivity, are studied. Also, {{the influence of the}} attitude of drivers (careful or aggressive) has been used as parameters on the present work. It was found that the optimal separation between cars, defined as the distance that allows the system to carry the higher number of vehicles through the signal <b>crossing</b> <b>line,</b> is independent of the sensitivity of the system, but it does depend on the aggressive or careful characteristic of the drivers. The optimal separation is also found to be proportional to the length of the cars for a system of identical vehicles. Comment: 5 figures, 15 page...|$|E
