40|$|Alterations in the {{composition}} of intestinal <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> are associated with enhanced susceptibility to multiple inflammatory diseases, including those conditions associated with interleukin (IL) - 17 – producing CD 4 + T helper (Th 17) cells. However, the relationship between <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines remains unclear. Using germ-free mice, we show that the frequency of Th 17 cells in the large intestine is significantly elevated in the absence of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Commensal-dependent expression of the IL- 17 family member IL- 25 (IL- 17 E) by intestinal epithelial cells limits the expansion of Th 17 cells in the intestine by inhibiting expression of macrophage-derived IL- 23.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} gastro-intestinal tract is colonized by {{trillions of}} beneficial <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{that are essential}} for promoting normal host physiology. While the majority of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{are found in the}} intestinal lumen, many species have also adapted to colonize different anatomical locations in the intestine including the surface of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and the interior of gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Distinct tissue localization of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> permits unique interactions between these microbes and the mammalian immune system and collectively influences intestinal immune cell homeostasis. Conversely, dysregulated localization of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> can lead to inappropriate activation of the immune system and is associated with numerous chronic infectious, inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Therefore, regulatory mechanisms that control proper anatomical containment of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> are essential to maintain tissue homeostasis and limit pathology. Although the roles of luminal and epithelial-associated <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> on immune cell homeostasis have been extensively studied, how lymphoid tissue-resident commensals (LRC) modulate host immune responses is not well understood. Data in Chapter 2 will describe interactions between a genetically related family of LRCs that can colonize dendritic cells and induces lymphoid tissue-specific immune responses. Further, Chapter 3 will provide evidence that LRC-induced immune responses are mutually beneficial for itself and the host. Specifically, LRC-induced interleukin (IL) - 22 enhances its own microbial colonization and LRC-induced IL- 10 limits tissue inflammation during intestinal injury. ^ Dysregulated anatomical localization of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> during chronic inflammatory conditions is typically associated with extra-intestinal complications including anemia or dysregulated iron homeostasis. Results in Chapter 4 support a role for the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin in modulating LRC colonization of DCs and identify hepcidin as a critical regulator of immune cell homeostasis and tissue repair following intestinal injury. Collectively, studies presented in this thesis define mutually beneficial interactions between mammalian hosts and <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> in intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues that regulate immune cell homeostasis and host responses to tissue inflammation or injury. ...|$|R

40|$|Mouse Paneth cell α-defensins, termed cryptdins, are {{secreted}} {{into the}} intestinal lumen, exert microbicidal activity {{and contribute to}} intestinal innate immunity. Among them, cryptdin- 4 (Crp 4) has the most potent microbicidal activity. In the intestinal lumen, <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> colonize and elicit beneficial effects to the host. However, the effects of Crp 4 against <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> are poorly understood. Thus, we investigated the bactericidal activities of Crp 4 against <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> compared to non-commensal bacteria. Oxidized Crp 4 showed only minimal or no bactericidal activity against 8 out of 12 commensal bacterial species, including Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus Casei. We further addressed a role of the conserved disulfide bonds of Crp 4 by analyzing reduced Crp 4 (r-Crp 4). r-Crp 4 demonstrated significantly greater bactericidal activities against 7 of 12 <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> than did oxidized Crp 4.

40|$|<b>Commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> and/or their {{products}} engender beneficial effects to the mammalian gut, including stimulating physiological cellular turnover and enhancing wound healing, without activating overt inflammation. In the present study, we observed commensal bacteria-mediated {{activation of the}} noninflammatory extracellular signal-regulated kinase[ERK]/mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt signaling pathways in gut epithelial cells and delineated a mechanism for this bacterially activated signaling. All tested strains of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> induced ERK phosphorylation without stimulating pro-inflammatory phospho-IκB or pro-apoptotic phospho-c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase, with Lactobacillus species being most potent. This pattern of signaling activation was recapitulated using the peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, a bacterial product known to stimulate signaling events in mammalian phagocytes. Sensing of N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe by gut epithelial cells occurs via recently characterized formyl peptide receptors located in the plasma membrane. Both <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe application to the apical surface of polarized gut epithelial cells resulted in specific formyl peptide receptor activation. In addition, pretreatment of model epithelia and murine colon with Boc 2 (a specific peptide antagonist) or pertussis toxin (a Gi-protein inhibitor) abolished commensal-mediated ERK phosphorylation. Taken together, these data show that <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> specifically activate the ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in an formyl peptide receptor-dependent manner, delineating a mechanism by which <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> contribute to cellular signaling in gut epithelia...|$|R

We therefore assessed the ability of various <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> and probiotics to adhere to and invade colonic epithelial cells. Effects of the bacteria on production of proinflammatory cytokines were also measured. <b>Commensal</b> <b>bacteria,</b> including mucosal organisms isolated from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, such as Fusobacterium varium, reported as a possible pathogen in UC, Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli and Clostridium clostridioforme, as well as their type strains and probiotics, were assessed for their ability to adhere to and invade colonic epithelial cells using two cell lines, SW- 480 and HT- 29.

40|$|Regular {{interactions}} between <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> and the enteric mucosal immune environment {{are necessary for}} normal immunity. Alterations of the commensal bacterial communities or mucosal barrier can disrupt immune function. Chronic stress interferes with bacterial community structure (specifically, a-diversity) {{and the integrity of}} the intestinal barrier. These interferences can contribute to chronic stress-induced increases in systemic IL- 6 and TNF-a. Chronic stress, however, produces many physiological changes that could indirectly influence immune activity. In addition to IL- 6 and TNF-a, exposure to acute stressors upregulates a plethora of inflammatory proteins, each having unique synthesis and release mechanisms. We therefore tested the hypothesis that acute stress-induced inflammatory protein responses are dependent on the <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and more specifically, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shed from Gram-negative intestinal <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> We present evidence that both reducing <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> using antibiotics and neutralizing LPS using endotoxin inhibitor (EI) attenuates increases in some (inflammasome dependent, IL- 1 and IL- 18), but not all (inflammasome independent, IL- 6, IL- 10, and MCP- 1) inflammatory proteins in the blood of male F 344 rats exposed to an acute tail shock stressor.
