40|$|SUMMARY: The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to use recent advances in the global positioning system and computer technology to apply {{just the right amount of}} fumigant (0. 2 kg/tree) where it is most needed (i. e., in the neighborhood of each tree planting site) to decrease the incidence of replant disease. Upadhyaya et al. (2008) and Udompetaikul et al. (2008) have reported that tree planting-site-specific application of fumigants can lead to 58 to 76 % reduction in fumigant cost and environmental load, compared to the conventional strip fumigation. This reduction in chemical application is not only beneficial to the environment, it can save a significant amount of money for the farmers. At a typical fumigant cost of approximately $ 5 /kg the savings would range from $ 490 to $ 640 /ha. Thus it is clear that applying a small amount of soil fumigant to control replant disease makes environmental, ecological, and economical sense. In the first year of this study, we retrofitted a <b>chemical</b> <b>applicator</b> with a high-performance global positioning system receiver (accuracy in the range of 10 to 20 cm), an embedded controller to read GPS data and control a solenoid valve to implement tree-planting-site-specific fumigan...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: One of {{the major}} {{problems}} of rice production is the shortage of labor&# 13; resulting from migration from rural to urban areas, making {{it very difficult to}} meet peak demands for paddy&# 13; production. In most developing countries of Southeast Asia, agricultural mechanization of paddy field&# 13; operation is mostly carried out using conventional machines. For example in rice production powerintensive&# 13; operations such as water pumping, land preparations, transplanting seedlings, harvestings and&# 13; threshing are being mechanized but other operations like fertilizer and chemical (pesticides) applications are&# 13; not yet fully mechanized, rather they are performed manually with motorized backpack knapsack sprayers&# 13; which have many disadvantages. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop and evaluate a new concept&# 13; dual-purpose <b>chemical</b> <b>applicator</b> for paddy fields farmers in order to complement the labor shortage during&# 13; the peak period. Approach: A dual-purpose <b>chemical</b> <b>applicator</b> for flooded paddy field was evaluated&# 13; using the S 341. 4 Standard in respect to the distribution patterns/droplet sizes and uniformity of&# 13; spreading/spraying for the chemical application to boost agricultural mechanization in rice production and&# 13; also to overcome the safety concern of hazardous spray drift during chemical application by the paddy&# 13; farmers. The dual purpose applicator was mounted on a high clearance prime mover. The machine&# 13; performances for both granular and liquid chemical application were reported. Results: Results for urea&# 13; granular chemical indicate that at low (40 kg ha â 1) and high (120 kg ha â 1) rates and 550 rpm disc speed&# 13; distribution pattern skewed to the left whereas the distribution pattern shape at medium (80 kg ha â 1) rates&# 13; was good flattop. At high rate (120 kg ha â 1) and 1000 rpm disc speed, mean distribution pattern became&# 13; poor (M-shape) and also at low and medium application rates the distribution pattern shapes lopsided to the&# 13; left. For NASA glyphosate liquid chemical herbicide, the average values of (VDM) and (NMD) were 108 &# 13; and 79 µm at 80 lt/ha application rate and 5000 rpm rotary disc speed and 185 and 119 µm at 80 lt/ha&# 13; application rate 3000 rpm rotary disc speed. Conclusion: The experimental results from the experimental&# 13; tests suggest that the average effective field capacity for the equipment with a prime mover was found to be&# 13; 0. 89 ha h â 1 or 7. 12 ha/man-day for an 8 h working day...|$|E
40|$|Real-time {{measurement}} of tire-road friction coefficient is extremely valuable for winter road maintenance operations {{and can be}} used to optimize the kind and quantity of the deicing and anti-icing chemicals applied to the roadway. In this project, a wheel based tire-road friction coefficient measurement system is first developed for snowplows. Unlike a traditional Norse meter, this system is based on {{measurement of}} lateral tire forces, has minimal moving parts and does not use any actuators. Hence, it is reliable and inexpensive. A key challenge is quickly detecting changes in estimated tire-road friction coefficient while rejecting the high levels of noise in measured force signals. Novel filtering and signal processing algorithms are developed to address this challenge including a biased quadratic mean filter and an accelerometer based vibration removal filter. Detailed experimental results are presented on the performance of the friction estimation system on different types of road surfaces. Experimental results show that the biased quadratic mean filter works very effectively to eliminate the influence of noise and quickly estimate changes in friction coefficient. Further, the use of accelerometers and an intelligent algorithm enables elimination of the influence of driver steering maneuvers, thus providing a robust friction measurement system. In {{the second part of the}} project, the developed friction measurement system is used for automated control of the <b>chemical</b> <b>applicator</b> on the snowplow. An electronic interface is established with the Force America applicator to enable real-time control. A feedback control system that utilizes the developed friction measurement sensor and a pavement temperature sensor is developed and implemented on the snowplow.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Use of {{precision}} agriculture (PA technologies has increased with advances in technologies and increased farmer awareness of PA's usefulness and potential profitability. Many farmers and agribusinesses are still uncertain {{about the wisdom}} of adopting PA technologies. More information on use, costs and benefits of PA technologies is needed by producers, agribusinesses, consultants, and extension personnel making decisions about adoption of PA. In December 1999 an attempt was made to gather some of this information by conducting a survey of persons attending the Ag Crop Management Conference sponsored by the University of Missouri. Attendees of this conference were professional <b>chemical</b> <b>applicators,</b> managers, consultants, and seed and chemical dealers. Seventy-five usable surveys were returned, representing 22 % of conference attendees...|$|R
40|$|Million {{liters of}} annual toxic {{solutions}} {{are used to}} combat pests and plant diseases and weeds in farms. Drift {{is one of the}} most critical problems which <b>chemical</b> <b>applicators</b> have to deal with. Wind drift would be highly controlled if the droplet size could be kept almost constant in stable atmospheric conditions. The most important factor in spraying is droplet size which is influenced by several factors including; spraying pressure, nozzle orifice diameter, the chemical viscosity and wind speed in the region. In this study factors affecting particle size have been studied using statistical methods. Nozzle orifice diameter and spraying pressure were considered as independent variables and particle size was chosen as the dependent variable. Analysis of variance showed that the effect of pressure and nozzle diameter and their interactive effect on particle volume mean diameter (VMD) were statistically significant at the 1 % level. In order to compare the results estimated from regression equations and observed particle diameter chi-square test was used. Based on this test, the difference was not significant. </p...|$|R

40|$|There is {{currently}} high demand for new building materials which are considered 2 ̆ 2 environmentally friendly 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 for both new construction and renovations. Spray polyurethane foam (SPUF) insulation has gained significant acceptance by both consumers {{and the construction}} industry due to its high R-value, which results into significant energy savings among other things. Despite its acceptance by consumers and the construction industry, consideration {{must be given to}} potential <b>chemical</b> exposures to <b>applicators</b> installing these products. This study sought to determine, through quantitative experimentation, if there was a release of glycol derivatives including, diethylene glycol (DEG), ethylene glycol (EG), and propylene glycol (PEG), during the application of SPUF. In addition, total volatile organic Compounds (tVOCs) and various environmental parameters were also collected during this research. This study utilized a two-component small-scale SPUF kit manufactured by the Dow Chemical Company, known as the FROTH-PAK™ kit. This specific kit is typically used by the construction industry to fill cavities, cracks, floor and wall penetrations, and expansion joints of buildings. In order to determine the presence of these glycol derivatives, personal breathing zone samples were collected during the application of the SPUF during three application trials. Glycols derivatives were measured using active sampling techniques. Supplementary parameters including tVOCs, ambient and wet-bulb temperature, relative humidity, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, were measured using direct-reading techniques. During this study several modifications were made to the work area and the air sampling methodology to assist in verifying the presence of the glycols and the conditions in which they may be present in the air during the application of SPUF insulation. All samples were sent to an accredited laboratory and were analyzed by the Nation Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Method 5523. During this study, measurable amounts of diethylene glycol and propylene glycol were detected in two of the trials in which no ventilation in the work area was utilized. During one trial in which a work area ventilation system was utilized, none of the glycols were detected in the laboratory analysis above the limit of detection given the analytical method. Ethylene glycol was not detected in any of the samples submitted for analysis. The results for the tVOC measurements were inconclusive. Based on the results of the air sampling, it is likely that exposure to diethylene glycol and propylene glycol may occur under certain conditions. However, due to the limited number of samples and the variation between the samples collected in this study, a generation rate or concentration buildup estimate for comparison of the OELs was not conducted. These conditions include the quantity of ventilation used during application, the application duration, and proper operation of the SPUF application equipment. Based on the results, there is evidence that additional research may be needed in this area...|$|R
