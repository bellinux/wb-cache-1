The notebook computer is not an exception, and innovative thermal management solutions must be employed {{to compensate for the}} increased heat dissipation in the space-constrained enclosures. The majority of current cooling systems in laptop computers rely on heat pipes attached to a remote heat exchanger with micro-fans providing forced convection to reject heat to the ambient, however this technique can not accommodate the increasing heat fluxes in the confined laptop enclosure. In this study, a two-phase <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is designed and tested for a laptop computer. The cooling system consists of an evaporator structure containing boiling structures connected to a compact condenser with mini fans providing external forced convection. A pump is also incorporated to assist the return of the condensate back to the evaporator. The cooling system is characterized by a parametric study which determines the effects of volume fill ratio of coolant, initial system pressure, and pump flow rate on the thermal performance of the closed loop. Experimental data shows the optimum parametric values which can dissipate 25 W of chip power with a chip temperature maintained at 95 C. Numerical analysis provides additional data to further enhance the heat dissipation from the external air-cooled side of the condenser by studying the effects of ventilation and air flow rate across the system. Thermal management of mobile systems must be considered during the early design phases, and this research shows the feasibility of implementing of a two-phase cooling system to dissipate 25 W in a laptop computer.

40|$|The {{earthquake}} and tsunami {{that hit the}} nuclear power plants at the Fukushima Daiichi site in March 2011 led to extensive fuel damage, including possible fuel melting, slumping, and relocation at the affected reactors. A so-called feed-and-bleed mode of reactor cooling was initially established to remove decay heat. The plan was to eventually switch over to a recirculation <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Failure of feed and bleed was a possibility during the interim period. Furthermore, even if recirculation was established, {{there was a possibility}} of its subsequent failure. Decay heat has to be sufficiently removed to prevent further core degradation. To understand the possible evolution of the accident conditions and to have a tool for potential future hypothetical evaluations of accidents at other nuclear facilities, a Markov model {{of the state of the}} reactors was constructed in the immediate aftermath of the accident and was executed under different assumptions of potential future challenges. This work was performed at the request of the U. S. Department of Energy to explore 'what-if' scenarios in the immediate aftermath of the accident.

Types of Cooling Towers Cooling towers fall into two main sub-divisions: natural draft and mechanical draft. Natural draft designs use very large concrete chimneys to introduce air through the media. Due to the tremendous size of these towers (500 ft high and 400 ft in diameter at the base) they are generally used for water flowrates above 200, 000 gal/min. Usually these types of towers are only used by utility power stations in the United States. Mechanical draft cooling towers are much more widely used.

40|$|Here we {{analyze the}} water use rates for {{thermoelectric}} power generation {{with respect to}} <b>cooling</b> <b>system,</b> plant type, plant age, geographic location {{and its relation to}} regional drought conditions between 2001 - 2005. Open loop plants withdraw roughly two orders of magnitude more water than <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> plants, while consuming (i. e., lose water to evaporation) about the same amount. A high degree of variability for water withdrawal and consumption rates exists for low capacity facilities. The highest withdrawal rates are in the southeastern part of the United States. Power to Water supply curves show that power generation limits exist for the various cooling types (i. e. at some point, a large increase in water withdrawal corresponds to only a small increase in power generation). Water supply curves also show the degree to which total power generation might decline if water withdrawal rates had to be reduced due to prolonged and severe drought. Facilities having the highest withdrawal rates are the most susceptible to prolonged and severe drought. The point at which power generation begins to be significantly affected by drought depends upon cooling type (e. g. open freshwater, closed tower with forced draft). For example, if each plant that uses a <b>closed</b> <b>loop,</b> forced draft <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> were limited to a water withdrawal rate of 100 cubic feet per second, total power generation for that category would only be reduced about 8 gigawatts. This means that if the maximum allowable withdrawal rate were reduced by 50 percent from 200 cubic feet per second, the total power generation would only be reduced 10 percent.

Cooling of thermoelectric plants is often achieved by water abstractions {{from the natural}} environment. In England and Wales, the electricity sector is responsible for approximately half of all water abstractions and 40 % of non-tidal surface water abstractions. We present a model that quantifies current water use of the UK electricity sector {{and use it to}} test six decarbonisation pathways to 2050. The pathways consist of a variety of generation technologies, with associated cooling methods, water use factors and cooling water sources. We find that up to 2030, water use across the six pathways is fairly consistent and all achieve significant reductions in both carbon and water intensity, based upon a transition to <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> and hybrid <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> From 2030 to 2050 our results diverge.

Risks to the aquatic environment will be intensified if generation with carbon capture and storage is clustered. Pathways of high nuclear capacity result in tidal and coastal abstraction that exceed current levels by 148 – 399 %. Whilst reducing freshwater abstractions, the marine environment will be impacted if a shortage of coastal sites leads to clustering of nuclear reactors and concentration of heated water discharges. The pathway with the highest level of renewables has both lowest abstraction and consumption of water.

It is the first reference card to utilize a <b>closed</b> <b>looped</b> liquid <b>cooler.</b> At 11.5 teraflops of computing power, the R9 295X2 was the most powerful dual-gpu consumer-oriented card in the world, until it was succeeded by the Radeon Pro Duo on April 26, 2016, which is essentially a combination of two (2) R9 Fury X (Fiji XT) GPUs on a single card. The R9 295x2 has essentially two R9 290x (Hawaii XT) GPUs each with 4GB GDDR5 VRAM.|$|R
40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center is {{developing}} advanced passive thermal management technology {{to reduce the}} mass and improve the reliability of space fuel cell systems for the NASA exploration program. The passive thermal management system relies on heat conduction within the cooling plate to move {{the heat from the}} central portion of the cell stack out to the edges of the fuel cell stack rather than using a pumped <b>loop</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> to convectively remove the heat. Using the passive approach eliminates the need for a coolant pump and other <b>cooling</b> <b>loop</b> components which reduces fuel cell system mass and improves overall system reliability. Previous analysis had identified that low density, ultra-high thermal conductivity materials would be needed for the cooling plates in order to achieve the desired reductions in mass and the highly uniform thermal heat sink for each cell within a fuel cell stack. A pyrolytic graphite material was identified and fabricated into a thin plate using different methods. Also a development project with Thermacore, Inc. resulted in a planar heat pipe. Thermal conductivity tests were done using these materials. The results indicated that lightweight passive fuel cell cooling is feasible...|$|R

In general, the use of hydrogen is attractive in the larger systems, even when extra safety precautions are taken.

40|$|We {{investigate}} monopoles in four-dimensional compact U(1) with Wilson action. We {{focus our}} attention on monopole clusters {{as they can be}} identified unambiguously contrary to monopole loops. We locate the clusters and determine their properties near the U(1) phase transition. The Coulomb phase is characterized by several small clusters, whereas in the confined phase the small clusters coalesce to one large cluster filling up the whole system. We find that clusters winding around the periodic lattice are absent within both phases and during the transition. However, within the confined phase, we observe periodically <b>closed</b> monopole <b>loops</b> if <b>cooling</b> is applied. 1...|$|R
