5|$|Alongside his {{colleague}} Wei Pu, Shen planned {{to map the}} orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court. To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, gnomon, sighting tube, and invented {{a new type of}} inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt. He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the <b>canal</b> <b>pound</b> lock. Although Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) was the first to describe camera obscura, Shen was the first in China to do so, several decades later. Shen wrote extensively about movable type printing invented by Bi Sheng (990–1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations. Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321.|$|E

25|$|During {{the ancient}} Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) of China, the sluice gate and canal lock of the flash lock had been known. By the 10th century the latter design was {{improved}} upon in China with {{the invention of}} the <b>canal</b> <b>pound</b> lock, allowing different adjusted levels of water along separated and gated segments of a canal. This innovation allowed for larger transport barges to pass safely without danger of wrecking upon the embankments, and was an innovation praised by those such as Shen Kuo (1031–1095). Shen also wrote in his Dream Pool Essays of the year 1088 that, if properly used, sluice gates positioned along irrigation canals were most effective in depositing silt for fertilization. Writing earlier in his Dongpo Zhilin of 1060, Su Shi came to a different conclusion, writing that the Chinese of a few centuries past had perfected this method and noted that it was ineffective in use by his own time.|$|E

2500|$|A {{flood gate}} or [...] "stop gate" [...] is the cheaper {{equivalent}} of a flood lock. Only one set of gates exist, and so when the river {{is higher than the}} canal, the gates are closed and navigation ceases. These are quite common in the French inland waterways system. Flood gates may also be used to sub-divide long <b>canal</b> <b>pounds</b> or protect, in case of bank collapse, the surrounding area if this is lower than the water level of the canal. They are commonly found at the ends of long embankments and at aqueducts. These gates are often overlooked because they lack balance beams and are only a little higher than normal canal level.|$|R

50|$|A <b>canal</b> <b>pound,</b> reach, or level (American usage), is {{the stretch}} of level water impounded between two canal locks. Canal pounds can vary in length from the non-existent, where two or more {{immediately}} adjacent locks form a lock staircase, to many miles.|$|E
50|$|Lockkeepers had {{to enforce}} company rules against the {{independent}} and wily boat captains. In some cases, {{they had to}} check waybills that the boats had. They also {{were responsible for the}} level (<b>canal</b> <b>pound)</b> by their lock, to fix leaks and other minor repairs.|$|E
50|$|The first summit <b>canal</b> to use <b>pound</b> locks was the Briare Canal in France {{which was}} {{completed}} in 1642.

50|$|A waste weir on a {{navigable canal}} is a slatted gate on each <b>canal</b> level or <b>pound,</b> to remove excess water and {{to drain the}} canal for repairs or for the winter shutdown. This differs for a dam or reservoir, for which a waste weir is another name for a spillway, i.e. not having the boards to adjust the water height nor the paddles to drain all the water as on a canal, only to drain the excess.|$|R

It closed in 1954, but may be reopened, as the closed section, now renamed the Lichfield Canal is the subject of an active restoration campaign. At 5.5 mi is Whittington Brook, where the waterway is officially part of the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal. The canal remains level for another 5.5 mi to Fazeley Junction, and for a further 3 mi along the Birmingham and Fazeley to Curdworth Bottom Lock or 1.4 mi along the Coventry Canal to Glascote Bottom Lock.|$|R
6000|$|In {{going to}} Narbonne I had of course counted upon Roman remains; but when I went forth {{in search of}} them I {{perceived}} that I had hoped too fondly. There is really nothing in the place to speak of; that is, {{on the day of}} my visit there was nothing but the market, which was in complete possession. [...] "This intricate, curious, but lifeless town," [...] Murray calls it; yet to me it appeared overflowing with life. Its streets are mere crooked, dirty lanes, bordered with perfectly insignificant houses; but they were filled with the same clatter and chatter that I had found at the hotel. The market was held partly in the little square of the hôtel de ville, a structure which a flattering woodcut in the Guide-Joanne had given me a desire to behold. The reality was not impressive, the old colour of the front having been completely restored away. Such interest as it superficially possesses it derives from a fine mediæval tower which rises beside it with turrets at the angles--always a picturesque thing. The rest of the market was held in another place, still shabbier than the first, which lies beyond the canal. The Canal du Midi flows through the town, and, spanned at this point by a small suspension-bridge, presented a certain sketchability. On the farther side were the vendors and chafferers--old women under awnings and big umbrellas, rickety tables piled high with fruit, white caps and brown faces, blouses, sabots, donkeys. Beneath this picture was another--a long row of washerwomen, on their knees {{on the edge of the}} <b>canal,</b> <b>pounding</b> and wringing the dirty linen of Narbonne--no great quantity, to judge by the costume of the people. Innumerable rusty men, scattered all over the place, were buying and selling wine, straddling about in pairs, in groups, with their hands in their pockets, and packed together at the doors of the cafés. They were mostly fat and brown and unshaven; they ground their teeth as they talked; they were very méridionaux.|$|R
50|$|The longest <b>canal</b> <b>pound</b> in the United Kingdom {{is between}} the stop lock on the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook (Dutton Stop Lock No 76) {{and the start of}} the Leeds and Liverpool Canal near Leigh (Poolstock Bottom Lock No 2), a {{distance}} of 39.5 mi. Another long pound is on the Kennet and Avon Canal between Wootton Rivers Bottom Lock and Caen Hill top lock. The longest level on the Erie Canal in New York was the 60 mile level (actually 64.2 miles) between Henrietta and Lockport.|$|E
50|$|Waste weirs {{are used}} to {{regulate}} {{the height of the}} water in the canal. Any water higher than the highest board in the waste weir would flow over the board, and out of the <b>canal</b> <b>pound.</b> Boards could be added or taken out to adjust the height of water. Waste weirs often had paddle valves at the bottom, allowing the canal to be completely drained for repairs, emergencies, or {{at the end of the}} boating season for winter. On some canals (e.g. the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal) with the exception of short levels, almost every level had a waste weir between the locks.|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} in 1775-1784 {{during the reign of}} Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Originally it was named Kanał Królewski (Royal Canal), after the Polish king, since he was the {{initiator}} of the project. Additional work was carried out starting in 1837 by Russian Empire and completed around 1846-1848. To supply the canal system with water, mainly the <b>canal</b> <b>pound,</b> Beloozerski and Orekhovski watercourses were started in 1839 and completed in 1843.The number of movable weirs between Brest and Pinsk reached 22. As a result, the canal became navigable for bigger vessels, steamers at any time from spring till autumn. In 1847, the Kanał Królewski was renamed into the Dneprovo-Bugski Canal.|$|E
40|$|By its presence, silver {{crucian carp}} or chiton (Carassius auratus gibelio Bloch.) makes {{lot of damage}} on fish-farms. By its {{nutrition}} way, the chiton competes with carp, thus reducing its growths and increasing the nutritive coefficient what is unjustified both economically and technologically. The diclinous and hermaphroditic way of procreation influences the spread of this species. After the dissection of an chiton exemplar of 10 - 12 dag in October 1995 in Našice “Ribnjak 1905 ” it was stated that it had 23 % of male fish. Spawn was in the IV. stage of sex maturity according to Kiseljević. The ways of chiton coming and going to particular pounds as well as measures to control it are analyzed in the text. It is recommended to turn full attention to the filling and re-filling of pounds, prevent the coming of wild fish and fill <b>canals</b> and <b>pounds</b> thoroughly...|$|R
5000|$|If {{the pound}} was many miles long, {{sometimes}} the canal would be designed with stop gates, {{so that if}} there was a break in the <b>canal</b> the whole <b>pound</b> would not lose all its water. Isolating the break would allow the company to make repairs sooner. For instance, on the 14 mile level of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, there were stop gates put before and after Big Pool so that it (the Big Pool lake) would not have to be drained [...] in case of breaks or repairs.|$|R

This was followed up by many recorded maritime travelers following the same route to India, including Faxian, Zhiyan, Tanwujie, etc. Like in the Western tradition, the earlier Zhou Dynasty Chinese also made use of the floating pontoon bridge, which became a valuable means to blockade the entire Yangtze River during Gongsun Shu's rebellion against the re-established Han government in 33 AD.

[...] There were many other improvements to nautical technology during the Song period as well, including crossbeams bracing the ribs of ships to strengthen them, rudders that could be raised or lowered to allow ships to travel in a wider range of water depths, and the teeth of anchors arranged circularly instead of in one direction, [...] "making them more reliable".|$|E
