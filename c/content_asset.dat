40|$|International audienceDocument Product Lines (DPL) is a {{document}} engineering methodology that applies product-line engineering principles to the gen-eration of documents in high variability contexts and with high reuse of components. Instead of standalone documents, DPL promotes the defi-nition of families of documents where the members share some common content while differ in other parts. The key for the definition is the avail-ability {{of a collection}} of <b>content</b> <b>assets</b> which can be parameterized and instantiated at document generation time. In this demonstration, we show the features of the DPL framework (DPLfw), the tool that supports DPL. DPLfw implements the domain engineering and application engineering stages of typical product line engineering approaches, supports different asset repositories, and gener-ates customized documents in different output formats. We use the case study of the generation of customized emergency plans in a University campus [[URL]...|$|R
