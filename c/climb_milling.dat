5000|$|<b>Climb</b> <b>milling</b> (right): Each tooth {{engages the}} {{material}} at a definite point, and {{the width of}} the cut starts at the maximum and decreases to zero. The chips are disposed behind the cutter, leading to easier swarf removal. The tooth does not rub on the material, and so tool life may be longer. However, <b>climb</b> <b>milling</b> can apply larger loads to the machine, and so is not recommended for older milling machines, or machines which are not in good condition. This type of milling is used predominantly on mills with a backlash eliminator.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates {{stability}} and dynamic behaviour of torus tool in <b>climb</b> <b>milling</b> on 5 positioned axes. The stability lobes theory {{is used to}} enable stable cutting conditions to be chosen. As the adaptation of such a theory to complex milling configurations is a difficult matter, new methods are presented to identify the dynamic parameters. Tool dynamic characteristics (stiffness and natural pulsation) are determined with an original coupled calculations-tests method. Start and exit angles are computed exactly using an original numerical model. A sensitivity analysis highlights the influence of machining parameters on stability of <b>climb</b> <b>milling.</b> This shows that a third region of "potential instability" {{must be taken into}} account in plotting stability lobes, due to the uncertainty of prediction due to modelling and identification of parameters. The results were validated experimentally with an innovative approach, especially through the use of high-speed cameras. Analysis of vibrations and the surface roughness allowed the analytical model to be verified so as to optimise the inclination of the tool on the surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ultra-high-strength steel 30 Cr 3 SiNiMoVA (30 Cr 3) {{which has}} {{excellent}} mechanical properties is usually used to manufacture the key parts in aviation industry. Precision hard milling is an efficiency way to machine 30 Cr 3 instead of grinding. Rounded cutting edge radius has important {{influence on the}} machining process due to small depth of cut. In order to better understanding the influence of rounded cutting edge radius, cutting forces, cutting temperature, critical depth of cut, etc., is analyzed by using finite element method (FEM). The results show that cutting forces in the y direction are more sensitively to the rounded cutting edge radii. Ploughing effect is also observed {{at the end of}} the <b>climb</b> <b>milling</b> process and it has significant influence on the quality of the machined surface. Simulation reveals that the increment of rounded cutting edge radius can lead to the increment of critical depth of cut correspondingly and the proportionality factor is about 14 %...|$|E

40|$|International audienceStatement of problemComputer-aided design/computer-aided {{manufacturing}} (CAD/CAM) machining {{influences the}} surface roughness of dental restorations and tool wear. Roughness must be suitable to meet clinical requirements, and the tool must {{last as long}} as possible. PurposeThe purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the influence of the CAD/CAM tool-material couple on tool wear and surface roughness after milling. Material and methodsThree tools (Lyra conical tool Ø 1 mm; GACD SASU, Lyra conical tool Ø 1. 05 mm; GACD SASU, and Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12 S; Sirona Dental Systems GmbH) and 3 CAD/CAM materials (Lava Ultimate; 3 M ESPE, Mark II; VITA Zahnfabrik H. Rauter GmbH, and Enamic; VITA Zahnfabrik H. Rauter GmbH) were tested. The tool wear of 6 tool-material couples at a feed rate of 2 m/min was analyzed before and after 8 minutes of flank and <b>climb</b> <b>milling</b> with optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and tool weighing. The surface roughness after milling was observed for 9 tool-material couples for flank and <b>climb</b> <b>milling.</b> Feed rates of 1, 2, 3, and 4. 8 m/min were used for each couple. Ra, Rt, Rz, Sa, Sq, and Sz roughness criteria were measured. A paired comparison of tool-material couples was conducted with the Kruskal-Wallis test. ResultsThe Mark II material led to more severe tool wear. Milling of Lava Ultimate resulted in chip deposits on the tool grit. The Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12 S was less worn for each material tested. The Cerec cylinder pointed tool 12 S and the Lyra conical tool Ø 1. 05 mm provided similar roughness measurements for the 3 materials tested. The Lyra conical tool Ø 1. 05 mm tool provided better roughness than the Lyra conical tool Ø 1 mm tool for the Enamic material. ConclusionTool lifetime calculated by volume of milled material removed should be the measure provided by CAD/CAM manufacturers instead of a number of blocks. This tool lifetime should be provided for the milling conditions associated with the material milled. Material hardness and tool grit are key factors for achieving a given roughness...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The optimal {{setting of}} {{machining}} parameters {{that may be}} realized via a suitable model/controller is an important concern to fulfill the overall objectives in machining. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper proposes an approach for determination of optimal setting of machining parameters in high speed <b>climb</b> <b>milling</b> operation through an TSK-type fuzzy logic controller (TSK-FLC). A novel approach is proposed here which combines the techniques of linear regression (LR) and genetic algorithm (GA) to utilize the advantages of each other, {{in order to develop}} an efficient FLC for high-speed milling. Findings: Modeling of manufacturing process enables generating of manufacturing data and knowledge representation in machining process. Comparisons of results with real experimental data as well as those obtained by other common methods of modeling show the effectiveness of the FLC. Research limitations/implications: The design approach of fuzzy logic controller uses experimental data for learning. The shape of fuzzy subsets as well as the structure(s) of rule consequent functions are the important concern for optimal knowledgebase (KB) of a FLC. Use of the advantages of both LR and GA makes it possible to achieve optimal KB of FLC. Practical implications: Use of developed FLC results in improved productivity and efficiency of machining process via the setting of optimal values of cutting parameters and the possiblilty to develop automatic manufacturing system by online determination of machining parameters. Originality/value: The paper describes a method for desiging a FLC for manufacturing process by a combination of LR and GA, which leads to eliminate a long regression function as required in standard linear regression method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This work {{deals with}} {{problems}} of tool axis inclination angles in ball-end milling. Tool axis inclination angle contributes to improvement of functional surface properties (surface integrity-surface roughness, residual stress, micro hardness, etc.), decreasing cutting forces and improving production. By milling with ball-end milling tool, using standard way of cutting, when work piece and cutting tool contain right angle, we have zero cutting speed on edge. At this point cutting tool only pushes material {{into the work}} piece. Here we can observe the following undesirable effects- chip contraction, increasing of cutting temperature, increasing vibrations or creation of built-up edge. These effects have negative results – low quality of surface and decreasing of tool life (in the worse case even it is pinching out). These effects can be eliminated with the tilt of cutting tool or tilt of work piece. Very important is direction of feed. If the feed is designated as pulled, the tool runs silently, and also the surface of work piece improves, as opposed to pushed tool [5]. These two ways {{can be used with}} the tool axis inclination angle in feed direction and also in pick feed direction. Also using <b>climb</b> <b>milling</b> or conventional milling has big influence on surface quality and on tool life. Keywords—CAD/CAM system, tool axis inclination angle, ballend milling, surface roughness, cutting forces. I. MILLING BY MEANS OF THE TOLL AXIS INCLINATION ANGLE Thanks to tilt of cutting tool we can change effective diameter of cutting tool and with it also effective cutting speed. Effective tool diameter (without tilt of cutting tool) can be calculated according to this mathematical expression: d 2 (d- a) eff = ⋅ a [mm] (1) p p Where: ap axial depth of cut [mm], d tool diameter [mm], deff effective tool diameter [mm]. Effective diameter of pulled cutting tool is calculated according to this mathematical expression [2]: ⎡ ⎛ d- 2 a ⎤ p ⎞ d = d ⋅ sin ⎢arccos ⎟ + β eff f ⎥ [mm] ⎝ d ⎠ ⎥...|$|E

40|$|Milling {{is one of}} {{the basic}} methods of {{machining}} where material is removed interrupted cut. A characteristic feature of this operation is that the removed material hasn´t a constant section, the chip thickness is observed. It is a variable. Therefore, medium chip thickness hm was determined. The experiment was realized by <b>climb</b> <b>milling</b> where the chip during the machining of a lot to say. Uncoated cutting tool was made of speed steel and the cutting speed was changed at three levels. The entire experiment was concentrated at monitoring the formation and shaping of chip at low speeds, as part of other experiments to be carried out at lower speeds. Three kinds of materials were machined, where the machinability has been evaluated {{on the basis of the}} chip shaping and it was compared with machinability according to the content of chemical elements in the material. From Groups of chips produced in the milling of the materials were selected representative samples, which were noted of the radius of these chips at 50 times magnification. The inaccuracy of this method mustn´t is forgotten, because the chip thickness is not constant and there is some distortion. At the selecting the reference material was assumed that material STN 12 050 is optimal machinability and was chosen as the reference material. All three materials as well cultivated by the shape of chips were appeared at cutting speed 4 m. min- 1. When gradually increasing the cutting speed changes occurred first and STN 14 220 material exhibited better machinability than material STN 17 241. Machinability according of chip shaping was also confirmed by machinability content of chemical elements in the material. According to the carbon content could be said that the STN 14 220 has better machinability, but the chromium content makes the material tougher and so makes worse its kinetic and dynamic machinability. Corrosion resistant steel STN 17 241 has the largest chromium content, it is tough, therefore kinetically and dynamically machinability is worse than previous materials. If the goal was to get a good surface quality material STN 17 241 would be in the first place thanks to the highest manganese content. Machining was recorded using high-speed camera Phantom. For the record it was observed the chip formation and their removal from the cutting zone. Chips were twisted into the radius but in machining stainless steel by higher cutting speeds were recorded the highest values of the chip radius of curvature. Observed of chip formation is more widespread in turning than milling operations. However, it is important to follow the features of various technological operations, because each is different and brings a deeper understanding of patterns of technological processes.
