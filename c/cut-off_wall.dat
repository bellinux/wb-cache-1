It does not necessarily require surcharge fill and vacuum loads of 80kPa or greater can, typically, be maintained for as long as required. However, if loads of 80kPa or greater are needed in order to achieve the target soil improvement, additional surcharge may be placed on top of the vacuum system. The vacuum preloading method is cheaper and faster than the fill surcharge method for an equivalent load in suitable areas.

The work was done mainly to show the behavior of the subsurface dam under the subjecting loads. The plastic concrete was chosen for the construction of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>wall</b> required for the reservoir. Three-dimensional finite element analyses were made for three thicknesses of the cut-off walls: 0. 6 to 0. 8 m, 0. 8 to 1. 0 m and 1. 0 to 1. 2 m for the alluvium depths of 30, 50 and 70 m, respectively. The change in soil rigidity with depth was taken into account. The vertical and horizontal boundary conditions were designed to simulate the proper behavior of the structure It was found that increasing the thickness of the wall improves the distribution of the mobilized passive pressure opposite to the water pressure acting on the upstream face of the <b>cut-off</b> <b>wall,</b> while, the vertical and horizontal stresses developed in the wall due to the applied loads increased. In addition, stresses in the wall increase incrementally with the increase of wall height. The maximum horizontal and vertical stresses developed in proportion to the 1 / 6 bottom height of the wall.

The {{objective of this}} research was to evaluate the performance of a polymer-treated bentonite (HYPER clay) and its impact on hydraulic and mechanical properties of cement-bentonite (CB) mixtures in contact with sulfates. In this research, bender elements were installed in a hydraulic conductivity cell, to simultaneously monitor the small- strain shear modulus (G 0) and the hydraulic conductivity (k) of cement-bentonite mixtures. Initially, during permeation with deionized water, an increase of G 0 with time was observed, due to cement hydration (hardening). Conversely, after prolonged permeation with sulfates, a decrease of G 0 and a gradual increase of k are expected due to degradation of the cemented material. Preliminary results show that k of mixtures containing untreated bentonite increases due to contact with sulfates; conversely, k of mixtures containing HYPER clay remains unaffected. The stiffness modulus G 0 was not significantly affected after a sulfate contact period of about 100 days in none of the cement-bentonite mixtures. More extensive monitoring is required for evaluating long-term mechanical degradation. These observations suggest that the use of polymer-treated bentonites could improve the resistance of cement-bentonite mixtures to sulfate attack maintaining a low hydraulic conductivity...|$|R

The use of additional anchored tie rods grouted into the backfill soil and arranged along the exposed wall height is one of the most practical and appropriate solutions adopted for stabilization and rehabilitation of the existing quay wall.
