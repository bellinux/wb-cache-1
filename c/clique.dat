5|$|In {{computer}} science, the <b>clique</b> {{problem is}} the computational problem of finding cliques (subsets of vertices, all adjacent to each other, also called complete subgraphs) in a graph. It has several different formulations depending on which cliques, and what information about the cliques, should be found. Common formulations of the <b>clique</b> problem include finding a maximum <b>clique</b> (a <b>clique</b> with the largest possible number of vertices), finding a maximum weight <b>clique</b> in a weighted graph, listing all maximal cliques (cliques that cannot be enlarged), and solving the decision problem of testing whether a graph contains a <b>clique</b> larger than a given size.|$|E
5|$|In the maximal <b>clique</b> listing problem, {{the input}} is an undirected graph, and the output {{is a list}} of all its maximal cliques. The maximum <b>clique</b> problem may be solved using as a {{subroutine}} an algorithm for the maximal <b>clique</b> listing problem, because the maximum <b>clique</b> must be included among all the maximal cliques.|$|E
5|$|In {{the maximum}} <b>clique</b> problem, the input is an undirected graph, and the output is a maximum <b>clique</b> in the graph. If there are {{multiple}} maximum cliques, one of them may be chosen arbitrarily.|$|E
5000|$|For {{every two}} {{overlapping}} maximal <b>cliques,</b> {{the intersection of}} the two <b>cliques</b> is a separator that splits the differences of the two <b>cliques.</b> In the illustration of the gem graph, this is not true: <b>cliques</b> [...] and [...] are not separated by their intersection, , because there is an edge [...] that connects the <b>cliques</b> but avoids the intersection.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} to identify peer <b>cliques</b> {{based on a}} consensus of group members; it provides quantitative measures of preadolescents’ involvement in <b>cliques</b> and their association with peers who often get in trouble. Of primary interest was the relation between peer rejection and participation in peer <b>cliques.</b> Characteristics of peer <b>cliques</b> were assessed for 824 fourth-grade youth {{as a function of}} their sociometric status, gender, and aggressiveness. Rejected youth were less central members of their group than were average-status peers; however, aggressive preadolescents were no less centrally involved than their nonaggressive peers. Rejected preadolescents also belonged to smaller <b>cliques</b> and to <b>cliques</b> comprised of other low-status peers. Aggression was the primary factor associated with being a central member of deviant peer <b>cliques...</b>|$|R
40|$|We do {{computational}} studies {{concerning the}} enumeration of maximal isolated <b>cliques</b> in graphs. Isolation, as recently introduced, measures {{the degree of}} connectedness of the <b>cliques</b> {{to the rest of}} the graph. Isolation helps both in getting faster algorithms than for the enumeration of maximal general <b>cliques</b> and in filtering out <b>cliques</b> with special semantics. We perform experiments with synthetic graphs (in the Gn,m,p model) and financial networks, proposing the enumeration of isolated <b>cliques</b> as a useful instrument in analyzing financial networks...|$|R
5|$|In the {{weighted}} maximum <b>clique</b> problem, the input is an undirected graph with weights on its vertices (or, less frequently, edges) and the output is a <b>clique</b> with maximum total weight. The maximum <b>clique</b> {{problem is the}} special case in which all weights are equal. As well as the problem of optimizing the sum of weights, other more complicated bicriterion optimization problems have also been studied.|$|E
5|$|Most {{versions}} of the <b>clique</b> problem are hard. The <b>clique</b> decision problem is NP-complete (one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems). The problem of finding the maximum <b>clique</b> is both fixed-parameter intractable and hard to approximate. And, listing all maximal cliques may require exponential time as there exist graphs with exponentially many maximal cliques. Therefore, much of the theory about the <b>clique</b> problem is devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational difficulty of the general problem in various models of computation.|$|E
5|$|The {{computational}} {{difficulty of}} the <b>clique</b> problem has led it {{to be used to}} prove several lower bounds in circuit complexity. The existence of a <b>clique</b> of a given size is a monotone graph property, meaning that, if a <b>clique</b> exists in a given graph, it will exist in any supergraph. Because this property is monotone, there must exist a monotone circuit, using only and gates and or gates, to solve the <b>clique</b> decision problem for a given fixed <b>clique</b> size. However, the size of these circuits can be proven to be a super-polynomial function of the number of vertices and the <b>clique</b> size, exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices. Even if a small number of NOT gates are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial. Additionally, the depth of a monotone circuit for the <b>clique</b> problem using gates of bounded fan-in must be at least a polynomial in the <b>clique</b> size.|$|E
30|$|We {{could also}} find 17 maximal strong <b>cliques,</b> which {{represent}} cohesive groups of recognition, where {{all members of}} the group recognized all other members as relevant. Out of these 17 maximal strong <b>cliques,</b> 6 <b>cliques</b> have only members from the topmost group. On the other hand, 6 <b>cliques</b> do not have any member from the topmost group, and the remaining 5 are evenly distributed. We could find three maximum strong <b>cliques,</b> with 3 members each. All these maximum <b>cliques</b> have only members from the topmost group. Similarly to the previous analysis, we observe that there is mutual recognition between both groups. Moreover, the large number of maximal and maximum <b>cliques</b> with few members in both analyses indicates that there is no individual concentration of indications. However, there are multiple localized concentrations, especially with members of the topmost group, as should be expected.|$|R
40|$|NP-complicated {{problems}} have been described in the graph theory. An example is the extracting of all maximal <b>cliques</b> from a graph. Many algorithms for solving this problem have been described. However, complexity is linear {{to the number of}} maximal <b>cliques.</b> This paper discusses a new approach for extracting maximal <b>cliques,</b> based on the monotone system theory. The complexity of the presented algorithms is linear to the number of maximal <b>cliques...</b>|$|R

5|$|However, some {{research}} in parallel algorithms {{has studied the}} problem of finding a maximal <b>clique.</b> In particular, the problem of finding the lexicographically first maximal <b>clique</b> (the one found by the algorithm above) {{has been shown to}} be complete for the class of polynomial-time functions. This result implies that the problem is unlikely to be solvable within the parallel complexity class NC.|$|E
5|$|Perfect graphs {{are defined}} by the {{properties}} that their <b>clique</b> number equals their chromatic number, and that this equality holds also in each of their induced subgraphs. For perfect graphs, {{it is possible to}} find a maximum <b>clique</b> in polynomial time, using an algorithm based on semidefinite programming.|$|E
5|$|The <b>clique</b> problem {{arises in}} the {{following}} real-world setting. Consider a social network, where the graph's vertices represent people, and the graph's edges represent mutual acquaintance. Then a <b>clique</b> represents a subset of people who all know each other, and algorithms for finding cliques {{can be used to}} discover these groups of mutual friends. Along with its applications in social networks, the <b>clique</b> problem also has many applications in bioinformatics and computational chemistry.|$|E

40|$|All {{the work}} made so far on edge-covering a graph by <b>cliques</b> focus on finding the {{minimum number of}} <b>cliques</b> that cover the graph. On this paper, we fix the number of <b>cliques</b> that cover a graph by {{the same number of}} {{vertices}} that the graph has, and give an upper bound for the sum of the number of vertices of these <b>cliques</b> in the cases where this covering is possible.

The crowds within a given school are also perceived hierarchically. Crowd ranking can sometimes change but is generally quite stable across time and schools. Part of a <b>clique's</b> popularity status {{is based on the}} crowd with which its members associate, thus similarly-popular <b>cliques</b> within the same crowd are more likely to move within the hierarchy than are similar crowds within the larger peer context.|$|R
