5|$|Sansa Stark confronts Petyr Baelish {{about his}} {{decision}} to marry her to Ramsay Bolton. He explains that he was ignorant of Ramsay's <b>cruelty</b> <b>and</b> begs for forgiveness. In exchange, he offers her {{the support of the}} Vale in her attempt to retake Winterfell from the Boltons, but Sansa declines. As he leaves, Littlefinger reveals that her great-uncle, the Blackfish, has retaken Riverrun with the Tully army; Sansa orders Brienne of Tarth to go and recruit the Blackfish for their cause.|$|E
5|$|While Tiberius was in Capri, rumours abounded as to {{what exactly}} he was doing there. Suetonius records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity, {{including}} graphic depictions of child molestation, and <b>cruelty,</b> <b>and</b> most of all his paranoia. While heavily sensationalized, Suetonius' stories at least {{paint a picture of}} how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} torture of a dog {{as a child in}} the First stage of cruelty, Nero {{progresses}} to beating his horse as a man in the Second stage of <b>cruelty,</b> <b>and</b> then to robbery, seduction, and murder in Cruelty in perfection. Finally, in The reward of cruelty, he receives what Hogarth warns is the inevitable fate of those who start down the path Nero has followed: his body is taken from the gallows after his execution as a murderer and is mutilated by surgeons in the anatomical theatre.|$|E

5|$|Due to its graphic content, {{there are}} several {{different}} versions of Cannibal Holocaust in circulation which are edited to varying degrees. In the UK, the film was originally released on VHS by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These cuts were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape. In 2001, the film was passed for release on DVD by the BBFC with 5 minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal <b>cruelty</b> <b>and</b> sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of these cuts were waived for a re-release in 2011. The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato which reduces the violence toward animals.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 2015, Cody {{was indicted}} on animal <b>cruelty</b> <b>and</b> drug charges by a Baltimore County grand jury.

Cody's agent, Peter Schaffer, denied his client's guilt and said that Cody's dog died of worms {{and that there was}} no animal cruelty. The investigating veterinarian said the dog was neglected and starved to death.|$|E
5|$|While {{the venom}} {{of a few}} species is {{dangerous}} to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides. Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these {{can be used as}} silk factories. As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, <b>cruelty</b> <b>and</b> creative powers. An abnormal fear of spiders is called arachnophobia.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of <b>cruelty</b> <b>and</b> violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Despite limited {{information}} about its service routes and construction, the Nathan F. Cobb {{was the subject}} of two separate New York Times articles during its short career. One article reported the wreck the day after it occurred, the other article came from 20 June 1892 and chronicled a disturbance between mates. The Cobb was still in tow only three miles outside Mobile Bay, beginning its route from Mobile, Alabama to New York, when mate Henry Shaffer jumped over board to avoid a beating. Another mate, J. Trott had already used a belaying pin to half kill another seaman on the schooner and Shaffer was fearful for his life. Shaffer began swimming towards a nearby light house and was picked up nearly five miles from where he jumped over board. The captain of the towboat reported that Captain Cookson of the Cobb, mentioned incidentally they had lost a crewman. Both Cookson and Trott already had pending charges against them for <b>cruelty</b> <b>and</b> marooning of sailors, stemming from an incident in May 1891 at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana.|$|E

Arisa awakens from her coma, but pretends to have amnesia and returns to Midori's side. She reveals {{that she was the}} original King: although she granted harmless wishes in the beginning, she eventually stole the answers to an exam for Mariko's wish, fearing disappointment if she refused. Midori caught her in the act, and she shared the task of granting the class's wishes with him, until he injured her mother, in an attempt to grant her wish. Midori then replaced her as King, using violence and bullying to grant wishes. Horrified by his <b>cruelty</b> <b>and</b> the perceived similarities between them, she then reached out to her twin, hoping that Tsubasa would be able to uncover the truth. Tsubasa learns that Midori suffered psychological trauma in his childhood after being abandoned by his mother and witnessing his twin, Akari, die of neglect. She later foils his attempt to kill her mother, as he hated his own mother and believed that Arisa hated hers as well. Arisa confesses that she loves him for noticing her loneliness, and he realizes that he loves her too. In the conclusion, Arisa's mother spends more time with her, and Arisa reconciles with Tsubasa.|$|E
5|$|In a {{parallel}} universe, a fantasy world of Enchantia is suffering under the terrible rule {{of a powerful}} coven of wicked witches. Their queen, who managed to surpass the rest in her boundless <b>cruelty</b> <b>and</b> depravity, frantically seeks a live male child from another dimension as the main ingredient of her desired spell of eternal youth. Having borrowed magic powers {{from all the other}} witches in Enchantia on the promise to make them too young forever, she created an invisible portal connection to Earth. One day in our world in the 1990s, an American young teenager named Brad plays a baseball practice with his sister Jenny when the witch spots him through the portal and incants a summoning spell, making him suddenly vanish in a flash of light.

Tyrion is appointed Master of Coin, the treasurer, {{as a reward for}} his successful leadership. After learning of a Tyrell plot to claim Winterfell through marriage to Sansa, Tywin forces Tyrion to marry her instead.

At the celebration of his wedding to Margaery Tyrell, Joffrey is poisoned. Cersei promptly accuses Tyrion, who is arrested. His previous good deeds forgotten, Tyrion is put on trial as Cersei manipulates the proceedings to ensure a guilty verdict. He is heartbroken to find that even Shae has turned against him. In his grief, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, to which Cersei responds by naming the virtually unbeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Oberyn Martell agrees to fight for Tyrion but dies in the attempt. Pronounced guilty, Tyrion is taken to the dungeon to await his execution. Jaime frees him with the help of Varys, eventually confessing his complicity in Tywin's ruin of Tyrion's first wife Tysha.
