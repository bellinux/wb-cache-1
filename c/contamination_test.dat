2500|$|The {{second of}} three spacewalks was {{completed}} on flight day 7. Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick {{were able to}} complete all their planned tasks in 5 hours and 54 minutes. The tasks included installing ammonia coolant loops, thermal blankets to protect the ammonia hoses, outfitting the earth facing port of Tranquility for the Cupola, install handrails and a non-propulsive vent valve (NPV). During the connection {{of one of the}} ammonia hoses, a small amount of ammonia leaked out of a quick disconnect valve and floated towards Nick Patrick. Procedures called for a [...] "bake-out" [...] while Patrick worked during the sunlit portion of the orbit, and a <b>contamination</b> <b>test</b> in the airlock. The bake-out happened {{at the end of the}} spacewalk. While the spacewalk was happening, Terry Virts and Kay Hire along with ISS commander Jeff Williams, Soichi Noguchi and T.J. Creamer, continued outfitting the Tranquility module. This included setting up the ventilation system, connecting electrical and computer cables and configuring racks. They confirmed lights and computers were on in the node once the ammonia cooling system had been activated. The crew also received word the mission had been extended by one day in the morning.|$|E

Referring to mixtures in the estimation window as contamination, this work introduces a novel sea clutter <b>contamination</b> <b>test</b> based on log-cumulants from Mellin kind statistics [1].

A <b>contamination</b> <b>test</b> {{was carried out}} using curry as a contaminant; the curry {{was placed on the}} thin film samples, heated at 150 ℃, and then removed with neutral detergent, followed by microscopic observation and color difference measurement. Coating with silica either using TEOS or PHPS was effective in suppressing the contamination, where the latter was found to be more effective than the former. Although the as-prepared silica and silica/PMMA hybrid thin films were crack-free, the films tended to be cracked when subjected to the <b>contamination</b> <b>test,</b> which was more significant for those prepared at higher substrate withdrawal speeds. The cracking tendency, however, was found to decrease when silica was hybridized with PMMA, and no cracks were observed on the <b>contamination</b> <b>test</b> for the sample prepared at PMMA/PHPS mass ratios higher than 1. 2. The degree of contamination was minimized at a PMMA/PHPS mass ratio of 0. 8, where excellent adhesion was also found between the film and the substrate...|$|E

40|$|Next {{generation}} sequencing, NGS, is revolutionizing {{the world}} of science. Illumina, Inc. ???s NGS chemistry begins with sample preparation which involves fragmenting genomic DNA (gDNA) and attaching oligonucleotide adapters. DNA fragments are then amplified, in a process referred to as cluster generation and sequenced in parallel. The adapters added during the sample preparation process are required for Illumina???s NGS chemistry. Most of the adapters have a unique index sequence (index adapter) incorporated in them, which allows sample tracking and multiplexing. Ilumina, Inc. has a diverse NGS product portfolio that currently uses 220 index adapters from seven different sample preparation product lines. Each manufactured index adapter requires quality control (QC) <b>contamination</b> <b>testing.</b> The purpose of this testing is {{to determine if the}} indexed adapters under evaluation are cross-contaminated with any other indexed adapter. This practice is particularly important because the end-user utilizes the Illumina, Inc. supplied adapter sequences for sample identification and cross-contamination can result in sample tracking errors. It is imperative that <b>contamination</b> <b>testing</b> be conducted on all manufactured adapters; however the majority of the QC testing of these product lines involves labor-intensive sample preparation protocols and instrument time intensive sequencing runs. The project aimed to move the <b>contamination</b> <b>testing</b> of index adapters with library preparation protocols to a shorter PCR-based protocol, introduce a faster cluster generation protocol, and combine multiple QC contamination processes into a single protocol.

Organic materials are outgassing in vacuum and deposit on irradiated optical components. To provide reliable space-based laser systems the optical components quality plays a major role. In this thesis laser-induced contamination growth on high-reflective coated optics is investigated for UV irradiation of 355 nm with naphthalene as contamination material.

40|$|Fe 3 + {{is a sort}} {{of common}} metal ion {{contaminant}} for the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) water electrolyser. In this paper, the effect of Fe 3 + on the performance of SPE water electrolyser has been investigated by both in-situ and ex-situ characterizations. The electron probe microanalysis and ultraviolet test results showed that Fe 3 + could migrate from the anode to the cathode and mostly be reduced to Fe 2 + in the cathode rather than occurred underpotential deposition as described in the previous report. The in-situ dynamic <b>contamination</b> <b>test</b> showed that the anode voltage increased sharply as soon as the Fe 3 + was fed into the anode, while the cathode voltage kept constant until the contamination time was over 30 minutes, indicating the higher tolerance of the cathode than the anode for the Fe 3 + contamination. The calculation results based on the electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy test results revealed that the striking increase of the electrolysis voltage was mainly attributed to the ohmic overpotential, which was due to the replacement of H+ by Fe 3 + in the Nafion resin. Interestingly, the voltage lagged behind the current for several minutes in the multi-current- step test for the contaminated electrolyser, which phenomenon may be used for judging whether the SPE water electrolyser performance degradation is due to the metal ions contamination.

40|$|Plumes of {{bipropellant}} thrusters are {{a source}} of contamination. Small bipropellant thrusters are often used for spacecraft attitude control and orbit correction. Such thrusters typically operate in a pulse mode, at various pulse lengths. Quantifying their contamination effects onto spacecraft external surfaces is especially important for long-term complex-geometry vehicles, e. g. International Space Station. Plume contamination tests indicated the presence of liquid phase contaminant in the form of droplets. Their origin is attributed to incomplete combustion. Most of liquid-phase contaminant is generated during the startup and shutdown (unsteady) periods of thruster pulse. These periods are relatively short (typically 10 - 50 ms), and the amount of contaminant is determined by the thruster design (propellant valve response, combustion chamber size, thruster mass flow rate, film cooling percentage, dribble volume, etc.) and combustion process organization. Steady-state period of pulse is characterized by much lower contamination rates, but may be lengthy enough to significantly conh'ibute to the overall contamination effect. Because there was no standard methodology for thruster pulse time division, plume contamination tests were conducted at various pulse durations, and their results do not allow quantifying contaminant amounts from each portion of the pulse. At present, the ISS plume contamination model uses an assumption that all thrusters operate in a pulse mode with the pulse length being 100 ms. This assumption may lead to a large difference between the actual amounts of contaminant produced by the thruster and the model predictions. This paper suggests a way to standardize thruster startup and shutdown period definitions, and shows the usefulness of this approach to better quantify thruster plume contamination. Use of the suggested thruster pulse time-division technique will ensure methodological consistency of future thruster plume <b>contamination</b> <b>test</b> programs, and allow accounting for thruster pulse length when modeling plume contamination and erosion effects...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of a research program aimed to define the chronology of the structures of the architectonic complex of San Francesco alla Collina (Paternò, Italy), two luminescence dating techniques were applied: Thermoluminescence (TL) on terracotta bricks and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) on mortars. Dating a historic building through the age of its bricks can be sometimes complex, for the possible gap between the age of the bricks themselves and that of the structure. Considering that the laying of mortar is contemporary to the construction, the principal objective of the work here presented is the verification of the possibility of solving chronological uncertainties of specific parts of a building using simultaneously TL on bricks and OSL on the associated mortar. The dating of bricks was obtained using the polymineral 4 - 11 m granulometric fraction following the fine-grain technique. Starting from the same granulometric fraction, a new protocol consisting of different etching treatments, associated with a feldspar <b>contamination</b> <b>test,</b> was developed to obtain pure quartz grains from mortar. The study shows the possibility of dating the mortar by luminescence, in particular using the OSL emissions of the fine-grained quartz fraction. The main focus is to provide a procedure where each step was opportunely adapted to mortar, starting from the chemical-physical preparation to the luminescence measurements protocols. The good agreement of OSL dating of mortars and TL dating of associated bricks and the correspondence of these ages with the well documented historical phases, unique at this time, represents an important goal for application. It is possible to assert that luminescence techniques permit the resolution of dating problems regarding historical buildings above all in terms of dating back {{to the use of the}} bricks in the construction from the laying of mortars...|$|E
