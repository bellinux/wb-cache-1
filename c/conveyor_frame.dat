50|$|Externally mounted {{monitoring}} {{technologies are}} also being investigated by the industry. Largely showing mixed results of success, these proposed technologies are mostly research based initiatives. A complexity arises out of detecting specific failing rollers using generalised monitoring technologies such as optic fibre cables or vibration monitoring transducers mounted to the <b>conveyor</b> <b>frame.</b> The general, non-specific nature of these technologies have many issues similar to those encountered with the traditional monitoring aids used by inspection personnel. Acoustic monitors, Infrared cameras and any other technology that does not monitor the rollers in a holistic way, generally fail to accurately predict impending roller failure. This is because conveyor roller failure is multi-modal and is indicated over a variety of failure signals not solely identified using single mode detection systems which are characteristic of optic fibre or vibration transducers mounted to the conveyor structure.|$|E
50|$|The exposed drum shafts {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the <b>conveyor</b> <b>frame</b> and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are {{assembled}} on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum radial load due to the bending stresses caused by the normal belt tension of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high belt tension.|$|E

The work is divided into acquaintance {{with the problem of}} chip conveyor and the requirements that are placed on the conveyor. The thesis summarizes possible design solutions, of which is chosen the best design solution. Followed by calculations dimensions, choice of materials and semifinished products for creating drawings. The primary input for the work is existing <b>conveyor</b> <b>frame.</b> All dimensions and functional members were chosen with regard to the parameters of the <b>conveyor</b> <b>frame,</b> which will be modified at least.

40|$|Simulation at the machine-control level {{plays an}} {{important}} role in designing machine controls and operational specifications. Recently, there has been a considerable amount of work done in the area of manufacturing systems control. This micro-level type of modeling is as important as modeling at the plant level. This paper is an application case study of modeling at the machine-control level. The objective of this paper is to address the issues of augmenting control design for automated production systems through the use of DES. The case study is an automated process of a frame turnover. In this process, an inbound <b>conveyor</b> transfers large <b>frames</b> into a turnover unit. Frames are accelerated toward the lift and rotate unit using a hydraulic slide. Frames are lifted and rolled over side to side then lowered onto an outbound pedestal conveyor. The pedestal <b>conveyor</b> shifts <b>frames</b> to the unloading station. The objectives of the case study were to visualize the turnover process and to design the sequences and timing of its operations. Based on that, it is required to verify that there is enough time for the turnover process to take place in synch with the movement of the inbound and pedestal conveyors. Finally, the machine controls are designed so that the system throughput and operational specifications are achieved...|$|R

Currently, the canopy volume is set mainly on the basis of size of over-head harvesting machines; this is a limit for natural growth of trees which have to be pruned hard once the allotted canopy size is reached. Thus, in these sorts of orchards, growers have to find the optimal canopy management in order to control canopy growth and keep the canopy productive (high-yield efficiency). Three main factors have to be considered in canopy management: adaptation of canopy to over-head harvesting machines, light penetration and reciprocal shading. Over-head harvesting machines require elastic canopy in the part exceeding the projection of <b>conveyor</b> <b>frames.</b> Pruning operations have to be set in order to eliminate branches which are not elastic enough to bend down. Elasticity requirements were calculated in 'Arbequina' and 'Maurino' and branch sizes in relation to their branching position are discussed. Light penetration influences the light environment experienced by each shoot. Light environment influences flowering potential of bearing shoots. Effects of selective pruning and topping on light penetration in the canopy of 'Arbequina' and 'Maurino' are compared. Canopy size effect on shading of nearby row was then studied and compared between rows pruned by topping cuts and selective side pruning. In conclusion, tree canopy size can be increased but pruning should keep canopy elastic and enough porous in order to allow light penetration and flowering in the whole canopy volume. Increasing canopy size does not increase significantly reciprocal shading between rows but at the same time it may allow to keep fruit yield steady once tree canopy fills the allotted space...|$|R

The screening mechanism consists of a steel bin with a mesh floor, sitting on a base of steel girders. The bin {{is attached to the}} base by pivots and coiled steel springs. This enables the bin to be rocked backwards and forwards on its base. A partly collapsed steel <b>framed</b> <b>conveyor</b> leads from this plant {{to the top of a}} second screening plant and bin.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This {{project is}} {{focuses on a}} {{conceptual}} design of a conveyor system {{that can be used}} to differentiate between metallic and non-metallic materials, as well as to perform transferring of the mentioned materials. The project should be started by means of research on metallic waste sorting machines in the market like magnetic conveyor system. A conveyor system is mechanical handling equipment that moves materials from one location to another and magnetic pulley has been used to separate metal and non-metal waste. Standard design process flow is to be followed e. g. conceptual design and detailed design to be produced prior to the fabrication. Design of the conveyor is using Solidworks Software and analysis is using Ansys Software. Analysis equipment has been done by doing calculation such as calculation of gear and motor torque prior to fabrication. The expected result the fully automated conveyor system that can be used for metallic waste management application is described in detail in this paper.
