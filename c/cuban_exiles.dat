5|$|During the Cold War {{the future}} park area {{was used as}} a {{training}} ground for <b>Cuban</b> <b>exiles</b> training for missions in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Elliott Key in particular was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a training area in the early 1960s in preparation for Bay of Pigs invasion. The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge, the only hotel ever built on the key. As late as 1988 a group of <b>Cuban</b> <b>exiles</b> were arrested when they tried to use the key for a mock landing. Farther north, exiled Venezuelan president Marcos Pérez Jiménez kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the improved relations between Cuba {{and a number of}} leftist Latin American states, in 2004 it broke off diplomatic ties with Panama after centrist President Mireya Moscoso pardoned four <b>Cuban</b> <b>exiles</b> accused of attempting to assassinate Castro in 2000. Diplomatic ties were reinstalled in 2005 following the election of leftist President Martín Torrijos.|$|E
5|$|In April 1961, a 1,400-man {{force of}} <b>Cuban</b> <b>exiles</b> invaded Cuba {{in an attempt}} to end the regime of Fidel Castro. The {{invasion}} was a failure and two hundred of the exiles were killed while an additional 1,200 were captured. Miskovsky, working with lawyer and lead negotiator James Donovan, and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, negotiated a release for the prisoners in return for around fifty million dollars in medicine, food and other supplies. The captured Cubans were released days before Christmas.|$|E

5|$|In Cuba, sailors on the USS America (CV-66) {{spent about}} 1,700hours to assist Guantánamo Bay in recovery. The sole {{survivor}} of the sinking boat carrying <b>Cuban</b> <b>exiles</b> was tried in a military tribunal. The man was {{held responsible for the}} 44boat deaths and was quickly executed. The United States Coast Guard deployed boats, helicopters, and airplanes to find victims of the boat capsized in the Straits of Florida. In the United States, the price for lettuce and tomatoes rose due to Inez's crop damage in Florida and reduced crop output in California. The country's military sent helicopters and planes to join the Mexican Air Force, as well as trucks by land, to deliver tons of supplies, including food, clothing, and medicine to flood-affected areas in Tamaulipas. In the weeks after the storm, many residents had minimal food access, and some areas remained flooded. Conditions in Tampico, located near where the storm moved ashore, gradually returned to normal. Heavy rainfall in Mexico restored reservoirs, which assisted future crop growing.|$|E
5|$|The Diocese of Miami {{was created}} on October 7, 1958, with Coleman Carroll {{installed}} as bishop. The diocese included the 16 southern counties in Florida, with a Catholic population of 200,000. It encompassed {{one half of}} the area of the state. Less than a year after the creation of the diocese, Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba. This set off a mass exodus of <b>Cuban</b> <b>exiles</b> to South Florida, increasing church membership in the region. The Catholic Welfare Bureau, created by Carroll, played a significant part in helping these waves of Cuban immigrants. Between 1960 and 1962, 14,000 Cuban children were sent to the United States. Operation Pedro Pan, created by Monsignor Bryan O. Walsh, placed them with friends, relatives or the Catholic Welfare Bureau. In 1996, the Catholic Welfare Bureau changed its name to Catholic Charities. Today it claims to be the largest non-governmental provider of social services in South Florida. It served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Dade and Monroe counties in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) {{was held}} in Havana, where Castro was {{selected}} as NAM president, a position he held till 1982. In his capacity as both President of the NAM and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1979 and gave a speech on the disparity between the world's rich and poor. His speech was greeted with much applause from other world leaders, though his standing in NAM was damaged by Cuba's abstinence from the U.N.'s General Assembly condemnation of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Cuba's relations across North America improved under Mexican President Luis Echeverría, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some <b>Cuban</b> <b>exiles</b> to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents. Conversely, his relationship with China declined, as he accused Deng Xiaoping's Chinese government of betraying their revolutionary principles by initiating trade links with the U.S. and attacking Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|The first post-Revolution Cuban {{dance music}} genre was the short-lived, but highly {{influential}} mozambique (1963). Neither the dance, nor the music caught on outside of Cuba.

Although the two rhythms share no parts in common, the band received death threats because some right wing <b>Cuban</b> <b>exiles</b> thought Palmieri's band was playing contemporary Cuban music.|$|E
25|$|The salsa {{controversy}} is also {{closely tied to}} the decades-long estrangement between the governments of the United States and Cuba, and the United States embargo against Cuba.

For a time the Cuban state media officially claimed that the term salsa music was a euphemism for authentic Cuban music stolen by American imperialists, though the media has since abandoned this theory.|$|E

The plan was launched in April 1961, {{less than three months}} after John F. Kennedy assumed the presidency in the United States. The Cuban armed forces, trained and equipped by Eastern Bloc nations, defeated the exile combatants in three days.
