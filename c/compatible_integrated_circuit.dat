40|$|Abstract — A {{new method}} for dry etching of silicon dioxide for surface {{micromachining}} {{is presented to}} obtain very compliant polysilicon microstructures with negligible stiction problem and to greatly simplify the overall releasing procedure as well. By etching the sacrificial silicon dioxide with hydrofluoric acid (HF) vapor instead of conventional aqueous HF solution, the need for subsequent rinsing and an elaborate drying procedure is eliminated. Condensation {{of water on the}} etch surface is first identified as the cause that prevented the success of HF vapor release in the past. Use of an anhydrous HF/CH 3 OH mixture under low pressure solves the problem of water condensation and enables us to take advantage of vapor-phase etching (VPE) for surface micromachining. The mechanism of oxide etching with the HF/CH 3 OH mixture is explained, and the developed VPE system is described and characterized. Polysilicon cantilevers up to 1200 m in length are successfully released with this HF VPE technique. The beams tested are 2 m thick with a 2 -m gap from the substrate, and no antistiction dimples are used. The fabricated structures are observed using both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and an optical profilometer.

In a typical piezoelectric energy harvester, a piezoelectric material {{is attached to a}} rigid structure, such as a silicon cantilever, and a proof mass located at the free end of the cantilever is coupled with an induced vibration. The transducer combined with a mechanical resonator converts the kinetic energy of the proof mass to electrical energy via the piezoelectric material [3 – 7]. However, the typical rigid-body based cantilever type energy harvester has a large resonance frequency due to its high spring constant. Thus, it is not for harvesting energy from human activity or low frequency ambient vibration. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is probably the most popular material for flexible energy harvesting applications. However, PVDF has lower dielectric and piezoelectric properties than ceramics such as PZT. For flexible piezoelectric films based on ceramics, several approaches have been reported. Nunes-Pereira et al. reported a piezoelectric fiber composite based flexible energy harvester for wearable applications. Piezoelectric fiber composite (PFC) based devices presented a larger output than PVDF based ones [8]. Lin et al. presented a ZnO nano wire array based flexible nano generator by employing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [9]. Do et al. and Park et al. also demonstrated a ceramic based flexible piezoelectric film.

Among these prominent issues, transistors composed of nanoscale vacuum channels or known as the nanogap have been steadily attracting attentions [8 – 10]. Distinct from the early vacuum tubes with high-power consumption and difficulty for high integration, the nanogap structures are more prospective for the modern nanoelectronics. For conventional field effect transistors (FETs), the carriers may collide with the optical and acoustic phonons during the transport. Also, intrinsic graphene-based FETs were found to have an on–off current ratio less than 10 due to the lack of a bandgap, which are not suitable for modern <b>integrated</b> logic <b>circuits.</b> Intrinsically, electrons could ballistically travel through the nanoscale vacuum channel while suffering from collision or scattering in the semiconductors. And the vacuum nano-devices could be compatible with standard silicon process and combine the advantages of ballistic transport with miniaturization and integration. Thus, the nanoscale vacuum channel transistors (NVCTs) may output high frequency [9, 11], on/off ratio [12], or fast temporal response [13] with low working voltage. More importantly, the NVCT is proved to retain the advantages of {{the traditional}} vacuum tubes that operate normally in the extreme conditions, like exposure of ionizing radiation or high temperature [8]. The development of manufacturing technology can open up enormous opportunities for creating nanoscale vacuum channel, which might be <b>compatible</b> with modern <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> (IC).|$|R
