5|$|St. Paul, Minnesota: in a store, Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), a life {{insurance}} salesman, purchases a {{paper and a}} lottery ticket and leaves. In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), who heads to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and entrails of a tea leaf reader, {{who was also a}} doll collector, have been found in her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive at the scene of that murder to help the local <b>cops,</b> <b>who</b> have recruited the help of a psychic, the eccentric Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker). Although the psychic delivers extremely vague clues, the cops are thoroughly impressed; both Scully and Mulder, however, are not, especially after Yappi diagnoses that it is Mulder—not Scully—who is a skeptic.|$|E
5|$|Verbal {{explains}} that, {{six weeks}} earlier in New York, {{he and the}} other criminals were arrested on supposedly a trumped-up hijacking charge, and decided to pull another heist to get back at the police. Led by Keaton, a former corrupt policeman, they robbed a group of corrupt <b>cops</b> <b>who</b> transported smugglers in a police convoy. They then went to California to fence the stolen jewels with a criminal named Redfoot, who turned them on to another jewel heist. The quarry turned out to be heroin, and the five had to shoot their way out. Soon after, a lawyer named Kobayashi tells them that Keyser Söze, a Turkish crime lord with a mythical reputation from whom all of the thieves had unwittingly stolen (including Hockney who hijacked the original truck six weeks earlier in New York), had offered them a job: invade a ship manned by a gang of Argentinian drug dealers whom Söze was competing with and destroy the $91 million worth of cocaine that they were transporting.|$|E
500|$|For his {{personal}} exhibition in March 2015 entitled [...] "Resisting Against Absurdity", Wong reunited pieces he created for previous protest marches and added new works: {{in particular the}} Black Cop Candle – a set of wax statues of policemen in riot gear and raised batons. These symbolise the seven [...] "black" [...] (meaning corrupt) <b>cops</b> <b>who</b> beat up a protester and who were caught on film so doing during the 2014 protests; lighting the candles would melt them and transform them into light.|$|E

500|$|Parker {{also said}} he and Stone {{purposely}} wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a [...] "humanist approach"; Clasquin said this is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} Jesus becomes caught up in people's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people bet against him: [...] "This satirical gesture beautifully draws attention to the sheer humanity of Jesus. He really is a man, just as we are men and women. He is open to fear and uncertainty." [...] Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way Americans can turn anything, even a religious situation, into a commercially hyped event. Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger said: [...] "They aren't making fun of organized religion (though they have in the past). They're making fun of those who would turn religion into entertainment and entertainment into a kind of religion." [...] Seitz said the episode mocks [...] "morality <b>cops</b> <b>who</b> misbehave in private" [...] like Priest Maxi, who secretly bets the parish against Jesus even as he admonished congregation members for siding with Satan.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, a {{television}} documentary entitled The Funny Life of Richard Pryor depicted Pryor's life and career. Broadcast in the UK {{as part of}} the Channel 4 series Kings of Black Comedy, it was produced, directed and narrated by David Upshal and featured rare clips from Pryor's 1960s stand-up appearances and movies such as Silver Streak (1976), Blue Collar (1978), [...] (1978), and Stir Crazy (1980). Contributors included George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Whoopi Goldberg, Ice-T, Paul Mooney, Joan Rivers, and Lily Tomlin. The show tracked down the two <b>cops</b> <b>who</b> had rescued Pryor from his [...] "freebasing incident", former managers, and even school friends from Pryor's home town of Peoria, Illinois. In the US, the show went out {{as part of the}} Heroes of Black Comedy series on Comedy Central, narrated by Don Cheadle.|$|E

2500|$|Giuliani gave much of {{the credit}} for a drop in 2001 crime to Kerik, saying that [...] "Commissioner Kerik took over a police {{department}} that was leading the country in crime declines, and somehow he was able {{to figure out how to}} create even more crime reduction and to do that against a national trend in which crime is going up in {{much of the}} rest of the country." [...] Known in the department as the [...] "beat-cop commissioner," [...] Kerik frequently cruised the city at night with a security detail composed of <b>cops</b> <b>who</b> had been in shootouts, dangled from rooftops, hit by bullets, raced into burning buildings, and seen their partners die. During his time as police commissioner he made five arrests, including one involving two ex-convicts—one a paroled killer, wanted for a carjacking at gunpoint in Virginia—for allegedly driving a stolen van in Harlem. As police commissioner, Kerik served on the terrorism committee with the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Criminal Justice Advisory Board for St. John's University.|$|E
