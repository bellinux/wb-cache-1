The distinctions between these three families may be easily remembered, and had better be learned before going farther; but first let us note their fellowship. They are all Oreiades, mountain plants; in specialty, they are all strong in stem, low in stature, and the Ericæ and Auroræ glorious in the flush of their infinitely exulting flowers, ("the rapture of the heath"--above spoken of, p. 96.) But all the essential loveliness of the Myrtillæ is in their leaves and fruit: the first always exquisitely finished and grouped like the most precious decorative work of sacred painting; the second, red or purple, like beads of coral or amethyst. Their minute flowers have rarely any general part or power in the colors of mountain ground; but, examined closely, they are one of the chief joys of the traveller's rest among the Alps; and full of exquisiteness unspeakable, in their several bearings and miens of blossom, so to speak. Plate VIII. represents, however feebly, the proud bending back of her head by Myrtilla Regina:[60] an action as beautiful in her as it is terrible in the Kingly Serpent of Egypt.|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} the possibility and the restrictions on prorogation of jurisdiction and electio legis about bond loans issued by Italian companies, aimed at istitutional investors operating in Europe. The bond loan, in the part where it regulates relations between bondholders and the Company – and hence, as regards the quorum and the roles assigned to bondholders’ meeting by art. 2415 c. c. - is governed by lex societatis. This {{is not the case}} for the <b>common</b> <b>representative</b> of the bondholders: his election, in fact, is not mandatory. However, the powers and functions granted and assigned to it by law, not olny do correspond to the interest of the bondholders but also to those of the Company. Therefore, if a representative of bondholders is appointed, he will be subject to the lex societatis: he will assume the tasks and the powers indicated by italian law, regardless of the governing law chosen by the parties. With regard to the questions concerning the validity of the decisions of the bondholders’ meeting and the powers and the duties conferred upon them the prorogation of jurisdiction and the derogation from italian law are unlawful. The English court seised has to decline jurisdiction because the matter is reserved to the italian exclusive jurisdiction and law.
