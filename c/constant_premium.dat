This contract expires early if a certain fixed drawup event occurs prior to the fixed drawdown. The last two contracts are extensions of the previous ones by an additional cancellation feature which allows the investor to terminate the contract earlier. We focus on two problems: calculating the fair premium p for the basic contracts and identifying the optimal stopping rule for the policies with the cancellation feature. To do this we solve some two-sided exit problems related to drawdown and drawup of spectrally negative Lévy processes, which is of independent mathematical interest. We also heavily rely on the theory of optimal stopping...|$|E
40|$|The {{expectations}} {{theory of}} the term structure of interest rates states that the yields on financial assets of different maturities are related primarily by market expectations of future yields. The expectations theory has occupied a prominent place in both theoretical and policy debates at various times. However, extensive empirical work in the United States has soundly rejected the joint (testable) hypothesis of the expectations theory and zero (or a <b>constant)</b> risk <b>premium.</b> The aim {{of this paper is}} to test this joint hypothesis against Australian short-term interest rate data for the period since the introduction of the tender system for the sale of Treasury notes in 1979. The sample period chosen is interesting for a number of reasons. First, the market has had a greater influence on the determination of interest rates since the introduction of the tender system. Second, there was a major structural change in the Australian financial system with the floating of the Australian Dollar in 1983. This provides scope to test for the impact of policy or institutional changes on the expectations theory. The paper finds that the joint hypothesis of the expectations theory and zero (or a <b>constant</b> risk <b>premium),</b> cannot be rejected in this period. Furthermore, this joint hypothesis cannot be rejected in the period before or after the introduction of the float. There is however, evidence of parameter instability across the pre- and post-float periods. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{estimates}} {{currency risk}} premia for the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Three different approaches are applied: a <b>constant</b> <b>premium</b> approach based on rational expectations, while time-varying premia are estimated with a method using financial market analysts' surveys {{and also with}} a Kalman filter technique. A novelty in this paper is a crosscheck based on the three different approaches applied and also making use of implied and historical volatilities. The results highlight the importance of such a crosscheck: {{in the case of}} the Czech and the Slovak koruna and the Polish zloty this exercise reveals severe problems with the results, which otherwise would not have been discovered. On the other hand, the estimation methods produce convincing results for the Hungarian forint. The estimated Hungarian premium series reflect the major events that intuitively may have shaped currency risk in the country. A possible reason for these findings is a high signal-to-noise ratio in the case of Hungary where the risk premium has been large and exhibited substantial shifts through time. Finally, the strong comovement of the premium series obtained with the Kalman-filter and the survey data for the Hungarian forint also indicates that the survey expectations are largely in line with both the riskpremium- extended UIP and the rational expectations hypothesis, which is theoretically important as the UIP relates exchange rate expectations to the interest rate differential...|$|E

We restrict ourselves to the case where the claim size is heavy-tailed, i. e. the equilibrium distribution function (e. d. f.) of the claim size belongs to a wide subclass (denoted A) of subexponential distributions. Two-sided estimates for the ruin probability are developed by reduction from the classical model without interest force. Discussions on the class A are given. The classical risk model with homogenous Poisson arrival process, <b>constant</b> <b>premium</b> rate and constant interest force has been investigated by many authors such as Sundt & Teugels (1995, 1997), Asmussen (1998), Kl-uppelberg & Stadtm-uller (1998) and Kalashnikov & Konstantinides (2000). In the present work, we propose two-sided bounds for the ruin probability in this model. The well-known inequalities in the classical risk model without interest force enable us to derive accurate two-sided estimates. The idea of the reduction is not new, but only recently this method became effective as the necessary tools has been accumulated. This approach is also applicable to {{the investigation of the}} convergence rate of the ruin probability approximations (see Kalashnikov & Tsitsiashvili (1999, 2000) and Mikosch & Nagaev (2000)).
