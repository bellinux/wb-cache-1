40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of VR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) in-car and in-motion for the first time. Immersive HMDs are {{becoming}} everyday consumer items and, as they offer new possibilities for entertainment and productivity, {{people will want to}} use them during travel in, for example, autonomous cars. However, their use is confounded by motion sickness caused in-part by the restricted visual perception of motion conflicting with physically perceived vehicle motion (accelerations/rotations detected by the vestibular system). Whilst VR HMDs restrict visual perception of motion, they could also render it virtually, potentially alleviating sensory conflict. To study this problem, we conducted the first on-road and in motion study to systematically investigate the effects of various visual presentations of the real-world motion of a <b>car</b> on the <b>sickness</b> and immersion of VR HMD wearing passengers. We established new baselines for VR in-car motion sickness, and found that there is no one best presentation with respect to balancing sickness and immersion. Instead, user preferences suggest different solutions are required for differently susceptible users to provide usable VR in-car. This work provides formative insights for VR designers and an entry point for further research into enabling use of VR HMDs, and the rich experiences they offer, when travelling...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Vehicle motion {{characteristics}} differ between air, road, and sea environments, both vestibularly and visually. Effects {{of vision}} on motion sickness {{have been studied}} before, though less systematically in a naval setting. It is hypothesized that appropriate visual information on self-motion is beneficial in a naval setting and that task performance is likely reduced as sickness increases. Methods: Using a within-subjects design, 24 subjects were exposed to 30 min of motion in a ship's bridge motion simulator with 3 visual conditions: an Earth-fixed outside view; an inside view that moved with the subjects; and a blindfolded condition. Subjective sickness symptoms and severity were rated repeatedly before, during, and after motion exposure. During the motion, subjects performed a mental task. Results: Though not excessive, sickness was highest in the inside viewing condition, intermediate in the outside viewing condition, and least in the blindfolded condition. The blind-folded condition was equally {{as bad as the}} inside viewing condition during the first 5 - 10 min of motion exposure. The overall temporal increase of sickness during motion was about equal to the decrease during recovery. No effect of sickness on task performance was observed. Discussion: Most sickness in a naval setting is observed when the visual environment moves with the subjects, as has been reported in other environments, such as <b>cars.</b> Only mild <b>sickness,</b> caused by moderate motions, was provoked in this study and was alleviated by the performance task. A non-linear brain mechanism integrating visual and vestibular information may explain why the least sickness was observed when subjects were blindfolded...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} commercial movies showing three dimensional (3 D) images has raised concern about possible adverse side effects on viewers. Methods and Findings: A prospective carryover observational {{study was designed}} to assess the effect of exposure (3 D vs. 2 D movie views) on self reported symptoms of visually induced motion sickness. The standardized Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was self administered on a convenience sample of 497 healthy adult volunteers before and after the vision of 2 D and 3 D movies. Viewers reporting some sickness (SSQ total score. 15) were 54. 8 % of the total sample after the 3 D movie compared to 14. 1 % of total sample after the 2 D movie. Symptom intensity was 8. 8 times higher than baseline after exposure to 3 D movie (compared to the increase of 2 times the baseline after the 2 D movie). Multivariate modeling of visually induced motion sickness as response variables pointed out the significant effects of exposure to 3 D movie, history of <b>car</b> <b>sickness</b> and headache, after adjusting for gender, age, self reported anxiety level, attention to the movie and show time. Conclusions: Seeing 3 D movies can increase rating of symptoms of nausea, oculomotor and disorientation, especially in women with susceptible visual-vestibular system. Confirmatory studies which include examination of clinical signs on viewers are needed to pursue a conclusive evidence on the 3 D vision effects on spectators...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} commercial movies showing three dimensional (3 D) computer generated images has raised concern about image safety and possible side effects on population health. This study aims to (1) quantify {{the occurrence of}} visually induced symptoms suffered by the spectators during and after viewing a commercial 3 D movie and (2) to assess individual and environmental factors associated to those symptoms. Methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out using a paper based, self administered questionnaire. The questionnaire includes individual and movie characteristics and selected visually induced symptoms (tired eyes, double vision, headache, dizziness, nausea and palpitations). Symptoms were queried at 3 different times: during, right after and after 2 [*]hours from the movie. Results We collected 953 questionnaires. In our sample, 539 (60. 4 %) individuals reported 1 or more symptoms during the movie, 392 (43. 2 %) right after and 139 (15. 3 %) at 2 [*]hours from the movie. The most frequently reported symptoms were tired eyes (during the movie by 34. 8 %, right after by 24. 0 %, after 2 [*]hours by 5. 7 % of individuals) and headache (during the movie by 13. 7 %, right after by 16. 8 %, after 2 [*]hours by 8. 3 % of individuals). Individual history for frequent headache was associated with tired eyes (OR[*]=[*] 1. 34, 95 %CI[*]=[*] 1. 01 - 1. 79), double vision (OR[*]=[*] 1. 96; 95 %CI[*]=[*] 1. 13 - 3. 41), headache (OR[*]=[*] 2. 09; 95 %CI[*]=[*] 1. 41 - 3. 10) during the movie and of headache after the movie (OR[*]=[*] 1. 64; 95 %CI[*]=[*] 1. 16 - 2. 32). Individual susceptibility to <b>car</b> <b>sickness,</b> dizziness, anxiety level, movie show time, animation 3 D movie were also associated to several other symptoms. Conclusions The high occurrence of visually induced symptoms resulting from this survey suggests the need of raising public awareness on possible discomfort that susceptible individuals may suffer {{during and after the}} vision of 3 D movies. </p...|$|E
