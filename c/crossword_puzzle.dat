METHODS: <b>Crossword</b> <b>puzzles</b> were designed with a free online tool and distributed in five kinesiology classes during library instruction sessions. Students completed the puzzles as a homework. Feedback from students was solicited in writing on {{the back side of the}} <b>crossword</b> <b>puzzles.</b> RESULTS: The <b>crossword</b> <b>puzzles</b> were completed by a total of 64 students, which yielded a response rate of 63 % of the total of 101 students enrolled in all five classes. Nearly one third of students submitted written feedback on this activity. They indicated that <b>crossword</b> <b>puzzles</b> were a fun way to review resources available through the libraries and wished to have more of them in other classes. Only a few students found the <b>crossword</b> <b>puzzles</b> challenging and time consuming but a few others liked the challenge and worked with a friend. CONCLUSIONS: When hunting for the answers, students perceived that this assignment prompted them to consult the handouts distributed in class in addition to exploring the library’s web site. Using <b>crossword</b> <b>puzzles</b> is a creative way to reinforce material covered in library instruction classes...|$|R
