5000|$|There {{have been}} a variety of criticisms of this treaty, {{including}} {{that it is too}} broad (for example in its prohibition <b>of</b> <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> technical protection <b>measures,</b> even where such circumvention is used in the pursuit of legal and fair use rights) and that it applies a [...] "one size fits all" [...] standard to all signatory countries despite widely differing stages of economic development and knowledge industry.|$|R
40|$|Digitisation had a {{profound}} impact on the creation, reproduction, and dissemination of works protected by copyright. Works in digital format are vulnerable to infringement, and technological protection measures are accordingly applied as protection. Technological protection measures can, however, easily be circumvented, and additional legal protection against circumvention was needed. Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (the WCT) obliges Member States to provide adequate legal protection against the <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> technological <b>measures</b> applied to works protected by copyright. Contracting parties must refine the provisions of Article 11 and provide for exceptions on the prohibition. Article 11 does not specify whether it pertains to only certain types <b>of</b> technological <b>measures,</b> nor does it prohibit the trafficking in circumvention devices. The United States implemented the provisions of Article 11 of the WCT through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the DMCA). Section 1201 of the DMCA prohibits the <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> technological <b>measures.</b> It is detailed and relates to two categories <b>of</b> technological <b>measures</b> - access control and copy control. It prohibits not only the act <b>of</b> <b>circumvention,</b> but also the trafficking in circumvention devices. Article 6 of the EC Directive on the Harmonisation of Certain Aspects of Copyright and Related Rights in the Information Society of 2001 implements Article 11 of the WCT. Article 6 seeks to protect Aeffective technological measures@. It prohibits both the act <b>of</b> <b>circumvention</b> and circumvention devices. Although Article 11 of the WCT is silent on the issue of access control, it seems as if the international trend is to provide legal protection to access controls, thus indirectly creating a right to control access. South Africa has not yet implemented Article 11 of the WCT. The South African Copyright Act of 1979 does not protect technological protection measures. The Electronic Communications and Transactions Act of 2002 (the ECT Act) provides protection against the <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> technological protection <b>measures</b> applied to digital data. The definition of Adata@ is such that it could include protected works. If applied to protected works, the anti-circumvention provisions of the ECT Act would be detrimental to user privileges. As developing country, it seems to be in South Africa's best interest to the implement the provisions of Article 11 in such a manner that it still allows users access to and legitimate use of works protected by copyright.

50|$|According to Raymond, hackers {{from the}} {{programmer}} subculture usually work openly {{and use their}} real name, while computer security hackers prefer secretive groups and identity-concealing aliases. Also, their activities in practice are largely distinct. The former focus on creating new and improving existing infrastructure (especially the software environment they work with), while the latter primarily and strongly emphasize the general act <b>of</b> <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> security <b>measures,</b> with the effective use of the knowledge (which can be to report and help fixing the security bugs, or exploitation reasons) being only rather secondary.

50|$|Any <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> {{technical}} protection <b>measures</b> {{designed to}} protect a copyrighted work is unlawful, even if the action was not {{for the purpose of}} copyright infringement. The marketing and distribution of products meant to breach technical protection measures is also unlawful. Exceptions exist in situations when the circumvention is for the purposes of accessibility, encryption research, privacy and security testing, reverse engineering to achieve software compatibility (if it is not already possible to do so without breaching TPMs), the creation of temporary recordings by broadcasters, and for law enforcement and national security purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the section}} (in the same book) {{pertaining}} to the [...] "(r)egulation <b>of</b> the <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> technological <b>measures</b> such as copy protection, etc.", it is stated that [...] "transfer to the public (of) the ownership of, and manufacture, etc. of, the devices to circumvent technological measures (e.g., copy protection), which prevent copying of videogram (sic) or music CD without authorization, are regulated by the (sic) criminal penalty" [...] (Japan Copyright Office 2001, 32). It is quite clear that with this regulation, it becomes impossible to circumvent the copyright-protection of intellectual property {{in the context of}} fair use. This means that when a CD, etc. is copyright-protected, there is not only technically no space for fair use, but also from the legislative side, there is no support for copying in the context of fair use.|$|R

40|$|Scientists {{who study}} {{encryption}} or computer security or otherwise reverse engineer technical measures, who make tools {{enabling them to}} do this work, and who report {{the results of their}} research face new risks of legal liability because of recently adopted rules prohibiting the <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> technical <b>measures</b> and manufacture or distribution <b>of</b> <b>circumvention</b> tools.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the definition of 'Technological Protection Measure' {{and the meaning of}} 'Effective Technological Measure' (ETM) in Article 17. 4. 7 of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA).

Title I of the DMCA implemented provisions relating to World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties signed in 1996 (as part of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations). These provisions established two new prohibitions under Federal Copyright Law [...] one on <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> technological <b>measures</b> used by copyright owners to protect their works and one on tampering with copyright management information [...] and adds civil remedies and criminal penalties for violating the prohibitions. (This portion of the DMCA is called the "WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act of 1998 ".) Of the two provisions, the anti-circumvention provisions have been extremely controversial. In part because of this, the limitations on liability provisions have gone relatively unnoticed.

40|$|Many {{research}} {{studies have been}} done to explain the reasons for the tensions and failures observed in joint ventures between Japanese and Western multinational enterprises. These studies have identified, with various degrees of sophistication, the existence of cultural differences as a primary determinant of failure. Alternative xplanations focus upon a transaction cost approach, emphasising opportunism and the danger of cheating in such strategic alliances, This paper synthesises the literature through {{the development of a new}} conceptual framework. This framework, which distinguishes between economic and cul-tural reasons for failure, provides a new lens to view the literature. It is demonstrated that the simple view of cultural incompatibility needs to be replaced by an awareness of the combined impact of cultural and economic fbrces on the viability of joint ventures between Japanese and Western firms. JAPANESE AND WESTERN JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS Since the 1960 s, joint ventures between firms of two different nationalities have increased dramatically, particularly between horizontally-related firms (Hergert and Morris, 1988; Harrigan, 1988). American and European multina-tional enterprises (MNEs) have begun to link up with Japanese firms for joint ventures in the non-Japanese partner's home country, a significant departure from the previous trend, in which most transnational cooperative ventures with a Japanese partner were based in Japan.

40|$|The recent {{decision}} of the Italian Supreme Court seems to put to an end the judicial saga of the Playstation’s “mod chip” in Italy. The Italian Supreme Court has eventually found the producer of mod chip (the equipment capable of circumventing Sony’s technological protection measure) liable under art. 171 -ter, lett. f-bis), Italian Copyright Law, implementing the provision codified at art. 6 (2), of the Information Society Directive. According to the Court, since videogames cannot be classified as mere software, the circumvention at issue had to be assessed in light of such provision encompassing a stronger burden of proof to be met by defendants. However, not much {{attention has been paid}} to the circumstance that the mod chip allowed <b>circumvention</b> <b>of</b> a <b>measure</b> placed on the console rather than the videogame itself. This fact may prove to be a crucial aspect in the analysis because the elusion <b>of</b> technological protection <b>measures</b> placed on software is disciplined by a different provision bearing a lighter burden of proof for defendants to rebut an initial finding of liability. In fact, in the latter case they only need to prove that other uses exist of the technology they produce that are not infringing. Because today many firms active in more than one market use TPMs to technically bundle together two (or more) products, exploiting the circumstance that at least one of them is protected by copyright, the Italian Supreme Court decision may turn quite problematic in its effects. In fact, while surely strengthening copyright owners’ position, especially in digital markets, it may also provide them the power to unduly distort competition in neighboring markets...|$|R
