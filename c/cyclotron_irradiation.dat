40|$|Development of {{chemical}} separations for the transactinides {{has traditionally been}} performed with longer-lived tracer activities purchased commercially. With these long-lived tracers, {{there is always the}} potential problem that the tracer atoms are not always in the same chemical form as the short-lived atoms produced in on-line experiments. This problem is especially severe for elements in groups 4 and 5 of the periodic table, where hydrolysis is present. The long-lived tracers usually are stored with a complexing agent to prevent sorption or precipitation. Chemistry experiments performed with these long-lived tracers are therefore not analogous to those chemical experiments performed in on-line experiments.

40|$|The LLNL {{heavy element}} {{group has been}} {{investigating}} the chemical properties of the heaviest elements {{over the past several}} years. The properties of the transactinides (elements with Z > 103) are often unknown due to their low production rates and short half-lives, which require lengthy <b>cyclotron</b> <b>irradiations</b> in order to make enough atoms for statistically significant evaluations of their chemistry. In addition, automated chemical methods are often required to perform consistent and rapid chemical separations on the order of minutes {{for the duration of the}} experiment, which can last from weeks to months. Separation methods can include extraction chromatography, liquid-liquid extraction, or gas-phase chromatography. Before a lengthy transactinide experiment can be performed at an accelerator, a large amount of preparatory work must be done both to ensure the successful application of the chosen chemical system to the transactinide chemistry problem being addressed, and to evaluate the behavior of the lighter elemental homologs in the same chemical system. Since transactinide chemistry is literally performed on one single atom, its chemical properties cannot be determined from bulk chemical matrices, but instead must be inferred from the behavior of the lighter elements that occur in its chemical group and in those of its neighboring elements. By first studying the lighter group homologs in a particular chemical system, when the same system is applied to the transactinide element under investigation, its decay properties can be directly compared to those of the homologues, thereby allowing an inference of its own chemistry. The Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (CAMS) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) includes a 1 MV Tandem accelerator, capable of accelerating light ions such as protons to energies of roughly 15 MeV. By using the CAMS beamline, tracers of transactinide homolog elements can be produced both for development of chemical systems and for evaluation of homolog chemical properties. CAMS also offers an environment for testing these systems 'online' by incorporating automated chemical systems into the beamline so that tracers can be created, transported, and chemically separated all on the shorter timescales required for transactinide experiments. Even though CAMS is limited in the types and energies of ions they can accelerate, there are still a wide variety of reactions that can be performed there with commercially available target materials. The half-lives of these isotopes vary over a range that could be used for both online chemistry (where shorter half-lives are required) and benchtop tracers studies (where longer lived isotopes are preferred). In this document, they present a summary of tracer production reactions that could be performed at CAMS, specifically for online, automated chemical studies. They are from chemical groups four through seven, 13, and 14, which would be appropriate for studies of elements 104 - 107, 113, and 114. Reactions were selected that had (a) commercially available target material, (b) half-lives long enough for transport from a target chamber to an automated chemistry system, and (c) cross-sections at CAMS available projectile energies that were large enough to produce enough atoms to result in a statistically relevant signal after losses for transport and chemistry were considered.

Radioimmunotherapy labeled with alpha-particle {{is expected to be}} very useful for the treatment of monocellular cancer (e. g. leukemia) and micrometastasis at an early stage, residual tumor remained in tissues after chemotherapy and tumor resection, due to the high linear energy transfer (LET) and the short path length in biological tissue of alpha particle.

Previously published investigations of high specific activity 186 Re production have utilized the 186 W(p,n) 186 Re or 186 W(d, 2 n) 186 Re reactions 2 - 5. Our group is interested in the refinement and scale-up of the production of high specific activity 186 Re by <b>cyclotron</b> <b>irradiations</b> of 186 W with deuterons; including investigations of the most suitable target material. WO 3 has been successfully used as a target material in proton irradiations by two other groups 4, 5. Further, the physical properties of WO 3, such as the reported monoclinic with Pc space group, body centered cubic crystal structure 6 and melting point of 1473 °C, made for an attractive target material as sintered and other more structurally robust pressed pellet target preparations could be explored. Thus, this study reports on the characterization and suitability of WO 3 as a full-thickness target material for the deuteron production of 186 Re. Materials and Methods Assessments of WO 3 for target material suitability and structural integrity were made on thick targets (~ 1 g) prepared using both commercially available and converted WO 3 by either uniaxially pressing (13. 8 MPa) of powdered WO 3 into an aluminum target support or by placing sintered WO 3 pellets (1105 °C for 12 hours) into an aluminum target support. In some experiments, WO 3 pellets were prepared by dissolution of Wmetal with H 2 O 2, then treatment with 1. 5 M HCl. The recovered hydrated WO 3 was calcinated at 800 °C for 4 hours, allowed to cool to ambient temperature, pulverized with a mortar and pestle, uniaxially pressed at 13. 8 MPa into pellets with a 13 mm die, and subsequently sintered in a tube furnace under flowing Ar at 1105 °C for 3, 6, and 12 hours. Material characterization and product composition analyses were conducted with SEM, EDS, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and visible photoluminescence spectroscopy. Thick WO 3 targets were irradiated for 10 min at 10 µA with nominal extracted deuteron energies of 17 MeV. Gamma-ray spectroscopy was per-formed to assess production yields and radionuclidic byproducts at least 24 hours post EOB. Results While the color of the commercially available WO 3 is slightly different (dull, pale green) than the brighter more yellow color of the chemically processed WO 3, X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD) indicated the two samples were virtually identical. Attempts to determine how the duration of the sintering process (at 1105 °C) affects the chemical/physical nature of the pellet yielded surprising results. In contrast to the characteristic annealed appearance of sintered material, grains of the WO 3 sample appeared more densely packed, but not sintered to one another as had been seen during higher temperature (1550 °C) reductions of WO 3 irrespective of the time interval used. Full-thickness pressed or sintered pellets of WO 3 were found to disintegrate upon irradiation with the deuteron beam, allowing for the direct irradiation of the aluminum target body producing 24 Na as a contaminant. Upon retrieval of the target support it was observed that the WO 3 had vaporized, discoloring the surface of the well in the target support and coating the walls of ~ 61 cm (24 inches) of the terminal portion of the beamline, which then required decontamination. We believe that these observations are the result of outgassing oxygen species that subsequently reacted with the aluminum target support. While these findings are in sharp contrast with the successful production yields and isolations previously reported by both Shigeta et al. and Fassbender et al., we believe that these differences are attributable to differences in target design (previous studies utilized an en-closed target with cooling in front of and behind the target) necessitated by the configuration of our target station. Conclusions. The physical properties of powdered WO 3, including its lower melting point and more suitable compressibility than powdered Wmetal, seemed to enhance the structural integrity of a WO 3 pellet (whether pressed or sintered). However, when compared to our recent successes with the use of Wmetal based targets, the disappointing degradation of our WO 3 targets when irradiated with the incident deuteron beam has led us to believe that Wmetal is the more viable target material for 186 Re production in our facility...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of radiopharmacy and {{molecular}} imaging, the concept of theranostics entails a therapy-accompanying diagnosis {{with the aim of}} a patient-specific treatment. Using the adequate diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, the disease and the state of the disease are verified for an individual patient. The other way around, it verifies that the radiopharmaceutical in hand represents a target-specific and selective molecule: the “best one” for that individual patient. Transforming diagnostic imaging into quantitative dosimetric information, the optimum radioactivity (expressed in maximum radiation dose to the target tissue and tolerable dose to healthy organs) of the adequate radiotherapeutical is applied to that individual patient. This theranostic approach in nuclear medicine is traced back to the first use of the radionuclide pair 86 Y/ 90 Y, which allowed a combination of PET and internal radiotherapy. Whereas the β-emitting therapeutic radionuclide 90 Y (t½ = 2. 7 d) had been available for a long time via the 90 Sr/ 90 Y generator system, the β+ emitter 86 Y (t½ = 14. 7 h) had to be developed for medical application.

In vitro evaluation of labelled products showed that binding properties were retained at present reaction conditions. In short term therapy of 211 At-MOv 18 in mice with occult intraperitoneal human metastases (NIH:OVCAR- 3 cells), 9 of 10 animals were apparently free of tumour after treatment given intraperitoneally. The distribution of modified polymers in tumour-free mice revealed fast whole-body clearance rates and tissue uptakes generally lower than that of labelled antibodies. Conclusions. 211 At-labelled tumour specific antibodies are effective in therapy of intraperitoneal human ovarian micro metastases xenograft in nude mice treated intraperitoneally. Improvement of pharmacokinetics, with enhanced therapeutic index, in the treatment of minimal residual disease may be achieved utilising a pretargeting strategy based upon a biotinylated, 211 At-labelled and charged modified poly-L-lysine effector molecule...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The Comecer ALCEO Metal {{system is}} {{intended}} to be a comprehensive solid targetry system, capable of all steps necessary to produce copper isotopes (60 Cu, 61 Cu & 64 Cu) from enriched nickel: plating, transfer to/from <b>cyclotron,</b> <b>irradiation,</b> and dissolution/purification. To develop plating and chemistry methods, we plate natural nickel, and irradiate with deuterons to produce 61 Cu. This alleviates the need for expensive enriched nickel isotopes, but gives a lower activity yield. We report a few issues with the ALCEO system, and some of our modifications. Material and Methods BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The ALCEO system uses cylindrical shuttles (dia 28 mm, height 35 mm) comprised of an Al body with a Pt well, onto which the Ni is plated. Shuttles are transferred pneumatically from the hot cell to the irradiation module, {{on the end of the}} cyclotron beamline. The plating and dissolution are both done at the electrochemical cell, located in the hot cell. This cell is connected by capillary tubes to the electrolytic solution reservoir (for plating), or the acid reservoir (for dissolution). These tubes form a recirculation loop, through which the fluid is propelled by an inline micropump throughout plating and dissolution. The platinum well is 16 mm in diameter, while an O-ring is used to plate only the center (6 mm in diameter). A constant DC voltage is applied. PLATING: We dissolve natural nickel nitrate (99. 999 % pure) into an electrolytic solution comprised of deionized water, ammonium hydroxide and ammonium chloride (pH = 9. 3). We use 30 – 100 mg of natNi in a 10 mg/mL solution. We have varied the ALCEO electrochemical cell voltage between 2. 25 – 3 VDC, and tried to maintain a low pump flow rate between 1 – 2 mL/min. The electrochemical cell uses a fixed metal tube as the anode (~ 3 mm above the plating surface). This tube also delivers the electrolytic plating solution to the Pt surface, forming part of the recirculating loop. The Pt surface is in contact with a gold-plated cathode. Due to issues discussed below, we have built a custom plating rig for the ALCEO shuttles, which does not use the pump/recirculation loop, but leaves the reservoir of electrolytic solution in place, atop the plating surface. A graphite rod is used for the anode, rotating offcenter ~ 2 mm above the plating surface. We use the same size O-ring to plate only the center 6 mm of the Pt surface, and apply a constant DC voltage. TRANSFER TO/FROM CYCLOTRON: The pneumatic transfer tube is 50 ft long between the hot cell and the cyclotron vault, and has a rise of 14 ft from under the floor to the ceiling of the cyclotron vault. IRRADIATION: The ALCEO irradiation module holds the plating surface orthogonal to the beam path. The module has a 10 -mil-thick (0. 010 ”) Al front foil, supported by a hex-grid. Once we realized the thickness, we replaced this with a 1 -mil-thick Al foil, followed by a 1 -mil-thick Havar foil. The foil is cooled by a flow of helium, while the shuttle and grid are cooled by a flow of water. The helium and water are cooled in heat ex-changers by chilled water. As initially plumbed, the chilled water flowed through the heat ex-changers in series, cooling the helium first, then the water. After initial runs, we plumbed the heat exchangers in parallel, teeing the chilled water to the supply of each heat exchanger, and teeing the returns together. Irradiation is performed with a PETtrace 800 accelerating deuterons to 8. 4 MeV on target. The beam current limit is 20 μA for the ALCEO Metal target. A set point of 19 μA is used to avoid the system tripping off. DISSOLUTION/PURIFICATION: The ALCEO system circulates 5 mL of 6 M HCl, while heating the shuttle to 100 ⁰C for 40 min. This solution is loaded onto a column containing 10 g of 200 – 400 mesh chromatographic resin in chloride form. A separation is performed yielding three solutions: The column is washed with 40 mL of 6 M HCl to obtain the Recovered Nickel Solution, then 20 mL of 4 M HCl to obtain the Cobalt Solution, then 10 mL of 0. 5 M HCl to obtain the Cop-per Product Solution. Results and Conclusion PLATING: Using the ALCEO method, the platings obtained had a tendency to mound, (up to 0. 75 mm thick for 50 mg) giving a lower density of 3 – 4 g/cm 3. This was attributed to the anode tube being fixed in place over the center of the plating surface. Using the custom rig, almost no mounding was observed, (0. 25 mm thick for 50 mg) giving a density of 7 g/cm 3, closer to nickel’s nominal density of 8. 9 g/cm 3. FIGS. 1 and 2 attempt to show the mounding from the ALCEO method, and relative flatness from the custom rig. Both methods give a rough, or “fuzzy” plated surface. FIG. 2 shows that the custom rig exaggerates this “fuzziness”. Using the ALCEO method, a slower pump speed (~ 1 mL/min) gives a smoother plating surface, but the pump has a tendency to lock up at this lower set point, stalling the plating. Using the ALCEO method, slight increases in the voltage (2. 65 V instead of 2. 25 V), can form thin stalagmites of nickel, electrically connecting the anode and the plating surface, ending the chance for a useable plating. Using the custom rig, no stalagmites are seen, adjusting the voltage from 2. 3 to 3. 0 V. This leads to the potential for a faster plating. Both the ALCEO method and the custom rig have obtained plating efficiencies of 95 %. TRANSFER TO/FROM CYCLOTRON: The shuttle typically transfers without issue in < 15 seconds. Once or twice it has remained in the transfer tube, but been retrieved by cycling the com-pressed air/vacuum a couple of times. IRRADIATION: During initial testing, the temperature of the return water rose rapidly during irradiation. This was attributed to the chilled water already gaining heat from the helium heat exchanger. Once the parallel chilled water plumbing was implemented, the water temperature rose much more slowly. Initial testing with the 10 -mil Al foils gave a very poor activity yield. The 1 -mil Al foil ruptured under the 20 psi helium pressure before beam was applied. The 1 -mil Havar foil produced 1. 57 mCi of 61 Cu at EOB, giving an activity yield of 0. 308 mCi/μAh (results summarized in TABLE 1). This compares to yields of 1. 4 obtained by [1], and 0. 29 obtained by [2] for deuterons on natNi. DISSOLUTION/PURIFICATION: The dissolution in 6 M HCl is close to 100 % efficient by weight. After purification, the three solutions were assayed by dose calibrator as summarized in TABLE 2. The purification is very efficient at removing the starting material, and long-lived Co isotopes from the Copper Product Solution, as seen with the 57 -hour EOB measurements. However, much of the desired 61 Cu is removed as well, with only 32 % remaining in the product. The lack of nuclide impurities in the Copper Product Solution was confirmed by gamma spectroscopy using a HP-Ge detector...|$|E

40|$|Rhenium- 186 has a {{half-life}} (t 1 / 2 = 3. 72 days) and {{emission of}} both gamma and beta particles {{that make it}} very attractive {{for use as a}} theranostic agent in targeted radionuclide therapy. 186 Re can be readily prepared by the 185 Re(n,γ) 186 Re reac-tion 1. However, that reaction results in low specific activity, severely limiting the use of reactor produced 186 Re in radiopharmaceuticals. It has previously been shown that high specific activity 186 Re can be produced by <b>cyclotron</b> <b>irradiations</b> of 186 W with protons and deuterons 2, 3. In this investigation we evaluated the 186 W(d, 2 n) 186 Re reaction using thick target irradiations at higher incident deuteron energies and beam currents than previously reported. We elected not to use copper or aluminum foils in the preparation of our 186 W targets due to their activation in the deuteron beam, so part of the investigation was an evaluation of an alternate method for preparing thick targets that withstand μA beam currents. Irradiation of 186 W. Initial thick targets (~ 600 - 1100 mg) were prepared using 96. 86 % enriched 186 W by hydraulic pressing (6. 9 MPa) of tungsten metal powder into an aluminum target support. Those thick targets were irradiated for 10 minu-tes at 10 µA with nominal extracted deuteron energies of 15, 17, 20, 22, and 24 MeV. Isolation of 186 Re. Irradiated targets were dissolved with H 2 O 2 and basified with (NH 4) 2 CO 3 prior to separation using column(s) of ~ 100 – 300 mg Analig Tc- 02 resin. Columns were washed with (NH 4) 2 CO 3 and the rhenium was eluted with ~ 80 ˚C H 2 O. Gamma-ray spectroscopy was per-formed to assess production yields, extraction yields, and radionuclidic byproducts. Recycling target material. When tested on a natural abundance W target, recovery of the oxidized WO 4 - target material from the resin was found to proceed rapidly with the addition of 4 M HCl in the form of hydrated WO 3. The excess water in the WO 3 was then removed by calcination at 800 °C for 4 hours. This material was found to undergo reduction to metallic W at elevated temperatures (~ 1550 °C) in a tube furnace under an inert atmosphere (Ar). Quanti-fication of % reduction and composition analyses were accomplished with SEM, EDS, and XRD and were used to characterize and compare both the WO 3 and reduced Wmetal products to a sample of commercially available material. Structural enhancement by surface annealing. In some experiments ~ 1 g WO 3 pellets were prepared from Wmetal that had been chemically treated to simulate the target material recovery process described above. Following calcination, the WO 3 was allowed to cool to ambient temperature, pulverized with a mortar and pestle and then uniaxially pressed at 13. 8 MPa into 13 mm pellets. Conversion of the WO 3 back to Wmetal in pellet form was accomplished in a tube furnace under flowing Ar at 1550 °C for 8 hours. Material characterization and product composition analyses were conducted with SEM, EDS, and XRD spectroscopy. Graphite-encased W targets. Irradiations were conducted at 20 μA with a nominal extracted deuteron energy of 17 MeV using thick targets (~ 750 mg) of natural abundance tungsten metal powder uniaxially pressed into an aluminum target support between layers of graphite pow-der (100 mg on top, 50 mg on the bottom). Targets were then dissolved as previously described and preliminary radiochemical isola-tion yields obtained by counting in a dose calibrator. Although irradiations of W targets were possible at 10 μA currents, difficulties were encountered in maintaining the structural integrity of the full-thickness pressed target pellets under higher beam currents. This led to further investigation of the target design for irradiations conducted at higher beam currents. Comprehensive target material characterization via analysis by SEM, EDS, XRD, and Raman Spectroscopy allowed for a complete redesign of the target maximizing the structural integrity of the pressed target pellet without impacting production or isolation. At the 10 A current, target mass loss following irradiation of an enriched 186 W target was < 1 % and typical separation yields in excess of 70 % were observed. Saturated yields and percent of both 183 Re (t½ = 70 days) and 184 gRe (t½ = 35 days) relative to 186 gRe (decay corrected to EOB) are reported in TABLE 1 below. The reason for the anomalously low yield at 24 MeV is unknown, but might be explained by poor beam alignment and/or rhenium volatility during irradiation. Under these irradiation conditions, recovery yields of the W target material from the recycling process were found to be in excess of 90 % with no discernable differences noted when compared to commercially available Wmetal and WO 3. Conceptually, increasing the structural integrity of pressed WO 3 targets by high temperature heat treatment under an inert atmosphere is intriguing. However, the treated pellets lacked both density and structural stability resulting in disintegration upon manipulation, despite the initially encouraging energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) determination that 94. 9 % percent of the WO 3 material in each pellet had been reduced to metallic W. The use of powdered graphite as a target stabi-lizing agent provided successful irradiation of natural abundance W under conditions where non-stabilized targets failed (20 µA at 17 MeV for 10 minutes). Target mass loss following irradiation of a natW target was < 1 % and a separation yield in excess of 97 % was obtained. In conclusion, the theranostic radionuclide 186 Re was produced in thick targets via the 186 W(d, 2 n) reaction. It was found that pressed W metal could be used for beam currents of 10 μA or less. For deuteron irradiations at higher beam currents, a method involving pressing W metal between two layers of graphite provides increased target stability. Both target configurations allow high recovery of radioactivity from the W target material, and a solid phase extraction method allows good recovery of 186 Re. An effective approach to the recycling of enriched W has been developed using elevated temperature under an inert atmosphere. Further studies are underway with 186 W targets sandwiched by graphite to assess 186 Re production yields, levels of contaminant radiorhenium, power deposition, and enriched 186 W material requirements under escalated irradiation conditions (20 µA and 17 MeV for up to 2 hours) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantities}} of positron emitting radionuclides used in medical diagnostics {{and the number}} of radiopharmaceutical production facilities have been estimated to be growing worldwide. In this field, an amount of these radionuclides might become airborne and escape into the environment during the process of production and/or during administration by hospital personnel. Therefore, the analysis of dose to the operating staff {{as well as to the}} public, due to releases through the stack, is a very important issue. To this end, sampling and measurement of radionuclide concentration in air released through the stack of a Nuclear Medicine Center (NMC), provided with a cyclotron for radiopharmaceuticals production, must be routinely carried out with an automatic measurement system. In this work is presented the analysis of the air concentration data recorded in “San Gaetano” NMC at Bagheria (Italy). The contaminated air at stack comes from <b>cyclotron</b> vault during <b>irradiation,</b> from Radiochemistry Laboratories during radiopharmaceuticals synthesis, from diagnostics room during medical scanning and other areas. Sampling of air was carried out continuously and gamma-ray spectrometric measurement are made on-line and for a short time by using a shielded Marinelli beaker filled with sampled air and a gamma detector. The use of this system allows to have 720 values per day from 2002, year of the start of operation with the cyclotron, until 2013. Therefore, the concentration values are very many and an analysis software is needed. The analysis allows either to determine the dose to the population and to evaluate possible improvements in the plant devices to reduce the air concentration at stack. Among engineered safety feature actuation systems, the provision of Air Compressing Stations (ACS), used for both hot cells and cyclotron vault releases, and a change in the position and height of the stack allow to ensure low level discharges from the stack and to reduce the dose to reference group of population. A comparison with the results of a simulation code based on a Gaussian Plume air dispersion modelling allow us to confirm the no-radiological significance of the stack effluent releases in terms of potential dose to population reference group, sited more than 100 m away from the plant...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{production}} and identification of isotopes of elements with atomic numbers {{up to six}} higher than the target element through bombardment with hexapositive 120 -Mev carbon ions made it seem worthwhile to apply this technique to the transuranium region. Accordingly, small pieces of natural uranium metal (about 0. 5 mil thick and 205 cm by 0. 6 cm area) were irradiated in the internal carbon ion beam in the Berkeley 60 -inch <b>cyclotron.</b> Following the <b>irradiations,</b> the uranium was dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid containing hydrogen peroxide and a transplutonium fraction was isolated {{through the use of}} lanthanum fluoride, and lanthanum hydroxide precipitation steps followed by the ion exchange adsorption column procedure in which concentrated hydrochloric acid is used to separate the tripositive actinide elements from the rare earth elements. The transplutonium fractions in hydrochloric acid were evaporated as weightless films on platinum plates which were placed in the ionization chamber of the 48 channel pulse analyzer apparatus in order to measure the yield and energies of any alpha-particles which might be present. In the best experiment at about one hour {{after the end of the}} 90 -minute bombardment, some 50 disintegrations per minute of the distinctive 7. 1 -Mev alpha-particles of Cf{sup 244 } were observed to be present and to decay with the 45 -minute half-life. The Cf{sup 244 } was presumably formed by the reaction U{sup 238 }(C{sup 12 }, 6 n). After the decay of the alpha-particles due to Cf{sup 244 }, about five disintegrations per minute of alpha-particles with 6. 8 -Mev energy was observed and this alpha-radioactivity decayed with a half-life of about 35 hours. A consideration of the systematics of alpha-radioactivity leads us to the view that this activity is due to the new isotope Cf{sup 246 } formed by the reaction U{sup 238 }(C{sup 12 }, 4 n). The measured half-life agrees with the expected alpha half-life for the observed energy for an even-even isotope of the element with atomic number 98. It is not possible at this time to obtain a good estimate of the intensity of the carbon ion beam. Therefore the cross sections for the reactions given above cannot be calculated 0 However, it is interesting to note that the indicated yields for the (C, 6 n) and (C, 4 n) reactions are comparable. If the isotopic assignment of the new 35 -hour activity to Cf{sup 246 } is correct, these new data give a better idea as to the slope of the alpha-energy vs. mass number line for californium, which in turn makes it possible to make better predictions of the radioactive properties of the nuclides in this region. We wish to express our appreciation to Professor J. G., Hamilton, J. F. Miller, G. B. Rossi, T. M. Putnam, Jr., M. T. Sebb, and the operating crew of the 60 -inch cyclotron in the Crocker Laboratory for their help in the carbon ion bombardments, We would also like to thank Mr. E. K.

40|$|Introduction Two current major {{research}} topics in nuclear medicine {{are in the}} development of long-lived positron-emitting nuclides for imaging tracers with long biological half-lives and in theranostics, imaging nuclides which have a chemically analogous therapy isotope. As shown in TABLE 1, the radioisotopes of arsenic (As) are well suited for both of these tasks with several imaging and therapy isotopes of a variety of biologically relevant half-lives accessible through the use of small medical cyclotrons. The five naturally abundant isotopes of germanium are both a boon and challenge for the medical nuclear chemist. They are beneficial in that they facilitate a wide array of producible radioarsenic isotopes. They are a challenge as monoisotopic radioarsenic production requires isotopically-enriched targets that are expensive and of limited availability. This makes it highly desirable that the germanium target material is reclaimed from arsenic isolation chemistry. One major factor which has limited the development of radioarsenic has been difficulties in its incorporation into biologically relevant targeting vectors. Previous studies have labeled antibodies and polymers through covalent bonding of arsenite (As(III)) with the sulfydryl group 1, 2, 3. Recent work in our group has shown the facile synthesis and utility of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle- (SPION-) bound radioarsenic as a dual modality positron emission tomography (PET) /magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agent 4. Presently, we have built upon previous studies producing, isolating, and labeling untargeted SPION with radioarsenic 4, 5. We have incorp-rated the use of isotopically-enriched 72 GeO 2 for the production of radioisotopically pure 72 As. The bulk of the 72 GeO 2 target material was re-claimed from the arsenic isolation chemical procedure for reuse in future irradiations. The 72 As was used for ongoing development toward the synthesis of targeted, As-SPION-based, dual-modality PET/MRI agents. Material and Methods Targets of ~ 100 mg of isotopically-enriched 72 GeO 2 (96. 6 % 72 Ge, 2. 86 % 73 Ge, 0. 35 % 70 Ge, 0. 2 % 74 Ge, 0. 01 % 76 Ge, Isoflex USA) were pressed into a niobium beam stop at 225 MPa, covered with a 25 µm HAVAR containment foil, attached to a water-cooling target port, and irradiated with 3 µA of 16. 1 MeV protons for 2 – 3 hours using a GE PETtrace <b>cyclotron.</b> After <b>irradiation,</b> the target and beam stop were assembled into a PTFE dissolution apparatus, where the 72 GeO 2 target material was dissolved with the addition of 2 mL of 4 M NaOH and subsequent stirring. After dissolution was completed, the clear, colorless solution was transferred to a fritted glass column and the bulk 72 GeO 2 was reprecipitated by neutralizing the solution with the addition of 630 µL [HCl]conc, filtered, and rinsed with 1 mL [HCl]conc. To the combined 72 As-containing filtrates, 100 µL 30 % H 2 O 2 was added to ensure that 72 As was in the nonvolatile As(V) oxidation state. The ~ 3 mL solution was then evaporated at 115 ˚C while the vessel was purged with argon, followed by a second addition of 100 µL H 2 O 2 after the volume was reduced to 1 mL. When the filtrate volume was ~ 0. 3 mL, the vessel was removed from heat, allowed to cool with argon flow, and the arsenic reconstituted in 1 mL [HCl]conc and loaded onto a 1. 5 mL bed volume Bio-Rad AG 1 × 8, 200 – 400 mesh anion exchange column preconditioned with 10 M HCl. The radioarsenic was eluted in 10 M HCl in the next ~ 10 mL, with 90 % of the activity eluting in a 4 mL fraction. The column was then eluted with 5 mL 1 M HCl. The 72 As-rich 10 M HCl fraction was reduced to As(III) with the addition of ~ 100 mg CuCl, and heating to 60 ˚C for 1 hour. The resulting AsCl 3 was then extracted twice into 4 mL cyclohexane, which were combined and back extracted into 500 µL of water as As(OH) 3. This solution of 72 As in H 2 O was then used directly to label SPION and for subsequent experiments conjugating 72 As-SPION with TRC 105, an angiogenesis-marking monoclonal antibody (MAb) targeting endoglin/CD 105. Several methods were initially attempted involving directly conjugating the surface-modified SPION to the MAb through a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker. More recent studies have investigated the radioarsenic labeling of SPION encapsulated in hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (SPION@HMSN) and its subsequent conjugation to TRC 105. Results and Conclusion Irradiation of pressed, isotopically-enriched 72 GeO 2 resulted in a production yield for 72 As of 17 ± 2 mCi/(µA·hr·g) and for 71 As of 0. 37 ± 0. 04 mCi/(µA·hr·g), which are 64 % and 33 %, of those predicted from literature 6, respectively. However, these production yields are in agreement with those scaled from observed production yields using analagous natGeO 2 targets. The end-of-bombardment 72 As radionuclidic purity can be improved by minimizing the 72 Ge(p, 2 n) 71 As reaction by degrading the beam energy. A 125 µm Nb containment foil would degrade impinging protons to 14. 1 MeV and is predicted to reduce 71 As yield by a factor of three, while only reducing 72 As yield by 1 % 6, improving end-of-bombardment radionuclidic purity from 98 % to greater than 99 %. Overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of the 72 As isolation procedure from 72 GeO 2 were 51 ± 2 % (n = 3) in agreement with those observed with natGeO 2 57 ± 7 % (n = 14). The beam current was limited to 3 µA as higher cur-rents 4 – 5 µA exhibited inconsistent dissolution and reprecipitation steps, resulting in an overall yield of 44 ± 21 % (n = 6). Dissolution time also {{played an important role in}} overall yield with at least one hour necessary to minimize losses in these first two steps. The separation procedure effectively removed all radiochemical contaminants and resulted in 72 As(OH) 3 isolated in a small volume, pH~ 4. 5 water solution. Over the course of minutes to hours after back extraction, rapid auto-oxidation to 72 AsO 4 H 3 was observed. The bulk 72 GeO 2 target material, which was reclaimed from the isolation procedure, is being collected for future use. The synthesis of a targeted PET/MRI agent based on the functionalization of 72 As-SPION has proved to be a difficult task. Experiments conjugating 72 As-SPION to TRC 105 through a PEG linker were unsuccessful, despite the investigation of a variety bioconjugation procedures. Current work is investigating the use of SPION@HMSN, which have a similar affinity for 72 As as unencapsulated SPION. This new class of 72 As-labeled SPION@HMSN has a hollow cavity for potential anti-cancer drug loading, as well as the mesoporous silica surface, which may facilitate the efficient conjugation of TRC 105 using a well-developed bioconjugation technique. In summary, radioarsenic holds potential in the field of diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine. However, this potential remains locked behind challenges related to its production and useful in vivo targeting. The present work strives to address several of these challenges through the use of enriched 72 GeO 2 target material, a chemical isolation procedure that reclaims the bulk of the target material, and the investigation of new targeted nanoparticle-based PET/MRI agents...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Radioisotopes play an {{important}} role in nuclear medicine and represent powerful tools for imaging and therapy. With the extensive use of 99 mTc-based imaging agents, therapeutic rhenium analogues are highly desirable. Rhenium- 186 emits therapeutic − particles with an endpoint-energy of 1. 07 MeV, allowing for a small, targeted tissue range of 3. 6 mm. Additionally, its low abundance γ-ray emission of 137. 2 keV (9. 42 %) allows for in vivo tracking of a radiolabeled compounds and dosimetry calculations. With a longer half-life of 3. 718 days, synthesis and shipment of Re- 186 based radiopharmaceuticals is not limited. Rhenium- 186 can be produced either in a reactor or in an accelerator. Currently, Re- 186 is produced in a reactor via the 185 Re(n,γ) reaction resulting in low specific activity which makes its therapeutic application limited. [1] Production in an accelerator, such as the PETtrace at the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR), can theoretically provide a specific activity of 34, 600 Ci. mmol− 1 Re[2], which represents a 62 fold increase over reactor produced 186 Re. The studies reported herein focused on the evaluation of accelerator-based reaction pathways to produce high specific activity (HSA) 186 Re. Those pathways include proton and deuteron bombardment of tungsten and osmium targets by the following reactions: 186 W(p,n) 186 Re, 186 W(d, 2 n) 186 Re, 189 Os(p,α) 186 Re, and 192 Os(p,α 3 n) 186 Re. Additional information on target design related to the determination and optimization of production rates, radionuclidic purity, and yield are presented. Material and Methods Osmium and tungsten metals are very hard and thus very brittle. Attempts at pressing the pure metal into aluminum backings resulted in chalky targets, which easily crumbled during handling. Osmium disulfide (OsS 2) and tungsten disulfide (WS 2) were identified to provide a softer, less brittle chemical form for targets. OsS 2 and WS 2 targets were prepared using a unilateral press with a 13 mm diameter die to form pressed powder discs. A simple target holder design (FIG. 1) was implemented to provide a stabilizing platform for the pressed discs. The target material was sealed in place with epoxy using a thin aluminum foil pressed over the target face. Initial irradiations of OsS 2 were performed using the 16 MeV GE PETtrace <b>cyclotron</b> at MURR. <b>Irradiations</b> were performed for 30 – 60 minutes with proton beam currents of 10 – 20 µA. Following irradiation, the OsS 2 targets were dissolved in NaOCl and the pH adjusted using NaOH. The resultant aqueous solution was mixed with methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), with the lipophilic perrhenate being extracted into the MEK layer and the osmium and iridium remaining in the aqueous layer. The MEK extracts were then passed through an acidic alumina column to remove any remaining osmium and iridium. Determination of rhenium and iridium activities was done by gamma spectroscopy on an HPGe detector. Preliminary irradiations on WS 2 targets were performed at MURR with the beam degraded to 14 MeV with a proton beam current of 10 µA for 60 minutes. After irradiation, WS 2 was dissolved using 30 % H 2 O 2 with gentle heating and counted on an HPGe detector to determine the radio-nuclides produced. Results and Conclusion Thin natOsS 2 targets were produced, irradiated at 16 MeV for 10 µAh, and analyzed for radiorhenium. Under these irradiation conditions, rhenium isotopes were produced in nanocurie quantities while iridium isotopes were produced in microcurie quantities. Future studies with higher proton energies are planned to increase the production of rhenium and decrease the production of iridium. After optimizing irradiation conditions, enriched 189 Os will be used for irradiations to reduce the production of unwanted radionuclides. A liquid-liquid extraction method separated the bulk of the rhenium from the iridium. The majority of the rhenium produced was recovered in the first organic aliquot with little iridium observed while the majority of the iridium and osmium was retained in the first aqueous aliquot. Target production with WS 2 was successful. A thin target of natWS 2 was produced and irradiated at 14 MeV for 10 µAh. Under these irradiation conditions, several rhenium isotopes were produced in microcurie quantities. Target parameters to maximize 186 Re production remain to be determined before enriched 186 W targets are used for irradiations to reduce the production of unwanted radionuclides. In conclusion, the potential production routes for accelerator-produced high specific activity 186 Re are being evaluated. Cyclotron-based irradiations of natOsS 2 targets established the feasibility of producing rhenium via the natOs(p,αxn) Re reaction. Current results indicate higher proton energies are necessary to reduce the production of unwanted iridium isotopes while increasing the production of rhenium isotopes. Preliminary irradiations were performed using the 50. 5 MeV Scanditronix MC 50 clinical cyclotron at the University of Washington to determine irradiation parameters for future higher energy irradiations (20 – 30 MeV). A rapid liquid-liquid extraction method isolated rhenium from the bulk of the iridium and osmium following irradiation. Preliminary studies indicate WS 2 may also provide a suitable target material to produce 186 Re via the (p,n) reaction pathway...|$|R
