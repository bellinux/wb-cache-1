40|$|<b>Current</b> <b>transfer</b> {{behaviour}} in anisotropic superconducting bodies is {{the central}} topic of this thesis and focuses on {{the effect that the}} nonlinearity of the electric field dependence upon the local current density value and anisotropy have on the nature of current transport. The main motivation for this work was the desire for {{a better understanding of the}} conceptually difficult behaviour of current transport in superconducting bodies and examines <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> quantitatively for a number of important problems on the macroscopic and microscopic scale. This behaviour is examined both experimentally and using computer models. The successful development of a powerful, robust and adaptable numerical model for analysing the complex <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> behaviour has been the primary aim of this work. The range of parameters appropriate to macroscopic models of the Bi- 2212 CRT system has been experimentally examined using a specifically constructed apparatus for the measurement of current transport characteristics. A study of the self-field properties of the Bi- 2212 CRT material using a new experimental technique and mathematical analysis is presented and has allowed the importance of the self-field effect in the numerical model to be assessed. An essential requirement for the practical application of high current superconducting devices is the development of low resistance current contacts. The research presented examines this macroscopic <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> problem and aims to explain experimentally observed <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> characteristics at high applied currents. Existing models cannot explain these characteristics. <b>Current</b> <b>transfer</b> on the microscopic scale is also examined. Models of <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> have been developed from descriptions of specific microstructures that are thought to characterise the microstructure of Bi- 2223 and Bi- 2212 silver-sheathed tapes.

For broader use, analytical formulae are proposed to determine the <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> length for multi-filamentary superconductors with complex cross-sectional layout. The increasing <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> length with the higher injected current and/or along with the distance away from the current injection point is explained by a progressive current penetration, which is caused by the high resistive matrix layers and complex layout.

50|$|The {{government}} {{budget has}} generally kept within projections. The budget deficit {{at the end}} of August 2011 reached about 2% of GDP, and fiscal authorities seemed committed to keeping it under the projected target of 2.5% of GDP {{by the end of the}} year. In addition to 220 million euros (approx. $298 million) drawn from an IMF Precautionary Credit Line (PCL) in March, financing mostly came from domestic borrowing. However, by the end of the year a financing gap remained of about 50 million to 60 million euros (approx. $67 million to $81 million), which the government plans to cover by borrowing from international capital markets, supported by a policy-based guarantee by the World Bank. The central government's public debt remained low at 26% of GDP, but represents a gradual increase from previous years. Despite lowering the Central Bank bills rate, the Central Bank has not changed liquidity indicators for banks or the reserve requirement since 2009, curbing credit growth to 7.5% in the first three-quarters of 2011. Nikola Gruevski says the government will pay off its entire debt to the private sector by February 2013 in order to improve the economy's overall liquidity.Macedonia's external trade struggled in 2010 due to the slow recovery from the economic crisis of its main trading partners, particularly EU members. Starting from a very low base, export growth in the first 8 months of 2011 reached 41.7%, topping import growth of 36.8%. The trade deficit has widened to 18.3% of GDP, approaching the end-year target of 21.9% of GDP. At the same time, the current account balance deficit significantly improved and the end-year projection was revised upward to 5.5% of GDP. This was due primarily to a 4.4% higher inflow of <b>current</b> <b>transfers,</b> mostly during the summer, and came despite a poor level of foreign direct investment (FDI) of only $237.2 million by end-July 2011.

Author Summary: Neurons take a great variety of shapes that allow them to perform their different computational roles across the brain. The most distinctive visible feature of many neurons is the extensively branched network of cable-like projections that make up their dendritic tree. A neuron receives current-inducing synaptic contacts from other cells across its dendritic tree. As in the case of botanical trees, dendritic trees are strongly tapered towards their tips. This tapering has previously been shown to offer a number of advantages over a constant width, both in terms of reduced energy requirements and the robust integration of inputs at different locations. However, in order to predict the computations that neurons perform, analytical solutions for the flow of input currents tend to assume constant dendritic diameters. Here we introduce an asymptotic approximation that accurately models the <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> in dendritic trees with arbitrary, continuously changing, diameters. When we then determine the diameter profiles that maximise <b>current</b> <b>transfer</b> towards the cell body we find diameters similar to those observed in real neurons.
