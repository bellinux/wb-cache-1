40|$|Using an {{extension}} of the concept of twist field in QFT to space-time (external) symmetries, we study <b>conical</b> <b>twist</b> fields in two-dimensional integrable QFT. These create conical singularities of arbitrary excess angle. We show that, upon appropriate identification between the excess angle and the number of sheets, they have the same conformal dimension as branch-point twist fields commonly used to represent partition functions on Riemann surfaces, and that both fields have closely related form factors. However, we show that <b>conical</b> <b>twist</b> fields are truly different from branch-point twist fields. They generate different operator product expansions (short distance expansions) and form factor expansions (large distance expansions). In fact, we verify in free field theories, by re-summing form factors, that the <b>conical</b> <b>twist</b> fields operator product expansions are correctly reproduced. We propose that <b>conical</b> <b>twist</b> fields are the correct fields in order to understand null polygonal Wilson loops/gluon scattering amplitudes of planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.

We also observe that, starting from a model conical Kähler metric with possibly unbounded scalar curvature, the conical Kähler-Ricci flow will instantly have bounded scalar curvature for t> 0, and the bound is of the form C/t. Several key results will be obtained by direct arguments on the conical equation without passing to a smooth approximation. In the last section, we present several remarks on a twisted Kähler-Ricci flow and its convergence. Comment: V 2, typos fixed, references update...|$|R

Existing drill designing methods rely extensively on discretized analytical equations to describe the drill and different sets of equations need to be formulated as the drill design changes.

A new configuration of wire array z-pinch, the <b>twisted</b> <b>conical</b> wire array, is used to produce convergent plasma flows each rotating about the central axis. Collision of the flows produces a standing shock and jet that each have supersonic azimuthal velocities.

She <b>twists</b> slowly, holding aloft a loop of rope {{with which she}} intends to kill herself. At the first performance, a sustained note from the orchestra's horns created a mood of impending doom. But, when the sound ceased, Jocasta recoiled in horror. Hastening to her room, she collapsed on the bridal bed. The ballet was reworked shortly after its debut. In the revised version, Jocasta's suicidal thoughts are interrupted by {{the entrance of the}} Seer, followed by the Furies.

40|$|Through a {{combined}} quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach, we evaluate the photodynamics of the mono- and dithiolated azobenzenes {{when they are}} chemisorbed on a gold surface. The analysis of steric effects suggests {{that the presence of}} the surface influences the photoisomerization process of the chemisorbed monothiolated azobenzene. In particular, the trans → cis quantum yields decrease, and the nπ* state lifetimes become longer. The approach to the <b>twisted</b> <b>conical</b> intersection needed for the isomerization is hindered when the molecule is attached to a substrate because of the van der Waals interactions with the surface. For the cis isomer, the cis → trans photoisomerization quantum yield is almost unaffected, since this isomer is not flat, and thus the interaction with the surface is less remarkable. Dithiolated azobenzene can photoisomerize both trans → cis and cis → trans, also when doubly linked to the surface, preserving the two bonds with the gold atoms: the flexibility of the central azo-moiety enables the molecule to photoisomerize without any bond breaking. The quantum yields in this case are even higher than in the monothiolated case, probably because of the strained initial conformation, which must adapt to the available distances between the anchoring sites...|$|R
50|$|Mod 4, {{the twelve}} guns from , relined in 1921-1923, had a conical {{one-step}} liner and uniform rifling {{with a new}} chase locking hoop and locking ring. With the Mod 5 {{an attempt was made}} to reline a Mod 1 with a uniform twist rifling, but it was dropped. Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a uniform twist rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step <b>conical</b> liner, uniform <b>twist</b> rifling, and added a tube and liner locking ring. Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step <b>conical</b> liner, uniform <b>twist</b> rifling that was secured by a tube and liner locking ring with a liner locking collar at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and locking ring. Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearance at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner locking ring and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band seating slope and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12. Mod 12 used a Mod 10 and lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope with Mod 13 being similar but of a Mod 8, Mod 14 used a Mod 9, Mod 15 used a Mod 7, Mod 16 used a Mod 10, Mod 17 used a Mod 8, and Mod 18 a Mod 9. Mod 19, the last modification, used a Mod 2 with its breech modified for the Smith-Asbury Breech Mechanism and the forward end of the chamber modified similar to the Mod 18, lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope. The breech end was further modified by being machined out so that it could accommodate a gas check seat liner locking ring. The Mod 19 could also be used right or left handed by cutting a new slide keyway that was 180° from the original keyway.|$|R
40|$|The photophysics of indigo {{as well as}} of bispyrroleindigo, {{the basic}} {{chromophore}} of indigo, has been investigated with ab initio electronic-structure calculations. Vertical electronic excitation energies and excited-state potential-energy profiles have been calculated with the CASSCF, CASPT 2 and CC 2 methods. The calculations reveal that indigo and bispyrroleindigo undergo intramolecular single-proton transfer between adjacent N-H and C=O groups in the 1 ππ* excited state. The nearly barrierless proton transfer provides the pathway for a very efficient deactivation of the 1 ππ* state via a conical intersection with the ground state. While a low-lying S 1 -S 0 conical intersection exists also after double-proton transfer, the latter reaction path exhibits a much higher barrier. The reaction path for trans → cis photoisomerization via the twisting of the central C=C bond has been investigated for bispyrroleindigo. It has been found that the twisting of the central C=C bond is unlikely {{to play a role in}} the photochemistry of indigo, because of a large potential-energy barrier and a rather high energy of the S 1 -S 0 <b>conical</b> intersection of <b>twisted</b> structure. These findings indicate that the exceptional photostability of indigo is the result of rapid internal conversion via intramolecular single-proton transfer, combined with the absence of a low-barrier reaction path for the generation of the cis isomer via trans → cis photoisomerization...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{relaxation}} phenomena which take place in thermonuclear plasma have great influence on the confinement in not only that it is usually harmful to sustainment of configuration, but sometimes that the confinement is improved to much better state by relaxation. The Taylor 2 ̆ 7 s theory [J. B. Taylor, Rev. Mod. Phys. 58, 741 (1986) ] {{is one of the most}} successful and useful theory describing relaxation phenomena, in which the total magnetic energy is minimized under the constraint that the total magnetic helicity is conserved. However, it is not sufficient to be applied for real fusion plasma because it ignores the existence of plasma pressure. On the other hand, the achievable plasma beta value in experiments has been increasing in recent years. In particular, the spherical tokamak concept is attracting a great deal of attention because it has excellent properties in the confinement and the stability at high β, and the engineering economy. Therefore, a generalized theory on relaxation phenomena including the effect of plasma pressure is needed. In this thesis, we shall try to reveal the dynamics of pressure-driven relaxation phenomena observed in spherical tokamak plasma, which is so-called IRE (Internal Reconnection Event), by means of a numerical simulation. IRE is observed as a rapid fall in the soft X-ray signal and an increase in the net toroidal current, together with a drastic deformation in overall shape. However, the physical mechanism of IRE had not been clarified at all until this study was carried out. The simulation results are full of suggestion for both improving the confinement of spherical tokamak plasma and understanding the general nature of the pressure-driven relaxation phenomena. 　　　The simulation is based on a nonlinear three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations. It is executed in a full toroidal spherical tokamak geometry including an open external magnetic field region, so that the dynamical behavior of an IRE, such as a large distortion in overall shape, can be properly treated. The spontaneous time development of tiny perturbations applied on an initial unstable equilibrium is pursued by a high-accuracy scheme. 　　　The simulation results successfully reproduce the key features of IRE in good agreement with experimental observations. The dominant linear eigenmodes for an initial condition including a q = 1 rational surface are found to be a combination of several low-n modes. Especially, the m = 2 /n = 2 and the m = 1 /n = 1 pressure-driven interchange modes grow simultaneously with almost the same large growth rate. As a result of the nonlinear development of such low-n modes, which induce an elliptically elongating and shifting convection flow in the poloidal cross section, a pressure bulge appears on the surface of the torus in a toroidally localized region, where the radial positive displacements of each mode are aligned to each other. The localized deformation generates a current sheet structure near the separatrix, which induces magnetic reconnection between the internal and external magnetic fields. The reconnected field line links the core region at high pressure and the peripheral region at low pressure, so that a large pressure gradient is formed along the reconnected field line. The confined plasma is rapidly expelled out of the torus due to the flows induced by the pressure gradient. The expelled plasma extends in the periphery, forming a characteristic helically <b>twisted</b> <b>conical</b> layers at the top and the bottom of the torus, which is in good agreement with experimental results observed by using a CCD camera. On the other hand, the plasma pressure at the center of the torus falls into about 40...|$|R
