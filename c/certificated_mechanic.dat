50|$|In the mid 1970s, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE, {{found that}} the contractor-owned air attack aircraft, mostly {{single-engine}} Cessna 182s and Cessna 210s, did not provide the airspeed and safety needed for the department's new air tanker program. In 1974, Senior Air Operations Officer Cotton Mason inspected 40 USAF O-2s at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. The best 20 were selected and shipped to Fresno, California. These aircraft had been FAC aircraft in Vietnam and were shipped back to the United States in containers, and were disassembled and on pallets {{when they arrived at}} Fresno. A crew of California Conservation Corps (CCC) members under the supervision of a CDF Battalion Chief, who was an FAA <b>Certificated</b> <b>Mechanic</b> with Inspection Authorization (IA), reassembled the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Aviation Medical Examiner, Ground Instructor, Parachute rigger, Aircraft Maintenance Technician, Repairman and Air Traffic Controller {{are also}} federally {{certified}} aviation-related positions. Most of these also have their rating systems. For example, an A&P is a certified mechanic with both airframe and powerplant ratings, and a Ground Instructor may be rated to give Basic, Advanced, and/or Instrument training. Aircraft Inspection authorization (IA) {{is an additional}} privilege conferred on <b>certificated</b> <b>mechanics</b> who meet specific experience and training requirements.|$|R
2500|$|The {{family moved}} from Manhattan to Red Bank, New Jersey, {{and then to}} Jersey City, New Jersey by 1920 where his father owned a delicatessen. Eddie {{attended}} William L. Dickinson High School and {{dropped out of school}} in 1926, at age 15 to go to work as a plane mechanic at Roosevelt Field in Hempstead, Long Island. His mother died In 1927 after which he, his father, and sister visited Bielefeld, Germany and Farsund, Norway to visit with relatives. In Germany Eddie went on a plane ride from Hamburg to Hanover and then aviation became his obsession. In 1928–1929 he trained at Roosevelt Field on Long Island and became the youngest person in the United States to receive a commercial pilot certificate. That same year he also received a mechanics certificate, becoming the youngest <b>certificated</b> airplane <b>mechanic</b> in New York. In April 1930 Eddie was living in Hempstead, Long Island with Carl Schneider (1898?) who was also working as a mechanic. Eddie's father bought him a used, red, 1927 Cessna Model AW monoplane with tail number C9092. It already had been flown five hundred thousand air miles. He called it [...] "the kangaroo".|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) is to encourage air carrier and repair station employees to voluntarily report errors that may be critical to identifying potential precursors to accidents. Under an ASAP, safety issues are resolved through proactive action rather than through punishment or discipline. The goal {{of this study was}} to identify factors that may lead to the success or failure of an ASAP. The Maintenance ASAP Questionnaire (MAQ) was developed and distributed to a randomly selected sample of 83, 0000 <b>certificated</b> aircraft <b>mechanics.</b> The results of this survey indicate that there is an overwhelming belief among the respondents that the ASAP programs can truly improve safety. The hurdles in building a successful ASAP program are rooted in two key areas: (a) limited interpersonal trust among mechanics, managers, and the FAA inspectors and (b) lack of awareness about the ASAP programs as well as its potential benefits. In addition to higher levels of trust and awareness among the organizations with successful ASAP programs, it was also clear that these organizations had a more collaborative labor-management relationship...|$|R

5000|$|A little-known {{responsibility}} of the NTSB is that {{it serves as a}} court of appeals for airmen, aircraft <b>mechanics,</b> <b>certificated</b> aviation-related companies and mariners who have their licenses suspended or revoked by the FAA or the Coast Guard. The NTSB employs administrative law judges which initially hear all appeals, and the administrative law judge's ruling may be appealed to the five-member Board. [...] The Board's determinations may be appealed to the federal court system by the losing party, whether it is the individual or company, on the one hand, or the FAA or the Coast Guard, on the other. [...] However, the NTSB's determinations will not be overturned by the federal courts unless the NTSB abused its discretion, or its determination is wholly unsupported by the evidence.|$|R
