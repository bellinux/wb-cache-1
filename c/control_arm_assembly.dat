40|$|International audienceCilia are {{evolutionarily}} conserved organelles {{endowed with}} essential physiological and developmental functions. In humans, disruption of cilia motility or signaling leads to complex pleiotropic genetic disorders called ciliopathies. Cilia motility requires {{the assembly of}} multi-subunit motile components such as dynein arms, but mechanisms underlying their assembly pathway and transport into the axoneme are still largely unknown. We identified a previously uncharacterized coiled-coil domain containing protein CCDC 151, which is evolutionarily conserved in motile ciliated species and shares ancient features with the outer dynein arm-docking complex 2 of Chlamydomonas. In Drosophila, we show that CG 14127 /CCDC 151 is associated with motile intraflagellar transport (IFT) -dependent cilia and required for geotaxis behavior of adult flies. In zebrafish, Ccdc 151 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, and morpholino-induced depletion of Ccdc 151 leads to left-right asymmetry defects and kidney cysts. We demonstrate that Ccdc 151 is required for proper motile function of cilia in the Kupffer's vesicle and in the pronephros by <b>controlling</b> dynein <b>arm</b> <b>assembly,</b> showing that Ccdc 151 is a novel player in the control of IFT-dependent dynein <b>arm</b> <b>assembly</b> in animals. However, we observed that CCDC 151 is also implicated in other cellular functions in vertebrates. In zebrafish, ccdc 151 is involved in proper orientation of cell divisions in the pronephros and genetically interacts with prickle 1 in this process. Furthermore, knockdown experiments in mammalian cells demonstrate that CCDC 151 is implicated in the regulation of primary cilium length. Hence, CCDC 151 is required for motile cilia function in animals but has acquired additional non-motile functions in vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the "right hand" <b>control</b> in dual <b>arm</b> <b>assembly</b> cell. While considering the constraints and perturbations that occur during a typical multi-robot assembly task (poorly known and varying environment parameters, mobile obstacles, impacts, friction, noises, [...] .), a controller have been developed in [1]. It is based on an impedance controller which is an intermediate solution between a fully decoupled scheme ([2]) and a linearized scheme. To increase the performances of the resulting controller, a higher control level is added to modify on-line the desired impedance and/or the reference trajectory. This supervisor has been developed using fuzzy logic techniques. The choice of gains to ensure stability is discussed, considering some theorical and practical aspects. Experimental results, obtained on a two-arms assembly system, illustrate the ability of the system to absorb large external impacts. 1 Introduction Advanced assembly applications sometimes re [...] ...|$|R

The weight of <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> can be reduced by applying the design and material technologies.

Strength assessment {{is the most important}} design criterion in the structural design of a <b>control</b> <b>arm.</b> At the proto design stage of a new <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> FE (finite element) analysis is often utilized to predict its strength.

According to the classification of structural optimization, the structural design of a <b>control</b> <b>arm</b> is included in the category of shape optimization. In this study, the kriging interpolation method is adopted to obtain the minimum weight satisfying the strength constraint.
