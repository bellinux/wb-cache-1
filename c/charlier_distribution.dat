40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} the research carried out in even-aged spruce stands, regarding to the deer damaged tree distribution on the diameter classes. The main studied topics were: correlation between the frequency of the deer damages and the Charlier distribution; regression equations witch represent relation between the <b>Charlier</b> <b>distribution</b> parameters (standard deviation, asymmetry, kurtosis) and the frequency of the deer damages; structural models of the deer damaged tree distribution on the diameter classes correlated with the frequency of the deer damages; validation of the theoretical model. Using an original method, it was possible to establish a model predicting the deer damaged tree distribution on the diameter classes, based on the relationship between frequency of the deer damages and stand age in spruce forests. This research brought up some unknown aspects that can be considered as new contributions concerning scientific basis for the sustainable forest management in mountains ecosystems affected by disturbances factors. ...|$|E

40|$|Counting data without zero {{category}} {{often occur}} in various _elds. Examples include days of hospital stay for patients, numbers of publication for tenure-tracked faculty in a university, numbers of tra_c violation for drivers during {{a certain period}} and so on. A class of zero-truncated discrete models such as zero-truncated Poisson, zero-truncated binomial and zero-truncated negative-binomial distributions are proposed in literature to model such count data. In this thesis, firstly, literature review is presented in Chapter 1 on a class of commonly used univariate zero-truncated discrete distributions. In Chapter 2, a unified method is proposed to derive {{the distribution of the}} sum of i. i. d. zero-truncated distribution random variables, which has important applications {{in the construction of the}} shortest Clopper-Person confidence intervals of parameters of interest and in the calculation of the exact p-value of a two-sided test for small sample sizes in one sample problem. These problems are discussed in Section 2. 4. Then a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for calculating the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of parameters in general zero-truncated discrete distributions. An important feature of the proposed EM algorithm is that the latent variables and the observed variables are independent, which is unusual in general EM-type algorithms. In addition, a unified minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm for obtaining the MLEs of parameters in a class of zero-truncated discrete distributions is provided. The first objective of Chapter 3 is to propose the multivariate zero-truncated <b>Charlier</b> series (ZTCS) <b>distribution</b> by developing its important distributional properties, and providing efficient MLE methods via a novel data augmentation in the framework of the EM algorithm. Since the joint marginal distribution of any r-dimensional sub-vector of the multivariate ZTCS random vector of dimension m is an r-dimensional zero-deated <b>Charlier</b> series (ZDCS) <b>distribution</b> (1 6 r < m), it is the second objective of Chapter 3 to propose a new family of multivariate zero-adjusted <b>Charlier</b> series (ZACS) <b>distributions</b> (including the multivariate ZDCS distribution as a special member) with a more flexible correlation structure by accounting for both inflation and deflation at zero. The corresponding distributional properties are explored and the associated MLE method via EM algorithm is provided for analyzing correlated count data. published_or_final_versionStatistics and Actuarial ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

The distribution offers flexibility in modeling both leptokurtosis and asymmetry (characteristics seen in high-frequency financial time series data), nests the standard normal and Student t distributions, and {{is related to the}} Gram <b>Charlier</b> and mixture <b>distributions.</b> An empirical ARCH model based on this distribution is formulated and estimated using hourly exchange rate returns for four currencies. The generalized Student t is found to better model the empirical conditional and unconditional distributions than other distributional specifications. ...|$|R
