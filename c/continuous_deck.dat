500|$|Some two-color paint schemes {{attempted}} to harmonize with both sea and sky near the horizon. The US Navy painted some ships dark gray with white structures above bridge level. Both the US Navy and the Royal Navy painted ships dark gray on the hull and light gray on the superstructure and turrets. USN measure 12 was a graded system with sea blue {{low on the}} hull below the first <b>continuous</b> <b>deck,</b> with ocean gray above that. The top of the masts were painted haze gray. This measure was modified with ocean gray above navy blue low on the hull below the first <b>continuous</b> <b>deck</b> (painted parallel to the waterline rather than the main deck). [...] This bold contrast on a horizontal line near the horizon reduced visibility to surface observers and created the illusion of greater range. [...] This camouflage was considered most effective for gunnery engagements with surface units or shore batteries in areas where aerial observation was unlikely. It {{was used in the}} Atlantic and European coastal waters from the end of 1942 through the end of World War II. It was worn by shore bombardment ships in the Pacific from late 1944 after the destruction of Japanese naval aviation capability at the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Similar Admiralty standard schemes were applied beginning in 1944 when it was assumed enemy forces would have radar.

In a typical modern steel ship, the structure consists of watertight and non-tight decks, major transverse and watertight (and also sometimes non-tight or longitudinal) members called bulkheads, intermediate members such as girders, s and webs, and minor members called ordinary transverse frames, frames, or longitudinals, depending on the structural arrangement.

International Journal of Advanced Structural Engineering.

A finite element (FE) model is developed and a detailed transient thermal analysis is performed on a <b>continuous</b> concrete bridge <b>deck</b> under the effect of various fire curves. A parametric study is performed to examine the top cover thickness and the critical fire exposure curve needed to fully degrade the top GFRP bars while achieving certain fire ratings for the deck considered. Accordingly, design tables are prepared for each fire curve to guide the engineer to properly size the top concrete cover and maintain the temperature in the GFRP bars below critical design values in order to control the full top GFRP degradation. It is notable to indicate that degradation of top GFRP bars do not pose a collapse hazard but rather a serviceability concern since cracks in the negative moment region widen resulting in simply supported spans...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaf 87. The {{available}} {{methods of}} calculating {{the effects of}} earthquakes on viaduct-type bridges with <b>continuous</b> <b>decks</b> and tall piers are examined. Particular emphasis is laid {{on the use of}} a relatively quick method of analysis using response spectra and taking account of the effects of damping. The use of this method is illustrated by applying it to a mathematical model representing a real. bridge. Manual calculations are performed and refined by the application of Rayleigh's Principle. A number of variations to the configuration of the model are analysed by the computer programme "SAP IV" under earthquake excitation in each of three mutually perpendicular directions. The computed results are compared with those obtained by manual calculation. The earthquake loading effects are compared with the effects of deadload, traffic loading and windload and there is a discussion on the design of suitable structural configurations to contend with seismic loading. The work ends with some generalisations about other types of bridges...|$|R
40|$|The study aims {{to further}} develop, {{with respect to}} {{previous}} findings, and validate structural design criteria which account {{for the effects of}} earthquakes spatial variability. In past works [Nuti, C. and Vanzi. I. (2004) & (2005); Carnevale, L. et al. (2010) ] the two simplest forms of this problem were dealt with: differential displacements between two points belonging to the soil or to two single degree of freedom structures. Existing codes appear indeed improvable on this aspect. For the differential displacements of two points on the ground, these results are generalized with different response spectra and validated using (indeed a small set of) real recordings. For the experimental validation, the first obtained results point towards an acceptable agreement of model vs. experimental results [Tropeano, G. et al. (2011) ]. In any case, results indicate that the design codes can be improved on this topic, both for the two points (e. g. simply supported decks) and the multiple points (e. g. <b>continuous</b> <b>decks</b> on multiple piers) cases...|$|R
