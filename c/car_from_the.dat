5|$|The Disneyland Railroad today {{operates}} {{four sets}} of train cars, {{as well as a}} parlor car. The combine <b>car</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> railroad's former Retlaw 1 passenger train, one of the DRR's two original train sets, was Walt Disney's favorite train car on the railroad, as it brought back memories from his youth working as a news butcher on the Missouri Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 9:00a.m. local time for a 30-minute warm-up session where several drivers ran into the track's run-off areas. Kanaan {{continued}} his good performance and recorded the fastest time with a lap of 59.869 seconds. Herta was second-fastest, and Fernández was third. Bräck and de Ferran rounded out the session's top five fastest drivers. Fernández locked his brakes {{and went into the}} turn five tire wall which stopped the session for three minutes to allow course officials to remove his <b>car</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> barrier, and Franchitti and Junqueira made contact at the pit lane entrance but both drivers continued without any apparent damage.|$|E
5|$|They meet up {{with the}} rest of the family at a car museum. They steal a replica of the main villain's <b>car</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Road Warrior and engage in a ludicrous car chase through the streets of Hollywood, with the film {{executives}} on their trail. Homer, taking an idea he believes to be from Braveheart, moons the executives along with Gibson so that they will stop their car out of disgust. Homer and Gibson then attend the film's premiere back in Springfield, but when the film ends, the entire audience walks out disgusted, and Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter walks up to them, slaps them, and threatens to sue them for the bad film. Homer then tries to apologize to Gibson, but he does not blame him, arriving to the conclusion there is no place for violence-lovers like them in Hollywood; however, as soon as Homer suggests more stupid film ideas, Gibson kicks him out of his limousine.|$|E

5|$|Castroneves led {{the field}} {{back up to}} speed at the lap-51 restart; he was {{followed}} by Fernández, Bräck and Dixon. Carpentier broke his rear wing after he collided with the turn one tire barrier when he locked his brakes and retired after {{it was discovered that}} his gearbox had sustained damage. Having restarted in seventh place, Andretti moved up into fourth position by lap 54. By the 60th lap, Castroneves had a 4.8 second lead over Fernández, who in turn was 3.5 seconds ahead of Bräck. Andretti was a further three seconds behind the Swedish driver, and was holding a two-second lead over Kanaan. Bräck went off at turn nine to retire with a mechanical issue that drained his car's battery on lap 63. Castroneves made a scheduled pit stop on lap 65, handing the lead to Fernández, and rejoined in tenth place. His car started to billow smoke after leaving turn one two laps later and pulled {{off to the side of}} the track at turn eight to retire. The seventh caution period was on the 68th lap to allow safety officials to remove Castroneves' <b>car</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> track. Most of the leaders (including Fernández) made pit stops to ensure they could reach the end of the race. Kanaan gained the lead and relinquished it to Andretti when he made a pit stop; Andretti led the field back up to speed at the lap-72 restart, followed by Tagliani.|$|E
5|$|Vergne {{dropped down}} the order when his car {{developed}} a water pump battery failure {{and was forced}} to make an unscheduled pit stop to move into his second vehicle on lap eight, while di Grassi made his required pit stop for a replacement front wing on the same lap and narrowly avoided striking a trackside marshal after leaving his pit stall. López had dropped to 18th place by the start of the following lap. Bird briefly reduced the time deficit to Piquet until the latter responded to the Virgin car's fast pace. Rosenqvist lost control of the back-end of his car and slid backwards into the turn five barrier on the 14th lap, damaging his rear wing. The incident forced him to make a pit stop for the switch into his second car. López carried a large amount of speed exiting the chicane and made heavy contact with the wall on lap 17. Piquet was close behind him and took avoiding action but reacted late and had an understeer which sent him into the barrier. He did not damage his car and was able to reverse out of the barrier but lost the lead to Bird and Buemi moved into second place. The incident necessitated the deployment of the safety car to allow marshals to repair the wall and extract López's <b>car</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> track. Some drivers (including Buemi) elected to make mandatory pit stops to switch into their second cars under safety car conditions {{at the end of the}} 20th lap.|$|E
25|$|Teams {{must use}} a single <b>car</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{start of the}} first {{practice}} session {{through the end of}} the race. Teams that crash a car in practice or qualifying may go to a backup car, but racing a different <b>car</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> one that qualified results in that car having to start at the rear of the field.|$|E

25|$|The first trouble {{during the}} night began at 7:20 PM, when a jeering crowd of about 30 {{individuals}} gathered at E. 79th and Hough Avenue as the National Guard, bayonets fixed, told an African American man to move his <b>car</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> intersection. Another incident occurred at 10:30 PM, when Cleveland police arrested 15 juveniles and three adults in Glenville (on the border {{with the city of}} East Cleveland) for harassing a National Guard unit.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 {{the company}} {{purchased}} a <b>car</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company, {{this being a}} double-decker with a single ended body pivoted on the truck.

This design was not particularly successful and the vehicle was later rebuilt as a standard rigid car with two ends.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} headlamps were {{fueled by}} acetylene or oil, and {{were introduced in}} the late 1880s. Acetylene lamps were popular because the flame is resistant to wind and rain. The first electric headlamps were introduced in 1898 on the Columbia Electric <b>Car</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Electric Vehicle Company of Hartford, Connecticut, and were optional. Two factors limited {{the widespread use of}} electric headlamps: the short life of filaments in the harsh automotive environment, and the difficulty of producing dynamos small enough, yet powerful enough to produce sufficient current.|$|E
