40|$|Regolith {{is present}} on most {{planetary}} surfaces such as Earth's moon, Mars, and Asteroids. If human crews and robotic machinery are {{to operate on}} these regolith covered surfaces, they must face the consequences of interacting with regolith fines which consist of particles below 100 microns in diameter down to as small as submicron scale particles. Such fine dust will intrude into mechanisms and interfaces causing a variety of problems such as contamination of clean fluid lines, jamming of mechanisms and damaging <b>connector</b> <b>seals</b> and couplings. Since multiple elements must be assembled in space for system level functionality, it will be inevitable that interfaces will be necessary for structural connections, and to pass commodities such as cryogenic liquid propellants, purge and buffer gases, water, breathing air, pressurizing gases, heat exchange fluids, power and data. When fine regolith dust {{is present in the}} environment it can be lofted into interfaces where it can compromise the utility of the interface by preventing the connections from being successfully mated, or by inducing fluid leaks or degradation of power and data transmission. A dust tolerant, hand held "quick-disconnect" cryogenic fluids connector housing has been developed at NASA KSC which can be used by astronaut crews to connect flex lines that will transfer propellants and other useful fluids to the end user.

40|$|The {{stainless}} steel bipolar plate has received much attention {{due to the}} cost of graphite bipolar plates. Since the micro-channel of bipolar plates plays the role of fuel flow field, electric <b>connector</b> and fuel <b>sealing,</b> an investigation of the deep drawing process for {{stainless steel}} micro-channel arrays is reported in this work. The updated Lagrangian formulation, degenerated shell finite element analysis, and the r-minimum rule have been employed to study the relationship between punch load and stroke, distributions of stress and strain, thickness variations and depth variations of individual micro-channel sections. A micro-channel array is practically formed, with a width and depth of a single micro-channel of 0. 75 mm and 0. 5 mm, respectively. Fractures were usually observed in the fillet corner of the micro-channel bottom. According to the experimental results, more attention should be devoted to the fillet dimension design of punch and die. A larger die fillet can lead to better formability and a reduction of the punch load. In addition, the micro-channel thickness and the fillet radius have to be taken into consideration at the same time. Finally, the punch load estimated by the unmodified metal forming equation is higher than that of experiments...|$|R

The first commercial use of the Low Pressure Molding process was in the automotive industry. The driving force was to replace toxic and cumbersome potting processes, faster cycle times, lighter parts and environmentally safe components. Since then Low Pressure Molding has spread out to other areas such as industrial products, medical, consumer products, military, wire harness and any unique product {{that needs to be}} sealed and protected against the environment. Basically, where {{there is a need to}} seal and protect an electronic device there may be an opportunity to use Low Pressure molding as the solution. Automotive sensors in-cabin and even under hood, USB thumb drives, RF ID tags, moisture sensors, motor control boards, consumer products.

40|$|This {{assessment}} was {{initiated by the}} NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) {{after a number of}} recent "high profile" connector problems, the most visible and publicized of these being the problem with the Space Shuttle's Engine Cut-Off System cryogenic feed-thru connector. The NESC commissioned a review of NASA's connector selection and application processes for space flight applications, including how lessons learned and past problem records are fed back into the processes to avoid recurring issues. Team members were primarily from the various NASA Centers and included connector and electrical parts specialists. The commissioned study was conducted on spacecraft connector selection and application processes at NASA Centers. The team also compared the NASA spacecraft connector selection and application process to the military process, identified recent high profile connector failures, and analyzed problem report data looking for trends and common occurrences. The team characterized NASA's connector problem experience into a list of top connector issues based on anecdotal evidence of a system's impact and commonality between Centers. These top issues are as follows, in no particular rank order: electrically shorted, bent and/or recessed contact pins, contact pin/socket contamination leading to electrically open or intermittencies, connector plating corrosion or corrosion of connector components, low or inadequate contact pin retention forces, contact crimp failures, unmated connectors and mis-wiring due to workmanship errors during installation or maintenance, loose connectors due to manufacturing defects such as wavy washer and worn bayonet retention, damaged <b>connector</b> elastomeric <b>seals</b> and cryogenic <b>connector</b> failure. A survey was also conducted of SAE Connector AE- 8 C 1 committee members regarding their experience relative to the NASA concerns on connectors. The most common responses in order of occurrence were contact retention, plating issues, worn-out or damaged coupling mechanisms, bent pins, contact crimp barrel cracking and torn seals. In addition to these common themes, responses included issues with markings, dimensional errors on the build, contact/socket damage (handling), manufacturing defects and customer misapplication and mishandling. The NESC team concluded that considering the large quantity and wide variety of connectors successfully flown on human and robotic space applications, the number of failures is quite low. However, "high profile" failures with significant cost, schedule, safety, and/or mission success impacts continue to occur. It was also concluded that connector failures occur throughout a system's life-cycle with the majority of connector issues application related. A number of recommendations were identified for improving NASA connector selection processes and overall space connector reliability and performance...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{practice}} of endotracheal suctioning of ventilator treated patients {{is necessary to}} remove secretions to prevent obstruction of the endotracheal-tracheal tube and lower airways. This very common procedure creates a large variety of heart-lung interferences. The closed system enables ventilation during suctioning, avoiding disconnection from the ventilator. Thus, the lesser side-effects of the closed suction system have been thoroughly evaluated rather than its effectiveness of secretion removal. Qualitative and semi-quantitative {{studies have indicated that}} the effectiveness of the closed system is inferior to the open one. Optimising the side-effects and effectiveness of the suction procedure is essential to preserve oxygenation in critically ill patients. This also requires adequate monitoring techniques. Suctioning through a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) via a tight <b>seal</b> <b>connector</b> is another form of closed suctioning. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effectiveness and side-effects of open and closed suctioning manoeuvres, using novel lung-monitoring techniques. Methods: Studies were performed in mechanical lung models, an experimental model of acute lung injury (ALI) in pigs and in ALI patients. Effectiveness of secretion removal was evaluated by weighing the suction system before and after suctioning of gel in a transparent trachea. In ALI model and patients, airway pressure and lung mechanics were measured via a tracheal catheter. A modified N 2 wash-out/wash-in method was used for functional residual capacity (FRC) measurements. Electric impedance tomography (EIT) was used to monitor global and regional lung volume changes during different suction manoeuvres. Results: In a mechanical lung, closed suction during volume control ventilation caused high intrinsic PEEP levels at insertion of the catheter. Pressure control ventilation (PCV) produced less intrinsic PEEP. The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode offered the least intrinsic PEEP during insertion of the catheter and least sub-atmospheric pressure during suctioning. Open suctioning and closed suctioning during CPAP of 0 cmH 2 O was about five times more effective in regaining gel from an artificial trachea than closed suctioning during PCV or CPAP of 10 cmH 2 O. In lavaged lungs side-effects were considerable less during closed suction with positive pressure ventilation than during open suction. Closed system suctioning during CPAP of 0 cmH 2 O caused side-effects similar to open suctioning. At disconnection FRC decreased with about 50 % of baseline value and further 20 % during open suctioning. Regional compliance deteriorated most in the dorsal parts of the lavaged lung. Post-suction restitution of lung volume and compliance was somewhat slower during pressure controlled - than during volume controlled ventilation, both in experimental lung injury and in some ALI patients. Bronchoscopic suction through a tight <b>seal</b> <b>connector</b> in a mechanical lung and in ventilator treated ALI patients caused marked lung volume reduction, especially if the endotracheal tube was too small in relation to the thickness of the bronchoscope. Conclusions: New monitoring strategies such as continuous, bedside FRC measurements with EIT technique and the nitrogen washout/washin method could contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the suctioning induced lung collapse and give us knowledge on how to minimize its negative effects, hence develop better clinical routines for handling them. The largest loss of lung volume takes place already at disconnection of the ventilator prior to suctioning. The dorsal regions of lavaged lungs are most affected by disconnection and suctioning. Closed system suctioning prevents lung collapse but is less efficient in removing secretions. Volume control ventilation in the post-suctioning period is a way of recruiting collapsed lung tissue. Bronchoscopic suctioning can cause severe lung collapse, although considered a closed system...|$|R
40|$|Safety measure {{design and}} {{accident}} predictive and prevention strategies are {{critical in the}} offshore process. The key area of concern in an offshore facility is a major event such as a fire, an explosion {{and the release of}} hazardous materials. The recent BP Transocean Deepwater Horizon accident is an example of safety protocols either being inadequate or response being inefficient and ineffective. Understanding the consequences of major release events is a key step in safety measure design and consequence assessment of major events. The assessment includes the definition of different release scenarios, release modeling, event modeling, and damage/loss quantification. The consequence assessment is an important step of risk estimation and is subsequently used to design safety measures. [...] To address release scenario modeling, a new methodology is developed in the current study to revise the emission factor estimation methods earlier developed by USEPA. Applying a non-linear regression approach, a new set of equations is introduced to estimate emission rates. Having ΔAIC values of more than 10, in the categories of pump <b>seals,</b> <b>connectors,</b> flanges and others, the equations replace USEPA's proposed correlation equations for oil and gas facilities. [...] Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to simulate different release scenarios, particularly to study fire, explosion and toxic dispersion. The Flame Acceleration Simulator (FLACS), a CFD tool, is used to model explosion and toxic dispersion of combustion products. To improve the consequence modeling work, a systematic approach for CFD modeling of Vapour Cloud explosion (VCE) is also introduced. Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) is used to model pool and jet fires. [...] A novel integrated approach in modeling the evolving accident scenarios is also developed in the current study. To develop the toxic risk profile of combustion products of an installation, a risk-based approach is proposed, overcoming the shortcomings of a concentration-based approach.
