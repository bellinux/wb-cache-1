40|$|Nearly {{one billion}} {{people of the}} world’s {{population}} lack access to safe drinking water. [1] This has caused severe health problems {{as well as political}} and economic problems for many countries. Climate change has made it more difficult to access safe drinking water and is a result of black carbon (BC) and CO 2 emissions. [2] The source of these emissions come from a variety of sources; among which are cooking with bio fuels and fossil fuels. Because of the negative effects of cooking, appropriate technologies have been implemented to reduce particulate emissions. However, monitoring of their utilization and effectiveness has not been properly accounted for leading to frequent failures. [3] The Sustainable Water, Energy and Environmental Technologies Laboratory (SWEETLab), at Portland State University (PSU), is developing a method of fixing this problem. The SWEETLab develops and implements technologies for the support of life in remote environments. A key thread of the SWEETLab’s research focuses on improving accountability and methodologies for international development through improved data collection. The goal of the SWEETLab is to proving the sustainability of efficient cookstoves by implementing an in-situ remote monitoring system,(called SWEETSense) a method of which has not been attempted yet until now. [2] Remote Monitoring can provide solutions to many of the issues around sustainability of water treatment, energy and infrastructure intervention in developing communities such as unrealizable survey data and relying on spot checks to assess performance. [2] The SWEETSense is designed to have a low power profile while maintaining high-resolution data logging capabilities. One valuable part of the SWEETSense is temperature sensors, thermistors. The thermistors trigger the SWEETSense to turn on whenever a cookstove is being used. The purpose of having a temperature sensor is to help minimize power consumption and allows high resolution logging of usage event while running off of compact batteries for a targeted minimum of six months. [2] When the SWEETSense is triggered on, CO and CO 2 sensors will trigger, recording data as the user is using the efficient cookstove. The overall goal of the SWEETLab is to find an appropriate method of calibrating the SWEETSense. As the SWEETLab progresses forward in mass production, the SWEETSense will require a faster calibration process. For the focus of this project, the temperature sensors of the SWEETSense will be studied. The project goal is to figure out the best process of calibrating the temperature sensors using a <b>calibration</b> <b>bath</b> while maintaining a 3 -degree error goal, set at four calibrated temperature ranges; 21. 3 °C (ambient), 35 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C. Over the course of five weeks, variations of calibration tests were performed on the sensors using the calibration water bath however the problem found was that there was a large amount of time spent performing the calibration tests while little progress was made in calibrating the sensors...|$|E
40|$|Published in: Shaping {{the future}} by {{engineering}} : 58 th IWK, Ilmenau Scientific Colloquium, Technische Universität Ilmenau, 8 - 12 September 2014; proceedings URN: urn:nbn:de:gbv:ilm 1 - 2014 iwk: 3 URL: [URL] of Contents of the Proceedings: [URL] Abstract: A simple method for calibrating slender temperature sensors like mineral insulated metal sheathed thermocouples (MIMS-TCs), cable-type thermocouples or thermocouples with single sheet insulation is described. The use of so called fixed-point calibration rods {{makes it possible to}} calibrate such sensors at one particularly chosen temperature easily. A second sensor for measuring the calibration temperature (reference sensor) is not necessary. In most cases, the calibration procedure can be performed in exactly that situation where the measuring application normally takes place (in-situ calibration). Thus the whole individual measuring circuitry and its specific thermal conditions are involved during calibration process. Fixed-point calibration rods are useful for quality management inspections in rough industrial application areas, for outdoor surveying tasks as well as for precision temperature measurements in <b>calibration</b> <b>baths</b> or furnaces. The paper presents structure and handling of fixed-point calibration rods. Examples of application including measuring uncertainty budgets are outlined...|$|R
40|$|A laser {{interferometer}} technique {{has been developed}} for calibrating extensometers at the Ogdensberg Station of Lamont Geological Observatory. It provides remote-controlled <b>calibration</b> of <b>bath</b> horizontal and vertical extensometers within the linear range of the transducer output. The present calibration system consists of an electromagnetic driving unit and a Michelson interferometer. The transducer end of the extensometer is displaced longitudinally with an electromagnetic driving unit, which is excited by a variable low-frequency oscillator with a bandwidth of 0. 0005 to 60 kHz. The resultant dis-placement is detected by counting fringe displacements of the interferometer with an Ne-He laser source. With this calibration system, motion as small as 0. 03 micron can be determined with excellent repeatability and with errors of less than 5 per cent, in comparison with errors of more than 40 per cent for the optical calibration method previously used...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Pulmonary artery {{catheters}} (PACs) {{are frequently}} used for monitoring patient {{temperatures in the}} intensive care unit. Nevertheless, data regarding the accuracy of these measurements are lacking, and few data testify to the accuracy of temperatures recorded after the PAC has been in place for several days. The absolute values of such measurements are relevant for critical care because patient temperatures are often used as diagnostic criteria for sepsis and antibiotic therapy. We thus hypothesized that the Edwards Lifesciences PAC would accurately measure blood temperature. To test our hypothesis, we compared temperature measurements obtained from PACs inserted in patients for different lengths of time with measurements of a reference platinum resistance thermometer (PRT). METHODS: PACs were removed and analyzed in 39 patients in whom PACs were inserted for 0 to 5 days. The PACs were placed in <b>calibration</b> <b>baths,</b> and 10 consecutive measurements at each of 7 different temperatures were obtained (36 °C, 36. 5 °C, 37 °C, 38 °C, 38. 3 °C, 39 °C, and 40 °C). The temperature measurements obtained using PACs were compared with measurements obtained using a PRT. Bland-Altman statistical analyses were performed. Outliers, defined as PAC temperature measurements that varied more than ± 0. 3 °C from PRT measurements, were identified. We considered a catheter unfit for clinical diagnostic or therapeutic use if ≥ 15 % of data pairs were outliers. RESULTS: A total of 2730 data pairs were analyzed. Overall, the bias was - 0. 15 °C; the precision was + 0. 13 °C; and the limits of agreement were - 0. 45 °C to + 0. 13 °C. The bias and limits of agreement did not differ according to the age of the catheter or the temperature tested. One hundred fourteen data pairs (4. 2 % [95 % confidence interval, 2. 0 %- 6. 4 %]), involving 13 PACs and mostly from 4 PACs, were outliers. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that temperature measurements obtained using the Edwards Lifesciences PACs are thus sufficiently accurate to be used for clinical temperature monitoring in critically ill patient...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of its}} {{training}} activities, SupAgro – Institut des Régions Chaudes (IRC), {{an agricultural}} engineering school in Montpellier, has introduced an applied training session in metrology for its students. This was undertaken by the CIRAD metrology platform {{in partnership with the}} agrifood technology platform of the Qualisud Joint Research Unit. The session comprises two hour workshops during which students can apply the basic notions required for metrological monitoring of the quantities “temperature” and “weight”. To that end, standard weights, a temperature calibration device comprising a thermostatically controlled <b>calibration</b> oil <b>bath</b> (uncertainty at k = 2 of 0. 14 °C) and a standard temperature probe with an accuracy of ± 0. 01 °C were made available to the technology platform by the CIRAD metrology platform. During practical work, these COFRAC calibrated instruments are used to check balances and, in particular, make students {{aware of the importance of}} parameters that might influence the temperature measurement of a thermostatically controlled bath (homogeneity, resolution and accuracy of the thermometers, measurement repeatability, etc.). To that end, the Qualisud team specifically adapted a water bath so as to be able to position several temperature probes at different places in the bath. Students have to acquire an approach that needs to take into account a particular measuring context. The teaching scenario of the training session is structured around these metrological checks proposed directly to the students. The training session takes place each year with 2 nd year students on the SAADS 2 /IAAS course “Sustainable Agriculture and Agrifood Systems in the South” at SupAgro in Montpellier.

40|$|Onset's HOBO U 22 Water Temp Pros are small, reliable, {{relatively}} inexpensive, self-contained temperature loggers {{that are}} widely used in studies of oceans, lakes, and streams. An in-house temperature <b>bath</b> <b>calibration</b> of 158 Temp Pros indicated root-mean-square (RMS) errors ranging from 0. 01 ° to 0. 14 °C, with one value of 0. 23 °C, consistent with the factory specifications. Application of a quadratic calibration correction substantially reduced the RMS error to less than 0. 009 °C in all cases. The primary correction was a bias error typically between - 0. 1 ° and 0. 15 °C. Comparison of water temperature measurements from Temp Pros and more accurate temperature loggers during two oceanographic studies indicates that calibrated Temp Pros have an RMSerror of~ 0. 02 °C throughout the water column at night and beneath the surface layer influenced by penetrating solar radiation during the day. Larger RMS errors (up to 0. 08 °C) are observed near the surface during the day due to solar heating of the black Temp Pro housing. Errors due to solar heating are significantly reduced by wrapping the housing with white electrical tape. © 2013 American Meteorological Society...|$|R
