5|$|In the wild, the diets of Campbell's dwarf hamsters vary {{across the}} {{population}} range. A total of 51 {{different species of}} plants were identified to be <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Transbaikalia population, the most common being Stipa capillata and species of Allium. However, in Tuva, only 10 species of plant were identified to be <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> population, the most common being Potentilla. Campbell's dwarf hamster is a natural predator of burrowing worms and grubs.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} large numbers of organisms {{actually}} <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E

Set {{in the village of}} Umuaro {{at the start of the}} twentieth century, the novel tells the story of Ezeulu, a Chief Priest of Ulu. Shocked by the power of British intervention in the area, he orders his son to learn the foreigners' secret. As with Okonkwo in Things Fall Apart and Obi in No Longer at Ease, Ezeulu is <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> resulting tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E

At the ensuing council of war, {{when it was}} debated whether to destroy the entire Temple, Alexander voted with the majority who favored preservation.

5|$|Premastication, pre-chewing, or kiss feeding is the act {{of chewing}} food {{for the purpose of}} {{physically}} breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the food by themselves. This is often done by the mother or relatives of a baby to produce baby food capable of being <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> child during the weaning process.

5|$|Some social wasps are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} fallen fruit, nectar, and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male wasps {{sometimes}} visit flowers to obtain nectar. Some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to locations where they previously found prey to forage. In many social species, the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly <b>consumed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> adults. These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein-building nutrients that are otherwise unavailable to the adults (who cannot digest proteins).|$|E
5|$|Some species, such as Gryllus assimilis, take off, fly, {{and land}} {{efficiently}} and well, while other species are clumsy fliers. In some species, the hind wings are shed, leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight.
