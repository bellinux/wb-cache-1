5000|$|... ==Coastal {{sand dune}} management== [...] Coastal sand dunes fringe {{thousands}} of Kilometres of coastline around the world. They {{are made up}} of continuous, hummocky hills of sand that are held together by specially adapted sand dune vegetation. [...] See Figure 1. These plants have adaptations that allow them to survive in sand dune habitats, these include adaptations to a moving substrate which <b>covers</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovers</b> its roots, adaptation to desiccation, to strong winds carrying salt and sand and to wildly changing temperatures. Coastal sand dunes formed during a time of low sea level where sand and sediments on the foreshore became exposed and in conjunction with sufficient winds, this sand was transported up the beach face via a process known as saltation. [...] Once sufficient wind (>15 km/hr) mobilises sand particles they become trapped in vegetation or drift wood {{at the back of the}} beach, sand then continues to accumulate among the vegetation and over time slowly builds up the dunes we see today. Sand dunes serve an important purpose by protecting inland areas from coastal water intrusion. They are able to absorb the impact and protect inland areas from high energy storms and act as a resilient barrier to the destructive forces of wind and waves.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are serious}} {{disadvantages}} to running many engines backwards under load {{for any length}} of time, and some of these reasons are general, applying equally to both two-stroke and four-stroke engines. This disadvantage is accepted in most cases where cost, weight and size are major considerations. The problem comes about because in [...] "forwards" [...] running the major thrust face of the piston is on the back face of the cylinder which, in a two-stroke particularly, is the coolest and best-lubricated part. The forward face of the piston in a trunk engine is less well-suited to be the major thrust face since it <b>covers</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovers</b> the exhaust port in the cylinder, the hottest part of the engine, where piston lubrication is at its most marginal. The front face of the piston is also more vulnerable since the exhaust port, the largest in the engine, is in the front wall of the cylinder. Piston skirts and rings risk being extruded into this port, so it is always better to have them pressing hardest on the opposite wall (where there are only the transfer ports in a crossflow engine) and there is good support. In some engines, the small end is offset to reduce thrust in the intended rotational direction and the forward face of the piston has been made thinner and lighter to compensate - but when running backwards, this weaker forward face suffers increased mechanical stress it was not designed to resist. This can be avoided by the use of crossheads and also using thrust bearings to isolate the engine from end loads.|$|E
40|$|When {{an object}} moves, it <b>covers</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovers</b> texture in the background. This pattern {{of change is}} {{sufficient}} to define the object’s shape, velocity, relative depth, and degree of transparency, a process called Spatiotemporal Boundary Formation (SBF). We recently proposed a mathematical framework for SBF, where texture transformations are used to recover local edge segments, estimate the figure’s velocity and then reconstruct its shape. The model predicts that SBF should be sensitive to spatiotemporal noise, since the spurious transformations {{will lead to the}} recovery of incorrect edge orientations. Here we tested this prediction by adding a patch of dynamic noise (either directly over the figure or a fixed distance away from it). Shape recognition performance in humans decreased to chance levels when noise was placed over the figure but was not affected by noise far away. These results confirm the model’s prediction and also imply that SBF is a local process...|$|E
40|$|The {{links between}} {{unionisation}} and job satisfaction remain controversial. In {{keeping with the}} existing literature we find strong statistically significant negative correlations between unionisation and overall job satisfaction. However, {{in contrast to the}} previous literature we find that once one accounts for fixed unobservable differences between <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovered</b> employees, union coverage is positively and significantly associated with satisfaction with pay and hours of work. Failure to account for fixed unobservable differences between <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovered</b> employees leads to a systematic underestimate of the positive effects of coverage on job satisfaction for both union members and non-members. It seems union coverage has a positive impact on job satisfaction that is plausibly causal. ...|$|R

40|$|Real-time in-situ {{visualization}} {{has been}} a subject of intensive re-search and development {{during the last decade}} [2], [6], [8]. Besides accuracy and speed of the systems one of the challenges to improve acceptance of medical AR is to overcome the misleading depth per-ception caused by superimposed virtual entities of the AR scene onto real imagery, e. g. virtual tissue and bones occlude real skin. Occlusion is the most effective depth cue [3] and let e. g. the visu-alized spinal column appear in front of the real skin. We present a technique to tackle this problem. A virtual window overlaid onto the real skin of the patient creates the feeling of getting a view {{on the inside of the}} patient. This view is restricted by the frame of the window, however, due to motion of the observer the frame <b>covers</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovers</b> fragments of the visualized bones and tissue and en-ables the depth cues motion parallax and occlusion, which rectify the perceptive misinformation.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} in-situ {{visualization}} of medical data taken from CT or MRI scans in real-time using a video see-through {{head mounted display}} (HMD). One of the challenges to improve acceptance of augmented reality (AR) for medical purpose is to overcome the misleading depth perception. This problem {{is caused by a}} restriction of such systems. Virtual entities of the AR scene can only be presented superimposed onto real imagery. Occlusion is the most effective depth cue [1] and let e. g. a correctly positioned visualization of the spinal column appear in front of the real skin. We present a technique to handle this problem and introduce a Virtual Window superimposed onto the real skin of the patient to create the feeling of getting a view {{on the inside of the}} patient. Due to motion of the observer the frame of the window <b>covers</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovers</b> fragments of the visualized bones and tissue and enables the depth cues motion parallax and occlusion, which correct the perceptive misinformation. An earlier experiment has shown the perceptive advantage of the window. Therefore seven different visualization modes of the spinal column were evaluated regarding depth perception.

40|$|We {{examine the}} light and color {{evolution}} of the T Tauri binary KH 15 D through photometry obtained at wavelengths between 0. 55 and 8. 0  μm. The data were collected with A Novel Dual Imaging CAMera (ANDICAM) on the 1. 3 m SMARTS telescope at Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory and with InfraRed Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We show that the system's circumbinary ring, which acts as a screen that <b>covers</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovers</b> different portions of the binary orbit as the ring precesses, has reached an orientation where the brighter component (star B) fully or nearly fully emerges during each orbital cycle. The fainter component (star A) remains fully occulted by the screen at all phases. The {{leading and trailing edges}} of the screen move across the sky at the same rate of ~ 15 m s− 1, consistent with expectation for a ring with a radius and width of ~ 4 au and a precession period of ~ 6500 years. Light and color variations continue to indicate that the screen is sharp edged and opaque at VRIJH wavelengths. However, we find an increasing transparency of the ring edge at 2. 2, 3. 6, and 4. 5  μm. Reddening seen {{at the beginning of the}} eclipse that occurred during the CSI 2264 campaign particularly suggests selective extinction by a population of large dust grains. Meanwhile, the gradual bluing observed while star B is setting is indicative of forward scattering effects at the edge of the ring. The spectral energy distribution of the system at its bright phase shows no evidence of infrared excess emission that can be attributed to radiation from the ring or other dust component out to 8  μm...|$|E

40|$|Background: Phototherapy may {{alter the}} morphologic {{features}} of melanocytic nevi. Dermoscopy is a non-invasive method {{for evaluation of}} skin lesions, specifically melanocytic nevi. Aims and Objectives: This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effects of narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) and psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy on the dermoscopic features of nevi. Methods: A total of 74 melanocytic nevi were randomly selected from 20 patients. Out of those, 54 nevi received NB-UVB, while 20 received PUVA. 50 % of the nevi in each group were exposed to radiation, while the remaining nevi were covered with an opaque tape. All nevi were demoscopically evaluated before and after 30 or 60 sessions of phototherapy. Results: Overall demoscopic changes were observed in 34 / 37 (91. 8 %) of the uncovered nevi compared to 16 / 37 (43. 2 %) of the covered nevi (P value 0. 0001). The most common changes were new dot/globule formation (62. 1 %), darkening (32. 4 %), nevus enlargement (27 %), and patchy pigmentation (18. 8 %). Compared to NB-UVB, dermoscopic changes were more frequent in both <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovered</b> nevi of the PUVA group. (P values 0. 041 and 0. 0172, respectively). New dot/globule formation was observed more frequently in the <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovered</b> nevi of PUVA group. Conclusion: PUVA and NB-UVB induce dermoscopic changes in the majority of the irradiated nevi. However, PUVA is associated with higher frequency of dermoscopic changes in both <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>uncovered</b> nevi...|$|R
