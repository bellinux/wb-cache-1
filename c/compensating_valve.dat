25|$|The {{compensating}} euphonium {{is common}} among professionals. It utilizes a three-plus-one-valve system with three upright valves and one side valve. The <b>compensating</b> <b>valve</b> system uses extra tubing, usually coming {{off of the}} back of the three upright valves, in order to achieve proper intonation in the lower range of the instrument. This range being from E2 down to B1. Not all four-valve and three-plus-one-valve euphoniums are compensating. Only those designed with extra tubing are compensating. There were, at one time, three-valve compensating euphoniums available. This configuration utilized extra tubing, just as the three-plus-one compensating models did, in order to bring the notes C2 and B1 in tune. This three-valve compensating configuration is still available in British style baritone horns, usually on professional models.|$|E
5000|$|Temperature compensation: A {{temperature}} <b>compensating</b> <b>valve</b> {{tends to}} eliminate the issue where the temperature and pressure from tankless heaters decrease during continuous use. Most new generation tankless water heaters stabilize water pressure and temperature by a bypass valve and a mixing valve incorporated in the unit. Modern tankless are not inversely proportional, because they regulate {{the amount of water}} they heat and discharge, and therefore stabilize water temperature by using a flow control valve. Temperature change, not flow speed, is the issue the water heater must address. The wider the temperature rise, the less flow from the unit—the smaller the temperature rise, the greater the flow. The flow control valve, in conjunction with thermistors, maintains a stable temperature throughout the use of the unit.|$|E

50|$|Some tubas have a {{compensating}} {{system to}} allow accurate tuning when using several valves in combination, simplifying fingering and removing {{the need to}} constantly adjust slide positions. The most popular of the automatic compensation systems was invented by Blaikley (Bevan, 1874) and was patented by Boosey (later, Boosey and Hawkes, which also, later still, produced Besson instruments). The patent on the system limited its application outside of Britain, {{and to this day}} tubas with <b>compensating</b> <b>valves</b> are primarily popular in the United Kingdom and countries of the former British Empire. The Blaikley design plumbs the instrument so that if the fourth valve is used, the air is sent back through a second set of branches in the first three <b>valves</b> to <b>compensate</b> for the combination of valves. This does have the disadvantage of making the instrument significantly more 'stuffy' or resistant to air flow when compared to a non-compensating tuba. This is due to the need for the air to flow through the valves twice. It also makes the instrument heavier. But many prefer this approach to additional valves or to manipulation of tuning slides while playing to achieve improved intonation within an ensemble. Most modern professional-grade euphoniums also now feature Blaikley-style <b>compensating</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R

40|$|Control valves are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} final control element in the chemical process industries. However, the behavior of valves (i. e., {{the manner in which}} the valve output flow rate changes in response to changes in the control signal to the valve) can contribute to a number of negative effects in a control loop, such as set-point tracking issues and sustained closed-loop oscillations. Valve stiction, for example, is a dynamic valve nonlinearity (i. e., the relationship between the valve output flow rate and the control signal to the valve is described by nonlinear differential equations) resulting from friction that is known to be problematic in the process industries. This dissertation describes the impact of valve behavior on process control loops and methods for <b>compensating</b> for the <b>valve</b> behavior through appropriate control designs. It begins by describing how the addition of input rate of change constraints to an optimization-based control design with a general objective function (economic model predictive control (EMPC)) can be performed in a manner that may reduce actuator wear while simultaneously guaranteeing feasibility of the controller and closed-loop stability of a nonlinear process operated under the control design. It then focuses on a specific type of actuator (a valve) and elucidates that coupled, nonlinear interactions between the process and valve model states and any internal states of the controller model create the negative effects that may be observed in control loops containing valves for which the dynamics cannot be neglected (e. g., valves subject to significant stiction). These multivariable interactions illustrate the closed-loop nature of the negative effects observed, and this closed-loop perspective is then used to analyze stiction compensation methods from the literature, to develop a novel stiction compensation scheme for control loops under proportional-integral control, and to demonstrate that incorporating models, both first-principles and empirical, of valve behavior within the model used for making state predictions in a model predictive controller is an effective means for <b>compensating</b> for <b>valve</b> behavior in general. The benefits of adding actuation magnitude and input rate of change constraints within EMPC including a model of stiction dynamics are discussed. Throughout the work, process examples are utilized to illustrate the advanced control-based frameworks for understanding and <b>compensating</b> for <b>valve</b> limitations...|$|R

40|$|Atlas Copco Surface Drilling Equipment {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{manufacturers}} of surface drill rigs. To stay in the top segment it is of great importance to have a well functioning development strategy as well as rig functions that makes the work as easy as possible for the operator. In this master thesis one development strategy has been evaluated and a dub tip control has been developed from idea to test on rig.   Today the conventional method to position the drill is to use two joysticks with three axes each where each axis corresponds to one hydraulic actuator on the boom and feeder structure. The dub tip control system enables the operator to position the drill in Cartesian coordinates with only one 3 -axes joystick. After the definition of the desired drill angle is done, the control system makes sure that this angle is obtained throughout the positioning motion. This system makes it considerably easier for an inexperienced operator to position the drill.   For development, simulation and verification of the control algorithms and regulators Matlab/Simulink has been used. To test the control system on rig, a configuration with LabVIEW together with a compactDAQ has been evaluated. LabVIEW is chosen because it provides the opportunity to create a user friendly graphical user interface. To use this configuration is however not recommended for persons with little or none experience from using LabVIEW.   This development strategy can be used for tests and verifications of control algorithms, but since neither Windows nor the compactDAQ are real time systems, there are solutions that are better but of course to a higher price.   The master thesis work has shown that it is possible to implement a dub tip control on a rig of this dimension. It has also concluded that <b>compensated</b> <b>valves</b> are necessary to achieve optimal performance of a velocity controlled dub tip positioning...|$|R

From the viewpoint of designing and tuning an efficient control system, an excavator is a very complex nonlinear plant. To design and tune such a complex control system an extremely good nonlinear model of the plant is necessary. The problem of modeling an excavator is considered in this document; a nonlinear mathematical model of an excavator has been developed using the AMESim® modeling environment to replicate actual operating conditions. The excavator model is described by detailed models of the main pump, mobile valve block, actuators and a completely developed kinematic model. The objective of this research is to develop a complete simulation model of an excavator with the capability of reproducing the actual characteristics of the system. This part presents the developed model of a complete excavator system with detailed verification of individual components and preliminary results of a complete excavator system.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Tracheal gas {{insufflation}} (TGI) {{can increase}} total positive end-expiratory pressure (total-PEEP) when flow is {{delivered in a}} forward direction, necessitating adjustments to maintain total-PEEP constant. When TGI is delivered throughout the respiratory cycle, additional adjustments are needed to maintain tidal volume (VT) constant. OBJECTIVE: Determine if bidirectional TGI (bi-TGI) (simultaneous flows toward the lungs and upper airway) in combination with a flow relief valve eliminates the increase in total-PEEP and maintains a constant V T, thus simplifying TGI administration. METHODS: Using an artificial lung model and pressure control ventilation, we studied the effect of TGI at 10 L/min on inspired V T, total-PEEP, and CO 2 elimination during 6 conditions: (1) control (no TGI, no catheter in the airway), (2) baseline (catheter in the airway but no TGI), (3) continuous TGI, (4) expiratory TGI, (5) reverse TGI, and (6) bi-TGI. Each condition was studied under 3 inspiration-expiration ratios (1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 2 : 1). A preset flow relief valve was inserted into the ventilator circuit during all TGI conditions with continuous flow. SETTING: University research laboratory. RESULTS: CO 2 elimination efficiency was similar under all conditions. Total-PEEP increased with continuous TGI and expiratory TGI, decreased during reverse TGI, and was unchanged during bi-TGI. With the flow relief valve in place, and no adjustment in mechanical ventilation, the change in minute ventilation ranged from 0 % to 10 %, with the least change during bi-TGI (0 - 5 %). During bi-TGI, gas flow was equivalent in both directions during dynamic conditions and the flow relief valve consistently removed gas at 10 L/min under various pressures. CONCLUSIONS: Our data from an artificial lung model support that continuous bi-TGI minimizes the change in total-PEEP seen during other TGI modalities. The flow relief <b>valve</b> <b>compensated</b> for the extra gas volume delivered by the TGI catheter, thereby eliminating {{the need to make}} ventilator adjustments.

40|$|Heavy load equipment, such as tractors, shovels, cranes, airplanes, etc, often employ {{fluid power}} (i. e. hydraulic) systems {{to control their}} loads by way of valve {{adjustment}} in a pump-valve control configuration. Most of these systems have low energy efficiency {{as a consequence of}} pressure losses across throttle valves. Much of the energy is converted into heat energy which can have determinantal effects on component life and the surrounding environment. From an energy efficiency point of view, an ideal hydraulic system is one that does not include any throttling valve. One such circuit is made of a variable pump and motor load (pump/motor configuration). The velocity of the load is controlled by manipulating the pump displacement or by changing the rotary speed of the pump shaft. In such a system, the transient response of the load is often unsatisfactory because it is difficult to quickly and accurately manipulate the pump displacement or change shaft speed. Thus circuit design must be a compromise between the energy efficiency of the pump/motor system and the controllability of a pump/valve/motor combination. One possible compromise is to use a pump-valve configuration which reduces energy losses across the valve. One way to achieve this is by controlling the pressure drop across the valve and limiting it to a small value, independent of load pressure. Based on this idea, a type of hydraulic control system, usually called load-sensing (LS), has recently been used in the flow power area. This type of system, however, is complex and under certain operating conditions exhibits instability problems. Methods for compensating these instabilities are usually based on a trial-and-error approach. Although some research has resulted in the definition of some instability criterion, a comprehensive and verifiable approach is still lacking. This research concentrates on identifying the relationship between system parameters and instability in one particular type of LS system. Due to the high degree of non-linearity in LS systems, the instabilities are dependent on the steady state operating point. The study therefore concentrates first on identifying all of the steady state operating points and then classifying them into three steady state operating regions. A dynamic model for each operating region is developed to predict the presence of instabilities. Each model is then validated experimentally. This procedure, used {{in the study of the}} LS system, is also applied to a pressure <b>compensated</b> (PC) <b>valve.</b> A PC valve is one in which the flow rate is independent in variations to load pressure. A system which combines a LS pump and a PC valve (for the controlling orifice) is called a load sensing pressure compensated (LSPC) system. This research, then, examines the dynamic performance of the LSPC system using the operating points and steady state operating regions identified in the first part of the research. The original contributions of this research include: (a) establishment of three steady state operating conditions defined as “Condition I, II & III”, which are based on the solution of steady state non-linear equations; (b) the provision of an empirical model of the orifice discharge coefficient suitable for laminar and turbulent flow, and the transition region between them; (c) and the development of an analytical expression for orifice flow which makes it possible to accurately model and simulate a hydraulic system with pilot stage valve or pump/motor compensator. These contributions result in a practical and reliable method to determine the stability of a LS or LSPC system at any operating point and to optimize the design of the LS or LSPC system...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} a forced-commutated voltage source {{converter}} (VSC) connected to a grid in a wind energy application. The work consists of four parts. The first part addresses the type of electrical system which {{should be used in}} a wind turbine. The conclusion is to use variable-speed wind turbines, due to higher efficiency, lower noise and lower fatigue. If high power quality is demanded, a grid-connected VSC should be used instead of a grid-commutated thyristor inverter. By utilizing the high current control bandwidth of the VSC in a hybrid wind farm, consisting of wind turbines having different electrical systems, a cost-efficient solution is obtained. The VSC is used for reactive power compensation and active filtering, in addition to converting wind power. These additional features cause only a moderate increase in the VSC rating compared with only converting wind power. In part two, an electrical system in a variable-speed wind turbine, in which the VSC uses the voltage angle control to track the reference voltage of the dc-link, is investigated. The proposed control method is based on a steady-state model of the system, which results in a low bandwidth but which is high enough to operate a wind turbine. To increase the bandwidth, the linear quadratic (LQ) control method has been introduced. Due to sensitivity to current harmonics, an extended Kalman filter has been added to the LQ-controller. Simulations show that the controller operates as expected. A grid-connected VSC using a discrete vector current controller is investigated in the third part of the thesis. The influences of an incorrect controller tuning and grid voltage harmonics on current frequency responses at an operating point are investigated. The attenuation of low-frequency voltage harmonics decreases when their frequency increases. Furthermore, it is shown that the current controller handles parameter errors satisfactorily. It has been shown that frequency dependent losses in the grid filter affect current frequency responses at high frequencies. A compensation function has been introduced to <b>compensate</b> for non-ideal <b>valves</b> and non-ideal pulse width modulation. The function improves the small-signal current frequency response around an operating point. Also four different synchronization methods, which are adapted to digital controllers, have been investigated. A novel transformation angle detector based on a space vector filter has been introduced. The detector manages phase steps in the grid voltage, and the extended version of the detector also manages frequency changes in the grid better than the extended Kalman filtered detector, in spite of the smaller number of calculations. The last part of the thesis deals with the current harmonics of a grid-connected VSC. By introducing a third-order LCL-filter as an alternative to an L-filter, current harmonics are decreased. Furthermore, reflections caused by high voltage derivatives are adressed...|$|R
