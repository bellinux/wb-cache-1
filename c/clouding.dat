5|$|Synchronous {{spawning}} is very typical on {{the coral}} reef, and often, even when multiple species are present, all corals spawn {{on the same}} night. This synchrony is essential so male and female gametes can meet. Corals rely on environmental cues, varying from species to species, to determine the proper time to release gametes into the water. The cues involve temperature change, lunar cycle, day length, and possibly chemical signalling. Synchronous spawning may form hybrids and is perhaps involved in coral speciation. The immediate cue is most often sunset, which cues the release. The spawning event can be visually dramatic, <b>clouding</b> the usually clear water with gametes.|$|E
5|$|The news of Daenerys's {{pregnancy}} {{reaches the}} Small Council, delivered {{by one of}} Varys's spies. Fearing a possible invasion by the Targaryen/Dothraki alliance, Robert orders {{that she and her}} unborn child, along with Viserys, be assassinated. Ned refuses to obey such a dishonorable order since Robert's hatred for Targaryens is <b>clouding</b> his judgment and ordering such an assassination will make him no better than the Mad King. When Robert's mind is clearly made, Ned resigns the office of Hand of the King, much to Robert's anger. As Robert drinks in sorrow over his fight with Ned, Cersei visits Robert and he explains why he takes the Dothraki threat seriously. Meanwhile, Robert's youngest brother Renly is with his lover, Ser Loras. Loras convinces Renly that he should be king because Loras believes that Renly would be a better ruler than either his brothers or nephews.|$|E

5|$|Grant was {{president}} during the Gilded Age, {{a time of}} massive industrial wealth, railroad speculation, and extravagance that fueled unethical behavior and influence in government offices. Although Grant was not personally involved in scandal, multiple corruption charges swept through his administration, <b>clouding</b> Grant's historical reputation. Grant was greatly trusting of men involved in speculation, particularly wealthy Gilded Age tycoons, loyally defending his corrupt cabinet or appointees whom he believed were innocent. Grant's failure was in his poor selection of cabinet officers and how he responded to their downfalls. Grant did not stop the guilty parties prosecutions, but was often insistent about having them prosecuted. His political enemies, outraged over the scandals, were eager to discredit Reconstruction, and the moral integrity of his administration. No person linked any of the scandals together, except possibly Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock, who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed federal investigations. Historians debate how effective he was at halting corruption.|$|E

The {{products are}} the ESA (European Space Agency) Level 2 (L 2) version 5. 02 <b>cloud</b> top height and the FRESCO (Fast Retrieval Scheme for <b>Clouds</b> from the Oxygen A band) version 6 <b>cloud</b> height. The radar/lidar profiles are obtained at the Cloudnet sites of Cabauw and Lindenberg, and are averaged for 1 h centered at the SCIAMACHY overpass time. In total we have 217 cases of single-layer <b>clouds</b> and 204 cases of multilayer <b>clouds.</b> We {{find that the}} ESA L 2 <b>cloud</b> top height has a better agreement with the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> top height than the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> middle height. The ESA L 2 <b>cloud</b> top height is on average 0. 4 km higher than the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> top height, {{with a standard deviation}} of 3. 1 km. The FRESCO <b>cloud</b> height is closer to the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> middle height than the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> top height. The mean difference between the FRESCO <b>cloud</b> height and the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> middle height is − 0. 1 km {{with a standard deviation of}} 1. 9 km. The ESA L 2 <b>cloud</b> top height is higher than the FRESCO <b>cloud</b> height. The differences between the SCIAMACHY <b>cloud</b> (top) height and the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> top height are linked to <b>cloud</b> optical thickness. The SCIAMACHY <b>cloud</b> height products are further compared to the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> top height and the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> middle height in 1 km bins. For single-layer <b>clouds,</b> the difference between the ESA L 2 <b>cloud</b> top height and the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> top height is less than 1 km for each <b>cloud</b> bin at 3 – 7 km. The difference between the FRESCO <b>cloud</b> height and the Cloudnet <b>cloud</b> middle height is less than 1 km for each <b>cloud</b> bin at 0 – 6 km. The results are similar for multilayer <b>clouds,</b> but the percentage of cases having a bias within 1 km is smaller than for single-layer <b>clouds.</b> We may conclude that the FRESCO <b>cloud</b> height is accurate for low and middle level <b>clouds,</b> whereas the ESA L 2 <b>cloud</b> top height is more accurate for middle level <b>clouds.</b> Both products are less accurate for high <b>clouds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Hourly {{satellite}} <b>cloud</b> {{data from}} 18 June to 18 July 1997 over the U.

The observed <b>clouds</b> are classified into high, midlevel, and low <b>clouds</b> according to their top heights. For each <b>cloud</b> type, contribution to the total <b>cloud</b> amount from <b>clouds</b> of different sizes is determined using a Lagrangian <b>cloud</b> classification scheme. It is found that in this continental, convectively active environment, {{more than half of}} the total <b>cloud</b> amount is from high <b>clouds,</b> of which 80 % comes from <b>clouds</b> with area. 4 3 104 km 2. For midlevel <b>clouds,</b> more than 50 % of the contribution to <b>cloud</b> amount is from small <b>clouds</b> (e. g., <b>cloud</b> area, 4 3 104 km 2). Almost all of the low <b>clouds</b> with significant contribution to <b>cloud</b> amount have spatial scales, 4 3 104 km 2. This suggests that most of the midlevel and low <b>clouds</b> are of subgrid scale to a typical GCM resolution (T 42 or T 63). It is further found that <b>cloud</b> radiative properties, such as <b>cloud</b> albedo, outgoing longwave radiation, and <b>cloud</b> radiative forcing, have strong scale dependence. Bigger <b>clouds</b> are brighter and have lower outgoing longwave radiation.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of <b>cloud</b> market mechanism we imagine that if a <b>cloud</b> broker represents a <b>cloud</b> provider, then the <b>cloud</b> broker may provide information which favors that <b>cloud</b> provider; however, if a broker is independent, and its business depends on the trust relations with users, the broker is more motivated to find and provide information being truly helpful for <b>cloud</b> users.

Consistent with the above view, we further imagine that if a <b>cloud</b> broker is highly trusted by some <b>cloud</b> users (especially, end <b>cloud</b> users), the broker may become those <b>cloud</b> users’ trust anchor, taking care of trust management for those <b>cloud</b> users.|$|R

25|$|The {{cause of}} {{amblyopia}} {{can be any}} condition that interferes with focusing during early childhood.
