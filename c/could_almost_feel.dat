5|$|A classic {{victory was}} within his grasp but he <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> his adversary's breath on his neck. Somehow Garin {{held on to}} his lead of two metres, two little metres for a legendary victory. The stands {{exploded}} and the ovation united the two men. Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.|$|E
25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. I felt the rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra became {{increasingly}} {{frustrated with the}} status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group, but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey for $125 a week at Palmer House in Chicago, and James agreed amicably to release Sinatra from his contract. On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with [...] "Stardust". Dorsey recalled: [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matinée idol. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos". Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940. Sinatra later said that [...] "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey". Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals, other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.|$|E

60|$|Now, why had {{the fellow}} said that? Curious how this desperate secret feeling {{of his own}} made him see {{sinister}} meaning in this servant, in Oliver's visit of last night--in everything. It was vile--this suspiciousness! He <b>could</b> <b>feel,</b> <b>almost</b> see, himself deteriorating already, with this furtive feeling in his soul. It would soon be written on his face! But what {{was the use of}} troubling? What would come, would--one way or the other.|$|R
60|$|Having once taken a {{first step}} in the new direction, I soon {{followed}} it up, without hesitation, by taking many others. Whenever I wished to call oftener than once a-day at North Villa, I had but to tell Mr. Mannion, and the next morning I found the permission immediately accorded to me by the ruling power. The same secret machinery enabled me to regulate Mr. Sherwin's incomings and outgoings, just as I chose, when Margaret and I were together in the evening. I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>almost</b> certain, now, of never having any one with us, but Mrs. Sherwin, unless I desired it--which, as may be easily imagined, was seldom enough.|$|R
2500|$|Jakala commended the art because [...] "Tsugihara helps {{distinguish}} characters {{by giving}} everyone distinctive looks." [...] Further, he appreciated how the detailing on body language and facial expressions, saying, [...] "In one scene, I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> {{the intensity of}} Sakuragi's gaze coming off the page." [...] RAC's commenator also asserted there are [...] "lots of careful shots of people's faces to show their reactions", and deemed Tsugihara's art very suitable to the series, calling it [...] "a solid, straight-forward style" [...] and comparing it to storyboards for a television show or a film.|$|E
2500|$|Dwaine Stevenson as [...] "Sammael"/Michael: The {{most feared}} and {{faithful}} Fallen, Michael seeks {{control of the}} city to challenge what he calls a lack of freedom in the followers of the Light. Stevenson was attracted to the character's difficulties, finding the role confronting and challenging. He describes playing the role as [...] "a very intimidating process and a lonely one. Each day I turned up to set, and began getting dressed, I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> the character laughing at me saying, ‘Well, let’s see what you get today.’" [...] One critic summarised his impression of the character as [...] "Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails wearing ping-pong balls as contact lenses." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Colts {{began their}} first {{offensive}} series {{on their own}} 27-yard line. Quarterback Earl Morrall completed a 19-yard pass to tight end John Mackey and then running back Tom Matte ran for 10 yards to place {{the ball on the}} Jets' 44-yard line. Jerry Hill's runs of 7 and 5 yards picked up another Colts first down, then Morrall's pass to tight end Tom Mitchell gained 15 yards on third and thirteen and saw the ball placed at the Jets' 19-yard line. In scoring position, Morrall attempted to score quickly against a reeling Jets defense. Receiver Willie Richardson dropped Morrall's pass on first down followed by an incompletion on second down after Mitchell was overthrown. On third down, none of his receivers were open and Morrall was tackled at the line of scrimmage by Al Atkinson. Michaels was brought out to attempt a 27-yard field goal, but it was wide left. [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> the steam go out of them," [...] said Snell.|$|E
60|$|After a {{time this}} {{absolute}} silence which she <b>almost</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> pressing upon her {{on all sides}} induced in Mrs. Travers a state of hallucination. She saw herself standing alone, {{at the end of}} time, on the brink of days. All was unmoving as if the dawn would never come, the stars would never fade, the sun would never rise any more; all was mute, still, dead--as if the shadow of the outer darkness, the shadow of the uninterrupted, of the everlasting night that fills the universe, the shadow of the night so profound and so vast that the blazing suns lost in it are only like sparks, like pin-points of fire, the restless shadow that like a suspicion of an evil truth darkens everything upon the earth on its passage, had enveloped her, had stood arrested as if to remain with her forever.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{she does}} see me,' whispered Oliver, folding his hands together; 'perhaps she has sat by me. I <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> {{as if she}} had.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl smiled. [...] "No," [...] she said; [...] "I {{managed to}} sleep through {{a good deal}} of it, and now I <b>feel</b> <b>almost</b> as fresh as if I had stayed ashore. Besides, this would make up for anything. One <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> wish we <b>could</b> sail south with the topsail up under the moonlight--forever. In spite of the bad weather, I have been so well since I came to sea." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Acton smiled. [...] "I <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> that I <b>could</b> shake both of you, but I suppose I {{shall have}} to marshal my forces on your behalf." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That has eased her, a bit," [...] Fairclough said, when Hardy rejoined him. [...] "They {{helped to}} pin her down, and I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> the difference, as each gun went overboard." ...|$|E
60|$|Thirty-six {{hours later}} Carter, alone with Lingard {{in the cabin}} of the brig, <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> during a pause in his talk the oppressive, the breathless peace of the Shallows {{awaiting}} another sunset.|$|E
60|$|He was {{suddenly}} intensely moved. He {{was filled with}} the warmth of her. In the glow he <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> {{her as if she were}} present--her arms, her shoulders, her bosom, see them, feel them, almost contain them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do want to," [...] {{she assured}} him. [...] "I {{want to tell}} you everything. I think--somehow I <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> that {{you have the right to}} know." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a January 2016 {{interview}} with CBS, Trump {{said of his}} campaign's plans to purchase advertising; [...] "I think I'm probably wasting the money. But I'm $35 million under budget. Look, I {{was going to have}} 35 or 40 million spent by now. I haven't spent anything. I <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> guilty … I'm leading by, as you all say, a lot. You can take the CBS poll. You can take any poll and I'm winning by a lot. I don't think I need the ads. But I'm doing them. I <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> guilty." ...|$|R

60|$|She {{could not}} see Chauvelin, but she <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> those keen, pale eyes of his fixed maliciously upon her {{helpless}} form, and his hurried, whispered words reached her ear, as the death-knell of her last faint, lingering hope.|$|E
60|$|Now {{it must be}} {{understood}} that we could see nothing; the darkness was so intense that one <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> it, and yet we proposed to blunder in upon enemies who would probably shoot without warning {{in the direction of}} the slightest suspicious noise.|$|E
60|$|When we {{had reached}} a point some ten feet from the secret doorway I halted my companion, and cautioning him to remain {{absolutely}} motionless until I gave the prearranged signal I quickly turned {{my back to the}} door through which I <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> the burning and baleful eyes of our would be executioner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> that we {{have been}} wrong," [...] said Mrs Dale; [...] "but in truth I never thought that the matter would be to him one of so much moment." ...|$|R
30|$|It <b>almost</b> <b>feels</b> {{like there}} is a taboo against talking about (lower) speed limits. Kind of like it’s not really {{politically}} correct. Instead it’s important to drive fast (interview traffic safety engineer).|$|R

6000|$|... {{could never}} mean to our brown companions {{what they meant}} to us; but they put on a polite air of being {{interested}} in the Graeco-Roman ruin, and were so gentle and friendly that one <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> they were fellow-men. Very likely they were; at any rate, until {{we are at war}} with them I shall believe so.|$|E
60|$|Greed had {{prompted}} him to an act, the discovery of which by his companion could lead only to the most frightful consequences for Werper. Already he <b>could</b> <b>almost</b> <b>feel</b> those strong, white fangs burying themselves in his neck. He shuddered. Far out across the plain a leopard screamed, and in the dense reeds behind him some great beast moved on padded feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{established}} our bivouac {{along the}} edge of the forest so as to get some shelter for our horses. However, the boisterous north wind had dropped as quickly as it had sprung up, and the great winter stillness lay on the land from the Baltic to the Black Sea.
