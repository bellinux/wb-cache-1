In this paper, we study the impact of congestion in a best-effort IP RAN on CDMA cellular voice networks. We propose and evaluate three congestion control mechanisms, admission control, diversity control, and router control, to maximize network capacity while maintaining good voice quality. We first propose two new enhancements to CDMA call admission control that consider a unified view of both IP RAN and air interface resources. Next, we introduce a novel technique called diversity control that exploits the softhandoff feature of CDMA networks and drops selected frames belonging to multiple soft-handoff legs to gracefully degrade voice quality during congestion. Finally, we study the impact of router control where an active queue management technique is used to reduce delay and minimize correlated losses. Using simulations of a large mobile network, we show that the three different control mechanisms can help gracefully manage 10 - 40 % congestion overload in the IP RAN. I...|$|E

It mainly research the attitude coordinate transformation matrix between the of flexible rope Micro-element and inertial system under the four coordinate system which are the direction cosine coordinates, finite rotation four element coordinates, Euler angle coordinate and Cardan angle coordinates, {{and the relationship between}} the <b>connecting</b> <b>base</b> on the element type and inertial reference based. It generally takes the rope as the flexible body in the dynamics and kinematics analysis process. The analysis method is mainly the finite element analysis method. It divides flexible rope into a number of micro line which is looked as ideal rigid body. Then it uses the multi-body system dynamics theory to do kinematics and dynamics analysis of every micro-element. Kinematics analysis of flexible rope is the inverse problem of gesture analysis that direction cosine matrix of rigid body is known, solving rigid body attitude coordinate. If coordinates of each element is determined, the dynamic attitude of flexible rope can be determined, which is the core of the kinematics analysis. Therefore, primary problem of gesture inverse analysis is how to get th...|$|E

40|$|Testing and {{validation}} of flight hardware in ground-based facilities {{can result in}} significant cost savings and risk reduction. We designed a relative motion emulator for aerospace vehicles using omni-directional mobile bases which provide large 3 degree-of-freedom motion, while Stewart platforms mounted atop these bases allow superposition of limited 6 degree-of-freedom motion. This paper addresses the design {{and implementation of the}} omni-directional mobile base. Each omni-directional base uses a trio of active split offset castor drive modules to provide smooth, holonomic, precise control of its motion. Three encoders on each castor, three optical mice sensors, and a 3 -axis inertial measurement unit provide full feedback information to a kinematics based control law. We built a one-third scale prototype to demonstrate design feasibility and for use in testing and development of data fusion techniques, control laws, and a dynamics model of the full-scale platform. Results presented in the paper validate the feasibility of the design and the approach.

40|$|The {{cost-effective}} {{impact and}} fundamental limits of infrastructure support with rate-limited wired backhaul links (i. e., GreenInfra support), directly <b>connecting</b> <b>base</b> stations (BSs), are analyzed in a large-scale hybrid network of unit node density, where multi-antenna BSs are deployed. We consider a general scenario {{such that the}} rate of each BS-to-BS link scales at an arbitrary rate relative to the number of randomly located wireless nodes, n. For the operating regimes with respect to the number of BSs and the number of antennas at each BS, we first analyze the minimum rate of each backhaul link, C_BS, required to guarantee the same throughput scaling as in the infinite-capacity backhaul link case. We then identify the operating regimes in which the required rate C_BS scales slower than n^ϵ for an arbitrarily small ϵ> 0 (i. e., the regimes where C_BS {{does not need to be}} infinitely large). We also show the case where our network with GreenInfra is fundamentally in the infrastructure-limited regime, in which the performance is limited by the rate of backhaul links. In addition, we derive a generalized throughput scaling law including the case where the rate of each backhaul link scales slower than C_BS. To validate the throughput scaling law for finite values of system parameters, numerical evaluation is also shown via computer simulations.
