25|$|Kakuma is {{situated}} in the second poorest region in Kenya {{and as a result}} of this poverty, there are ongoing tensions between the refugees and the local <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> occasionally resulted in violence. Compared to the wider region, the Kakuma camp has better health facilities and a higher percentage of children in full-time education, which resulted in a general notion that the refugees were better off than the locals. The host community is composed largely of nomadic pastoralists who stick to their traditions and don't co-operate with refugees. Camp is becoming a normal part of the regional socio-economic landscape and a part of livelihood options available in the region. Kakuma is one of two large refugee camps in Kenya; the second and bigger one is Dadaab.|$|E

Therapists complained that the data does not fully support the attention and funding CBT receives. Psychotherapist and professor Andrew Samuels stated that this constitutes [...] "a coup, a power play by a <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> suddenly found itself on the brink of corralling an enormous amount of money...

2500|$|Business Spectator {{described}} the mixed {{legacy of the}} resilient protest <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been created and galvanisation of youth – a previously apolitical section of society – into political activism or heightened awareness of their civil rights and responsibilities. Against that, the resulting divisions in Hong Kong society will leave a void for Beijing to strengthen its role and influence. The journal also agreed that Hong Kong's institutions had been damaged through government actions as well as inaction. Citing the government and police choice to employ civil injunctions to justify clearing the protest sites, it said [...] "In so doing, the government has called the court system into service as a political tool. This politicisation of the court system is known as 'rule by law', a phrase frequently applied to the PRC and which could now {{be used for the}} first time with some justification in the context of Hong Kong." [...] It further predicts further erosion of press and academic freedoms, as universities have been shown to be seed beds of political activism and potential subversion.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, Bomis {{planned to}} make Wikipedia a {{profitable}} business. Sanger initially saw Wikipedia {{primarily as a}} tool to aid Nupedia development. Wales feared that, at worst, it might produce [...] "complete rubbish". To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching, the number of articles on Wikipedia had outgrown that of Nupedia, and a small collective of editors had formed. It was Jimmy Wales, along with other people, {{who came up with the}} broader idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that would accept contributions from ordinary people. Initially, neither Sanger nor Wales knew what to expect from the Wikipedia initiative. Many of the early contributors to the site were familiar with the model of the free culture movement, and, like Wales, many of them sympathized with the open-source movement. Wales has said that he was initially so worried about the concept of open editing, where anyone can edit the encyclopedia, that he would awaken during the night and monitor what was being added. Nonetheless, the cadre of early editors helped create a robust, self-regulating <b>community</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> proven conducive to the growth of the project.

[...] Yoakum also built the Pisgah Store in Arroyo Seco where donated clothing and other goods were distributed free of charge. [...] There was also a gospel mission in West Los Angeles. [...] In the late 1910s, a local newspaper described the breadth of services provided by Pisgah Home:"Its door is ever open any hour, day or night, to receive the poor, needy, homeless, the drunkard, fallen, or outcast. [...] Across the Arroyo, the 'Ark' makes a home for rescued women and girls. [...] Nearby is the 'Workers' Home,' and the 'Store,' over whose counter no money has ever passed in the five years of its existence. [...] Voluntary contributions keep its supply ever ready for the needs of the many people who apply. [...] Eighteen or twenty miles (32 km) away are the 'Gardens,' [...] of fruit, vegetable and farm land near Lankershim, with [...] under cultivation. [...] Here a hundred more are gathered, a colony of consumptives fighting their way back to health, a group of epileptics and feeble minded, and an orphanage for 'nameless' and homeless children. [...] Apricot, plum and peach trees furnish fruit which is dried by the ton, and cannery preserves much of the fruit which, together with other products, is distributed to the poor, 'without money and without price.'"By 1914, Pisgah Home had outgrown its facilities, and Yoakum bought a 3,300 ranch in the Santa Susana Mountains north of Simi Valley, California.
