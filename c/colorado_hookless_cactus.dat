5000|$|Sclerocactus glaucus is a {{rare species}} of cactus known by the common name <b>Colorado</b> <b>hookless</b> <b>cactus.</b> It is endemic to Colorado in the United States, where it is known only from the area between Grand Junction and Montrose. It is a federally listed {{threatened}} species.|$|E
5000|$|Sclerocactus wetlandicus is a {{rare species}} of cactus known by the common name Uinta Basin <b>hookless</b> <b>cactus.</b> It is endemic to Utah in the United States, where it is known only from the Uinta Basin. It may also be called the Pariette cactus, but this name is more {{appropriate}} for Sclerocactus brevispinus, the species endemic to the Pariette Draw of Duchesne County.|$|R
50|$|The {{description}} {{of this species}} formerly included plants now belonging to Sclerocactus brevispinus and Sclerocactus wetlandicus, two cacti endemic to Utah. When {{the second of the}} two species was separated in 1994, the name S. glaucus was applied only to plants found in Colorado; it made the common name Uinta Basin <b>hookless</b> <b>cactus</b> a misnomer, because now this species does not occur in the Uinta Basin of Utah. The two new species retained their federally threatened status, which they had received while members of S. glaucus. Sources vary in whether they recognize the separation of these species from S. glaucus; Anderson (2001) does not.|$|R
40|$|The Uinta Basin <b>hookless</b> <b>cactus</b> (Sclerocactus wetlandicus) is a {{threatened}} species native to Eastern Utah. The cactus {{is found in}} a landscape highly disturbed by non-renewable energy production. To understand the environmental conditions that support natural growth of this cactus, we asked whether plant communities differed in the undisturbed areas where the cactus {{is and is not}} found. We then compared undisturbed communities to those found on disturbed areas such as reclaimed well pads. Plant community characterization was accomplished with the line-point intercept method, and data were analyzed using Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling. There {{was no significant difference in}} occupied and unoccupied undisturbed plant communities; S. wetlandicus associates with the common vegetation found in the study area. In contract, plant communities on the well pads were significantly different from those present in undisturbed locations. The disturbed areas were dominated by non-native weedy species and bare soil, thus differing from undisturbed habitats that contained higher relative vegetation cover and a mix of species from all functional groups both native and non-native. To help restore this threatened cactus in disturbed habitats as well as prevent future extinction, we developed and tested a protocol for cactus seed germination in the greenhouse and successfully produced seedlings with a ~ 75 % germination rate. Additionally, an important factor contributing to the successful growth of this threatened cactus is the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). By extracting the DNA from root samples of wild cacti we were able to identify the presence of AMF from the families Glomeraceae and Claroideoglomeraceae representing three genera: Rhizophagus, Glomus, and Claroideoglomus. Sequences closest to Rhizophagus irregularis were identified from multiple root samples. Cactus seedlings may be inoculated with the fungi to promote their growth and ultimately their survival in the wild. Our study indicates that because S. wetlandicus is part of the common plant community of the study area and the well pads are vastly different from the common plant community, disturbed areas should be reclaimed in a way that better resembles undisturbed habitats to increase the likelihood that the newly planted cacti can thrive...|$|R
