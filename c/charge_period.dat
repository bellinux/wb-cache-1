40|$|For a doped antiferromagnet with {{short-range}} spin stripe correlations and long-range charge stripe order we {{find that}} the manifestation of charge order changes abruptly as a function of momentum along the Fermi surface. The disorder averaged local density of states is almost perfectly homogeneous when integrated only over states which contribute to the ``nodal'' spectral weight whereas it displays long range charge stripe order when integrated only over states which contribute to the ``antinodal'' spectral weight. An effectively two dimensional nodal liquid can thus coexist with static charge stripes provided there is no static spin order. We also study commensurate spin and charge stripe ordered systems where the Fermi surface consists of a nodal hole pocket and an open ``stripe band'' section. Due to the stripe order the relation between hole density and size of a pocket will be reduced compared to a paramagnet by a factor of two for even <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> and four for odd <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> and we find an estimated upper limit on the area fraction of a hole pocket of 1. 6 % for <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> four and 4 % for <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> five.

40|$|We report {{experiments}} on a Laughlin quasiparticle interferometer where {{the entire system}} is on the 1 / 3 primary fractional quantum Hall plateau. Electron-beam lithography is used to define an approximately circular 2 D electron island separated from the 2 D bulk by two wide constrictions. The interferometer consists of counterpropagating chiral edge channels coupled by quantum-coherent tunneling in the two constrictions, thus enclosing an island area. Interference fringes are observed as conductance oscillations, similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The flux and <b>charge</b> <b>periods</b> of the interferometer device are calibrated with electrons in the integer quantum Hall regime.

40|$|In two dimensions, {{the laws}} of physics permit {{existence}} of anyons, particles with fractional statistics which is neither Fermi nor Bose. That is, upon exchange of two such particles, the quantum state of a system acquires a phase which is neither 0 nor π, but can be any value. The elementary excitations (Laughlin quasiparticles) of a fractional quantum Hall fluid have fractional electric charge and are expected to obey fractional statistics. Here we report experimental realization of a novel Laughlin quasiparticle interferometer, where quasiparticles of the 1 / 3 fluid execute a closed path around an island of the 2 / 5 fluid and thus acquire statistical phase. Interference fringes are observed as conductance oscillations as a function of magnetic flux, similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We observe the interference shift by one fringe upon introduction of five magnetic flux quanta (5 h/e) into the island. The corresponding 2 e <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> is confirmed directly in calibrated gate experiments.

40|$|We report {{experiments}} on Fabry-Perot electron interferometers in the integer quantum Hall regime. The GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure devices consist of two constrictions defined by etch trenches in 2 D electron layer, enclosing an approximately circular island. The interferometer is formed by counterpropagating chiral edge channels coupled by tunneling {{in the two}} constrictions. Interference fringes are observed as conductance oscillations, similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Front gates deposited in etch trenches allow to fine-tune the device and to change the constriction filling f relative to the bulk filling. Quantum-coherent conductance oscillations are observed on the f = 1 - 4 plateaus. On plateau f we observe f conductance oscillations per fundamental flux period h/e. This is attributed to {{the dominance of the}} electron-electron Coulomb interaction, effectively mixing Landau level occupation. On the other hand, the back-gate <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> is the same (one electron) on all plateaus, independent of filling. This is attributed to the self-consistent electrostatics in the large electron island. We also report dependence of the oscillation period on front-gate voltage for f = 1, 2 and 4 for three devices. We find a linear dependence, with the slope inversely proportional to f for f = 1 and 2...|$|E
40|$|Laughlin quasiparticles are the {{elementary}} excitations of a highly-correlated fractional quantum Hall electron fluid. They have fractional charge and obey fractional statistics. The quasiparticles can propagate quantum-coherently in chiral edge channels, and constructively or destructively interfere. Unlike electrons, the interference condition for Laughlin quasiparticles has a non-vanishing statistical contribution {{that can be}} observed experimentally. Two kinds of interferometer devices have been realized. In the primary-filling interferometer, the entire device has filling 1 / 3, and the e/ 3 edge channel quasiparticles encircle identical e/ 3 island quasiparticles. Here the flux period is h/e, same as for electrons, but the back-gate <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> is e/ 3. In the second kind of interferometer, a lower density edge channel at filling 1 / 3 forms around a higher density island at filling 2 / 5, so that e/ 3 edge quasiparticles encircle e/ 5 island quasiparticles. Here we observe superperiodic oscillations with 5 h/e flux and 2 e charge periods, both corresponding to excitation of ten island quasiparticles.

The composite electrodes examined comprised the use of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) as binders for the carbon and the third was a graphite foil electrode of ∼ 1 mm thickness. The zinc deposition process {{was carried out in}} a methane sulfonic acid (MSA) electrolyte at 60 °C and nucleation studies revealed the growth of the deposits to be instantaneous in this medium. Galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles were performed in order to test the performance of these composite materials under a variety of operating conditions. For all the materials, the highest charge/discharge coulombic efficiencies (∼ 95 %) were found for the highest discharge current densities (200 mA cm− 2) employed in the study but this falls as the <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> is increased. The effect of solution flow velocity is however less clear. Prolonged zinc charging–discharging cycling on the composite materials revealed that whereas the PVDF-based electrode exhibited no loss in efficiency with cycling (> 250), a drastic reduction was observed for the HDPE-based and graphite foil electrodes beyond 70 cycles and this was accompanied by the physical deterioration in the electrode surface...|$|E

The solution containing the metal precursors was mixed with the hydrogel before the supercritical drying step ensuring a highly homogeneous dispersion of the nanometric metal oxides as determined by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. XPS spectra revealed the increased contribution of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups after the activation process. Also, an enhanced metal oxidation at the outer particle surface was observed. Nitrogen isotherms have revealed a decrease of the pore volume in doped samples ascribed to the partial blocking of the pore structure by the embedded nanometric metal oxide particles. Capacitance values as large as 99 F/g and 91 F/g were respectively recorded for CAGDFeAct and CAGDMnAct by cyclic voltammetry. The large capacitance detected for the iron containing activated aerogel was confirmed by deionization experiments.

40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of a PCM based solar chimney is experimentally investigated in this paper. The research is carried out within a laboratory condition with three different heat fluxes of 500 W/m 2, 600 W/m 2 and 700 W/m 2. The results show that for a same <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> of 7 h 10 min though the PCM does not fully melts {{in the cases of}} 600 W/m 2 and 500 W/m 2, the absorber surface temperature variations for the three heat fluxes are the same during the phase change transition period. Contrary to the sensible heat discharge period, during the phase change period, the surface temperatures descend very slowly till the latent heat releases completely. The phase change periods are nearly 13 h 50 min for all cases investigated. The air flow rates vary corresponding to the absorber surface temperature. The air flow rate of 0. 04 kg/s for the case of 700 W/m 2 is slightly higher than 0. 039 kg/s for 600 W/m 2 and followed by 0. 038 kg/s for 500 W/m 2. Unlike to air flow rate, the air outlet average temperature of 19. 6 °C for the case of 700 W/m 2 is the lowest amongst three cases, and then followed by 20. 1 °C for 600 W/m 2 and 20. 5 °C for 500 W/m 2.

40|$|The Solar Dynamic Power Module being {{developed}} for Space Station Freedom uses a eutectic mixture of LiF-CaF 2 phase change material (PCM) contained in toroidal canisters for thermal energy storage. Presented {{are the results}} from heat transfer analyses of a PCM containment canister. One and two dimensional finite difference computer models are developed to analyze heat transfer in the canister walls, PCM, void, and heat engine working fluid coolant. The modes of heat transfer considered include conduction in canister walls and solid PCM, conduction and pseudo-free convection in liquid PCM, conduction and radiation across PCM vapor filled void regions, and forced convection in the heat engine working fluid. Void shape, location, growth or shrinkage (due to density difference between the solid and liquid PCM phases) are prescribed based on engineering judgment. The PCM phase change process is analyzed using the enthalpy method. The {{discussion of the results}} focuses on how canister thermal performance is affected by free convection in the liquid PCM and void heat transfer. Characterizing these effects is important for interpreting the relationship between ground-based canister performance (in 1 -g) and expected on-orbit performance (in micro-g). Void regions accentuate canister hot spots and temperature gradients due to their large thermal resistance. Free convection reduces the extent of PCM superheating and lowers canister temperatures during a portion of the PCM thermal <b>charge</b> <b>period.</b> Surprisingly small differences in canister thermal performance result from operation on the ground and operation on-orbit.

40|$|AbstractThe {{relationship}} between reservoir tightening time and gas <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> {{are the key}} subjects {{that have not been}} well solved considering the studies on the tight sand gas accumulation mechanism and enrichment regularity. The diagenetic evolution history, interaction sequence of organic–inorganic in aquiferous rock, gas charge history, the tightening mechanism of tight sandstone reservoir and the {{relationship between}} reservoir tightening time and gas accumulation period of the Xujiahe Formation have been analyzed in the Yuanba–Tongnanba area of the Sichuan Basin. It has been confirmed that the main reason for the tight sandstone reservoir formation is the intensive mechanical compaction which has dramatically reduced the sandstone reservoir quality, and it resulted to a semi-closed to a closed diagenetic fluid system formation at the early diagenetic stage. In the semi-closed to a closed diagenetic fluid system, at the later part of the diagenetic stage, the fluid circulation is not smooth, and the migration of the dissolution products are blocked, hence, the dissolution products mainly undergo the in situ precipitation and cementation. Such dissolution products block the dissolution pores and the residual primary pores; and the stronger the dissolution is, the higher the cement content is, which makes the reservoir further tightened. The hydrocarbon generation and expulsion history of source rocks and reservoir fluid inclusion characteristics in the Xujiahe Formation show that the charge of natural gas occurs in the Middle Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (mainly Early Cretaceous). A comprehensive analysis of the reservoir tightening history, gas charge history, and interaction sequence of organic–inorganic aquiferous in rock indicate that the sandstone reservoir experienced a tightening process when gas charging took place in the Xujiahe Formation in the Yuanba–Tongnanba area of the Sichuan Basin...|$|E
