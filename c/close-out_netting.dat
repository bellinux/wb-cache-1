50|$|The more {{important}} use of netting is <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> under Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement. Pursuant to this section, when an ISDA Master Agreement (or, more accurately the outstanding Transactions under it) is terminated (normally following a credit event of some kind), {{the value of}} each of the Terminated Transactions is assessed (there are several ways this can be done, but the most usual measure is to determine how much it would cost for a party to enter into a Transaction having commercial terms identical to the Terminated Transaction with an independent third party - this is called the Settlement Amount) and converted into the Termination Currency (which should have been specified in the schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement) and any outstanding Unpaid Amounts are taken into account. The Settlement Amounts (which may be positive or negative depending which party is 'in-the-money' with respect to a particular Terminated Transaction) and unpaid amounts (again positive or negative, depending on who owes them) are added up and a single figure in the Termination Currency is determined payable by one party or the other. The enforcability of the <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> provisions is absolutely vital to financial institutions active in the derivatives market since the ability to net allows them to allocate capital only against the net figure they would have to pay on close-out of an ISDA Master Agreement rather than the gross amount. ISDA has obtained legal opinions from all important jurisdictions confirming the effectiveness of the <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> provisions in those jurisdictions. Members of ISDA are entitled to rely on these opinions.|$|E
40|$|Unidroit has {{recently}} launched an intergovernmental process intended {{to set an}} international non-binding standard for <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> legislation. This paper, first, provides insights into {{the question of why}} harmonisation is needed. The colossal exposures inherent in the derivatives, securities lending, repo, forex and similar markets are generally covered by <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> provisions, which are contained in the relevant master agreements. <b>Close-out</b> <b>netting</b> reduces mutual exposure by about 80 – 90 %. The ‘net’ exposure is taken as a basis for the calculation of collateral and underlying capital, thus being vital for market participants' risk management, as well as for prudential supervision. Even though most developed markets have adopted netting-friendly legislation, the international nature of the modern financial market complicates enforceability of <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> in cross-jurisdictional situations, in particular in insolvency scenarios. Further, the Article explains the current difficulties in transposing the concept of <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> across jurisdictional borders and advocates a functional approach alongside the five criteria (immediate discharge of obligations? obligations due? obligations of the same kind?). Lastly, it sheds light on the concepts underlying the current UNIDROIT draft principle...|$|E
40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{volatility of}} daily foreign exchange (FX) derivatives poses {{a number of}} risks for the international banking community. Settlement risk, liquidity risk and capital adequacy {{are just a few}} immediate concerns that arise from such volatility. This thesis examines the impact of <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> on minimising the stochastic volatility of inter-bank FX derivatives. The problem with <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> is that although it is a simple formula of taking the differences between two banks at one point in time, it is the stochastic and volatile nature of FX rates that makes measuring the full impact of netting difficult. The objective of this thesis is to establish a realistic international banking framework or modelling environment in which <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> can be scientifically applied and examined. Five international daily FX rates will be used as sufficient approximations for five international banks. A generalised autoregressive conditionally heteroschedastic (GARCH) modelling approach is adopted as a robust and rich FX volatility paradigm. Then through Monte Carlo simulation of the resulting fitted GARCH models, we generate the distributions -with and without <b>close-out</b> <b>netting.</b> The findings of this thesis are interesting, showing that <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> is far more than just a simple mathematical process. Netting surely does reduce each bank&# 039;s exposure to FX volatility, however, its multivariate nature reveals some important results for banking risk research and bank analysts...|$|E
40|$|<b>Close-out</b> <b>netting</b> {{is a risk}} {{mitigation}} tool used by financial institutions. It is comparable to set-off and its effects in insolvency are loosely comparable to a super-priority. Therefore, it might conflict with the pari passu principle. Many jurisdictions have solved that conflict and adapted their laws so that <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> is enforceable even {{in the event of}} insolvency. However, as the financial market is global, the parties, their branches and assets might be located in different jurisdictions. Nevertheless, countries failed to agree on a harmonised conflict-of-laws rule, despite the obvious need, when they decided not to include a conflict-of-laws principle in the 2013 Unidroit Principles on the operation of <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> provisions. The relevant EU law, though patchy, already addresses this concern. This article identifies the underlying conceptual difficulties and proposes a solution for an improved framework for both the EU and other financial marketplaces...|$|E
40|$|In many {{financial}} markets repurchase agreements (repos) and securities lending agreements benefit from special insolvency treatment which - broadly speaking {{consists of an}} exemption {{from a number of}} insolvency law mechanisms. In line with FSB Recommendation 13 on repos and securities lending, insolvency treatment of these transactions should not be changed. Instead, the regulators should be given the power to temporarily stay <b>close-out</b> <b>netting,</b> as in bank resolution proceedings. Regulatory haircuts (FSB Recommendations 6 and 7) may buffer systemic consequences but are unable to act as a circuit breaker. Repo and securities lending collateral assets face increased enforcement difficulties in cross-border settings, stemming from different national rules regarding good-faith acquisition and <b>close-out</b> <b>netting.</b> Haircuts are not an appropriate solution. Instead, only harmonisation of securities law and of the relevant insolvency rules can guarantee a consistent cross-border framework...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the benefits from adopting <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> to decrease the exposure to counterparty risk across the world markets and to establish the additional benefits from central counterparties towards decreasing counterparty risk. The novelty of the approach is to estimate a figure for counterparty credit risk (CCR) grouping together most of the financial transactions that generate counterparty risk and to analyze the benefit of netting possibilities in reducing the overall risk exposure, using three different scenarios. In the first scenario, counterparty credit risk is calculated assuming that no <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> is possible across different contracts. The second scenario assumes bilateral negotiations and netting across contracts. The third scenario contemplates the existence of a central counterparty as the center of transactions. Benefits from netting and central counterparty are assessed by comparing the risk exposure in each scenario. Results from the model show that netting provides a decrease in world counterparty risk of over $ 17 trillion. Netting is thus a powerful tool available in the world markets to manage counterparty risk while decreasing systemic risk, and as such policies to facilitate and standardize netting procedures across different jurisdictions should be encouraged. Moreover, results show that the use of central counterparties for settling the outstanding contracts would additionally decrease CCR by over $ 2 trillio...|$|E

The model enables the analysis of credit risk transfer mechanisms, includes features of market and liquidity risk, and allows for contagious propagation of counterparty failures. As an illustration, we calibrate the model using sovereign bond and CDS data for 65 major European banks. The model simulation shows that, in case of a sovereign credit event, banks 2 ̆ 019 losses due to direct and correlated bond exposures are significantly higher than losses due to CDS exposures. The main risk for CDS sellers is found to be sudden increases in collateral requirements on multiple correlated CDS exposures. <b>Close-out</b> <b>netting</b> considerably reduces the extent to which contagion may occur...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{introducing}} rigorous methods and formulas for bilateral counterparty risk credit valuation adjustment (CVA) on interest-rate portfolios. In doing so, we summarize the general arbitrage-free valuation framework for counterparty risk adjustments in presence of bilateral default risk, including the default of the investor. We illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the adjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a call option, both with zero strike and written on the residual net present value of the contract at the relevant default times. We allow for correlation between the default times of the investor and counterparty, and for correlation of each with the underlying risk factor, namely interest rates. We also analyze the often neglected impact of credit spread volatility. We include <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> rules in our examples, although other agreements, such as periodic margining or collateral posting, are left for future work.

40|$|Special bail-in powers, {{similar to}} those of the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (the BRRD), have been in the {{legislative}} sights of HM Treasury (HMT) since the Independent Commission on Banking reported in 2011. Consequently, many of the bail-in tools called for by the BRRD have already found legislative enactment (if not full commencement) in the UK with 2013 ’s amendments to the Banking Act 2009. The specific treatment of the bail-in of derivatives, however, remained an exception. Aware of this difference, and, it will be conjectured, concerned about the scope of the BRRD’s attempts to bail-in derivatives, HMT have enacted secondary legislation dealing with this matter. Having discussed the route to today’s secondary legislation on derivatives bail-in in Part 2. 1, we will consider inter alia the following issues raised by the power to bail-in derivatives in the secondary legislation in Part 2. 2 including: (i) what is a ‘derivative,’ and does HMT agree with the BRRD’s definition; (ii) the critical role of <b>close-out</b> <b>netting,</b> and whether this is appropriate for all derivatives in the widest sense; (iii) the appropriateness of safeguards for protected liabilities and excluded liabilities e. g. secured interests; and (iv) practical matters like valuation. In Part 2. 3 this chapter will consider the systemic effects of bail-in; that is, firstly, the shockwaves caused by bailing in a derivative which is hedged by the non-defaulting party, and secondly, the effect of bailing in bank securities which will (following ISDA’s 2014 amendments to the Credit Derivatives Definitions) trigger a Credit Event for Credit Default Swaps...|$|E
40|$|The main {{result of}} this paper is a collateralized {{counterparty}} valuation adjusted pricing equation, which allows to price a deal while taking into account credit and debit valuation adjustments (CVA, DVA) along with margining and funding costs, all in a consistent way. Funding risk breaks the bilateral nature of the valuation formula. We find that the equation has a recursive form, making the introduction of a purely additive funding valuation adjustment (FVA) difficult. Yet, we can cast the pricing equation into a set of iterative relationships which can be solved by means of standard least-square Monte Carlo techniques. As a consequence, we find that identifying funding costs and debit valuation adjustments is not tenable in general, contrary to what has been suggested in the literature in simple cases. The assumptions under which funding costs vanish are a very special case of the more general theory. We define a comprehensive framework that allows us to derive earlier results on funding or counterparty risk as a special case, although our framework is {{more than the sum of}} such special cases. We derive the general pricing equation by resorting to a risk-neutral approach where the new types of risks are included by modifying the payout cash flows. We consider realistic settings and include in our models the common market practices suggested by ISDA documentation, without assuming restrictive constraints on margining procedures and <b>close-out</b> <b>netting</b> rules. In particular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding rates, and exogenous liquidity policies and hedging strategies. Re-hypothecation liquidity risk and close-out amount evaluation issues are also covered. Finally, relevant examples of non-trivial settings illustrate how to derive known facts about discounting curves from a robust general framework and without resorting to ad hoc hypotheses.
