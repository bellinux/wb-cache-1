40|$|As {{the single}} {{molecules}} detection tool, nanopore is applied in {{more and more}} fields, such as medicine controlled delivery, ion conductance microscopes, nanosensors and DNA sequencing. When molecules pass through a nanopore, they will physically block the pore and produce measurable changes in ionic currents under an external electrical potential. Based on analyzing the resultant electrical signals, it is possible to detect various bio-molecules. Generally, the <b>capturing</b> <b>ratio</b> of nanopre for molecules is dependent on the intensity of electrical potential, to which the duration time of event is inversely proportional. It is difficult to analyze the too short duration time. Therefore, we investigate the study on concentration gradient of ionic solution effect on the <b>capturing</b> <b>ratio</b> of nanopore for DNA, which is {{in order to get the}} higher <b>capturing</b> <b>ratio</b> with the invariant duration time.

The events of DNA translocating through nanopore are observed more compressed during the fixed time under the higher concentration gradient and there is no change to the duration time of DNA passing through the nanopore.

5000|$|StreetPlanter: Bio-retention Cells are {{depressions}} {{that contain}} vegetation grown in an engineered soil mixture placed above a gravel drainage bed. They provide storage, infiltration and evaporation of both direct rainfall and runoff captured from surrounding areas. Street planters consist of concrete boxes {{filled with an}} engineered soil that supports vegetative growth. Beneath the soil is a gravel bed that provides additional storage. The walls of a planter extend 3 to 12 inches above the soil bed to allow for ponding within the unit. The thickness of the soil growing medium ranges from 6 to 24 inches while gravel beds are 6 to 18 inches in depth. The planter's <b>capture</b> <b>ratio</b> is the ratio of its area to the impervious area whoserunoff it captures. Raingarden:Rain Gardens are a type of bio-retention cell consisting of just the engineered soil layer with no gravel bed below it.Rain Gardens are shallow depressions filled with an engineered soil mix that supports vegetative growth. They are usually used on individual home lots to capture roof runoff. Typical soil depths range from 6 to 18 inches.The <b>capture</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{the ratio of the}} rain garden's area to the impervious area that drains onto it. GreenRoof: Green Roofs are another variation of a bio-retention cell that have a soil layer laying atop a special drainage mat material that conveys excess percolated rainfall off of the roof. Green Roofs (also known as Vegetated Roofs) are bio-retention systems placed on roof surfaces that capture and temporarily store rainwater in a soil growing medium. They consist of a layered system of roofing designed to support plant growth and retain water for plant uptake while preventing ponding on the roof surface.The thickness used for the growing medium typically ranges from 3 to 6 inches. InfilTrench: infiltration trenches are narrow ditches filled with gravel that intercept runoff from upslope impervious areas. They provide storage volume and additional time for captured runoff to infiltrate the native soil below. [...] PermPave or Permeable PavementsContinuous Permeable Pavement systems are excavated areas filled with gravel and paved over with a porous concrete or asphalt mix. Continuous Permeable Pavement systems are excavated areas filled with gravel and paved over with a porous concrete or asphalt mix. Modular Block systems are similar except that permeable block pavers are used instead. Normally all rainfall will immediately pass through the pavement into the gravel storage layer below it where it can infiltrate at natural rates into the site's native soil. Pavement layers are usually 4 to 6 inches in height while the gravel storage layer is typically 6 to 18 inches high. The <b>Capture</b> <b>Ratio</b> is the percent of the treated area (street or parking lot) that is replaced with permeable pavement. [...] Cistern: Rain Barrels (or Cisterns) are containers that collect roof runoff during storm events and can either release or re-use the rainwater during dry periods. Rain harvesting systems collect runoff from rooftops and convey it to a cistern tank where it can be used for non-potable water uses and on-site infiltration. The harvesting system is assumed to consist of a given number of fixed-sized cisterns per 1000 square feet of rooftop area captured. The water from each cistern is withdrawn at a constant rate and is assumed to be consumed or infiltrated entirely on-site. VegSwale: Vegetative swales are channels or depressed areas with sloping sides covered with grass and other vegetation. They slow down the conveyance of collected runoff and allow it more time to infiltrate the native soil beneath it. Infiltration basins are shallow depressions filled with grass or other natural vegetation that capture runoff from adjoining areas and allow it to infiltrate into the soil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Source {{location}} {{privacy is}} becoming an increasingly important property of some wireless sensor network applications. The fake source technique has been proposed as an approach for handling the source location privacy problem in these situations. However, whilst {{the efficiency of the}} fake source techniques is well documented, there are several factors that limit the usefulness of current results: (i) the assumption that fake sources are known a priori, (ii) the selection of fake sources based on an prohibitively expensive pre-configuration phase and (iii) the lack of a commonly adopted attacker model. In this paper we address these limitations by investigating the efficiency of the fake source technique with respect to possible implementations, configurations and extensions that do not require a pre-configuration phase or a priori knowledge of fake sources. The results presented demonstrate that one possible implementation, in presence of a single attacker, can lead to a decrease in <b>capture</b> <b>ratio</b> of up to 60 % when compared with a flooding baseline. In the presence of multiple attackers, the same implementation yields only a 30 % decrease in <b>capture</b> <b>ratio</b> with respect to the same baseline.
