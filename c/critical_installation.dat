50|$|Initial drying {{and firing}} of a {{refractory}} castable is a <b>critical</b> <b>installation</b> variable that can influence lining performance. Precast shapes are typically fired in a digitally-controlled furnace prior to shipment, {{ensuring that the}} refractory manufacturer's recommended bake-out schedule is closely followed. Since the shapes are fired slowly from all sides, the moisture is removed through the entire thickness of the shape in a controlled manner. Depending on the temperature to which the shape is fired, this can optimize the physical properties of the material through the entire thickness of the shape, not just the hot face surface. This results in a truly homogeneous lining. Micro-cracking within the shape, which are often introduced during field bake-out but may go unnoticed, may also be reduced since the initial firing is more controlled.|$|E
40|$|Installation of OffshoreWind Turbine {{structural}} components need to {{be executed}} in sea states for which their dynamic responses are expected to remain within a safe domain or perform {{a limited number of}} outcrossings from the safe boundary beyond which the responses may lead to unsafe working conditions, large impact loads or even structural failure. A <b>critical</b> <b>installation</b> activity limiting the installation of a Transition Piece TP is often the motion monitoring phase of the mating points until its landing on the foundation. The operational limit is normally given by the horizontal displacement and the safe domain could conveniently be defined by a circle of radius r in the horizontal plane. This paper presents an existing general accurate method and its solution to estimate the outcrossing rate of dynamic responses for a circular safe boundary in short crested seas which is applicable for the motion monitoring phase of offshore wind turbine components prior to mating. The required input is calculated from spectral analysis in the frequency domain and the solution is derived for Gaussian processes. It is found that both 1 st and 2 nd order responses have to be included and that the Gaussian assumption for the slow drift motions is not valid so that its real PDF is required. Also wave spreading has large influence in the outcrossing rate and should realistically be applied. The suggested approach is in agreement with real offshore practice, and is efficient when compared with time domain simulations. Then, the outcrossing rate method could help on Marine Operations decision making during <b>critical</b> <b>installation</b> activities...|$|E

40|$|Dogs {{are known}} for their {{incredible}} ability to detect odours, extracting them from a ‘‘complex’’ environment and recognising them. This makes sniffer dogs precious assets in a broad variety of security applications. However, their use is subject to some intrinsic restrictions. Dogs can only be trained to a limited set of applications, get tired after a relatively short period, and thus require a high turnover. This has sparked a drive over the past decade to develop artificial sniffer devices—generally known as ‘‘chemical sniffers’’ or ‘‘electronic noses’’—able to complement and possibly replace dogs for some security applications. Such devices have been already deployed, or are intended to be deployed, at borders, airports and other <b>critical</b> <b>installation</b> security checkpoints. Similarly to dogs, they are adopted for detecting residual traces that indicate either the presence of, or recent contact with, substances like drugs and explosives. It goes without saying that, as with sniffer dogs, the use of artificial sniffer devices raises many sensitive issues.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a numerical study for preliminary {{assessment of the}} dynamic responses and allowable sea states for the installation of an offshore wind turbine (OWT) tower and rotor nacelle assembly (RNA) based on a novel method. This method {{is based on the}} inverted pendulum principle and consists of various sequential activities for which the allowable limits of sea states need to be established. For <b>critical</b> <b>installation</b> activities, numerical analyses methodologies have been applied to model the actual operations. For the parameters limiting the execution of the operations, response statistics are provided. It is found that at least 45 seeds are required to achieve convergence of snap force statistics during the OWT lift-off. The response statistics are used to calculate a characteristic value corresponding to a target probability of non-exceedance. For the lift-off and mating operations, these characteristic values are compared with the allowable limits of the response parameters to establish the allowable limits of sea states. In addition, sensitivity study on key modeling parameters are conducted. Spring coefficients of contact elements and hinged connections, winch speed, and hoist wire stiffness are shown to be important modeling parameters. The results provided in this paper are important for future finite element modeling (FEM) and cost-effective design of the structural components...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative sensor system, created specifically for new civil engineering structural monitoring applications, allowing specially packaged fiber grating-based sensors {{to be used}} in harsh, in-the-field measurement conditions for accurate strain measurement with full temperature compensation. The sensor consists of two fiber Bragg gratings that are protected within a polypropylene package, with one of the fiber gratings isolated from the influence of strain and thus responding only to temperature variations, while the other is sensitive to both strain and temperature. To achieve this, the temperature-monitoring fiber grating is slightly bent and enclosed in a metal envelope to isolate it effectively from the strain. Through an appropriate calibration process, both the strain and temperature coefficients of each individual grating component when incorporated in the sensor system can be thus obtained. By using these calibrated coefficients in the operation of the sensor, both strain and temperature can be accurately determined. The specific application for which these sensors have been designed is seen when installed on an innovative small-scale flexi-arch bridge where they are used for real-time strain measurements during the <b>critical</b> <b>installation</b> stage (lifting) and loading. These sensors have demonstrated enhanced resilience when embedded in or surface-mounted on such concrete structures, providing accurate and consistent strain measurements not only during installation but subsequently during use.

40|$|Current {{installation}} costs of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) {{are high and}} profit margins in the offshore wind energy sector are low, it is thus necessary to develop installation methods that are more efficient and practical. This paper presents a numerical study (based on a global response analysis of marine operations) of a novel procedure for installing the tower and Rotor Nacelle Assemblies (RNAs) on bottom-fixed foundations of OWTs. The installation procedure {{is based on the}} inverted pendulum principle. A cargo barge is used to transport the OWT assembly in a horizontal position to the site, and a medium-size Heavy Lift Vessel (HLV) is then employed to lift and up-end the OWT assembly using a special upending frame. The main advantage of this novel procedure is that the need for a huge HLV (in terms of lifting height and capacity) is eliminated. This novel method requires that the cargo barge is in the leeward side of the HLV (which can be positioned with the best heading) during the entire installation. This is to benefit from shielding effects of the HLV on the motions of the cargo barge, so the foundations need to be installed with a specific heading based on wave direction statistics of the site and a typical installation season. Following a systematic approach based on numerical simulations of actual operations, potential <b>critical</b> <b>installation</b> activities, corresponding critical events, and limiting (response) parameters are identified. In addition, operational limits for some of the limiting parameters are established in terms of allowable limits of sea states. Following a preliminary assessment of these operational limits, the duration of the entire operation, the equipment used, and weather- and water depth-sensitivity, this novel procedure is demonstrated to be viable...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between feminisms and visual arts in Indonesia. Focusing on works by Indonesian women artists produced from the 1940 s until the present day, it provides {{a new understanding of}} the history of Indonesian modern and contemporary art from a feminist perspective. Its main aim is not only to analyze the actual works of Indonesian women artists historically and today, but also to illuminate the sociocultural and political contexts in which the artists worked through feminist reading. Feminisms are often regarded as a purely Western concept that is irrelevant to the Indonesian context, but during a brief period of time after 1998, there was a surge in the Indonesian mainstream consciousness about gender issues. Feminist scholars, activists and cultural workers successfully created a discursive space in the mainstream media to discuss issues which were previously taboo, such as the politics of the female body, domestic violence, sexual abuse and more. Women artists such as Arahmaiani and Titarubi made significant contributions to this discourse, for example through their <b>critical</b> <b>installation</b> and performance art pieces. The thesis sets out to explore the works of these and other women artists, employing multiple methodological approaches from psychoanalysis to semiotics in order to construct a framework for an active re-reading and re-visioning of Indonesian art discourses. Strategies of correction and interrogation are applied to both critically asses the patriarchal structure of the Indonesian art world and revise the existing readings of works by women artists. By looking beyond the labeling but not rejecting the term itself, the thesis highlights a trajectory of change in the way feminisms operates in Indonesian visual arts. As important drivers of this process of change, Indonesian women artists neither resist patriarchy in a ‘politically correct’ way nor revel in eroticism, but steer a course between these two positions. Furthermore, the thesis demonstrates how works by Indonesian women artists can include difference and absorb ambiguity within their frame of reference, thus avoiding the totalising and exclusionary practices sometimes associated with feminisms...|$|E

40|$|The {{installation}} of offshore wind farms presents great challenges {{as the industry}} move farther offshore and into deeper waters, and the turbines and foundations are getting larger and heavier. Current installation methods are all sensitive to weather conditions: lifting the foundations using floating crane vessels, deploying and retrieving jack-ups' legs, and lifting turbine nacelles and rotors at a large lift height. Careful numerical studies of these <b>critical</b> <b>installation</b> scenarios in the planning phase are therefore important to ensure safe executions. Monopiles (MP) are {{the most commonly used}} foundations for offshore wind turbines (OWT), but there is little work focusing on their installation phase. In order to predict the responses of the installation system, accurate numerical models and methods are needed. This thesis addresses the modelling and dynamic analysis of two installation phases for monopiles: the lowering into the sea and the initial hammering phases. Due to nonstationarity, current numerical methods used for steady-state conditions are not applicable for simulating the lowering phase. In this thesis, new numerical methods were developed to account for the shielding effects from the floating installation vessel and the radiation damping of the monopile for analysing the nonstationary process. The shielding effects from the vessel are considerable especially in short waves, and the inclusion of the radiation damping of the MP may reduce the predicted responses. These methods also provide more accurate results than the commonly used simplified conservative methods, and they can be extended to apply for other structures. For the initial hammering process, the coupled vessel-monopile installation system with soil interaction was modelled. Dynamic analyses for various monopile penetration depths and soil conditions showed that the responses were sensitive to those factors. These numerical models, methods and dynamic analysis form the basis for assessing the operational limits for different installation activities. The operational limits are essential during the planning phase of the operation, i. e. to size equipment, select installation vessel and optimize the installation method. The allowable sea states together with weather forecasts provide the basis for the decision making during the execution of the operation. Although many studies have focused on obtaining operational limits of specific installation activities, little work has been published on providing a general methodology to establish these limits. Therefore, the thesis also addresses the development of a systematic methodology to assess the operational limits based on the installation procedure, numerical models and safety criteria. To demonstrate the methodology, a detailed procedure for establishing the operational limits is presented for the monopile initial hammering process. First, the critical events and corresponding responses for this operation were identified. The allowable sea states were then obtained by comparing the characteristic responses with their allowable limits. For the monopile lowering process, the allowable sea states were also established using this methodology. An operability analysis at a selected offshore site using different numerical methods was carried out. It was showed that among different modelling parameters, the shielding effect is the most critical factor, followed by the nonstationary analysis approach, wave spreading and the radiation damping from the monopile. The methodology to assess the operational limits is general and can be extended to other marine operations. The original contributions of this work include the development of new methods for simulating the nonstationary lowering operation, and development of a systematic methodology for assessment of the operational limits. These methods provide a basis for further studies on modelling and analysis of other marine operations...|$|E
