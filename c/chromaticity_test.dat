40|$|Discrimination for equiluminant {{chromatic}} stimuli {{that vary}} in L- and M-cone excitation {{depends on the}} chromaticity difference between the test field and the surrounding area. The current study investigated {{the effect of the}} proximity in space and time of a surround to the test field on chromatic contrast discrimination. The experimental paradigm isolated spatial, temporal, and spatial-and-temporal chromatic contrast effects on discrimination. Chromatic contrast discrimination thresholds were assessed by a four-alternative spatial forced-choice procedure. Stimuli were either metameric to the equal energy spectrum, or varied in L-cone activation along a line of constant S-cone activation. A model based on primate parvocellular pathway physiology described the data. Spatial and temporal contrast produced equivalent reductions in chromatic discriminability as the chromatic difference between the test and surround increased.

One of the {{requirements}} of a fruit harvesting robot {{is the ability to}} recognize and locate fruit from the leaf and branch portions; machine vision system is one of the methods used to detect the location of the fruit. This paper showed the development of a machine vision algorithm that would guide an apple harvesting hand prototype. The objectives of this study were to differentiate the fruit from the other portions of the tree, such as the leaf and the branch, and to locate the fruit center and the abscission layer of the fruit’s peduncle. The study was divided into two stages, the recognition stage and the location stage of the apple fruit. In the recognition of the apple, Fuji variety was tested. Apple images were collected using a color CCD camera under natural lighting condition. Color models of Fuji were examined to determine the color properties used to differentiate the fruit from the other portions of the tree, such as the leaf and branch portions. The LCD (Luminance and Color Difference of red) model and the chromaticity model were used for the analysis. The color properties: luminance, color difference of red and <b>chromaticity</b> were <b>tested</b> to determine the thresholds for segmentation using the decision theoretic approach. This approach derived decision functions that could classify the apple fruit, leaf, and branch.

The motivation for this study was to derive a method for evaluation of test design, test sen-sitivity, and observer performance. The discrimination model {{is based on the assumption}} that chromatic discrimination is mediated in two independent channels, one for short-wavelength cones and one for long- and middle-wavelength cones. Luminance-dependent templates are derived for each channel, and they describe chromatic-discrimination behavior of the young color-normal observer. The templates incorporate receptor-and opponent-level gain controls.

Observers matched the <b>test</b> <b>chromaticities</b> to a rectangular matching field using haploscopic presentation. Data were collected and analyzed {{within the framework}} of a cone chromaticity space, allowing analysis of spatial frequency effects on post-receptoral spectral opponent pathways. Assimilation, a shift of chromaticity toward the inducing chromaticity, was found at the highest spatial frequency (9. 0 cpd). Contrast, a shift of chromaticity away from the inducing chromaticity, occurred at the lowest spatial frequency (0. 7 cpd). The spatial frequency at the transition point from assimilation to contrast was near 4 cpd, independent of the cone axis. Assimilation was unaffected by the presence of a neutral surround and could be described by a spread light model. Contrast was reduced {{in the presence of a}} neutral surround.

40|$|On color constancy, {{we showed}} that {{brighter}} surrounding colors had greater influence than dim colors (Uchikawa, Kitazawa, MacLeod, Fukuda, 2010 APCV). Increasing luminance of a stimulus causes the change in appearance from the surface-color to the illuminant-color mode. However it is unknown whether the visual system considers such color appearance mode of surrounding colors to achieve color constancy. We investigated the influence of surrounding colors that appeared illuminant on color constancy. The stimulus was composed of a central test stimulus and surrounding six colors: bright and dim red, green and blue. The observers adjusted the <b>chromaticity</b> of the <b>test</b> stimulus to be appeared as an achromatic surface. The luminance balance of three bright surrounding colors was equalized {{with that of the}} optimal colors in three illuminant conditions, then, the luminance of one of the three bright colors was varied in the range beyond the critical luminance of color appearance mode transition.

40|$|Studies of {{chromatic}} discrimination {{are typically}} based on homogeneously colored patches. Surfaces of natural objects, however, cannot {{be characterized by}} a single color. Instead, they have a chromatic texture, that is, a distribution of different chromaticities. Here we study chromatic discrimination for natural images and synthetic stimuli with a distribution of different chromaticities under various states of adaptation. Discrimination was measured at the adaptation point, where the mean <b>chromaticity</b> of the <b>test</b> stimuli {{was the same as}} the chromaticity of the adapting background, and away from the adaptation point. At the adaptation point, discrimination for natural objects resulted in threshold contours that were selectively elongated in a direction of color space matching the chromatic variation of the colors within the natural object. Similar effects occurred for synthetic stimuli. Away from the adaptation point, discrimination thresholds increased and threshold ellipses were elongated along the contrast axis connecting adapting color and test color. Away from the adaptation point, {{no significant differences between the}} different stimulus classes were found. The effect of the chromatic texture on discrimination seemed to be masked by the overall increase in discrimination thresholds. Our results show that discrimination of chromatic textures, either synthetic or natural, differs from that of simple uniform patches when the chromatic variation is centered at the adaptation point...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. A {{previous}} study demonstrated wavelength - specific {{differences in the}} time course of chromatic adaptation in a complex pattern (Werner, A., Perception, 24, suppl. : 58, 1995). Here, I present data that reveal the significance of contrasts for this finding. Method. The test pattern (12 ° x 13 °) was presented on a calibrated colour monitor and consisted of 37 hexagons corresponding to Munsell papers. The pattern was alternately presented under conditions simulating a standard illumination (D 65) and one of four test illuminations. These test illuminations were confined to one of the cardinal axes in an equiluminant plane in colour space (Red/Green, Blue/Yellow). The effect of chromatic adaptation was measured by having subjects adjust the <b>chromaticity</b> of a <b>test</b> field to appear achromatic under the respective adaptation condition. Three test subjects measured the effect of chromatic adaptation as a function of adaptation time (between 200 ms and 120 s) and of the content of contrasts in the test pattern: (1) luminance and chromatic contrasts, (2) luminance contrasts only, (3) chromatic contrasts only, (4) no contrasts (uniformly achromatic). All patterns had equal mean luminance (19 cd/m 2) and size and were viewed binocularly. In order to learn whether adaptation to a contrast - pattern transfers interocularly, condition (1) was repeated using a haploscopic arrangement. Results. It was observed that the wavelength specific enhancement of the initial phase of chromatic adaptation is due to the presence of contrasts in the test pattern. Luminance and chromatic contrasts contribute equally to this effect; it is also present under haploscopic conditions. Conclusion. The results suggest the presence of a fast contrast dependent mechanism for chromatic adaptation which is most sensitive in the middle range of the spectrum and has a cortical site. The results will be discussed with respect to findings on chromatic induction...|$|R
40|$|Colour rendering, {{referring}} {{to the impact of}} a light source on the colour appearance of objects, has been investigated for many decades. Several metrics, not all successful, have been proposed in an attempt to quantify the effect of the light source. The current standard method, the colour rendering index Ra developed by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE), offers an objective measure of the colour rendering properties of a light source. However, such an objective measure {{may not be the best}} answer to the needs of lighting designers, architects and the people active in the shop and retail sector. End users and consumers are usually more interested in the more subjective aspects of colour rendering quality, i. e. in how appealing or how natural objects look. The failure of the CIE colour rendering index Ra to accurately assess the colour rendering quality of white light sources, especially narrowband sources such as Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs), has made colour rendering a hot research topic. The principal aim of this doctoral research project was to contribute to the international discussion on colour rendering by developing a new metric that meets most end-users expectations: a correct assessment of one or more of the subjective aspects of colour quality of a white light source, such as preference and attractiveness. In this work a new metric was developed that assesses the colour quality of a light source with respect to the memory colours of a set of familiar objects. A memory colour approach was adopted because it corresponds more closely to the way people judge the colour quality of light sources in everyday life than reference illuminant based approaches: nobody walks around with a reference source in their pockets to be able to judge the colour quality of the lighting in a room! The basic assumption of the approach is simple and intuitive: the better a light source renders object colours to what is expected, i. e. the memory colour, the better will be the colour quality. Although memory colours have been investigated in the past, the available data was either insufficient for or inapplicable to the new memory colour quality metric. Therefore, new data was collected by investigating the memory colours of a set of ten familiar objects, as well as the human response to a deviation from these memory colours in a series of visual experiments. In the experiments the familiar objects were presented individually and illuminated by over one hundred different illumination spectra to a group of observers that were asked to rate the colour appearance of the objects with respect to what they thought the objects look like in reality. The colour of the objects was changed by presenting them in a specially designed LED illumination box that created the illusion that the objects themselves changed colour and that kept the adaptation state of the observers constant. The good inter observer agreement suggested an average observer could be postulated by pooling the observer ratings for each familiar object. The pooled observer ratingswere modelled by a bivariate Gaussian function in IPT colour space. Based on the modelled functions a set of similarity functions were determined that describe the similarity of any object chromaticity with the memory colours of the familiar objects. As colour quality is assumed to be directly related to the similarity of an objects apparent colour with its memory colour, these similarity functions establish the basis of the memory colour quality metric. Practically, the colour quality of a white light source is determined as follows. For each familiar object a special memory colour quality indicator value is obtained by calculating the function value of the similarity function at the IPT object <b>chromaticity</b> under the <b>test</b> source. The object chromaticity is determined by first calculating the CIE 10 &# 176; tristimulus values under the light source using the spectral reflectance of the object. Second, the tristimulus values are then converted to their corresponding colour using the CAT 02 chromatic adaptation transform. The degree of chromatic adaptation is set depending on the illuminance. If unknown a value 0. 90  corresponding to an illuminance of approximately 800 lx  generally gives good results. Finally, the IPT object chromaticity is calculated from the corresponding tristimulus values. For a white light source, a general memory colour quality index is calculated as the geometric mean of the special indicator values. This number describes the overall agreement of the apparent object chromaticities with their memory colours and hence overall colour quality. Psychophysical experiments conducted in the framework of this doctoral research project as well as independent visual data collected from literature have validated the memory colour quality metric with high statistical significance as a metric with a high correlation with visual appreciation of light sources. It was shown to be the statistically best metric to assess the colour quality of a white light source in terms of visual appreciation among a large group of past and currently proposed metrics. However, the correlation with naturalness was rather low. The memory colour quality metric was also shown to be applicable to the design of new light sources with pleasing colour quality. Based on the optimization results of simulated tri- and tetrachromatic LED clusters a physical lamp was realized composed of red, green, blue LEDs and warm white phosphor LEDs. The superior colour quality of the lamp, optimized for the memory colour quality metric at 2700 K, was verified in a psychophysical rating experiment. It was found to perform significantly better than an incandescent lamp, of the same correlated colour temperature, in terms of preference, attractiveness and memory similarity. Furthermore, no statistical differences were observed in terms of naturalness and vividness. Although there are still some potential shortcomings to the memory colour quality metric, such as the limited amount of test objects and the unknown influence of cultural differences, the version of the metric as it was developed during the doctoral research project has already shown great promise and could, even in its current form, be a significant contribution to the field of colour rendering. Anyway, this doctoral research project has made the international colour science community aware of the potential of a memory colour approach to colour quality evaluation of white light sources.
