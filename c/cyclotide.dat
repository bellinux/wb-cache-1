40|$|During {{the last}} decade there has been {{increasing}} interest in small circular proteins found in plants of the violet family (Violaceae). These so-called <b>cyclotides</b> consist of a circular chain of approximately 30 amino acids, including six cysteines forming three disulfide bonds, arranged in a cyclic cystine knot (CCK) motif. In this study we map the occurrence and distribution of <b>cyclotides</b> throughout the Violaceae. Plant material was obtained from herbarium sheets containing samples up to 200 years of age. Even the oldest specimens contained <b>cyclotides</b> in the preserved leaves, with no degradation products observable, confirming their place {{as one of the}} most stable proteins in nature. Over 200 samples covering 17 of the 23 - 31 genera in Violaceae were analyzed, and <b>cyclotides</b> were positively identified in 150 species. Each species contained a unique set of between one and 25 <b>cyclotides,</b> with many exclusive to individual plant species. We estimate the number of different <b>cyclotides</b> in the Violaceae to be 5000 - 25, 000, and propose that <b>cyclotides</b> are ubiquitous among all Violaceae species.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} peptides as therapeutic drugs and, in particular, in the potential of <b>cyclotides,</b> a family of cyclic peptides with remarkable stability and amenability to sequence engineering, as scaffolds in drug design. As well as having an ultrastable structure, many natural <b>cyclotides</b> have intrinsic biological activities with potential pharmaceutical or agricultural applications. Some <b>cyclotides</b> also have the ability to cross membrane barriers and to enter into cells; in particular, <b>cyclotides</b> that belong to the Möbius and bracelet subfamilies have been found to harbor lipid-binding domains, which allow for the specific recognition of phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipids in biological membranes. This lipid selectivity is intimately correlated with the highly conserved three-dimensional structures of <b>cyclotides</b> and is important for their reported biological properties and cell penetration ability. The membrane binding features of Möbius and bracelet <b>cyclotides</b> contrast with the lack of membrane binding of trypsin inhibitor <b>cyclotides,</b> which have physicochemical properties and bioactivities {{different from those of the}} other two subfamilies of <b>cyclotides</b> but are also able to enter cells.

40|$|ConspectusAmong {{the various}} {{molecules}} that plants produce for defense against pests and pathogens, <b>cyclotides</b> {{stand out as}} exceptionally stable and structurally unique. These ribosomally synthesized peptides are around 30 amino acids in size, and are stabilized by a head-to-tail cyclic peptide backbone and three disulfide bonds that form a cystine knot. They occur in certain plants of the Rubiaceae, Violaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, and Solanaceae families, with an individual plant producing up to hundreds of different <b>cyclotides.</b> Aside from being exploitable as crop protection agents based on their natural pesticidal activities, <b>cyclotides</b> are amenable to repurposing by chemists for use as drug leads or as tools in chemical biology. Their macrocyclic peptide backbone and knotted arrangement of three disulfide bonds engenders <b>cyclotides</b> with resistance to proteolytic degradation, high temperatures, and chemical chaotropes. Furthermore, their small size makes them accessible to synthesis using solid-phase peptide chemistry and so non-natural <b>cyclotides</b> can be designed and synthesized {{for a variety of}} applications. Our focus here is on <b>cyclotides</b> as tools in chemical biology, and there are four main areas of application that have appeared in the literature so far: (i) <b>cyclotides</b> as probes of membrane binding; (ii) <b>cyclotides</b> as probes of biosynthetic pathways for peptide cyclization; (iii) <b>cyclotides</b> as probes of protease specificity and function; and (iv) <b>cyclotides</b> as probes of receptor binding and specificity, with the potential for them to be developed as drug leads. The main methods used in these studies include solid-phase peptide chemistry for synthesis and NMR spectroscopy for structural characterization, as well as a wide range of biochemical and biophysical techniques for probing intermolecular interactions. In addition, <b>cyclotides</b> have been examined in diverse biological assays, ranging from enzyme inhibition to cell penetration, intracellular targeting and cytotoxicity. The main finding to have emerged from studies over the past decade is that <b>cyclotides</b> are exceptionally stable under a variety of conditions (in assay buffers, biological fluids, membranes, and recombinant expression systems). Furthermore, they are structurally very well-defined and amenable to sequence substitutions that can introduce new desired biological activities, generally without compromising their exceptional stability.

Finally, they occupy a size niche between traditional small-molecule drugs (5000 Da) and thus can probe receptors, membranes, and protein-protein interactions in different ways to what is possible with either small molecules or biologics. Overall, <b>cyclotides</b> are an exciting class of peptides that have great potential as ultrastable chemical biology probes in a variety of applications.

Both hedyotide B1 and B2 belong to the <b>cyclotide</b> superfamily which {{was known to be}} an important part of plant innate defense. Hedyotide B1 has a cyclic-cystine-knot motif and displayed potent broad-spectrum activities against many bacteria including E. coli, S. salivarius, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. cereus and B. megaterium. Hedyotide B1 and cyclotides are likely to exerted their antimicrobial actions by disrupting the bacteria membranes which eventually leads to cell death.

Although binding is predominantly an entropy-driven process, suggesting that hydrophobic forces contribute significantly to cyclotide-lipid complex formation, specific binding to the phosphoethanolamine-lipid headgroup is also required, which is evident from the enthalpic changes in the free energy of binding.
