40|$|Abstract PRUDENCE {{simulations}} {{of the climate}} in Central Europe are analysed with respect to mean temperature, mean precipitation and three monthly mean geostrophic circulation indices. The three global models show important <b>circulation</b> biases <b>in</b> the control climate, in particular in {{the strength of the}} west-circulations in winter and summer. The nine regional models inherit much of the circulation biases from their host model, especially in winter. In summer, the regional models show a larger spread <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> statistics, depending on nesting procedures and other model characteristics. Simulated circulation biases appear to have a significant inluence on simulated temperature and precipitation. The PRUDENCE ensemble appears to be biased towards warmer and wetter than observed <b>circulations</b> <b>in</b> winter, and towards warmer and dryer <b>circulations</b> <b>in</b> summer. A 2 -scenario simulations show important circulation changes, which {{have a significant impact on}} changes in the distributions of monthly mean temperature and precipitation. It is likely that interactions between land–surface processes and atmospheric circulation play an important role in the simulated changes in the summer climate in Central Europe. ...|$|R
5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to <b>circulation</b> <b>in</b> 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{attempts}} by the Mint to adjust the design, the coins proved to strike indistinctly, and {{to be subject to}} wear—the dates were easily worn away in <b>circulation.</b> <b>In</b> 1938, after the expiration of the minimum 25-year period during which the design could not be replaced without congressional authorization, it was replaced by the Jefferson nickel, designed by Felix Schlag. Fraser's design is admired today, and has been used on commemorative coins and the gold American Buffalo series.|$|E
5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their <b>circulation</b> <b>in</b> response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E
