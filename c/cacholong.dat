Thus, level VI (Morocco Moulouyan ?) slightly successed Lower Acheulean and pediment III (Morocco Tensiftian ?) is prior to Upper Paleolithic. Terrace I came after Capsien; in particular, its summit is constituted by deposits derived from a post-Neolithic soil erosion. The study of prehistoric tools shows that efficient eolisation and gelifraction occured between Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic. Since Middle Paleolithic, the formation of calcareous crusts moves northwards. On the other hand, the southern cortex enriched with metallic oxides and the northern <b>cacholong</b> went on forming {{at least as far}} as Neolithic...|$|E
