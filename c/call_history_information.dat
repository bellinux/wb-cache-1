Design <b>history</b> <b>information</b> is information which cannot be inferred from the product model alone; it {{is related to the}} how's and why's behind a design. Design <b>history</b> <b>information</b> can be recorded, organized, stored and played back. Design <b>history</b> <b>information</b> can be recorded by means of speech or text input. Sketch input is anticipated. Information types which are supported are: function, construction, constraints and intents. All these information types are related to either assembly, component, feature or relation level. Storage has been implemented by means of a combination of files and a relational database. Play back of geometry and all design <b>history</b> <b>information</b> which has been stored previously is possible. The design <b>history</b> <b>information</b> is closely related to the design objects (assemblies, components, features) and relations which exist between these objects. Conceptual graphs are used for the representation of the design objects and the relations between these entitie...|$|R

50|$|Combined {{with the}} Internet and {{personal}} computing, digital media has caused disruption in publishing, journalism, entertainment, education, commerce and politics. Digital media has also posed new challenges to copyright and intellectual property laws, fostering an open content movement in which content creators voluntarily {{give up some}} or all of their legal rights to their work. The ubiquity of digital media and its effects on society suggest that we are {{at the start of a}} new era in industrial <b>history,</b> <b>called</b> the <b>Information</b> Age, perhaps leading to a paperless society in which all media are produced and consumed on computers. However, challenges to a digital transition remain, including outdated copyright laws, censorship, the digital divide, and the spectre of a digital dark age, in which older media becomes inaccessible to new or upgraded information systems. Digital media has a significant, wide-ranging and complex impact on society and culture.|$|R

40|$|A general {{model of}} {{decentralized}} stochastic control <b>called</b> partial <b>history</b> sharing <b>information</b> structure is presented. In this model, {{at each step}} the controllers share part of their observation and control history with each other. This general model subsumes several existing models of information sharing as special cases. Based on the information commonly known to all the controllers, the decentralized problem is reformulated as an equivalent centralized problem {{from the perspective of}} a coordinator. The coordinator knows the common information and select prescriptions that map each controller’s local information to its control actions. The optimal control problem at the coordinator is shown to be a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) which is solved using techniques from Markov decision theory. This approach provides (a) structural results for optimal strategies, and (b) a dynamic program for obtaining optimal strategies for all controllers in the original decentralized problem. Thus, this approach unifies the various ad-hoc approaches taken in the literature. In addition, the structural results on optimal control strategies obtained by the proposed approach cannot be obtained by the existing generic approach (the person-by-person approach) for obtaining structural results in decentralized problems; and the dynamic program obtained by the proposed approach is simpler than that obtained by the existing generic approach (the designer’s approach) for obtaining dynamic programs in decentralized problems...|$|R

40|$|Background. A family history, {{reflecting}} {{genetic susceptibility}} {{as well as}} shared environmental and behavioral factors, is an important risk factor for common chronic multifactorial diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and many cancers. Discussion. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to discuss the evidence for the use of family history as a tool for primary prevention of common chronic diseases, in particular for tailored interventions aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles. The following questions are addressed: (1) What is the value of family <b>history</b> <b>information</b> as a determinant of personal disease risk?; (2) How can family <b>history</b> <b>information</b> be used to motivate at-risk individuals to adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles in order to prevent disease?; and (3) What additional studies are needed to assess the potential value of family <b>history</b> <b>information</b> as a tool to promote a healthy lifestyle?. Summary. In addition to risk assessment, family <b>history</b> <b>information</b> can be used to personalize health messages, which are potentially more effective in promoting healthy lifestyles than standardized health messages. More research is needed on the evidence for the effectiveness of such a tool...|$|R
40|$|Two {{important}} {{pieces of}} information for consumers evaluating products online are consumer ratings (i. e. base-rates) and consumer reviews (i. e. case histories). While literature in cognitive psychology shows a tendency to weigh case <b>history</b> <b>information</b> more heavily than base-rate information, other consumer oriented studies show the opposite. This study examined the relative impact of each type of information by treating consumer ratings and reviews as orthogonal factors and then manipulating the valence of each type of information. Participants evaluated a novel health beverage by viewing consumer ratings and/or reading their reviews about the product. Results indicated that the valence of the base-rate information significantly affected participants’ evaluation of the product only when case <b>history</b> <b>information</b> was not presented. When case <b>history</b> <b>information</b> was presented, the valence of such information significantly affected participants’ evaluation of the product regardless of the valence of any base-rate information. These results demonstrate that base-rate neglect may bias individuals’ evaluations of products since base-rate information {{tends to be more}} representative of a population than case <b>history</b> <b>information.</b> Thus determining ways of making base-rate information more impactful in consumer settings is an important goal...|$|R
