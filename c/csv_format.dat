They work just as well with Unicode character sets (such as UTF-8 or UTF-16) as with ASCII (although particular programs that support CSV may have their own limitations).

50|$|TSV is an {{alternative}} to the common comma-separated values (<b>CSV)</b> <b>format,</b> which often causes difficulties because of the need to escape commas - literal commas are very common in text data, but literal tab stops are infrequent in running text.

50|$|CSV is {{a common}} data {{exchange}} format that is widely supported by consumer, business, and scientific applications. Among its most common uses is moving tabular data between programs that natively operate on incompatible (often proprietary or undocumented) formats. This works despite lack of adherence to RFC 4180 (or any other standard), because so many programs support variations on the <b>CSV</b> <b>format</b> for data import.|$|E
50|$|An {{external}} {{meteorological data}} source that delivers data in WDTF-compliant forms is the CSIRO Land & Water's Automatic Weatherstation Network. Data from this weatherstation network {{can be viewed}} in a web browser, downloaded at text values in <b>CSV</b> <b>format,</b> downloaded in a condensed XML format for machine-to-machine communications, or downloaded as WDTF-compliant data.

50|$|A Calliope model {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} structured text files, in YAML and <b>CSV</b> <b>formats,</b> that define the technologies, locations, and resource potentials. Calliope takes these files, constructs a pure linear optimization (no integer variables) problem, solves it, and reports the results in the form of pandas data structures for analysis. The framework contains five abstract base technologies - supply, demand, conversion, storage, transmission - from which new concrete technologies can be derived. The design of Calliope enforces the clear separation of framework (code) and model (data).|$|R
30|$|For {{simple and}} {{universal}} further processing, each feature {{set of the}} calculated electrical characteristics is stored as one row of double values in an easily readable tabular text format. The rows are time stamp indexed and saved in one character separated value (<b>csv)</b> <b>formatted</b> file each day. One csv file is created per captured channel. Each reaches a size of approximately 23 MB in 24 h. The overall data processing and local storage including raw data handling takes less than 15 ms on the actual computing hardware, which is short when compared to an update interval of 1 s.|$|R
50|$|When a NERC Tag {{was created}} in the spreadsheet, the {{information}} was then distilled into a small <b>CSV</b> <b>formatted</b> data packet which was disseminated via e-mail to all of the participants listed on the NERC tag. In this way, all participants of a transaction were able to determine which other electric utilities and power marketers were involved in the transaction, and what the roles of the other participants were. More importantly, {{in the event of a}} contingency such as a transmission line outage or generation failure, all participants could more easily be notified of the schedule change, and could then all act in cooperation to curtail the scheduled transaction.|$|R
