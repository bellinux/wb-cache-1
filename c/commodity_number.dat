The main reason is that farmers are able to earn income from their initial plants while they wait their new crops starting to produce. There are three reasons that farmers switch of social, economic, and agronomists. Social reasons, namely, to see the success of a friend of 41. 30 %, follow friends 39. 13 %, and their-owned beliefs 26. 08 %.

40|$|Abstract: Framing {{prostitution}} as {{an economic}} exchange, this paper evaluates some {{of the consequences of}} conceiving of sex as a commodity rather than as an aspect of an intimate interpersonal relationship among the customers of prostitutes. Subjects were 700 men arrested while trying to hire street prostitutes. Questionnaires were administered prior to intervention programs designed to discourage re-offense in San Francisco, California (N= 588); Portland, Oregon (N= 82); and Las Vegas, Nevada (N= 30). Significant predictors of conceiving of sex as a commodity included being unmarried, having served in the military, and more frequent visits to prostitutes. Conceiving of sex as a commodity significantly predicted rape myth acceptance, attraction to violent sexuality, less frequent use of condoms while with prostitutes, support for prostitution, and the attitude that prostitution is positive for women. We argue that that conceiving of sex as a <b>commodity</b> has a <b>number</b> of negative implications for the men involved, their sexual partners, and for gender relations in general...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Grain legumes play an {{important}} role in Nepalese agriculture contributing towards food and nutritional security, nitrogen economy, crop intensification, diversification and sustainable farming systems and rank fourth in terms of area and fifth in agricultural production. Grain Legumes Research program (GLRP) of Nepal in collaboration with CGIAR centers works for genetic improvement of lentil, chickpea, pigeonpea, soybean, mungbean, blackgram, and cowpea, resulting in development of 35 improved varieties and a dozen of production technologies for different agro-ecological domains. This has led to substantial increase (142 %) in grain legumes production, mainly because of 47 % area increase and 65 % yield increase during the last two and a half decades. The current estimates for area, production and productivity of grain legumes in Nepal are 334, 323 ha, 319, 770 metric tons and 956 kg ha- 1, respectively. Lentil is the major grain legume and accounts for 62 % of area and 65 % production of total grain legumes in Nepal and has emerged as {{an important}} export <b>commodity.</b> A <b>number</b> of micro-nutrient rich (iron, zinc and selenium) lentil lines have been identified in collaboration with ICARDA and scaled out under the Harvest Plus Challenge Program.

The {{study was conducted in}} seven sub-districts which belongs to Southern Region of Deli Serdang Regency. The data used in this study are society’s demography, production of agricultural commodities in 2009 - 2013, and also the number of agribussiness and settlement’s facilities. This study used description analysis, Location Quotient (LQ), Shift Share, and scalogram. The result of LQ and Shift Share analysis showed that there were seventeen superior commodities in Southern Region such as corns, cassavas, red chilis, tommatoes, eggplants, cucumbers, melons, bananas, zalaccas, petais, pecan nuts, cloves, kulit manis, beef cattles, buffaloes, goats, and pigs. According to their distribution, corns, cassavas, red chilis, eggplants, bananas, zalaccas, pecan nuts, beef cattles, buffaloes, goats, and pigs were produced by all of sub-districts.

Moreover various chromo-some representations will be applied, and the results through the numerical experiments will be com-pared.

40|$|In recent years, {{the impact}} of {{agricultural}} production on biodiversity and water quality has come forward. The Midwest has been particularly singled out due to its highly productive farmland and extensive agricultural production. The environmental degradation in the Midwest stems primarily from non-point source pollution such as soil erosion and agricultural chemical runoff and leaching. Another source of pollutants is from the runoff of fecal matter from confinement livestock operations. To address these pollution problems, a team of landscape architects created three alternative landscape designs for the Walnut Creek Watershed in Iowa. The three alternatives represent landscapes that might {{be seen in the}} year 2025, as a result of different pohcy choices. The three future scenarios differ in the priority given to commodity production, water quahty improvements, and restoration of biodiversity.

40|$|The {{transportation}} {{problem is}} a special type of linear program in which {{the objective is to}} minimize the total cost of shipping a single <b>commodity</b> from a <b>number</b> of sources (m) to a number of destinations or sinks (n).

Using sparse matrix techniques to store the solution array, and a rooted tree as the labeling method for handling the associated information provides a viable method to solve the transportation problem. A difficult test problem was designed to test the computer program and demonstrate its efficiency.

G 8 2011 Despite the {{government}} introduction of school feeding program in 1980 and free primary education in 2003 in its quest to provide basic education to all school going age children, the access and retention rates in nomadic schools {{are still very}} low, compared to other settled communities in Kenya. It was due to this that the researcher set to investigate the influence of school feeding program on access and retention among primary school children in nomadic families in central division of Wajir district. The specific objectives {{of the study were}} (i) to assess the ratio of food supplied and the requirements of the school from 2005 - 2010,(ii) to identify {{the extent to which the}} food supplied is optimally used, (iii) to relate the school feeding Program with pupils' access to education in primary schools in ASAL areas and (iv) to seek views of respondents on possible intervention measures to enhance access and retention in schools using SFP in ASAL primary school. The study used survey design which was conducted in central division of Wajir district, North Eastern province. The target population was 10, 452 pupils of which 3, 996 are girls and 6, 456 are boys as well as 265 teachers. The study also targeted the District Education Officer and District School Feeding Program officer stationed in the division. Simple random sampling procedure was used. The total sample size for the selected study constituted three hundred and sixty two respondents (362). The study used a questionnaire (administered to the head teacher and teachers), interview schedule (for the district education officer and the district school feeding program coordinators) and focus group discussion (administered to the pupils/learners). The SPSS program for MS Windows was used to analyze questionnaires. The study used frequencies and percentages because they easily communicated the research findings to majority of the readers. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data quantitatively. On the ratio of food supplied and the requirements of the schools from 2005 - 2010, the study found that the supply channeled to schools was enough to sustain the targeted population. Each child was entitled to receiving a ratio of the <b>commodity,</b> <b>numbers</b> stipulated according to the World Food Program. The study found that the supply channeled to schools was enough to sustain the targeted population based on world food program's policy. The majority of the pupils tended to come to school due to provision of food although the long distance from home to school was a major setback. The teachers indicated that SFP service could be improved by increasing quantity of food, the pupils thought that the school feeding program at their school could be improved by increasing the quantity and quality of food, the pupils and their parents / guardians wanted the school feeding program to continue. The study concludes that the main cause was lack of knowledge on the value of education, while others include lack of food and enough teachers in the schools. The study also states that the school feeding program has been used optimally and therefore should continue. The study further found out that there is a relationship between the schools feeding Program with pupils' access to education in primary schools in ASAL areas. The other finding was that there are inappropriate infrastructural facilities in schools which should be provided. A better economic way to cater for the needs of the nomads should be introduced to decrease poverty. More boarding schools should be introduced built in the area to avoid disturbances of the pupils while they move from one place to another. Kenyatta Universit...|$|R
