5|$|Because of its <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea, Jaywick {{had never}} been a {{practical}} place for farming due to the risk from floods; and the land remained unused. A sea wall was built in 1880 to protect against flooding. Ordnance Survey mapping around 1897 shows Jaywick as a few farmhouses near what is now Crossways on the Tudor estate.|$|E
5|$|Because of its <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike {{receives}} fewer visitors. When climbing {{from the}} west many people traverse the western slopes {{on their way to}} Helvellyn. Despite this the summit does still receive a large number of walkers, who use a large number of footpaths. The large number of footpaths causes significant disturbance to the summit vegetation, which could be greatly reduced by using fewer footpaths.|$|E
5|$|CU Denver {{features}} both {{undergraduate and}} graduate courses, with more than 35 {{percent of the students}} graduate students. The campus is located {{in the heart of the}} central business district and is in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pepsi Center, Elitch Gardens, The Colorado Convention Center, The Denver Center for the Performing Arts, Larimer Square, and the 16th Street Mall. The reclaimed Tivoli brewery, which closed in 1969, houses the student union.|$|E
50|$|George Best is also {{credited}} with {{working out the}} warmth of the tropics was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sun's light being spread over a smaller area, rather than their <b>closer</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sun.|$|R
60|$|Even {{those who}} were in <b>closest</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fugitive's own room, were so taken up with what they had seen that they either {{did not think of}} her, or {{supposed}} that fatigue had induced her to retire early.|$|R
30|$|The {{population}} {{within a}} specific state with power plants has priority to be served before power is exported {{out of the state}} (i.e., households with <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> power plants are served first until the capacity of the plant is fully utilized).|$|R
5|$|Despite {{not making}} landfall, Helene's <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States {{resulted}} in impacts along the East Coast. Impacts were most severe in North Carolina, where the hurricane made its closest approach. Wind impacts were felt primarily from South Carolina to Virginia, though a frontal zone aided in bringing precipitation {{as far north}} as Maine. In the United States, Helene caused $11.2million in damages and one indirect fatality.|$|E
5|$|Tawang Monastery, {{located in}} Tawang city of Tawang {{district}} in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, is the largest monastery in India and second {{largest in the world}} after the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet. It is situated in the valley of the Tawang River, near the small town of the same name in the northwestern part of Arunachal Pradesh, in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tibetan and Bhutanese border.|$|E
5|$|The New Harbour {{was later}} renamed as Keppel Harbour in 1900 after Admiral Sir Henry Keppel of HMS Meander, {{who carried out}} an on-site survey to build an {{anchorage}} in the harbour in the 1880s. He was also known for his successful campaigns against the pirates in 1842 that were boldly harassing merchant ships in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harbour. Piracy became less of {{a danger to the}} trade of Singapore only from the 1850s.|$|E
50|$|A Roman candle {{is a long}} tube {{containing}} {{several large}} stars which fire at a regular interval. These are commonly arranged in fan shapes or crisscrossing shapes, at a <b>closer</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience. Some larger Roman candles contain small shells (bombettes) rather than stars.|$|R
5000|$|Instead of a website's hosting server, CDNs {{are used}} in tandem with HTTP/2 in order <b>to</b> better serve <b>the</b> {{end-user}} with web resources such as images, JavaScript files and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files since a CDN's location is usually in <b>closer</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end-user.|$|R
50|$|Although Drumtochty Castle {{was built}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> designs of James Gillespie Graham with further {{extensions}} c. 1815, the actual {{work of the}} extensions was undertaken by Smith. Miller speculates Gillespie Graham {{could have had a}} dispute with the owner, George Drummond, but considers Smith's <b>closer</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site is a more plausible scenario.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
5|$|During the Singer World Series {{tournament in}} Sri Lanka in September 1994, which {{involved}} India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia, the Australian team {{stayed at the}} Oberoi Hotel in the capital Colombo. There was a casino in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel, which Waugh and Warne visited. Team manager Colin Egar had advised Warne {{that he had been}} told that the venue was unsavoury, but he was vague in his comments, and at the time, casinos were not perceived as trouble spots or traps for unwary cricketers.|$|E
5|$|I-87 {{begins in}} the Bronx at the {{northern}} approach to the Triborough Bridge, where it connects to the Bruckner Expressway (I-278) at a directional T interchange. The route heads west from the interchange, paralleling loosely with the Harlem River through Mott Haven. After , the highway makes a turn to the north, mirroring {{a change in the}} nearby river's course. It passes by Yankee Stadium on its way to Highbridge, where the Deegan connects to the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95 and U.S. Route1 or US1) at the eastern approach to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge. The Deegan remains in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Harlem River until the waterway turns westward at Kingsbridge to form the northern edge of Manhattan.|$|E

5|$|Q'anjob'al {{is spoken}} by 77,700 in Guatemala's Huehuetenango department, with small populations elsewhere. The region of Q'anjobalan {{speakers}} in Guatemala, due to genocidal policies during the Civil War and its <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mexican border, {{was the source}} of a number of refugees. Thus there are now small Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek, and Awakatek populations in various locations in Mexico, the United States (such as Tuscarawas County, Ohio and Los Angeles, California), and, through postwar resettlement, other parts of Guatemala. Jakaltek (also known as Popti') is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities of Huehuetenango. Another member of this branch is Akatek, with over 50,000 speakers in San Miguel Acatán and San Rafael La Independencia.|$|E
5|$|Rufus's {{gameplay}} {{has been}} compared to the fighting styles used by Street Fighter III characters Yun and Yang by the development team, notably in regards to his diving kick attack, and emphasized mobility while attacking. Other attacks were designed as a means to negate enemy offensives, such as the Galactic Tornado, which destroys enemy projectiles while drawing the opponent closer to Rufus for a final strike. His Ultra Combo, Space Opera Symphony, is a barrage of attacks that requires <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opponent, dealing several blows and ending in a final upwards blast.|$|E
5|$|Song Ci {{also shared}} his opinion that having the accused suspect {{of the murder}} present at the autopsy of his victim, in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grieving {{relatives}} of the deceased, was a very powerful psychological tool for the authorities to gain confessions. In the earliest known case of forensic entomology, a villager was hacked {{to death with a}} sickle, which led the local magistrate to assemble all the villagers in a town square to lay down their sickles in order for blow flies to gather around which sickle still had unseen remnants of the victim's blood; when it became apparent which sickle was used as the murder weapon, the confessing murderer was arrested on the spot.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cartridge}} {{overall length}} is 72.64 mm, cartridge case is 53.34 mm {{in length and}} the bullet diameter is [...]308 in (7.62 mm), which is common to all U.S[...]30 caliber cartridges. The principle {{at work in the}} short magnum cartridge is the advantage of fitting larger volumes of powder in <b>closer</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> primer's flash hole, resulting in more uniform, consistent ignition.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, we also {{investigated}} {{whether the}} concentration of the DNA solution {{plays a significant role}} in regulating <b>the</b> bundles size. <b>To</b> this purpose, 5 μL of 50  ng μL− 1 genomic DNA solution was deposited on a superhydrophobic surface wetted in the Cassie state. Referencing the bundles pinned outside the saw-shaped pillars, the average bundle diameter dependency on the distance from the stain is shown in Fig.  6 a. Like the higher concentrated DNA solution, the bundle diameter is ~ 160  nm in <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> DNA stain. Then, it decreases exponentially up to reach a plateau of ~ 15  nm at 60  μm far from the stain. Referencing the bundles pinned outside the saw-shaped pillars (Fig.  6 b), the average diameter is ~ 80  nm in <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> DNA stain and decreases monotonously up to 40  nm, like the more concentrated ones. DNA bundles can no longer be detected at 40 microns far from the stain.|$|R
5|$|The Main Media Centre of the 2010 Commonwealth Games managed media-related activities, and {{comprised}} the International Broadcasting Centre and the Main Press Centre. It {{was set up}} in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Games Village and the main venues at Pragati Maidan. State owned agencies managed both centres, with host broadcaster Prasar Bharti managing the International Broadcasting Centre and the Press Information Bureau managing the Main Press Centre. It was believed that by the time the Games are held, New Delhi would stop analogue broadcast and begin digital broadcast through a conditional access system, for which it is the first city in India to do so.|$|E
5|$|The Velepromet {{camp was}} a {{detention}} facility {{established in the}} final days of the Battle of Vukovar during the Croatian War of Independence. The camp was set up by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), which shared control of the facility with Croatian Serb rebels. The facility, originally an industrial storage site, was located on the southern outskirts of the city of Vukovar, in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> JNA barracks. It consisted of eight warehouses surrounded by a wire fence, and was established on 16 November 1991, when the first detainees were brought there.|$|E
5|$|The land {{upon which}} the site was {{developed}} was originally owned by Edward Hilliard. It was chosen in March 1915 by Wing Commander T. O. Lyons of the Air Ministry to house the Ordnance Aircraft Stores Depot from Farnborough, although {{a decision was made}} instead to establish the depot in Didcot, beside the existing buildings there. In 1917, the Ruislip site was revisited, and on 3 July was selected to house a depot for the Royal Flying Corps, under a military acquisition order. The <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great Western and Metropolitan Railways made it ideal for the purpose.|$|E

50|$|The name of {{the first}} French ship that brought {{settlers}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area is unknown today, and only its wreck date of 1719 remains. Both the Asia and the Georgina were sunk in the Northumberland Strait west of Naufrage in 1939, and between November 1 and November 8, 1906, there were four vessels wrecked near or around Naufrage, with the Shipwreck Point lighthouse being in <b>closest</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wrecks. The Sovinto and the Orpheus were wrecked at Priest Pond, while the Olga was sunk at Black Bush (present-day Hermanville) and the Turret Bell was sunk at Cable Head.|$|R
5|$|The neuroendocrine {{system is}} typical of insects. There is a brain, a subesophageal ganglion, three {{thoracic}} ganglia, and six abdominal ganglia. Strong neuron connections connect the neurohemal corpora cardiaca to the brain and frontal ganglion, where the closely related median corpus allatum produces juvenile hormone III in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neurohemal dorsal arota. The digestive system of earwigs is like all other insects, consisting of a fore-, mid-, and hindgut, but earwigs lack gastric caecae which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect. Long, slender (extratory) malpighian tubules can be found between the junction of the mid- and hind gut.|$|E
5|$|From 1964 until 1966 she dwelt {{in a flat}} at 8 Holly Hill, Hampstead, {{which was}} owned by the husband {{of one of her}} OMS students, the Latvian exile and poet Velta Snikere. After leaving Holly Hill, Montalban moved to a flat in the Queen Alexandra Mansions at 3 Grape Street in the St. Giles {{district}} of Holborn. Here, she was in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two primary bookstores then catering to occult interests, Atlantis Bookshop and Watkins Bookshop, {{as well as to the}} British Museum. She offered one of the rooms in her flat to a young astrologer and musician, Rick Hayward, whom she had met in the summer of 1967; he joined the OMS, and in the last few months of Montalban's life authored her astrological forecasts for Prediction. After her death, he continued publishing astrological prophecies in Prediction and Prediction Annual until summer 2012.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that they}} were being {{monitored}} by the Bavarian police, Lenin and the newspaper's other editors agreed to relocate Iskra to London, Britain, with Lenin and his wife arriving in the city in April 1902, there renting a flat in St. Pancras. Although despising English cuisine, Lenin liked London, spending much time in the Reading Room of the British Museum. He lived in <b>close</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other editors, but disliked their communal mode of living, instead becoming good friends with Trotsky, who had arrived in the city. While in London, Lenin fell ill with erysipelas and was unable to take such a leading role on the Iskra editorial board; in his absence the board approved a measure that he disagreed with, that of moving back to Switzerland. Before relocating, Lenin holidayed in Brittany, France with his mother and sister.|$|E
