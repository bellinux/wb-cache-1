5|$|The <b>Crossrail</b> project, to {{construct}} a new underground railway line through central London, will have one of its new stations at Liverpool Street. A new ticket hall serving the <b>Crossrail</b> station will be built within the old Underground ticket hall with its entrance at 100 Liverpool Street, the old entrance to the Underground that served Broad Street, with the platforms themselves under the Broadgate complex.|$|E
5|$|Angel is a {{proposed}} {{station on the}} <b>Crossrail</b> 2 (Chelsea-Hackney line) project, providing an interchange between <b>Crossrail</b> 2 and the Northern Line. Depending on the route constructed, it would be between King's Cross St. Pancras and Dalston Junction or Hackney Central. It was officially safeguarded {{as part of the}} route in 2007, although there had been proposals for a route for some time previously and safeguarding had been in place since 1991.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{the number of}} {{passengers}} using the branch stabilised at about 800 people each weekday. In 2009 the Chesham branch saw 427,000 journeys each year. The proposal to close the Aylesbury–Marylebone route was dropped, and instead the line was upgraded and equipped with fast British Rail Class 165 trains in the early 1990s. These reduced the travel time between Chalfont& Latimer and Marylebone to 33 minutes, increasing usage of the line as a commuter route. The Chesham branch was proposed as a terminus for the original <b>Crossrail</b> scheme, which would have seen <b>Crossrail</b> trains running from Paddington to serve the stations between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury and the Chesham branch, allowing London Transport to withdraw from Buckinghamshire and cut the Metropolitan line back to serve only the branches to Watford and Uxbridge. The bill proposing the scheme was defeated in Parliament and abandoned in 1995, and the revived scheme authorised by the <b>Crossrail</b> Act 2008 {{did not include the}} branches to Aylesbury and Chesham. By this time the little-used Central line branch from Epping to Ongar had closed, with the last services running on 30 September 1994, leaving Chesham—already the westernmost point of the London Underground network since 1961's withdrawal from Aylesbury—as the northernmost point on the London Underground.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of <b>Crossrail,</b> {{part of which}} runs between Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road stations, involved demolition of property in nearby Hanover Square, some of which backs onto New Bond Street. This affected Nos.64–72, which required refurbishment.|$|E
5|$|Euston was {{constructed}} as two separate underground stations. Three {{of the four}} Northern line platforms date from the station's opening in 1907. The fourth Northern line platform and the two Victoria line platforms were constructed in the 1960s when the station was significantly altered to accommodate the Victoria line. Plans for High Speed 2 and <b>Crossrail</b> 2 both include proposals to modify the station to provide interchanges with the new services.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, a {{team from}} the University of Cambridge began {{conducting}} a study in a short, double track section of unused tunnel near the platforms where a newly built tunnel for <b>Crossrail</b> is situated almost two metres beneath. The study is to establish how the original cast-iron lining sections, which {{are similar to those}} used for many miles of railway under London, resist possible deformation and soil movement caused by the developments.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{buildings}} on Lindsey Street opposite the East Market were demolished in 2010 to allow {{the construction of the}} new <b>Crossrail</b> Station at Farringdon. The demolished buildings include Smithfield House (an early 20th-century unlisted Hennebique concrete building), the Edmund Martin Ltd. shop (an earlier building with alterations dating to the 1930s) and two Victorian warehouses behind them.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} rebuilt {{in the early}} 1990s to {{accommodate}} {{the large number of}} passengers using the station. As a result, the station has an extra-wide southbound platform, the longest escalators on the Underground network and the fourth-longest escalators in Western Europe. It is a candidate station on the proposed <b>Crossrail</b> 2 line from north Surrey and south-west London to south-east Hertfordshire.|$|E
50|$|The nearest {{station is}} Abbey Wood for Southeastern {{services}} towards Barnehurst, Crayford, Dartford, Gillingham, London Cannon Street and Charing Cross. The station will soon become a terminus {{for the south}} eastern branch of <b>Crossrail's</b> Elizabeth Line, beginning in late 2018.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, it was {{announced}} that <b>Crossrail's</b> tunnel contractor BAM/Ferrovial/Kier (BFK) would form a grout shaft beneath the original tunnel of the old central London subway. The purpose of the grout shafts is to stabilize the ground in anticipation of the arrival of tunnel boring equipment in 2013.|$|R
2500|$|A {{more ambitious}} {{proposal}} named [...] "Superlink" [...] was proposed in 2004, {{at an estimated}} cost of £13billion, including additional infrastructure work outside London: in addition to <b>Crossrail's</b> east– [...] west tunnel, lines would connect towns including Cambridge, Ipswich, Southend-on-Sea, Pitsea, Reading, Basingstoke and Northampton. According to the scheme's promoters, the line would carry {{four times as many}} passengers and require a lower public subsidy as a result.|$|R
5|$|With {{the need}} for more rail {{capacity}} in London, <b>Crossrail</b> is due to open in 2018. It will be a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport. It is Europe's biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost.|$|E
5|$|Between April and August 2016 the Bakerloo line {{platforms}} {{were closed}} to enable escalator replacements {{and the construction}} of connecting passageways to the new <b>Crossrail</b> platforms due to open in 2018. In December 2016 Westminster City Council approved proposals to construct a new mixed-use development called Paddington Quarter on a site adjacent to the mainline station. The plans include reconstruction of the Bakerloo line station to provide a larger ticket hall and better access between platforms and street level.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{the council}} {{announced}} that Denmark Street would be redeveloped by the architectural firm ORMS {{as part of}} a major development in conjunction with the <b>Crossrail</b> construction work around Tottenham Court Road tube station and Centre Point. The proposed development includes the construction of an 800-seat subterranean performance venue. Numbers 1–6 and 17–21 Denmark Place, which run parallel along the back of the street, and the York and Clifton Mansions will be demolished, along with partial demolition of No. 21 Denmark Street.|$|E
50|$|A new {{commercial}} development on Moorgate, known as Moor House, opened in 2005. The building {{is located at}} the corner of Moorgate and London Wall, and was designed by Foster and Partners. The building has 28,000 m² of office space in 19 storeys, and is built in the location of a smaller office building built in the 1960s known as Moor House. A 36 m shaft under the building incorporates part of <b>Crossrail's</b> new station and ticket hall serving Liverpool Street.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2006, as {{with the}} Poplar branch (see above), the line between Stratford and North Woolwich was {{permanently}} closed to make a way for a future DLR extension from [...] to Stratford International (opened February 2011). The section south of Canning Town was not used by the DLR, as it is largely duplicated by the DLR King George V branch. Instead, the section will become part of <b>Crossrail's</b> branch to [...] (opening 2018). The section south of Stratford {{had always been the}} 'Cinderella' end of the line, in that when there were operating problems it was common for trains to be turned short at Stratford.|$|R
40|$|Constructing tunnels {{in highly}} {{congested}} urban cities is a challenge, as the construction will inevitably {{take place in}} close proximity to existing structures both above and below ground. As more tunnels are being constructed, it is inevitable that some tunnels will be constructed {{in close proximity to}} existing tunnels and monitoring of the existing tunnels in this case is paramount for the design and construction works. The discrete nature of conventional monitoring instrumentation requires significant interpolation and judgement {{in order to understand the}} overall behaviour of the tunnel itself. Subsequently, conservative design approaches will have to be adopted to cater for the gaps in knowledge, which could lead to unnecessary delays and high costs. Distributed fibre optic strain sensing systems based on Brillouin Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (BOTDR) could offer an alternative; in this paper a case study is presented where fibre optic cables were deployed to monitor the response of the cast iron Royal Mail tunnel in the vicinity of London Liverpool Street Station during the construction of <b>Crossrail’s</b> new platform tunnel directly below it. Single mode single core tight-buffered cables were attached directly to the intrados of the cast iron tunnel lining of the Royal Mail tunnel to understand its response during the construction works. This paper focuses on the challenges and considerations in deploying the fibre optic system in the tunnel and presents some of the data, which demonstrates the potential benefit of using such a system in real, complex tunnelling scenarios...|$|R
5|$|The station {{will have}} 24 {{platforms}} serving both high-speed and ordinary lines {{at a low}} level. The flats demolished for the extension would be replaced by significant building work above. The underground station would be rebuilt and connected to Euston Square tube station. As part of the extension beyond Birmingham, the Mayor of London's office believed {{it will be necessary}} to build the proposed <b>Crossrail</b> 2 line via Euston to relieve 10,000 extra passengers forecast to arrive during an average day.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} {{introduction}} of S Stock trains, the track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme planned to increase peak-hour capacity on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines by 65 per cent by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface railway is to be established in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s. The cross-London <b>Crossrail</b> line, planned to open in 2018, is expected to reduce crowding between Paddington and Whitechapel.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Transport for London {{suggested}} that pedestrianisation {{may not be}} a suitable long-term measure due to <b>Crossrail</b> reducing the demand for bus services along Oxford Street, and proposed to ban all traffic except buses and cycles during peak shopping times. Optimisation of existing traffic signals along the street, including Pedestrian Countdown signals, have also been proposed. Transport for London is concerned that in the long term traffic problems may affect trade on Oxford Street, which is now competing with shopping centres such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre. In 2015, while campaigning for election as London Mayor, Labour's Sadiq Khan favoured the full pedestrianisation of Oxford Street, which was supported by other parties. After winning the election, he pledged the street would be completely pedestrianised by 2020, including a ban on buses and taxis. By 2017, this had been revised forward {{to the end of the}} following year.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, {{after it}} was {{announced}} that Phase 2 might cost $6 billion, transit experts expressed concern that the Second Avenue Subway might be so excessively costly as to preclude construction of Phases 3 and 4, as well as future expansions. One expert stated that the Phase 1 project was the most expensive subway project in the world, and that compared to other subway systems around the world, the cost of building new subways in New York City was much higher. The Second Avenue Subway's per-mile construction cost is higher than that of other projects in similar cities like London's <b>Crossrail</b> and Paris's Grand Paris Express, which themselves are among the most expensive underground-railway projects in the world. MTA officials stated that the Second Avenue Subway cost as much as it did only because of the complex underground infrastructure in Manhattan, as well as the fact that the New York City Subway runs all the time.|$|E

25|$|<b>Crossrail</b> {{is a major}} rail {{scheme to}} provide a new east-west railway {{connection}} under Central London. The western portion of the line will connect with the Great Western main line {{to the west of}} Paddington. Current plans are for <b>Crossrail</b> services to terminate at Reading in the west. With electrification of the Great Western being extended westwards past Reading, the Department of Transport has stated that <b>Crossrail</b> will terminate at Reading from the outset. Some of the suburban services using the GWML into London Paddington will be transferred to <b>Crossrail,</b> which will free up some capacity at the surface level station at London Paddington.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, <b>Crossrail</b> {{announced}} that five bidders had been shortlisted for {{the contract to}} build the Class 345 and its associated depot. One of the bidders, Alstom, withdrew from the process in July 2011. In February 2012, <b>Crossrail</b> issued an invitation to negotiate to CAF, Siemens, Hitachi and Bombardier, with tenders expected to be submitted by mid-2012. In 2013, Siemens also withdrew from the bid, but will provide signalling and control systems for <b>Crossrail.</b>|$|E
