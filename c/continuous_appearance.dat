60|$|The {{whole of}} this {{description}} answers most accurately {{to the island}} of Exuma, which lies south from San Salvador, and S. W. by S. from Concepcion. The only inconsistency is, that Columbus states that Fernandina bore nearly west from Concepcion, and was twenty-eight leagues in extent. This mistake must have proceeded from his having taken the long chain of keys called La Cadena {{for part of the}} same Exuma; which <b>continuous</b> <b>appearance</b> they naturally assume when seen from Concepcion, for they run in the same S.E. and N. W. direction. Their bearings, when seen from the same point, are likewise westerly as well as southwesterly. As a proof that such was the case, it may be observed, that, after having approached these islands, instead of the extent of Fernandina being increased to his eye, he now remarks that it was twenty leagues long, whereas before it was estimated by him at twenty-eight; he now discovers that instead of one island there were many, and alters his course southerly to reach the one that was most conspicuous.|$|E

50|$|The small shell {{measures}} 2.1 mm. It is umbilicated, elongate-ovate conic, semitransparent, polished. The 2½ whorls of the protoconch are moderately large, helicoid, elevated, about one-fifth {{immersed in}} the first of the succeeding whorls and having their axis at a right angle to them. The five whorls of the teleoconch are flattened, angulated at the periphery and weakly shouldered at the summit; the latter falls somewhat anterior to the periphery of the preceding whorl and lends to it a somewhat constricted appearance at the well-impressed suture. The whorls are marked by extremely fine, closely placed, wavy spiral striations, which are visible only under very high magnification. The periphery of the last whorl is somewhat angulated. The base of the shell is very broad, gently rounded, somewhat pinched at the narrow umbilicus. The aperture is elongate-ovate, somewhat prolonged at the junction of the outer lip and columella. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, somewhat effuse. The slender columella is decidedly curved, slightly revolute, provided with a prominent oblique fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a strong callus which lends the periostracum an almost <b>continuous</b> <b>appearance.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The small, milk-white shell {{grows to}} {{a length of}} 2.0 mm. It is umbilicated, {{regularly}} conic with an obliquely truncated apex and deeply channeled sutures. The whorls of the protoconch are almost completely immersed in the first whorl of the teleoconch. Only half of the last volution projects above it. The four whorls of the teleoconch are flattened. They are marked by strong, very obliquely backward-slanting axial ribs, which are thickened at the summits and constricted a little below the summit, which renders {{the top of each}} rib beaded. Anteriorly the ribs are terminated by the posterior margin of the peripheral sulcus; here the ribs expand somewhat and almost fuse, and this expansion gives them a subnodulose effect at this point. The intercostal spaces are smooth, about as wide as the axial ribs, decidedly depressed in the middle—that is, between the bead at the summit and the nodules at the periphery. The periphery of the body whorl is deeply sulcate. The base of the shell is well rounded. It is marked by about nine spiral lirations, the posterior one of which is decidedly wider than the rest. The depressed spaces between the lirations are marked by fine axiaf threads. Both the spiral lirations and the spaces between them gradually diminish in width from the periphery to the umbilical area. The aperture is suboval The posterior angle is acute. The columella is strongly oblique, somewhat revolute, reinforced by the somewhat attenuated base and provided with a fairly strong oblique fold near its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a thick callus, which gives the periostracum a <b>continuous</b> <b>appearance.</b> On the body whorl the first basal keel appears above the sutures, which is therefore not channeled like the sutures of the preceding whorls.|$|E

40|$|A general {{formulation}} of classical relativistic particle mechanics is presented, {{with an emphasis}} on the fact that superluminal velocities and nonlocal interactions are compatible with relativity. Then a manifestly relativistic-covariant {{formulation of}} relativistic quantum mechanics (QM) of fixed number of particles (with or without spin) is presented, based on many-time wave functions and the spacetime probabilistic interpretation. These results are used to formulate the Bohmian interpretation of relativistic QM in a manifestly relativistic-covariant form. The results are also generalized to quantum field theory (QFT), where quantum states are represented by wave functions depending on an infinite number of spacetime coordinates. The corresponding Bohmian interpretation of QFT describes an infinite number of particle trajectories.

Various methods of mixing(: the polymer and additive were investigated and a method involving the screw-Extrusion of the polymer and the additive was ultimately adopted. Crystallisation {{studies were carried out}} using differential scanning calorimetry under dynamic and isothermal modes. The results produced under conditions of isothermal crystallisation were analysed by means of a computer. Despite differences between batches of polymer all the additives with the exception of indigo produced a nucleating effect in the polymer as indicated by an increase in the rate of crystallisation compared with that of the base polymer. Two organo-metallic substances (sodium benzoate and sodium stearate) proved to be the most effective in this respect by decreasing the degree of supercooling of the polymer by 20 [degrees]. Morphological studies were carried out on isothermally crystallised samples, after etching and replication using a transmission electron microscope. A nodular structure whose dimensions were sensitive to both the nucleating agent and the temperature of crystallisation was observed. Mechanical testing of samples direct from the D. S. C. was carried out using a compression method. The breaking loads were found to vary with both the type of nucleating agent used and the crystallisation temperature chosen. A separate study involving the exanination of the resulting fracture surfaces by scanning electron microscopy revealed that a, high breaking load was associated with a fine discontinuous structure whereas lower breaking loads were characterised by a more <b>continuous</b> linear <b>appearance.</b> This implies a higher energy of fracture due to the increased surface area of the fracture surface of the former...|$|R
40|$|The Fatha (ex-Lower Fars) Formation (Middle Miocene) is the {{predominant}} stratigraphic {{unit in the}} Mosul Dam area. It is about 250 meters thick near Mosul. Marls, chalky limestone, gypsum, anhydrite, and limestone form a layered sequence of rocks under {{the foundation of the}} dam. The foundation of the dam is mainly resting on the Fatha Formation (Middle Miocene) which is highly karstified. Karstic limestone and the development of solution cavities within the gypsum and anhydrite layers are the main geological features under the foundation of the dam. The right (west) abutment is located in the steeply dipping Fatha Formation within Butmah East anticline with SE plunge being in the reservoir north of the dam, whereas the left (east) abutment is located on gently dipping beds of the Fatha Formation, which is overlain by fine clastics of the Injana Formation. These differences in lithology as well the dip amount and direction along both abutments as well upstream and downstream of the dam have certainly affected on the hydraulic pressure and increased the dissolution ability of the gypsum and limestone beds, along the abutments and the foundations, which are already karstified in nearby areas. Consequently, more gypsum, anhydrite and limestone beds are dissolved and karst openings are continuously increasing, as the exerted hydraulic pressure is <b>continuous.</b> First <b>appearance</b> of sinkholes on the right bank down-stream was not until approximately six years after the filling of the reservoir began.
