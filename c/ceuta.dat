5|$|Some {{years after}} the events in Tarifa, a quarrel erupted between the Marinids and the Nasrids, in 1306. The Nasrids {{promptly}} sponsored the rebellion of Uthman ibn Idris, a pretender to the Marinid throne in Morocco. Uthman was landed by a Nasrid force in <b>Ceuta,</b> and quickly carved out an enclave. The rebels continued to receive support across the strait from the Nasrid garrisons. It is believed that the Marinid sultan Abu al-Rabi Sulayman, unable to dislodge the rebel from <b>Ceuta,</b> intrigued with the Castilians, whose truce with Granada was about to expire, encouraging them to take Algeciras and Gibraltar and cut the rebel off. The first siege of Gibraltar was a side-operation of the main Castilian siege of Algeciras in 1309–10.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Gibraltar {{led to the}} {{deposition}} of the Nasrid sultan of Granada by his brother Nasr, who quickly reversed policy, abandoned the rebels in <b>Ceuta</b> and gave Algeciras (and thus the claim on Gibraltar) to the Marinids in 1310, {{as part of a}} new treaty, hoping they might recover it. But too busy elsewhere for any entanglements in Spain, the Marinids gave Algeciras back to Granada almost immediately after. The Granadans launched an attempt to recover Gibraltar by themselves in 1315, but without Marinid support, the Second Siege of Gibraltar faltered and failed.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 19 February 1801 {{was a minor}} naval battle {{fought off}} <b>Ceuta</b> in Spanish North Africa in February 1801 between frigates of the French and Royal Navies during the French Revolutionary Wars. The {{engagement}} formed {{part of a series}} of actions fought to prevent the French from resupplying their garrison in Egypt, which had been trapped there without significant reinforcement since the defeat of the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of the Nile {{two and a half years}} earlier. The leader of the Egyptian expedition, General Napoleon Bonaparte, had returned to France in 1799 and promised aid to the troops left behind, prompting several expeditions to the region carrying reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Review, Admiral Graf Spee returned to Spain for a fourth non-intervention patrol. Following fleet manoeuvres and a brief visit to Sweden, the ship conducted a fifth and final patrol in February 1938. In 1938, KzS Hans Langsdorff took command of the vessel; she conducted a series of goodwill visits to various foreign ports throughout the year. These included cruises into the Atlantic, where she stopped in Tangier and Vigo. She also participated in extensive fleet manoeuvres in German waters. She was part of the celebrations for the reintegration of the port of Memel into Germany, and a fleet review in honour of Admiral Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. Between 18 April and 17 May 1939, she conducted another cruise into the Atlantic, stopping in the ports of <b>Ceuta</b> and Lisbon. On 21 August 1939, Admiral Graf Spee departed Wilhelmshaven, bound for the South Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Daoíz {{volunteered to}} help defend <b>Ceuta</b> against the Moors in 1790 {{and was given}} command of an {{artillery}} battery. He remained in North Africa {{to assist with the}} defence of Oran in 1791, spending part of the time with a unit of miners. Daoíz was commended by his superiors, including artillery Brigadier Andres Aznar, for his courage and zeal in the battles and was promoted to lieutenant on 28 February 1792. After Spain joined the First Coalition against Revolutionary France, Daoíz participated in the War of Roussillon, in the Pyrenees, from March 1794 but was captured in a French counterattack on 25 November 1794. He was held as a prisoner of war at Toulouse where he turned down an offer of freedom and a commission in the French Army, which was short of artillery officers. After the Peace of Basel ended the war between France and Spain on 22 July 1795, Daoíz was released and made his way back to El Puerto de Santa Maria.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and {{autonomous}} communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although {{the effect was}} mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both autonomous cities; <b>Ceuta</b> (1998) and Melilla (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had no rights if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{control over}} the city ended {{following}} {{the chaos of the}} Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established.In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised {{what was left of the}} province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern <b>Ceuta).</b> Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses.|$|E
5|$|She {{fought with}} the Spanish Republican Navy in the Spanish Civil War. At the {{outbreak}} of the Nationalist revolt, wireless operators in the navy headquarters Madrid intercepted radio messages from General Francisco Franco to rebels in Morocco. They alerted the crews aboard Jaime I and other ships, who mutinied against their rebellious officers and ensured the ships would remain under Republican control. The vessels were nevertheless crippled by poor discipline for some time, as they had murdered many of their officers, and distrusted those that were not killed. On the first months of the war, Jaime I shelled a number of rebel strongholds, among them <b>Ceuta,</b> Melilla and Algeciras. In Algeciras she hit with her secondary armament the Nationalist gunboat Eduardo Dato, which was burned down to the waterline, although she was later repaired and returned to service.|$|E
5|$|The siege {{began in}} May 1648. The Ottomans spent three months {{investing}} the city, which included {{cutting off the}} water supply. Eventually, it would last until 1669, the second longest siege in history after the Siege of <b>Ceuta</b> (1694-1727) by the Moors under Moulay Ismail. The Ottoman besiegers were adversely affected by the bad supply situation caused by {{the activity of the}} Christian fleets in the Aegean, who intercepted Ottoman convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements to the island. In addition, the overall Ottoman war effort was severely hampered by increased domestic instability caused by Sultan Ibrahim's erratic policies and his summary execution of leading state officials. It ultimately led to his deposition in favor of his son Mehmed IV, ushering in a further period of confusion within the Ottoman government.|$|E
5|$|For {{operations}} in the Mediterranean during the 5th century, fleets {{appear to have been}} assembled on an ad hoc basis and then disbanded. The first permanent Byzantine fleet {{can be traced to the}} early 6th century and the revolt of Vitalian in 513–515, when Anastasius I created a fleet to counter the rebels' own. This fleet was retained, and under Justinian I and his successors it was developed into a professional and well-maintained force. Because of the absence of any naval threat, however, the navy of the late 6th century was relatively small, with several small flotillas in the Danube and two main fleets maintained at Ravenna and Constantinople. Additional flotillas must have been stationed at the other great maritime and commercial centres of the Empire: at Alexandria, providing the escort to the annual grain fleet to Constantinople, and at Carthage, controlling the western Mediterranean. Justinian also stationed troops and ships at the more remote outposts of the Empire, at Septem (<b>Ceuta),</b> Cherson in the Crimea, and Aelana (Eilat) in the Gulf of Aqaba. The long-established naval tradition and infrastructure of those areas made the maintenance of the fleet easier, and, in the event of a naval expedition, a large fleet could be quickly and inexpensively assembled by impressing the numerous merchant vessels.|$|E
25|$|The colony at <b>Ceuta</b> rapidly {{became a}} drain on the Portuguese treasury, and it was {{realised}} that without the city of Tangier, possession of <b>Ceuta</b> was worthless. After <b>Ceuta</b> was captured by the Portuguese, the camel caravans {{that were part of}} the overland trade routes began to use Tangier as their new destination. This deprived <b>Ceuta</b> of the materials and goods that made it an attractive market and a vibrant trading locale, and it became an isolated community.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ceuta</b> and Melilla are two Spanish {{cities on}} the North African coast. They {{are part of}} the EU but they are {{excluded}} from the common agricultural and fisheries policies. They are also outside the customs union and VAT area, but no customs are levied on goods exported from the Union into either <b>Ceuta</b> and Melilla, and certain goods originating in <b>Ceuta</b> and Melilla are exempt from customs charges.|$|E
25|$|On November 5, while King Juan Carlos I {{was visiting}} <b>Ceuta,</b> Abbas el Fassi {{compared}} {{the situation of}} <b>Ceuta</b> and Melilla to the Israeli occupation of Palestine during a special session of the Moroccan Parliament to discuss the issue.|$|E
25|$|The King of Spain had not visited <b>Ceuta</b> and Melilla in his reign. The most {{immediate}} antecedent of the stay of King Juan Carlos I in these cities {{dates back to}} 1970, when he undertook a visit to <b>Ceuta</b> {{in his capacity as}} Prince of Asturias {{on the occasion of the}} fiftieth anniversary of the Spanish Legion.|$|E
25|$|Seguí then telephoned <b>Ceuta</b> and Tetuán {{and sent}} a {{telegraph}} to Franco at Las Palmas. Colonel Yagüe, with the II Bandera of the Spanish Legion, seized <b>Ceuta</b> while Colonel Saenz de Buruaga, with the V Bandera of the Spanish Legion, took Tetuán. The rebel troops in <b>Ceuta</b> occupied the working class districts and killed prominent unionists and the major of the city, and in Tetuán, the Foreign Legion seized the Casa del Pueblo and executed the union officers and all persons found with arms. Furthermore, Colonel Beigbeder, gained {{the support of the}} Grand Vizier of Tetuán, Mulay Hassan, and Moroccan volunteers started to join the rebellion.|$|E
25|$|In his {{official}} chronicle, Ruy de Pina {{makes no mention}} of the noble or the escape plan, and suggests the negotiations broke down simply because Abu Zakariya had little interest in actually recovering <b>Ceuta,</b> that the Portuguese presence in <b>Ceuta</b> served Abu Zakariya as a useful political distraction for the Moroccan population, allowing the Wattasid vizier to consolidate his power domestically.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Algeciras Heliport {{is being}} built for {{transport}} to <b>Ceuta</b> and other areas in the region.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ceuta,</b> on the {{southern}} shore of the Strait of Gibraltar, had been captured in 1415 by the Portuguese, under King John I. In 1421 the King's son, Henry the Navigator, sent a Holy Virgin's statue to <b>Ceuta</b> in order to consecrate Africa to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the invocation of Our Lady of Africa. That way, {{each of the two}} Pillars of Hercules was the site of a Marian shrine, consecrating both continents to Our Lady.|$|E

25|$|Ali ibn Hammud, Emir of <b>Ceuta,</b> {{declares}} {{himself the}} rightful Caliph and marches on Córdoba. A Berber general deposes and executes Caliph Suleiman II.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century, only Melilla, Alhucemas, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera (which {{had been}} taken again in 1564), <b>Ceuta</b> (part of the Portuguese Empire since 1415, has chosen to retain its links to Spain once the Iberian Union ended; the formal {{allegiance}} of <b>Ceuta</b> to Spain was recognized by the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668), Oran and Mazalquivir remained as Spanish territory in Africa. The latter cities were lost in 1708, reconquered in 1732 and sold by Charles IV in 1792.|$|E
25|$|It {{was already}} {{known that the}} Genoese sailors had been dealing with the Merinids of Gibraltar and <b>Ceuta,</b> and the {{relations}} between them were far from hostile.|$|E
25|$|Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmad {{was born}} to a Muslim family in <b>Ceuta,</b> a Spanish enclave in North Africa. As a young man, he worked in {{construction}} when jobs were available.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese {{foreign policy}} {{promoted}} {{the interests of}} Lisbon: trade and cooperation agreements were signed with the commercial city-states of Venice (accord of 1392), Genoa (1398), Pisa and Florence, whose merchants had already formed communities in the city, and {{many of whom were}} naturalised and married into the Portuguese nobility. <b>Ceuta</b> on the north African coast was captured by the Portuguese during the Battle of <b>Ceuta</b> in 1415, giving Lisbon's merchants a base from which to attack Saracen pirates and better local control of the Mediterranean trade that passed through the Strait of Gibraltar, as well as the importation of Moroccan wheat at the best prices. Moreover, at this time <b>Ceuta</b> received caravans bearing gold and ivory, a trade Lisbon wanted to dominate, and it was feared that its Castilian rivals in Seville or the Aragonese of Barcelona might seize the outpost. A renewed alliance with England, one of its most important trade partners, was pursued.|$|E
25|$|In 1414 Oswald {{became a}} member of the entourage of Friedrich IV, Duke of Austria and Count of Tyrol at the Council of Constance (1414–18); a {{portrait}} of Oswald can be found in the council's chronicle (by Ulrich von Richental). Oswald entered as diplomat in the service of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary. His first diplomatic voyage brought him to England, Scotland and Portugal, where he participated in the conquest of the Moorish city of <b>Ceuta</b> (see Battle of <b>Ceuta).</b> In 1416 he joined King Sigismund in France and they travelled together back to Constance.|$|E
25|$|Although Abu Zakariya did not {{ultimately}} recover <b>Ceuta,</b> {{the victory}} at Tangier {{was instrumental in}} the ascent of the Wattasid viziers and their eventual eclipse of the Marinid sultans in whose name they ruled.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{is divided}} into 17 {{autonomous}} communities, which in turn are divided into 50 provinces. There are also two autonomous cities: those of <b>Ceuta</b> and Melilla. Finally, each province comprises a number of municipalities.|$|E
25|$|John I of Castile died in 1390 {{without issue}} {{from his wife}} Beatrice, which meant that a {{competing}} legitimate bloodline with a claim to the throne of Portugal died out. John I of Portugal was then able to rule in peace and concentrate on the economic development and territorial expansion of his realm. The most significant military actions were the siege and conquest {{of the city of}} <b>Ceuta</b> by Portugal in 1415, and the successful defence of <b>Ceuta</b> from a Moroccan counterattack in 1419. These measure were intended to help seize control of navigation off the African coast and trade routes from the interior of Africa.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{along with}} the 17 {{autonomous}} communities, two autonomous cities {{are also part of}} the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: <b>Ceuta</b> and Melilla. These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.|$|E
25|$|The {{last visit}} of a Head of State of Spain to <b>Ceuta</b> and Melilla was by king Alfonso XIII, who {{was last seen}} in 1927, and President of the Second Republic, Niceto Alcala Zamora, on 4 November 1933.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a similar}} system for local border traffic permits between Spain and Morocco {{regarding}} <b>Ceuta</b> and Melilla. This system is older and {{was included in the}} 1991 accession treaty of Spain to the Schengen Area.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th century, the Portuguese troops {{defeated}} Castilian invaders, {{obtaining a}} definitive {{victory in the}} Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385. With the independence guaranteed, Portugal then began its worldwide overseas expansion, starting by the conquest of <b>Ceuta</b> in North Africa in 1415.|$|E
25|$|The Spaniards took Crafty into <b>Ceuta.</b> Reportedly, the Spaniards had {{suffered}} four men killed and nine wounded in their attack. Marshall, in writing Spencer's biography, implied that Spanish casualties were triple those on Crafty, {{and reported that}} the Spanish commodore and his captain died while boarding Crafty.|$|E
25|$|In 1416, King John I of Portugal {{placed his}} son, the Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator, Duke of Viseu, {{in charge of}} {{supplying}} and provisioning <b>Ceuta.</b> As a result, Henry was disinclined to abandoning the city, and instead urged an expansion of Portuguese holdings in Morocco.|$|E
25|$|Al-Abbas {{was born}} in <b>Ceuta,</b> but moved to Marrakesh in 1145-6, during the final weeks of the Almohad siege of the city. For {{a number of years}} he lived in a cave on the hill of Igilliz outside Marrakesh, only coming into town on Fridays for the {{communal}} prayer.|$|E
25|$|Llanito, {{the vernacular}} {{language}} {{for the majority}} of Gibraltarians, has significant Jewish influence. Some 500 words are of Hebrew origin, and the language also has features of influence from Haketia, a Judeo-Spanish language spoken by the Sephardic communities of Northern Morocco and the Spanish exclaves of <b>Ceuta</b> and Melilla.|$|E
