This has been the government's policy for over 40 years. Contractor <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> has become the largest unallowable cost. This research examines how contractors view <b>interest</b> <b>expense.</b> Additionally, the reactions of contractors if <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> were to be allowed is discussed.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} whether the {{substitution}} of employee stock options (ESOs) for debt occurs for firms with different tax status classifications throughout the conditional distribution of <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> {{before and after the}} implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 123 R (SFAS 123 R). Design/methodology/approach – This study uses Censored Quantile Regression (CQR) to assess whether the substitution effect is dependent on firms 2 ̆ 7 position in the conditional distribution of <b>interest</b> <b>expense.</b> Our sample firms are categorized into two groups: one group (tax‐sensitive) that is sensitive to additional deductions due to a moderate income level and the other group (tax‐insatiable) that is not sensitive because of very high income level. Findings – The substitution effect is not present for firms with below medium level of <b>interest</b> <b>expense.</b> Only tax‐sensitive firms substitute at medium levels of <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> while both tax‐sensitive and tax‐insatiable firms substitute at high levels of <b>interest</b> <b>expense.</b> Tax‐insatiable firms with very high levels of <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> also substitute; however, tax‐sensitive firms with very high levels of <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> only substitute after SFAS 123 R required firms to report ESO expense in financial statements. We attribute the substitution patterns revealed by the CQR analysis to a positive relationship between <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> and cost of debt. Originality/value – To the authors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge, this is the first paper to analyze firms 2 ̆ 7 tax status classification impact on the substitution of ESO <b>expense</b> for <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> across different levels of <b>interest</b> <b>expense.</b> Our application of CQR should benefit researchers who are interested in examining explanatory variables 2 ̆ 7 impact at various points in the conditional distribution of the dependent variable. This study also refines the conjecture that ESOs are substitutes for debt by demonstrating that such relationship is dependent on the level of <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> and tax status. Furthermore, the finding of firms substituting ESOs for debt provides accounting standard setters a reason to begin requiring firms to re‐measure the value of ESOs after the grant date until the exercise date...|$|R

40|$|Investment {{income tax}} {{planning}} requires informed, strategic choices. One must determine {{the amount of}} qualified dividends and net long-term capital gain to be included in investment income (against which investment <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> can be deducted). This choice also determines the residual qualified dividends and net long-term capital gain which enjoy a reduced tax rate. Another important decision is whether all or some of this <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> should be deducted in the current year or carried forward. This paper puts forward a new approach to formulate these questions as a generalized resource allocation problem which permits analysis of the interdependence between, and the tax consequences of, the above decisions. The commonly used approach - deducting investment <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> sooner rather than later - we consider myopic since the benefit of deferring some of the deduction is not leveraged. Presented here is a tax planning guideline (a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality) to realize a more forward-looking strategy.

40|$|One of the {{important}} changes of the 1986 tax reform for U. S. multinationals {{is related to the}} allocation of <b>interest</b> <b>expense.</b> Prior to 1986, U. S. companies allocated domestic <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> to the income of foreign affiliates on a non-consolidated basis according to the distribution of gross income or assets. After 1986, a U. S. multinational is required to allocate domestic <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> on a consolidated basis according to the distribution of U. S. and foreign assets. We analyze the impact of the new interest allocation rules on the financial and investment decisions of U. S. multinationals using data from a survey of multinationals assembled by Price Waterhouse. We find that the allocation of <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> increases the marginal cost of U. S. debt by about 38 percent for firms with excess foreign tax credits. Our empirical tests suggest that firms have altered the location of their borrowings in response to the new rules. We also find that the requirement to allocate <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> has {{a significant impact on the}} effective tax rate faced by U. S. multinationals. For U. S. domestic investments, the interest allocation rules increase the U. S. effective rate from 17. 6 percent to 21. 9 percent.

5000|$|Overtrading {{is a term}} in {{financial}} statement analysis. Overtrading often occurs when companies expand their own operations too quickly (aggressively).

40|$|In {{spite of}} their differences, both a {{cash-flow}} consumption tax and a Schanz-Haig-Simons income tax require that dollars paid out as business or investment expenses be eliminated from the base. This is necessary under a cash-flow consumption tax because business and investment expenses are not consumption and it is necessary under an SHS tax because these expenditures are neither consumption nor additions to savings. Since business and investment outlays {{have no place in}} the base of either tax, intuition suggests that business and investment <b>interest</b> <b>expenses</b> would be treated identically under a cash-flow consumption tax and an SHS tax. But they are not. The cash-flow regime allows a deduction for such interest only if the related debt is included in the tax base whereas business and investment interest is always deductible under an SHS tax even though the related debt is never part of the base (unless the debt is bogus or is ultimately canceled). The apparent conflict is, however, deceptive because the <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> deduction serves different functions in these two different taxing regimes. In the cash-flow system, business and investment capital income is wholly excluded from the tax base with the result that a deduction for related <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> is not required to arrive at a net taxable amount. Instead, the cash-flow consumption tax employs an <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> deduction as part of an adjustment mechanism that removes previously included borrowings from the tax base. Thus, an interest deduction is not appropriate under a cash-flow regime unless the related debt was part of the base at an earlier time. By contrast, an SHS tax always excludes borrowed amounts from its base so that no <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> deduction is necessary to assist in canceling the prior inclusion of borrowed sums. But an SHS regime invariably includes business and investment income in the base. Consequently, and SHS deduction for business and investment <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> is required to reduce related gross income to a net amount even though the debt which generated the interest outlay was not a previously included item. This illustrates the point that the propriety of an <b>interest</b> <b>expense</b> deduction depends on the role which is assigned to the deduction in the particular tax system...|$|R
