5|$|At {{check-in}} {{a dedicated}} bellhop staff will retrieve a customer's luggage from their prior hotel, airport, etc. {{so that the}} <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> not left waiting for luggage arrival. A complimentary Japanese tea service greets each guest upon check-in, featuring green tea and special rice crackers. As a security feature, the elevators must be operated from the outside with a room key. There are no buttons inside the elevators themselves. Other services include 24-hour in-room dining {{and access to the}} spa. WiFi access and shoeshine services are available for an additional charge.|$|E
5|$|Many bathhouses {{are open}} {{twenty-four hours a}} day, seven days a week. There is {{typically}} a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry {{to those who are}} visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.|$|E
5000|$|Referral-based <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> better matched. [...] The {{referred}} <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> likely {{interacting with}} people similar to themselves.|$|R

50|$|This is {{essentially}} a tile placement game. There are 100 tiles which represent the <b>customers.</b> There <b>are</b> four men and four women from 12 countries. Clever readers would have deduced that 12 countries by 8 <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> 96 tiles - the last four <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> jokers, or wild.

5000|$|<b>Customers</b> <b>were</b> sent prepaid courier {{envelopes}} {{and instructed}} to send back their Mifi units for {{replacement of the}} battery and battery compartment cover. [...] <b>Customers</b> <b>were</b> notified that Novatel would return the serviced units within 6 to 8 weeks of their return. Bell <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> provided with cellular internet access via Novatel U998 USB sticks, which were provided as temporary replacements by Bell.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, attracting new <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> {{more expensive}} than retaining the existing customers. Therefore, companies should {{have a plan to}} retain their existing <b>customers.</b> <b>Customers,</b> who <b>are</b> placed in high attractive cell, are more important for the company. Retention of high attractive <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> significantly important.|$|R

25|$|The MPI HSP46 is a four-axle AC-traction {{diesel-electric}} locomotive for commuter trains, designed and assembled by MotivePower. It meets EPA Tier 3 emissions standards. The launch <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), whose first unit entered revenue service in April 2014.|$|E
25|$|Payday lenders do {{not compare}} their {{interest}} rates to those of mainstream lenders. Instead, they compare their fees to the overdraft, late payment, penalty fees and other fees that will be incurred if the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> unable to secure any credit whatsoever.|$|E
50|$|Wind gusts to 83 mph were {{recorded}} on outer Cape Cod and Buzzards Bay. Over 385,000 <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> without power {{as of the}} afternoon of October 29, and flooding of roadways and buildings was reported. As of 2 p.m. November 1, about 12,000 <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> still without power in the state. As of the morning of November 2, 7,200 <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> still without power, down from 400,000.|$|R
30|$|With {{respect to}} the effect of the antecedents of {{customer}} loyalty (e.g., image and customer satisfaction), the total effects of image on customer loyalty for satisfied and dissatisfied <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> 0.57 and 0.21. In other words, the customer loyalty of satisfied <b>customers</b> <b>was</b> affected more by customer satisfaction. <b>Customer</b> satisfaction <b>was</b> significantly related to the customer loyalty of both satisfied and dissatisfied customers, and satisfied <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> affected more by customer satisfaction (β =  0.63 vs. 0.14). Consequently, regarding customer loyalty, <b>customer</b> satisfaction <b>is</b> more important than image for both satisfied and dissatisfied customers. Numerous studies have shown that <b>customer</b> satisfaction <b>is</b> a crucial factor for ensuring customer loyalty (Barsky 1992; Smith and Bolton 1998; Hallowell 1996; Grønholdt et al. 2000). This study empirically supports the notion that <b>customer</b> satisfaction <b>is</b> positively related to customer loyalty.|$|R

25|$|In 2008, {{the phrase}} was revived by McDonald's Malaysia. The revival {{includes}} the original prize {{of a free}} Big Mac if the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> able to recite the phrase in under four seconds. This was released in May, along with the promotional Mega Mac, which has four beef patties rather than the standard two.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> {{purchasing}} PAYG, the top-up {{will be at}} {{the gates}} of their nominated station, or Tramlink stop the next day (ready for first train, provided they made the purchase before 11PM the previous night). It will remain at the gates for 7 further days before dropping off the system.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{customer}} attrition is bad. For many firms, it {{is useful}} and desirable that unprofitable customers should churn away. This is known as customer divestment of unprofitable customers. However, simply because a <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> unprofitable {{does not mean that}} the customer should be divested, because there are strategic reasons for retaining unprofitable customers.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, {{the company}} {{investigated}} the advertising claim by SAP that its <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> 32% more profitable {{than their peers}} and published a report finding <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> actually 20% less profitable 6, generating industry response 7 8.|$|R
5000|$|Simply stated, {{these are}} the {{requirements}} that the <b>customers</b> expect and <b>are</b> taken for granted. When done well, <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> just neutral, but when done poorly, <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> very dissatisfied. Kano originally called these “Must-be’s” {{because they are the}} requirements that must be included and are the price of entry into a market.|$|R
30|$|The first factor, {{geographical}} {{spread of}} the <b>customers,</b> <b>is</b> statistically significant. For clustered customers, the total costs increase with 11 % on average when allowing customers to select a delivery time window. The percentage of total costs increase is calculated by dividing the additional costs of allowing customers to choose a delivery time window by the total costs of the basic scenario. For randomly spread customers, the total costs increase with 24 % on average. When <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> clustered the increase in costs is less than when <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> randomly spread because when <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> spread more randomly probably more distance is needed to travel to another customer with a close delivery time window.|$|R
25|$|For card {{not present}} {{transactions}} where the card is not shown (e.g., e-commerce, mail order, and telephone sales), merchants additionally {{verify that the}} <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> in physical possession of the card and is the authorized user by asking for additional information such as the security code printed {{on the back of}} the card, date of expiry, and billing address.|$|E
25|$|The {{floor area}} {{is open for}} general admission. A <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> free to wander around the club, except for {{employee}} areas and premium lounges. To access premium lounges (sometimes called VIP, champagne, other lounges), a customer would normally be charged a fee above the cover charge. In some cases, the employee and premium lounges are dual use. For example, a manager's office might also double as the VIP room.|$|E
25|$|Example of {{throttling}} {{in action}} (based on May 2009 scheme): Customer has an L (10 Mbit/s) package, {{which has a}} 3GB threshold during 10am-3pm and a 1.5 GB threshold between 4pm-9pm with a 75% throttle for five hours. Customer downloads over 3GB on Tuesday morning between 10am-3pm. The <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> then throttled to 2.5 Mbit/s {{for the next five}} hours from the time that they exceed the threshold, after which normal service is resumed.|$|E
30|$|To {{take into}} account {{practical}} aspects, buffers of finite size for both two classes of <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> assumed in this paper. Furthermore, a proposed queue includes a congestion control mechanism. Once the number of low-priority customers in the system reaches the first control threshold, the arrival rate of low-priority <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> reduced to a guarantee arrival rate. If the number of low-priority <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> above the second control threshold, each arriving batch of low-priority <b>customers</b> will <b>be</b> discarded with a certain probability. Therefore, the proposed queue {{can be used to}} model Differentiated Service Architecture [14] in IP networks.|$|R

25|$|Banks, {{telephone}} service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates {{as one of}} their key business metrics (along with cash flow, EBITDA, etc.) because the cost of retaining an existing <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> far less than acquiring a new one. Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.|$|E
25|$|Older Japanese sockets and {{multi-plug}} adaptors are unpolarized—the {{slots in}} the sockets {{are the same}} size—and will accept only unpolarized plugs. Japanese plugs generally fit into most North American sockets without modification, but polarized North American plugs may require adaptors or replacement non-polarized plugs to connect to older Japanese sockets. In Japan the voltage is 100 V, and the frequency is either 50Hz (East Japan) or 60Hz (West Japan) {{depending on whether the}} <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> located on the Osaka or Tokyo grid. Therefore, some North American devices which can be physically plugged into Japanese sockets may not function properly.|$|E
25|$|The {{customer}} debits {{his or her}} savings/bank (asset) {{account in}} his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> overdrawn, {{he will have a}} negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.|$|E

40|$|The basic {{models of}} price {{dispersion}} due to Butters (1977) and Varian (1980), further developed by Narasimhan (1988), {{have been applied}} to {{a broad range of}} issues in industrial organization and marketing. Much of the previous research assumes that the captive and switcher segments are exogenously symmetric or asymmetric. We embed the Varian (1980) model in a broader setting that considers how captive/switcher <b>customer</b> segments <b>are</b> determined through <b>customer</b> acquisition. The <b>customer</b> segments <b>are</b> symmetric if sellers acquire customers simultaneously with setting prices. If <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> acquired before prices are set, then the equilibrium <b>customer</b> segments <b>are</b> asymmetric unless <b>customer</b> acquisitions <b>are</b> randomized and the marginal cost of customer acquisition increases at a sufficiently slow rate. If prices <b>are</b> set before <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> acquired, then the equilibrium <b>customer</b> segments <b>are</b> almost certainly asymmetric. With constant returns to scale, the <b>customer</b> segments <b>are</b> symmetric only if sellers acquire customers simultaneously with setting prices...|$|R
