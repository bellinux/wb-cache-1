5|$|The {{model was}} {{originally}} developed for programming decompression computers for constant oxygen partial pressure <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreathers.</b> Initial experimental diving using an exponential-exponential algorithm {{resulted in an}} unacceptable incidence of DCS, so a change was made to a model using the linear release model, with a reduction in DCS incidence.|$|E
5|$|These values can be {{used with}} {{standard}} open circuit decompression tables, but are not applicable with constant oxygen partial pressure as provided by <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreathers.</b> Tables are used with the sea level equivalent depth and stops are done at the altitude stop depth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreathers</b> {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. The effect {{is to keep the}} partial pressure of inert gases as low as safely practicable throughout the dive. This minimizes the absorption of inert gas in the first place, and accelerates the elimination of the inert gases during ascent.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-1990s}} a push {{into the central}} Yucatán Peninsula {{discovered}} {{a large number of}} deep sinkholes, or pit cenotes, such as Sabak Ha and Utzil, and deep caves such as Chacdzinikche, Dzibilchaltun and Kankirixche that have since been explored and mapped. These deep caves of the central Yucatán remain largely unexplored due to the number of cenotes in the State of Yucatán, and the depths, which require technical diving techniques or rebreathers.

25|$|In September 2003, an {{expedition}} led by Carl Spencer dived into the wreck. This {{was the first}} expedition to dive Britannic where all the bottom divers were using <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreathers</b> (CCR). Diver Rich Stevenson found that several watertight doors were open. It {{has been suggested that}} this was because the mine strike coincided with the change of watches. Alternatively, the explosion may have distorted the doorframes. A number of mine anchors were located off the wreck by sonar expert Bill Smith, confirming the German records of U-73 that Britannic was sunk by a single mine and the damage was compounded by open portholes and watertight doors. Spencer's expedition was broadcast extensively across the world for many years by National Geographic and the UK's Channel 5.|$|E

2500|$|Recreational diving is {{generally}} {{limited to the}} use of air or a single nitrox mixture with an oxygen partial pressure not exceeding [...] 40% for the planned dive, but this does not preclude constant oxygen partial pressure nitrox provided by electronically controlled <b>closed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>rebreathers</b> like the Poseidon Mk6 or variable nitrox mixtures such as provided by the earlier semi-closed circuit Dräger Ray rebreather.

In this case the actual breathing mixture varies with the depth, and is made up of a diluent blend mixed with oxygen. The diluent is usually a gas blend {{that can be used for}} bailout if necessary. Relatively small amounts of diluent are used in a rebreather, as the inert components are neither metabolised nor exhausted to the environment while the diver remains at depth, but are rebreathed repetitively, only being lost during ascent, when the gas expands in inverse proportion to the pressure, and must be vented to maintain the correct volume in the loop.|$|E

This endurance is independent of depth. The life of the soda lime scrubber is likely to be less than this and so will be the limiting factor of the dive.|$|R
