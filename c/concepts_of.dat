5|$|After protein {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} have been translated from nucleic acid chains, {{they can be}} edited by appropriate enzymes. Although this {{is a form of}} protein affecting protein sequence, not explicitly covered by the central dogma, there are not many clear examples where the associated <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> the two fields {{have much to do with}} each other.|$|E
30|$|Notice {{that the}} <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> α-{{completeness}} of metric spaces is weaker than the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> completeness and the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> an α-continuous multivalued mapping is weaker than the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> continuity in metric spaces.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} about Edmond Dantes' changing <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice. I {{apply the}} <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> retributive justice to explain Edmond Dantes' early <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice and restorative justice {{to explain his}} latter <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice. I see that Edmond Dantes changes his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice, from retributive justice to restorative justice. The main reason why Edmond Dantes applies his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> retributive is {{the pain and suffering}} which he gets from his enemies. Edmond Dantes applies the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice to make an equal pain and suffering. However, after he executes his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> retributive justice, Edmond Dantes has a state of fear and emptiness. These fear and emptiness then make Edmond Dantes change his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> retributive justice to restorative justice. Edmond Dantes applies the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> restorative justice as a payment for the troubles created by his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> retributive justice. I apply the theory of utilitarianism to explain why Edmond Dantes changes his early <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice to his latter <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice. As the conclusion, {{there are lots of things}} that can be learned especially about justice. Edmond Dantes' case shows that retributive justice is not a perfect <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> justice because it will create another trouble. On one hand, restorative justice can give the solution to the problem...|$|R
5|$|Constantin Amăriuţei {{was noted}} for {{defining}} Mitică's character (Miticism) through onthologic terms {{borrowed from the}} German philosopher Martin Heidegger. He thus argued that, for all their mundane motivations, the character and his peers illustrated a search present with all individuals, identifiable with Heidegger's <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> Being-in-the-World and Being-toward-death (see Heideggerian terminology).|$|E

5|$|Even in finite dimensions, the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> {{functional}} analysis have illuminated economic theory, particularly in clarifying {{the role of}} prices as normal vectors to a hyperplane supporting a convex set, representing production or consumption possibilities. However, problems of describing optimization over time or under uncertainty {{require the use of}} infinite–dimensional function spaces, because agents are choosing among functions or stochastic processes.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we define}} the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> {{conditional}} acceptability {{by combining the}} <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> conditioning on a σ-algebra and the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> acceptability. In particular, conditioning is combined with the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> wide acceptability. We therefore give the following definition.|$|R

5|$|From December 1851 to March 1852, Marx wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, a {{work on the}} French Revolution of 1848 {{in which}} he {{expanded}} upon his <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> historical materialism, class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, advancing the argument that victorious proletariat has to smash the bourgeois state.|$|E

5|$|Sir Isaac Newton {{described}} {{the motion of}} all objects using the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> inertia and force, {{and in doing so}} he found they obey certain conservation laws. In 1687, Newton published his thesis Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica. In this work Newton set out three laws of motion that to this day are the way forces are described in physics.|$|E
50|$|The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Young {{measure is}} named after him: he also {{introduced}} the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the generalized curve and a <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> generalized surface which later evolved in the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> varifold.

5|$|Taoism {{tends to}} {{emphasize}} various {{themes of the}} I Ching, the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi, such as naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, detachment from desires, and most important of all, wu wei.

5|$|The Devi Upanishad (Sanskrit:देवी उपनिषत्), {{is one of}} {{the minor}} Upanishads of Hinduism and a text {{composed}} in Sanskrit. It {{is one of the}} 19 Upanishads attached to the Atharvaveda, and is classified as one of the eight Shakta Upanishads. It is, as an Upanishad, a part of the corpus of Vedanta literature collection that present the philosophical <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|The book {{introduced}} the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> disruptive coloration {{to break up}} an object's outlines, of masquerade, as when a butterfly mimics a leaf, and especially of countershading, where an animal's tones make it appear flat by concealing its self-shadowing.|$|E
30|$|Sung et al. [14] {{generalized}} {{the notion}} of h-integrability and introduced the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> h-integrability with exponent r. They also proved that the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> h-integrability with exponent r is strictly weaker than the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Cesàro-type uniformly integral with exponent r. The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> h-integrability with exponent r is as follows.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> [...] "existence precedes essence", a key {{foundational}} <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> existentialism, {{can also}} be found in the works of Averroes, as a reaction to Avicenna's <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> [...] "essence precedes existence".|$|R
5|$|The <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> {{angle and}} radius were already used by ancient {{peoples of the}} first {{millennium}} BC. The Greek astronomer and astrologer Hipparchus (190–120 BC) created a table of chord functions giving {{the length of the}} chord for each angle, and there are references to his using polar coordinates in establishing stellar positions.|$|E
5|$|The founder {{developed}} {{many of the}} empty-handed techniques {{from traditional}} sword and spear movements. Consequently, {{the practice of the}} weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> distance, timing, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's training partner(s).|$|E
5|$|The section {{summarizes}} the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> population genetics, {{a branch of}} evolutionary theory combining Mendelian genetics and natural selection in mathematical form to explain the pressures on animal societies. In particular, altruism, self-sacrificing behaviour, would die out unless something such as kin or group selection maintains it.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> fuzzy-generalized closed set and study its properties. Secondly the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> infra L-fuzzy topological space is introduced.

5|$|Gandhi's London {{lifestyle}} {{incorporated the}} values {{he has grown}} up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial {{and he could not}} make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> his mature philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the first}} form of graph duality to be {{recognized}} was the association of the Platonic solids into pairs of dual polyhedra. Graph duality is a topological generalization of the geometric <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> dual polyhedra and dual tessellations, and is in turn generalized algebraically by {{the concept of a}} dual matroid. Variations of planar graph duality include a version of duality for directed graphs, and duality for graphs embedded onto non-planar two-dimensional surfaces.|$|E
