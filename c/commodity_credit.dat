25|$|During {{his tenure}} at the RFC, Reed {{influenced}} two major national policies. First, Reed was instrumental in setting up the <b>Commodity</b> <b>Credit</b> Corporation. In early October 1933, President Roosevelt ordered RFC president Jesse Jones to establish a program to strengthen cotton prices. On October 16, 1933, Jones met with Reed and together they created the <b>Commodity</b> <b>Credit</b> Corporation (CCC). President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6340 the next day, which legally established the CCC. The brilliance of the CCC was {{that the government would}} hold surplus cotton as security for the loan. If cotton prices rose above the value of the loan, farmers could redeem their cotton, pay off the loan and make a profit. If prices stayed low, the farmer still had enough money to live as well as plant next year. The plan worked so well that it became the basis for the New Deal's entire agricultural program.|$|E

40|$|The {{present day}} realities facing New York dairy farmers and all dairy farmers {{is an example}} of when {{business}} risk become so severe that the residual impact on financial risk become acute. While financial risk is ever present, stress results only when conditions arise in which downside risk result in a return on assets insufficient to meet fixed financial obligations. Thus, it is proposed in this paper the use of <b>commodity</b> linked <b>credit</b> to balance financial and business risks faced by New York dairy farmers. In this paper, <b>commodity</b> linked <b>credit</b> refers to a suite of financial products in the form of operating loan and mortgage with payoff schedules tied to the price of class III milk futures price. To apply <b>commodity</b> linked <b>credit,</b> a represent farm financial statement is established and modified. Monte Carlo simulation is then used to analysis the effect of <b>commodity</b> linked <b>credit.</b> By comparing return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and other financial parameters before and after implementing commodity linked operating loan and mortgage, conclusion is reached that <b>commodity</b> linked <b>credit</b> is a proven method to hedge business risk and financial risk...|$|R

The supply of agricultural services in the first two post-war decades was dominated by such intervention, and in the next two decades by attempts by the state to reduce its intervention in the market, a process which was not completed by 1990.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{framework}} for modeling stochastic local volatility, with potential applications to modeling derivatives on interest rates, <b>commodities,</b> <b>credit,</b> equity, FX etc., {{as well as}} hybrid derivatives. Our model extends the linearity-generating unspanned volatility term structure model by Carr et al. (2011) by adding a local volatility layer to it. We outline efficient numerical schemes for pricing derivatives in this framework for a particular four-factor specification (two "curve" factors plus two "volatility" factors). We show that the dynamics of such a system can be approximated by a Markov chain on a two-dimensional space (Z_t,Y_t), where coordinates Z_t and Y_t are given by direct (Kroneker) products of values of pairs of curve and volatility factors, respectively. The resulting Markov chain dynamics on such partly "folded" state space enables fast pricing by the standard backward induction. Using a nonparametric specification of the Markov chain generator, one can accurately match arbitrary sets of vanilla option quotes with different strikes and maturities. Furthermore, we consider an alternative formulation of the model {{in terms of an}} implied time change process. The latter is specified nonparametrically, again enabling accurate calibration to arbitrary sets of vanilla option quotes. Comment: Sections 3. 2 and 3. 3 are re-written, 3 figures adde...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture sector {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the economic development of Pakistan. Wheat is an important and most cultivated crop because it is an essential ingredient of food <b>commodities.</b> <b>Credit</b> plays a vital role in agricultural farming by indirectly participating in purchasing of agricultural inputs i. e. seed, fertilizer, irrigation, machinery and labor etc. Majority of the farmers are poor and they are not able to fulfill the cash requirement of farming, therefore credit has become their dire need. Due to credit farmers can timely purchase the agricultural inputs which resulting a bumper crop. The objective of this study is to depict the impact of credit on the production of wheat crop. Survey was conducted and random sampling technique was used to select the sample borrowers. The collected data was interpreted through “Cobb Douglas Production Function” by using statistical software (SPSS 16. 0). The results showed that credit has positive and significant impact on wheat production. The values of R 2 and F-statistics are found significant which represented that all selected variables are highly significant.
