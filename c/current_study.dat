25|$|The Great Red Spot {{may have}} existed since before 1665, but the present spot was first seen only after 1830 and well-studied {{only after a}} {{prominent}} apparition in 1879. A long gap separates its period of <b>current</b> <b>study</b> after 1830 from its seventeenth-century discovery; whether the original spot dissipated and reformed, whether it faded, or even if the observational record was simply poor, are all unknown.|$|E
25|$|Dengue {{virus is}} {{transmitted}} by the mosquito species Aedes aegypti. Aedes aegypti produce saliva that contains {{over one hundred}} unique proteins, including the protein family D7. Scientists use {{to believe that the}} Aedes aegypti saliva, when being transmitted, actually enhanced the dengue virus in the body. It was said that the mosquito’s spit could make the virus spread faster due to the weakened immune response of its host. However, a <b>current</b> <b>study</b> has found that the protein D7 hinders the virus transmission into the host cells.|$|E

25|$|Children {{of smoking}} parents {{are more likely}} to smoke than {{children}} with non-smoking parents. Children of parents who smoke are less likely to quit smoking. One study found that parental smoking cessation was associated with less adolescent smoking, except when the other parent currently smoked. A <b>current</b> <b>study</b> tested the relation of adolescent smoking to rules regulating where adults are allowed to smoke in the home. Results showed that restrictive home smoking policies were associated with lower likelihood of trying smoking for both middle and high school students.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effect of}} {{pregnancy}} on prospective memory {{is still under}} <b>current</b> <b>study.</b> Rendell et al. (2008) tested the prospective memory of 20 pregnant women in the laboratory. There {{were no significant differences}} observed between pregnant and non-pregnant women for event-based prospective memory tasks, but there were clear hindrances in performance for pregnant women in time-based prospective memory tasks such as a job deadline. Pregnant women [...] are more likely to remember to perform an intention after the cue has already passed. Further, women tested a few months after giving birth were found to forget intentions entirely. Both these findings may be related to stress encountered during pregnancy or child rearing and lack of sleep.|$|E
