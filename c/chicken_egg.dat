In {{order to}} detect fertilized <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs</b> nondestructively to improve {{hatching}} rate, this paper uses {{the method of}} image processing and optimizing BP neural network by particle swarm to identify fertilized <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs.</b> Firstly, we use image collection device to collect images of the unfertilized and fertilized <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs,</b> to extract the feature of egg image, and then determine the input and output vector, while optimized neural network by particle swarm is 5 dimensional input and 1 dimensional outputs. Finally, we use particle swarm algorithm to optimize the weights and threshold of neural network, {{which can be used}} to predict the condition of fertilization. The experiment shows that, compared with the traditional BP neural network, it is more accurate to recognize the fertilized <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs</b> when using optimized BP neural network by particle swarm. The rate can reach 98. 21 %, which meets the requirements of recognizing fertilized <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs...</b>|$|R

Biosecure farms which implement the program of Clean and Healthy Market Chain (CMC) developed in the ACIAR project, which resulted in good quality <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs,</b> healthy and good for consumption. The farms which obtain a certificate of Indonesian Poultry Biosecurity Center (PBUI) will have the logo of biosecure. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine (1) the logistics management of <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs</b> from the biosecure farms to the consumers (2) the perceptions of stakeholders on the price and quality of eggs from biosecure farms. The method used was descriptive and qualitative analysis to determine the planning, budgeting, procurement, storage, control and distribution. The results showed that (1) logistics management on biosecure farms of <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs</b> commodity can be performed well. It can be seen from the results of weekly livestock production which provides a supply of eggs for PT Mitra Sinar Jaya of 42 % and UD Limas Merta Mandiri of 58 %. Both agencies will distribute back to the institutional consumer markets (supermarkets and hotels) and a small portion to the traditional markets, (2) the perception of stakeholders on the commodity of <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs</b> from biosecure farms can be categorized as very good with a score of 85. 33 %. Suggestions which can be given are (1) the logistics management of biosecure farms can expand the distribution channels of healthy <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs</b> for the benefit of consumers, (2) stakeholders of PT MSJ are expected to put biosecure labeling on the packaging, with the aim of attracting consumers in terms of quality. As for UD LMM, it is expected to develop the business of <b>chicken</b> <b>eggs</b> produced by biosecure farms to expand its distribution network.

2500|$|Engineers {{often use}} dyes in water or smoke in air {{in order to}} see streaklines, from which pathlines can be calculated. Streaklines are {{identical}} to streamlines for steady flow. Further, dye can be used to create timelines. The patterns guide their design modifications, aiming to reduce the drag. This task is known as streamlining, and the resulting design is referred to as being streamlined. Streamlined objects and organisms, like steam locomotives, streamliners, cars and dolphins are often aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The Streamline Moderne style, an 1930s and 1940s offshoot of Art Deco, brought flowing lines to architecture and design of the era. [...] The canonical example of a streamlined shape is a <b>chicken</b> <b>egg</b> with the blunt end facing forwards. [...] This shows clearly that the curvature of the front surface can be much steeper than the back of the object. [...] Most drag is caused by eddies in the fluid behind the moving object, and the objective should be to allow the fluid to slow down after passing around the object, and regain pressure, without forming eddies.|$|E
