40|$|Introduction: This paper {{describes}} a carbon dioxide (CO 2) waveform simulator designed {{to evaluate and}} test the performance of <b>capnographs,</b> which are clinically used respiratory gas analyzers that continuously measure CO 2. Currently, <b>capnographs</b> are tested for minimum performance standards according to guidelines specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). However, <b>capnographs</b> that meet these guidelines are not guaranteed to perform to a high caliber in a dynamic clinical environment. Methods: We designed a simulator that overcomes the limitations of current testing protocols by reproducing real-­‐time capnography waveforms (called capnograms) recorded in clinical settings. At each time point in the capnogram, the desired CO 2 partial pressure (mmHg) is simulated by controlling a proportional solenoid valve to mix various flow rates of CO 2 into a constant flow of oxygen (O 2). Results: The simulator was tested using five different capnography waveforms. Four out of five files had mean squared errors (MSE) under 5 mmHg. All five files had R 2 values greater than. 97. Conclusion: After further research and optimization, this device {{has the potential to}} standardize and improve the testing methods used for <b>capnographs...</b>|$|R

30|$|Second, during {{spontaneous}} breathing, {{measurement of}} ET-CO 2 by direct or lateral capnography {{is limited by}} the inevitable air leak from the system, and the technique has low sensitivity to detect hypoventilation in sedated patients [26]. However, in patients who are not under the effects of sedation, direct or lateral <b>capnographs</b> coupled to nasal cannula have good diagnostic performance [27 – 29], which may even be comparable with capnography in patients on mechanical ventilation [30].|$|R
5000|$|<b>Capnographs</b> usually {{work on the}} {{principle}} that [...] absorbs infrared radiation. A beam of infrared light is passed across the gas sample to fall on a sensor. The presence of [...] in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor, which changes the voltage in a circuit. The analysis is rapid and accurate, but the presence of nitrous oxide in the gas mix changes the infrared absorption via the phenomenon of collision broadening. This must be corrected for measuring the [...] in human breath by measuring its infrared absorptive power. This was established as a reliable technique by John Tyndall in 1864, though 19th and early 20th century devices were too cumbersome for everyday clinical use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background For {{healthcare}} providers in the prehospital setting, bag-valve mask (BVM) ventilation {{could be as}} efficacious and safe as endotracheal intubation. To facilitate the evaluation of efficacious ventilation, <b>capnographs</b> have been further developed into small and convenient devices able to provide end- tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether a new portable device (EMMA™) attached to a ventilation mask would provide ETCO 2 values accurate enough to confirm proper BVM ventilation. Methods A prospective observational trial was conducted in a single level- 2 centre. Twenty-two patients under general anaesthesia were manually ventilated. ETCO 2 was measured every five minutes with the study device and venous PCO 2 (PvCO 2) was simultaneously measured for comparison. Bland- Altman plots were used to compare ETCO 2, and PvCO 2. Results The patients were all hemodynamically and respiratory stable during anaesthesia. End-tidal carbon dioxide values were corresponding to venous gases during BVM ventilation under optimal conditions. The bias, the mean of the differences between the two methods (device versus venous blood gases), for time points 1 - 4 ranges from - 1. 37 to - 1. 62. Conclusion The portable device, EMMA™ is suitable for determining carbon dioxide in expired air (kPa) as compared to simultaneous samples of PvCO 2. It could therefore, be a supportive tool to asses the BVM ventilation in the demanding prehospital and emergency setting. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction In several studies, {{we found}} that during guided rhythmic speech exercises, a {{decrease}} in cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation occurred {{as the result of}} a decrease in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood (PaCO 2) during speaking. To further explore the effect of PaCO 2 variations on cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation, the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of spoken, inner and heard speech tasks on these parameters. Material and Methods Speech tasks included recitation or inner recitation or listening to hexameter, alliteration, prose, or performing mental arithmetic. The following physiological parameters were measured: tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2) and absolute concentrations of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin (over the left and right anterior prefrontal cortex, using an ISS OxiplexTS frequency domain near-infrared spectrometer) and end-tidal CO 2 (PETCO 2; using Nellcor N 1000 and Datex NORMOCAP <b>capnographs).</b> Statistical analysis was applied to the differences between baseline, 2 tasks, and 3 post-baseline periods. Data of 3 studies with 24, 7 and 29 healthy subjects, respectively, were combined, and linear regression analyses were calculated. Results Linear regression analyses revealed significant relations between changes in oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin or StO 2 and the participants’ age, the baseline PETCO 2 or certain speech tasks. While hexameter verses affected changes during the tasks, alliteration verses only affected changes during the recovery phase. Discussion and Conclusion The observed effects in hemodynamics and oxygenation indicate a combination of neurovascular coupling (increased neuronal activity leading to an increase in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen resulting in an increase in cerebral flood flow/volume) and CO 2 reactivity (increased breathing during speech tasks causing a decrease in PaCO 2 leading to vasoconstriction and decrease in cerebral blood flow). The neurovascular coupling characteristics are task-dependent. References Scholkmann F, Gerber U, Wolf M, Wolf U.

Study design  Prospective clinical study. Animals  Twenty client-owned dogs, ASA I and II undergoing anaesthesia for clinical purposes. Methods  Following pre-medication, induction of anaesthesia, and intubation of the trachea, intermittent positive pressure ventilation was commenced. Mixed expired CO 2 partial pressure (PēCO 2) was measured by two methods: method MC by analysis, using an infrared <b>capnograph,</b> of the expired gas collected in a mixing box and method SBT which calculated it automatically by a device consisting of a mainstream <b>capnograph</b> and a pneumotachograph. At four time points arterial partial pressure of CO 2 (PaCO 2) was measured. Physiologic dead space variables (VD and VD/VT) were calculated manually (method MC) or automatically (method SBT) using the Bohr–Enghoff equation. Method MC and SBT were compared using Bland–Altman plots and linear regression. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) {{was used to measure}} consistency of each method. Results  Four measurement pairs were obtained in all 20 dogs for method SBT and MC. The bias was − 1. 15 mmHg, 7. 97 mL and 0. 02 for PēCO 2, VD and VD/VT, respectively. Linear regression analysis revealed a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0. 79, 0. 94, and 0. 83 for PēCO 2, VD and VD/VT, respectively. The ICC revealed an excellent consistency for both methods.

We report {{the case of a}} 76 -year-old man with a massive pulmonary embolism, who required early intubation and mechanical ventilation. Thrombolysis with rtpA (total dosage: 60 mg) was initiated. During this procedure, clinical data, arterial blood gases and end-tidal CO, with a <b>capnograph</b> were recorded. Before thrombolysis the P(a-ET) CO 2 gradient was raised to 25 mmHg. During thrombolysis, the clinical data improved and the P(a-ET) gradient fell to 14 mmHg. We postulate that the P(a-ET) CO 2 gradient seems to be a reasonable indicator of efficacy of thrombolysis in this setting. However. the gradient did not return to normal values(45 mmHg). The possible reasons for this may be that during mechanical ventilation there was a large ventilation- perfusion ratio and the cardiac output may have still reduced. With these limitations, we conclude that the P(a-ET) CO 2 gradient should be evaluated as an indicator of pulmonary reperfusion in massive pulmonary embolism. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

During each imagery trial, end-tidal PCO 2 (Handheld <b>Capnograph,</b> Oridion) was measured. After each trial, patients filled out a symptom checklist. Results showed low resting values of PetCO 2 overall, while only imagery of hostile resistance triggered a decrease and deficient recovery of PetCO 2.

40|$|Complications {{that are}} {{associated}} with surgery and hospitalization cannot be entirely ruled out. To prevent patients from experiencing addi­tional harm, it is essential that complications during hospitalization are recognized and treated adequately. A patient’s respiratory sta­tus can provide us with valuable information about the presence and progression of these complications. Unfortunately, respiratory assessment is still infrequently performed and technical solutions for (continuous) respiratory monitoring are generally not available outside high care facilities. This thesis aims to provide a strong basis for future development of continuous monitoring strategies outside high care facilities. The implementation of a system for continuous respiratory monitoring in order to im­prove patient outcomes is a ‘complex intervention’. That is illustrated by our systematic review as incomplete and suboptimal implementation of one of the components of the monitoring strategy jeopardizes the success of the complete monitoring strategy. The first of those components is the sensor technology. It is essential for success to de­velop sensor technologies that are explicitly suitable for the low care clinical setting. The frequency-modulated continuous wave radar that monitors respiratory rate would fit the low care requirements, as it operates in a non-invasive wireless, and contactless mode. However, a monitoring strategy is more than just the sensor technology. The success of a moni­toring strategy depends on several other components, including signal analysis, alarm strate­gy, as well as the diagnostic and treatment algorithms used. Illustrated by the clinical evaluations of the radar and <b>capnograph</b> sensor technology in this thesis. The radar prototype signal analysis was not sophisticated enough to recognize voluntary movement, that resulted in artifacts and limited the diagnostic accuracy. The additive value of monitoring with a <b>capnograph</b> during procedural sedation depends on the therapeutic interventions and choices that interact with the monitoring strategy. In this example, something elementary as the administration of supplemental oxygen makes the difference. Successful development of continuous respiratory monitoring strategies for use outside high care facilities also depends on the methodology that is used to study them. We compared three statistical methods to derive limits of agreement in method comparison studies in a simulation study and found that it does indeed matter which statistical method is used to determine the accuracy of monitoring devices. Furthermore, we studied the association between the duration of vital instability before intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and mortality. Our findings suggest that ICU admission should be cautiously used as surrogate endpoint in studies evaluating a monitoring strategy to detect deteriorating patients. Based on the find­ings of our clinical studies and systematic review implementation of routine continuous non-in­vasive respiratory monitoring on general hospital wards cannot yet be advocated, however the monitoring strategy should be intensified, and this thesis reveals that technical monitoring solutions are getting closer...|$|E

Although fentanyl (1 – 3  µg kg− 1) and etomidate (0.3  mg kg− 1) were the preferred pre-treatment and induction agents, the operators selected the sedatives and dosages after considering each patient’s condition. A sedative was administered 2  min after pre-treatment agent injection, and tracheal intubation was performed 20 – 30  s later. The operators chose either a curved Macintosh laryngoscope with metal reusable blade or a GlideScope video laryngoscope (Verathon, Bothell, WA, USA) as the initial device. Tracheal intubation was supervised by an experienced operator when performed by an inexperienced operator. If the second intubation attempt was unsuccessful, the experienced operator performed the third attempt. However, for the patient safety, supervisors tended to intubate directly if the patient was expected to have difficult airway or hemodynamically unstable. It is presumed that relatively less severe patients were intubated by inexperienced operators and with direct laryngoscopy for the training purpose. Correct tracheal tube placement was assessed using careful auscultation, end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement, and chest radiography. The end-tidal carbon dioxide level was measured using an EMMA Emergency <b>Capnograph</b> (Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA). After each tracheal intubation, intubation-related information was recorded on a data collection sheet by MET nurses, and all tracheal intubations were reviewed in regular weekly meetings.|$|E
