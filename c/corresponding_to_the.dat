5|$|Therefore, Apollonius' {{problem can}} be re-stated in Lie {{geometry}} as a problem of finding perpendicular vectors on the Lie quadric; specifically, {{the goal is to}} identify solution vectors Xsol that belong to the Lie quadric and are also orthogonal (perpendicular) to the vectors X1, X2 and X3 <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> given circles.|$|E

5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the dual}} graph {{depends on a}} {{particular}} embedding, the dual graph of a planar graph is not unique {{in the sense that}} the same planar graph can have non-isomorphic dual graphs.

The upper red dual has a vertex with degree 6 (<b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outer face of the blue graph) while in the lower red graph all degrees are less than 6.|$|E
5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E

50|$|Categorical constructions {{lead to some}} examples. For example, the {{coproduct}} is the disjoint {{union and}} thus <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> direct sum of algebras, which {{is the product of}} C*-algebras. Similarly, Product topology <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coproduct of C*-algebras, the tensor product of algebras. In a more specialized setting,compactifications of topologies <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> unitizations of algebras.

5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, <b>corresponding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E
