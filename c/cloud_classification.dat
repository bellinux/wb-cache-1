Non-ground points are then divided into clusters based on height and local neighborhood.

40|$|Abstract—The {{early and}} {{accurate}} segmentation of low clouds during the night-time {{is an important}} task for nowcasting. It requires that observations can be acquired at a sufficient time rate as provided by the geostationary METEOSAT satellite over Europe. However, the information supplied by the single infrared METEOSAT channel available by night {{is not sufficient to}} discriminate between low clouds and ground during night from a single image. To tackle this issue, we consider several sources of information extracted from an infrared image sequence. Indeed, we exploit both relevant local motion-based measurements, intensity images and thermal parameters estimated over blocks, along with local contextual information. A statistical contextual labeling process in two classes, involving “low clouds ” and “clear sky, ” is performed on the warmer pixels. It is formulated within a Bayesian estimation framework associated with Markov random field (MRF) models. This comes to minimize a global energy function comprising three terms: two data-driven terms (thermal and motion-based ones) and a regularization term expressing a priori knowledge on the label field (expected spatial contextual properties). We propose a progressive minimization procedure of this energy function starting from initial reliably labeled pixels and involving only local computation. Thermal parameters associated to each class are estimated according to an unsupervised learning scheme enabling the handling of spatiotemporal nonstationarities. Our method produces segmentation maps displaying temporal coherency along the image sequence. Experimental results on representative meteorological situations are reported and favorably compared with NOAA/AVHRR <b>cloud</b> <b>classifications</b> which serve as reference results. They demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between convective penetration depth and tropospheric humidity {{is central to}} recent theories of the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO). It {{has been suggested that}} general circulation models (GCMs) poorly simulate the MJO because they fail to gradually moisten the troposphere by shallow convection and simulate a slow transition to deep convection. CloudSat and Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) data are analyzed to document the variability of convection depth and its relation to water vapor during the MJO transition from shallow to deep convection and to constrain GCM cumulus parameterizations. Composites of cloud occurrence for 10 MJO events show the following anticipated MJO cloud structure: shallow and congestus clouds in advance of the peak, deep clouds near the peak, and upper-level anvils after the peak. Cirrus clouds are also frequent in advance of the peak. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (EOS) (AMSR-E) column water vapor (CWV) increases by ~ 5 mm during the shallow–deep transition phase, consistent with the idea of moisture preconditioning. Echo-top height of clouds rooted in the boundary layer increases sharply with CWV, with large variability in depth when CWV is between ~ 46 and 68 mm. International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project <b>cloud</b> <b>classifications</b> reproduce these climatological relationships but correctly identify congestus-dominated scenes only about half the time. A version of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E 2 (GISS-E 2) GCM with strengthened entrainment and rain evaporation that produces MJO-like variability also reproduces the shallow–deep convection transition, including the large variability of cloud-top height at intermediate CWV values. The variability is due to small grid-scale relative humidity and lapse rate anomalies for similar values of CWV...|$|R

This algorithm has been adapted by SAFNWC to the spectral characteristics and field of view of each satellite. Retrieved cloud cover characteristics (<b>cloud</b> mask, <b>classification</b> and top pressure) are evaluated over four months in summer of 2009 against CALIOP lidar observations from the CALIPSO polar-orbiting satellite. To better identify atmospheric and instrumental issues, separate analyses are performed over land and ocean, for 0130 AM and 0130 PM CALIPSO overpasses and for each GEO. Both mean cloud cover occurrence and instantaneous cloud cover statistics are compared. We found that each classification has specific features, which depend on observed cloud regimes and instrument capabilities. Most important, a common behaviour of the GEOs against CALIOP depending on cloud types is observed. We found that GEO cloud occurrence is lower by about 10 % than CALIOP, with the largest biases over land during daytime and the smallest over ocean during daytime. Further detailed analysis reveals specific discrepancies in the retrieved cloud types. As expected, high-level clouds are detected more frequently by the lidar. We show that, over ocean when the optical thickness of detected high-level clouds is limited to greater than 0. 1 in the comparisons, multi-spectral radiometry performs very similarly. However, the most significant difference is attributed to non-detection of low-level clouds that are often broken, which causes a reduction of up to 20 % in low-level cloud fraction and even 30 % in some regions. Other significant differences are seen over land, where mid-level clouds are not detected or are misclassified...|$|R

This study uses geostationary satellite imagery from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) to estimate UTH using water vapour channel radiances. Deep convection over Tropical Africa is detected using the difference between 6. 2 mm and 7. 3 mm brightness temperatures. The sensitivity of TOA brightness temperatures to cloud properties including cloud top height and optical depth are modelled using the Santa Barbara Disort Atmospheric Radiative Transfer model with thresholds developed using colocated matchups with CloudSat and CALIPSO <b>cloud</b> <b>classifications.</b> The most appropriate thresholds are determined using probability statistics and receiver operating characteristic curves. Deep convective clouds are tracked over their lifetime in June and December 2010 using a cloud tracking algorithm, based on an area overlap method. A general robust pattern in the UTH response emerges. A stronger response of UTH is found in the spatial domain than that over the temporal domain. UTH decreases with distance from the cloud edge, whilst a small increase is seen over the cloud lifetime. This was found to be controlled by cloud size and cloud lifetime, with larger and longer lived clouds causing a stronger perturbation in UTH. The UTH response was found to be stronger in June than in December.

For each cloud and aerosol types, layer-averaged backscatter and backscattering depolarization ratio from the CALIPSO measurements are discussed. The present results demonstrate the unique capabilities of the CALIPSO lidar instrument for determining cloud phase and aerosols subtypes. In the second part, we evaluate the MODIS IR cloud phase with the CALIPSO cloud products. The three possible misclassifications of MODIS IR cloud phasealgorithm, which are studied by Nasiri and Kahn (2008) with radiative transfer modeling, are tested by comparing between MODIS IR phase and CALIOP observations. The current results support their hypotheses, which is that the MODIS phase algorithm may tend to classify thin cirrus clouds as water clouds or mixed phase clouds or unknown, and classify midlevel and/or mid-temperature clouds as mixed or unknown phase. In the third part, we present a comparison of mineral dust aerosol retrievals from two instruments, MODIS and CALIPSO lidar. And, we implement and evaluate a new mineral dust detection algorithm based on the analysis of thin dust radiative signature. In comparison, three commonly used visible and IR mineral dust detection algorithms, including BTD procedure, D parameter method, and multi-channel image algorithm, are evaluated with CALIPSO aerosol classification.
