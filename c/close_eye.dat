5|$|Multiple escape {{attempts}} were made {{throughout the history of}} the prison camp, but the majority ended in failure. In one attempt, foursoldiers were recaptured by the Japanese. The guards forced all prisoners to watch as the foursoldiers were beaten, forced to dig their own graves and then executed. Shortly thereafter, the guards put up signs declaring that if other escape {{attempts were}} made, tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee. Prisoners' living quarters were then divided into groups of ten, which motivated the POWs to keep a <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on others to prevent them from making escape attempts.|$|E

5|$|Savige's {{sixth and}} last {{campaign}} {{of the war}} was free of controversy about his command. Once again, he had a talented regular officer as chief of staff, Brigadier Ragnar Garrett, with whom he had worked in Greece during 1941 and more recently in New Guinea. Moreover, as a corps commander, tactical details could be left to subordinates, although Savige still had to keep a <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on them to ensure that they did not take unnecessary risks or incur needless casualties. Savige continued to tour the front lines wearing his scarlet cap band and flying his car flag. He also maintained his concern for, and rapport with, the ordinary soldiers under his command. The final campaign on Bougainville cost 516Australian lives. Some 8,500Japanese were killed while 9,800died of other causes, leaving 23,571still alive when the war ended. On 8September 1945, Savige accepted their surrender at Torokina.|$|E
5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing out of the ordinary was published. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} changes of corneal {{topography}} and astigmatism et al with various duration of <b>closing</b> <b>eyes</b> and sleep; {{and study the}} impact of <b>closing</b> <b>eye</b> and sleep causing physiological hypoxia on corneal topography. METHODS: Sixteen volunteers were selected(32 eyes), 22 - 33 (26. 19 ± 3. 95) years old, without refractive errors and other eye diseases, as well as never wearing corneal contact lens, including 10 male eyes and 22 female eyes. The main parameters received corneal simulation K value, corneal astigmatism, corneal irregular measure(CIM) and the shape factor(SF) by Zeiss corneal topographer. They were measured before and after <b>closed</b> <b>eyes</b> 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 min; before sleep and after over 6 h sleep, they were detected immediately {{as soon as they}} opened eyes after 10, 20, 60, 120 min. RESULTS: During <b>closing</b> <b>eyes,</b> there were no statistical significance on the changes of corneal topography, corneal astigmatism, and SF. After opening eyes and over 6 h sleep, there were no statistical significance on the changes of corneal topography, corneal astigmatism, CIM, and SF. CONCLUSION: <b>Closing</b> <b>eyes</b> and sleep don't injure the cornea substantially, so corneal topography and corneal astigmatism don't mainly change...|$|R

5|$|Following the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State {{was set up}} as an {{independent}} British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces {{and members of the}} Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground. The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on them. Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil. On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL. Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England), at least six had never even been to Ireland before.|$|E
25|$|While {{not itself}} {{a part of}} the New Deal, the Roosevelt {{administration}} kept a <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on the challenge to the 1934 Railroad Retirement Act, Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co.. Its similarity with the Social Security Act meant the test of the railroad pension regime would serve as an indicator of whether Roosevelt's ambitious retirement program would be found constitutional. The railroad pension was designed to encourage older rail workers to retire, thereby creating jobs for younger railroaders desperately in need of work, although ostensibly Congress passed the act {{on the grounds that it}} would increase safety on the country's railways.|$|E
25|$|There {{was little}} {{improvement}} in 1964–65, with a finishing position of seventeenth. There was a mid-season period where the team went fifteen games without victory, including eight consecutive defeats, which equalled the club record set in 1898–99. Charnley {{returned to the}} top of the goalscoring charts, with 21 strikes, but already the bigger clubs were keeping a very <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on Alan Ball. Newcomers included Ian Moir and Jimmy Robson, but Roy Gratrix left the club after eleven years of service, and goalkeeper Gordon West joined Everton. Blackpool's debut on Match of the Day occurred with their visit to Craven Cottage to face Fulham on 21 November 1964. The match finished 3-3, with the visitors' Alan Ball netting a hat-trick.|$|E

25|$|The Vikings {{came into}} the game with great {{confidence}} internally but none by the wider league. They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E
25|$|The 2008–09 season {{preparations}} began {{much earlier}} than past seasons, with Perth Glory going on a three-game tour of China in March, consisting of matches against Changchun Yatai, Changsha Ginde and Guangzhou. The tour {{was used as an}} opportunity for the club to assess potential signings, including state league players Josip Magdić (Floreat Athena), Mark Lee, (footballer, now coach at Pro Football Training) (ECU Joondalup), Callum Roberts (Fremantle) and Marc Anthony (Stirling Lions). Eugene Dadi, whose mooted move to the Glory last season was stalled due to Hapoel Acre's refusal to release him, also made the trip. The Glory lost all three matches; the first match went to Changchun 3–0, the second match to Changsha 2–0 and Guangzhou won the final game 3–1. Callum Roberts scored the Glory's only goal on the tour. Perth Glory also made four new signings in their off-season. Eugene Dadi was granted release from his former club to sign for Perth Glory. Adriano Pellegrino and Adrian Trinidad joined the club in early May. Jimmy Downey also had his contract extended by a further year. Josip Magdić and Naum Sekulovski had also re-joined the Glory for season 2008/09. Stan Lazaridis is the most notable departure, having been told by the club he is no longer required after two seasons hampered by injury, suspension and poor form. In July 2008, Glory announced the signing of Brazilian international midfielder Amaral. The defensive midfielder has played with some of the great clubs around the globe including Brazilian giants Palmeiras and Corinthians, perennial Portuguese championship contenders Benfica and successful Italian Serie A outfits Parma and Fiorentina. He has also represented Brazil 31 times during a long and successful career before joining Perth on their pre-season tour of Indonesia. Glory had been keeping a <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on youngsters Scott Bulloch (Sorrento), Anthony Skorić (Western Knights) and Andrija Jukić (Perth SC) who were all up and coming players in the WA State league. Bulloch signed with the Glory's senior team in August, while Skorić and Jukić joined Glory's Youth Team. In September, Wayne Srhoj returned to Australia after five seasons in Romania, to sign with the Glory {{for the rest of the}} season. Perth finished the season in 7th place, with 22 points. Glory once again started the season poor, though they did however finish the second half of the season strongly, winning 4 matches and drawing 3, securing 15 points in the last 11 rounds since November. In November, Head Coach Dave Mitchell signed a contract extension securing his services till the end of the 2010/11 season. Mitchell's contract extension, despite Glory's slow start, showed the new direction Glory's club was heading, of vision, but built on stable foundations. Promising signs on and off the field were shown this season and things progressed further with Tony Sage taking sole ownership of the club at season's end.|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly ran most Mint {{operations}} under Scobey and his successor, Robert J. Grant. Although the Mint Bureau {{was very}} {{busy in the}} booming economy of the 1920s, numismatic historian Roger Burdette points out that there were flaws in operations—for example, Philadelphia Mint officials, instead of setting aside gold coins from each batch delivered for inspecting and testing by the annual Assay Commission, took all assay coins from a bag set aside {{at the start of}} the year, increasing the likelihood that nonstandard coins would go undetected. O'Reilly did keep a <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on coinage operations, warning the San Francisco Mint in November 1931 that it had produced fewer than 200,000 nickels, a figure that if allowed to stand would have resulted in the issue being hoarded by collectors. [...] She directed the mint to strike nothing but nickels for the remainder of the year, resulting in a total mintage for the 1931–S of 1,200,000, still the second-lowest by date and mint mark in the Buffalo nickel series.|$|E

Rousseau tortures him until he eventually convinces her {{that he is not}} one of the Others. She allows Sayid to return to his camp, and cautions him to keep a <b>close</b> <b>eye</b> on the other survivors. Over two weeks later, she comes across a delirious Claire (Emilie de Ravin), who had been left in the jungle after being kidnapped by the Others. Noticing that Claire's shouting is alerting the Others to her presence, Rousseau knocks her unconscious and carries her back to the other survivors. Rousseau makes her next appearance in [...] "Numbers", where she shoots at Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) and Hurley (Jorge Garcia), suspecting them of being Others. In the season one finale, set 43 days after the plane crash, Rousseau arrives on the beach and warns everyone that the Others are coming. After Claire gives birth to her son Aaron, Rousseau steals him and intends to swap him for her own child. When the Others do not come, Rousseau reluctantly returns him to Sayid. In season two, set two weeks later, Rousseau informs Sayid that she has caught one of the Others, who later turns out to be Ben. Later, Rousseau joins Claire and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) who are searching for medicine for Claire's baby, in one of the Others' work stations. Disappointed that she has not found any trace of Alex, she begins to leave them when Claire tells her that she believes Alex helped her escape when the Others captured her.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{employed}} the affective priming paradigm and measurements of event-related potentials to investigate implicit affective reactions elicited by gaze stimuli. Participants categorized {{positive and negative}} words primed by direct gaze, averted gaze, and <b>closed</b> <b>eyes.</b> The behavioural response time results indicated that direct gaze implicitly elicited more positive affective reactions than did <b>closed</b> <b>eyes.</b> Analyses of the ERP responses to the target words revealed a priming effect on the N 170 and an interaction on late positive potential (LPP) responses, and congruently with the behavioral results, suggested that, compared to <b>closed</b> <b>eyes,</b> direct gaze was affectively more congruent with positive words and more incongruent with negative words. The priming effect on the N 170 response indicated that gaze stimuli influenced the subsequent affective word processing {{at an early stage}} of information processing. In conclusion, the present behavioral and electrophysiological evidence suggests that direct gaze automatically activates more positive affective reactions than <b>closed</b> <b>eyes...</b>|$|R
