5|$|A {{drawing method}} found by Kazimierz Zarankiewicz has been conjectured {{to give the}} correct answer for every {{complete}} bipartite graph, and the statement that this is true has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the Zarankiewicz crossing number conjecture. The conjecture remains open, with only some special cases solved.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, it is conjectured that Zarankiewicz's and Urbanik's {{formula is}} optimal. This has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the Zarankiewicz {{crossing}} number conjecture. Although some special cases {{of it are}} known to be true, the general case remains open.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} half of Belgium, {{which would}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as Flanders, was a largely agricultural area containing the important port of Antwerp, {{the city of}} Ghent and the capital, Brussels. In the southern half, which would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as Wallonia, a number of smaller towns and cities along {{the valley of the}} Sambre and Meuse rivers – the sillon industriel ("industrial valley") – became the focus of industrialization. In the west of the valley, around Charleroi, was the Pays Noir ("Black Country"), which held significant coal deposits. In southeast Belgium, along the border with Luxembourg and Prussia (later Germany), was the heavily forested and agricultural region known as the Ardennes.|$|E
5|$|But at {{some point}} in 1972, family {{friendly}} programming began being interspersed with (and was eventually replaced by) “blue movies”, such as Swedish Fly Girls. The chain would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> for its generally risque material. In 1981, prints of both Caligula and Dracula Sucks were confiscated from multiple Towne locations, and the company was sued by the Government of Alberta under obscenity laws.|$|E

5000|$|According to legend, saint Thirugnana Sambandar {{was singing}} verses praising Shiva {{at the nearby}} site and Shiva was mesmerized by the devotion.

5|$|The old-style typefaces of Garamond and {{his contemporaries}} and successors {{remained}} {{in use in}} printing for over two hundred years after Garamond's death, and became influential on Dutch printing during the period known as Dutch golden age, when Dutch printing was itself very influential across Europe. Dutch and German printers and punchcutters, however, often favoured more solid, darker designs than Garamond's, which would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the “Dutch taste” (“Goût Hollandois”) style.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} {{in recent decades}} has been {{the study of the}} formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from economics have also been applied for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as science and technology studies.|$|E

5|$|Between September and November 1917, I Anzac Corps {{took part}} in a number of actions around Ypres in Belgium as the Allies {{launched}} a campaign in order to capture the Gheluvelt Plateau in Belgium. Collectively these actions have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the Third Battle of Ypres, of which they were a part, although to Australians they are more commonly known by the names of the places where the individual actions took place—Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him {{to believe that he}} was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as it has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known.</b> With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck {{at the rate of}} a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed {{to what has}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the High Victorian style. Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, {{and the use of}} polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the approval of the}} new five-cent coin, the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern coins in 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the Shield nickel.|$|E
5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures that would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as Kepler's solids. From there, {{he extended his}} harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and {{in the case of}} astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E

He {{was part of the}} Munster team that won the 2002–03 Celtic League, starting and scoring 12 points as Munster beat Neath 37–17 in the Millennium Stadium. O'Gara turned down the chance to join NFL side Miami Dolphins in March 2003. He started when Munster beat Llanelli Scarlets to win the Celtic Cup in May 2005, scoring 17 points in the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{which would}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as Brazil was claimed by Portugal on 22 April 1500, when the navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral landed on its coast. Permanent settlement followed in 1532, {{and for the}} next 300 years the Portuguese slowly expanded westwards until they had reached nearly all of the borders of modern Brazil. In 1808, the army of French Emperor Napoleon I invaded Portugal, forcing the Portuguese royal family—the House of Braganza, a branch of the thousand-year-old Capetian dynasty—into exile. They re-established themselves in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, which became the unofficial seat of the Portuguese Empire.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, {{all well and good}} for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
