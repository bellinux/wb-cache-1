Jon Caramanica of Rolling Stone gave the album 3 stars stating, [...] "When she really gets her hands dirty, Kim sounds more forceful and engaged than she's been in years". However, some critics felt {{the album was}} too long and contained too many fillers. Birchmeier of AllMusic stated the album <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> [...] "trimming". Brett Berliner of Stylus Magazine said, [...] "I enjoy about eight songs on this album, but they're tracks I only feel like listening to from time to time".|$|E

[...] Airlock Alpha also commended 17th Precinct for incorporating a fresh take on the police procedural genre, though also felt the pilot introduced too many characters and concepts. [...] TG Daily thought the concept was cool, though they felt [...] "the execution <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> polish". [...] They also specifically lauded Bamber, Helfer, and Callis, while not being overly impressed by the supporting cast. [...] In the end, they would have preferred 17th Precinct over Grimm.|$|E

2500|$|On April 28, 1932, Bow {{signed a}} two-picture deal with Fox Film Corporation, for Call Her Savage (1932) and Hoop-La (1933). Both were successful; Variety favored the latter. The October 1934, Family Circle Film Guide rated {{the film as}} [...] "pretty good entertainment", and of Miss Bow said: [...] "This is the most {{acceptable}} bit of talkie acting Miss Bow has done." [...] However, they noted, [...] "Miss Bow is presented in her dancing duds as often as possible, and her dancing duds wouldn't weigh two pounds soaking wet." [...] Bow commented on her revealing costume in Hoop-La: [...] "Rex accused me of enjoying showing myself off. Then I got a little sore.

[...] According to The New York Times Kamphuis also claimed to be the spokesman of the attackers, and said in a message [...] "We are aware {{that this is one of}} the largest DDoS attacks the world had publicly seen", and that CyberBunker was retaliating against Spamhaus for [...] "abusing their influence". The NYT added that security researcher Dan Kaminsky said [...] "You can’t stop a DNS flood ... The only way to deal with this problem is to find the people doing it and arrest them".|$|E
2500|$|The film review {{aggregator}} Rotten Tomatoes reports 71% positive reviews {{based on}} 52 surveyed critics {{and an average}} score of 7.4/10. [...] The site's consensus reads: [...] "The ending <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> work but this is otherwise another sterling example of David Fincher's iron grip on atmosphere and storytelling." [...] Metacritic rated it 61/100 based on 19 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, praising Douglas as [...] "the right actor for the role. He can play smart, he can play cold, and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does, and never overplays the process of his inner change". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Mr. Fincher, like Michael Douglas in the film's leading role, does show real finesse in playing to the paranoia of these times". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "Fincher's style is so handsomely oppressive, and Douglas' befuddlement is so cagey, {{that for a while}} the film recalls smarter excursions into heroic paranoia (The Parallax View, Total Recall)". In his review for The Washington Post, Desson Howe wrote, [...] "It’s formulaic, yet edgy. It’s predictable, yet full of surprises. How far you get through this tall tale of a thriller before you give up and howl is a matter of personal taste. But there’s much pleasure in Fincher’s intricate color schemes, his rich sense of decor, his ability to sustain suspense {{over long periods of time}} and his sense of humor". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Emotionally, there's not much at stake in The Game — can Nicholas Van Orton be saved?! — but Douglas is the perfect actor to occupy the center of a crazed Rube Goldberg thriller. The movie has the wit to be playful about its own manipulations, even as it exploits them for maximum pulp impact". In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote, [...] "At times The Game is frustrating to watch, but that's just a measure of how well Fincher succeeds in putting us in his hero's shoes". However, Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers felt that [...] "Fincher's effort to cover up the plot holes is all the more noticeable for being strained ... The Game has a sunny, redemptive side that ill suits Fincher and ill serves audiences that share his former affinity for loose ends hauntingly left untied".|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked by}} a {{reporter}} for {{a response to the}} threat, Rushdie said, [...] "I wish I had written a more critical book."

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the film}} was mostly positive, with Film Threat praising the movie's dialogue. The Stranger also praised The Naked Proof, {{saying that it was}} [...] " [...] full of spirited fits and starts". Variety gave an ambivalent review, writing that it was an [...] "amiable, good-hearted pic <b>could</b> have <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more brain and a lot less mouth {{to make the most of}} its ain't-humans-weird approach to romantic comedy".|$|R
5000|$|Wizard {{gave the}} game a mixed review. They {{commented that the}} {{inclusion}} of an illustrated storybook is an inspired way to get gamers to read, and helps establish a strong connection between the player and the protagonist, but {{that the number of}} secrets embedded in the game and the storybook is excessive. They praised the [...] "intense" [...] backgrounds, but felt the character graphics and animation were lacking. They concluded Sküljagger to be [...] "an interesting game that <b>could</b> have <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more work ... definitely worth a look-see." ...|$|R

500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times reviewed: [...] "Dick Tracy {{has just}} about {{everything}} required of an extravaganza: a smashing cast, some great Stephen Sondheim songs, all of the technical wizardry that money can buy, and a screenplay that observes the fine line separating true comedy from lesser camp." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed review, but was impressed by Madonna's performance. [...] "Dick Tracy is an honest effort but finally {{a bit of a}} folly. It <b>could</b> have <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less color and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more flesh and blood," [...] Gleiberman concluded.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{received}} [...] "average" [...] reviews {{according to}} the review aggregation website Metacritic. The substantial amount of criticism came from the game's gameplay, with many reviews stating the game had style over substance. Matt Casamassina of IGN said, [...] "Fragile Dreams is {{a great example of}} a spectacular concept whose execution <b>could</b> have <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more thought and time." [...] Eurogamer echoed IGN's sentiments, noting [...] "Fragile Dreams fails to match its ambition with its systems and imagination." [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, Deirdre Crimmins {{described}} {{the novel as}} [...] "an imperfect vampire book" [...] marred by [...] "some very awkwardly worded phrases and poorly described scenarios scattered throughout the book" [...] and some [...] "terribly clichéd" [...] characters. Jeff Jensen, reviewing The Strain for Entertainment Weekly, wished for more evidence of del Toro's participation, saying, [...] "It's hard to believe he found time for such an ambitious project — and after reading the book, it seems clear he didn't. ... The Strain is a competently constructed piece of entertainment, and I'll give it bonus points for shaking up some vampire clichés. ... The novel <b>could</b> have <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less Hogan and little more del Toro." ...|$|R

5000|$|G. Allen Johnson of the San Francisco Chronicle {{describes}} {{the film as}} [...] "a gorgeously shot, ambitious epic". Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film, [...] "a remarkable period piece, evoking the bustling, dense and increasingly dangerous Shanghai of the '30s". Thomas praised Zhang as an actress with [...] "formidable resources" [...] and [...] "has that crucial gift of holding herself in check {{at just the right}} moments for maximum dramatic impact and psychological complexity". Thomas further state the film is [...] "suspenseful, atmospheric and sometimes puzzling". However, other critics saw the film as technically masterful but a case where style had trumped substance. In particular the film's labyrinthine and difficult to follow plot was pointed to as a major point of complaint. One such review by Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called the film [...] "lush but confusing", and states [...] "Purple Butterfly is rich with emotional turmoil and searing beauty, but it <b>could</b> have <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time in the editing room {{to make sense of it}} all." ...|$|R
5000|$|One of Chbosky's major {{contributions}} {{to the structure of}} the series was the introduction of a greater feminine element to the storyline, opining that, [...] "We <b>could</b> <b>use</b> some girls, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kissing, and some laughs." [...] Another significant developmental influence were the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina, and the sense of [...] "being a spectator to a disaster, while not quite being part of it." [...] Co-creator Steinberg in particular felt that after 9/11, the United States saw some of the [...] "best of people," [...] and after Hurricane Katrina, some of the [...] "worst of people," [...] and sought to include both in the fabric of Jericho, with Katrina providing [...] "lots of inspiration" [...] for the show's overall premise.|$|R
50|$|As was {{the case}} with other British Superstars of the era, Ripley could not attempt to win the events by picking up points in every event - he had to use the popular tactic of scoring as highly in his 'banker' events as possible, and holding on in the others. Unfortunately for Ripley his size proved to be a {{disadvantage}} in the gymnasium tests - he was too big to contemplate parallel bar dips or squat thrusts and while he could lift prodigious amounts in the weightlifting, his heavy bodyweight meant that smaller athletes would always win using the coefficient system. He <b>could</b> also have <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> luck - <b>a</b> puncture right {{at the start of the}} 1981 British Final cycling race cost him eight valuable points, and any chance of the title. Instead it went to Keith Fielding, his former England Rugby Sevens teammate.|$|R

He observed that the signals were clear and that the spring switch appeared to be properly aligned against the rail, likely having completely closed after train 703 passed through the switch earlier.

5000|$|Helen Brown in The Telegraph {{calls it}} a [...] "mellow, {{accessible}} album" [...] and states [...] "Proceeds go to help refugees {{at a time when}} displaced people are struggling to find room at the inn. Whatever your stance on the Catholic Church, or its leader, I suspect Pope Francis has made a good call here. At a time of increasingly inflamed religious emotions, the world <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Holy chill out." ...|$|E
5000|$|Time for Love is {{the fifth}} studio album by Freddie Jackson, {{released}} in 1992 on Capitol Records. The album includes the singles [...] "Me and Mrs. Jones", [...] "Can We Try" [...] and [...] "I <b>Could</b> <b>Use</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Love Right Now". The standout track is a poignant cover of the Gamble & Huff classic [...] "Me and Mrs. Jones", originally recorded by Billy Paul in 1971 and subsequently by The Dramatics.|$|E
5000|$|Another aspect Lady Sia {{was praised}} for was its solid {{gameplay}} that IGN described as [...] "a decent balance between" [...] standard platformers and Final Fight clones. Sia herself has a remarkable number of abilities at her disposal. Although this prevented combat from being too repetitive, most reviewers felt Sias abilities <b>could</b> have <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more fine-tuning. For example, some reviewers thought Sias elemental spells {{were hard to}} cast, as performing them required a combination of control pad buttons. Thus, Sia needs room to move on-screen, which, due to the platform structure, isnt always an option. Some of her sword combos had a similar shortcoming. GameSpy wrote: [...] "They often cause her to slide off platforms or into enemies." [...] The reviewers also criticized {{the fact that if}} Sia hit a checkpoint, it saved her current magic and health status. This made the checkpoint practically worthless if activated when the player only has <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of health left. GameSpot considered this and the combos to be the games only two weaknesses. In the end, Lady Sia garnered mostly positive reviews. IGN summarized it with the quote, [...] "Lady Sias a good one," [...] and GameSpot did so with: [...] "Thanks to its solid control, clever puzzles, and stellar production values, Lady Sia is easily worth a trip to the local game shop." [...] GameSpy concluded that there were better platform games on the market, but that Lady Sia was still a worthwhile game.|$|R
5000|$|Jesus Freak Hideouts John DiBiase {{said that}} the album [...] "with {{everything}} new in place except for vocalist David Zach, one might expect Remedy Drive to sound entirely different, but Resuscitate retains {{the heart and soul}} of the band through Zachs hopeful lyrics and unique vocals. However, a quick listen to the album may disappoint some fans who enjoyed the somewhat more raw sound the jam band had brought to the piano pop rock table with Daylight Is Coming (Which, honestly, I thought <b>could</b> have even <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less polish then). But further listens to Resuscitates more shiny packaging reveal the gems within." [...] Additionally, DiBiase wrote that [...] "as a pop rock record, Resuscitate is among some of the best of the year, while those maybe hoping to find <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more of the raw energy of their live show captured on this record might be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> disappointed. Regardless, Resuscitate remains a strong batch of songs from a band that I can expect only bigger things from in the near future as they continue to rediscover their proverbial footing as this new foursome." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} aggregator, reports that 96% of 23 {{surveyed}} critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.8/10. Metacritic rated it 65/100 based on nine reviews. [...] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Although highly entertaining, this loving tribute to Romero's cult classic <b>could</b> have <b>used</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more meat on its zombie bones". [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated it A and wrote {{that it is}} [...] "full of juicy anecdotes". [...] Andy Webster of The New York Times made it a NYT Critics' Pick and called Romero [...] "a most agreeable raconteur". [...] The Los Angeles Times called it [...] "a nifty little tribute" [...] that lacks commentary about Romero's later work. [...] Jeff Shannon of The Seattle Times wrote that the film [...] "pays wide-ranging tribute to an enduring pop-cultural milestone". [...] Ernest Hardy of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "What distinguishes this doc from much of the tedious critical prose Romero has inspired is the fan-boy and fan-girl ardor that fuels its smarts". [...] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York rated it 4/5 stars and wrote that the film finds interesting analysis not already covered by previous works. [...] Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine rated it 2.5/4 stars and wrote that the documentary is charming despite its lack of new information. [...] A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club rated it C+ and also criticized its lack of new insights. [...] Noel Murray of The Dissolve rated it 3/5 stars and called it [...] "little more than a glorified DVD featurette" [...] but still enjoyable. [...] Eric Ortiz Garcia of Twitch Film wrote, [...] "Kuhns' love letter to Romero's masterpiece is a welcome and fresh addition to our history of the modern screen zombie." ...|$|R

5000|$|Thicke and Minaj first {{collaborated on}} the track [...] "Shakin' It 4 Daddy" [...] for Thicke's fourth studio album Sex Therapy: The Session (2009). Speaking on Minaj's {{involvement}} during an interview for On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Thicke said, [...] "I was working with Max Martin and Kotecha and we had been messing with the song for a few months, and then Max finally got it {{to a place where}} he loved it and I thought it <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> spice — a little edge. That’s when I sent it to Nicki and she loved it." [...] "Back Together" [...] is raging, disco-fied track.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{awarded the}} album a [...] "B-" [...] grade, opining that, [...] "the peaks on Neighborhoods — their first disc {{in eight years}} — {{do little more than}} recall past triumphs. Outside of some latent goth leanings ('This Is Home') and a gauzy detour ('Ghost on the Dance Floor'), it's mostly twitch-crunch-whine-repeat." [...] Michael Brown of Drowned in Sound gave a mixed review, {{awarding}} the album a lukewarm five out of ten. He critiqued that, [...] "Blink have the potential for much more than their past reputation may convey, but Neighborhoods is reminiscent of that first awkward conversation after a heated argument, as no-one's quite sure where to go next." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave the album three stars out of five, noting elements of sophistication, introspection, and darkness in the music and lyrics and commenting that [...] "Some Clinton-era pants-dropping might've been a fun nostalgia move. But those days are gone; it's their early-2010s nightmare as much as anyone else's." [...] Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club was critical of DeLonge's vocals, saying that he [...] "sounds flat as ever, and has a fondness for clunky lyrics", concluding that [...] "Although Blink-182 has long since left its past as a bare-bones punk band behind, overwrought rock isn't its forte, either. Neighborhoods finds a nice balance between the two, but it <b>could</b> still <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less fussiness." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine considered it uninspired: [...] "When they try to add relatively ambitious elements to the things they actually do well, Blink-182 is more successful. [...] It's admirable that Blink-182 tries to challenge themselves over the course of Neighborhoods, but their growing pains don't make for a particularly good album or a welcome comeback." [...] Scott McLennan of The Boston Globe considered the album a step forward, summarizing, [...] "Blink-182 again delivers a record with nothing outright awful and enough dynamite songs to pack a punch at future tours." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin called the album [...] "surprisingly and refreshingly low-key," [...] but its self-examination [...] "comparatively adrift" [...] with the sound of their past.|$|R
