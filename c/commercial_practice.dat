5|$|The only internationally {{recognized}} authority for naming celestial bodies is the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The International Astronomical Union maintains the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the British Library calls an unregulated commercial enterprise. The IAU has disassociated itself from this <b>commercial</b> <b>practice,</b> and these names are neither {{recognized by the}} IAU, professional astronomers, nor the amateur astronomy community. One such star-naming company is the International Star Registry, which, during the 1980s, was accused of deceptive practice for making it appear that the assigned name was official. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} in the High Court of Justice on 30 January 1893, before Sir Henry Hawkins; Bottomley {{conducted}} his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for {{far less than the}} prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted <b>commercial</b> <b>practice,</b> and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.|$|E

40|$|Diploma thesis {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of legal instruments to prevent the use of aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> Thesis {{is divided into two}} main chapters, the first is the protection against aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> in business to consumer market and the second part is dedicated to the protection against aggressive practices in the business to business market. Each section compares the European protection of aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> (and also through European legislation implemented in Czech law) with the protection of those practices in U. S. law. The first part of thesis deals with the protection of consumers against aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> In European law it mainly regulated by Directive on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> The Directive is implemented in Czech Republic in mainly in Consumer Protection Code and in the Advertising Code. Private protection against aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> is embodied in provision of unfair competition of the Commercial Code. Protection of personality, privacy and personal data is another form of protection against aggressive practices. In U. S. law, public consumer protection is represented by Federal Trade Commission. In private law, consumers seek redress in court through actions for torts. In relations between competitors is the protection against aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> regulated by unfair competition and by antirust law. Antitrust law in European Union is represented by 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. Unfair Competition Law in the U. S. in the B 2 B market is the part of business torts. Antitrust law is represented by Federal Trade Commission and the Ministry of Justice. The last part of Diploma Thesis is concerned with aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> that very often are accompanying the offers in time-sharing field and with children aggressive commercials, as a example of aggressive <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> in practice...|$|R

500|$|Kitchener, a [...] "figure of {{absolute}} will and power, {{an emblem of}} British masculinity", was a natural subject for Leete's artwork as his name was directly attached to the recruiting efforts and the newly-forming Kitchener's Army. Le Bas of Caxton Advertising (for whom Leete worked) chose Kitchener for the advertisement because Kitchener was [...] "the only soldier with a great war name, won in the field, within {{the memory of the}} thousands of men the country wanted." [...] Kitchener made his name in the Sudan Campaign, avenging the death of General Gordon with brutality and efficiency. He became a hero of [...] "New Imperialism" [...] alongside other widely regarded figures in Britain like Field Marshal Wolseley and Field Marshal Roberts. [...] Kitchener's appearance including his bushy mustache and court dress jacket was reminiscent of romanticized Victorian era styles. Kitchener, [...] tall and powerfully built, was for many the personification of military ethos so popular in the present Edwardian era. After the scorched earth tactics and hard-fought victory of the Second Boer War, Kitchener represented a return to the military victories of the colonial era. The fact that Kitchener's name is not used in the poster demonstrates how easily he was visually recognized. David Lubin opines that the image {{may be one of the}} earliest successful celebrity endorsements as the <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> expanded greatly in the 1920s. Keith Surridge posits that Kitchener's features evoked the harsh, feared militarism of the Germans which bode well for British fortune in the war. Kitchener would not see the end of the war; he died onboard in the sinking of HMS Hampshire in 1916.|$|E

40|$|In 2005, the EU Directive on Unfair <b>Commercial</b> <b>Practices</b> was adopted.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} highly topical subject of {{regulation}} surrounding <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> This examination is divided into four chapters. The first chapter looks at the notion of <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> by considering both the linguistic and legal definition of the term, and the importance of the regulation is proved. The second chapter deals with the question of division of law into its public and private counterparts. The discussion of the consequences of this division are crucial for a better analysis of the actual implementation of the EU Directive 2005 / 29 /CE on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> In the third chapter, the scope of application of this Directive is analysed and the main principles of regulation are described. The final section focuses on the Czech law on unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices.</b> In this segment, the text of the provisions of the Czech Code of Consumer Protection is compared to the Directive, and the system of legal redress and sanctions in the Code of Consumer Protection is critically analysed. The legal regulation of "promotional events", during which the ban of unfair <b>commercial</b> <b>practices</b> is often breached, is placed under scrutiny. The Directive was also implemented into the Code of Regulation of Advertisement. One subchapter of the fourth chapter is therefore [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Consideration is an {{additional}} requirement in English law before a contract is enforceable. A person wishing to enforce an agreement must show that they have brought something to the bargain which has [...] "something of value {{in the eyes of}} the law", either by conferring a benefit on another person or incurring a detriment at their request. In practice this means not simple gratitude or love, not things already done in the past, and not promising to perform a pre-existing duty unless performance takes place for a third party. Metaphorically, consideration is [...] "the price for which the promise is bought". It is contentious in the sense that it gives rise to a level of complexity that legal systems which do not take their heritage from English law simply do not have. In reality the doctrine of consideration operates in a very small scope, and creates few difficulties in <b>commercial</b> <b>practice.</b> After reform in the United States, especially the Restatement of Contracts §90 which allows all promises to bind if it would otherwise lead to [...] "injustice", a report in 1937 by the Law Revision Committee, Statute of Frauds and the Doctrine of Consideration, proposed that promises in writing, for past consideration, for part payments of debt, promising to perform pre-existing obligations, promising to keep an offer open, and promises that another relies on to their detriment should all be binding. The report was never enacted in legislation, but almost all of its recommendations have been put into effect through case law since, albeit with difficulty.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>commercial</b> <b>practice</b> {{the term}} [...] "debenture" [...] {{typically}} {{refers to the}} document that evidences a secured debt, although in law the definition may also cover unsecured debts (like any [...] "IOU"). The legal definition is relevant for certain tax statutes, so for instance in British India Steam Navigation Co v IRC Lindley J held that a simple [...] "acknowledgement of indebtedness" [...] was a debenture, which meant that a paper on which directors promised to pay the holder £100 in 1882 and 5% interest each half year was enough, {{and as a result}} subject to pay duty under the Stamp Act 1870. The definition depends on the purpose of the statutory provision for which it is used. It matters because debenture holders have the right to company accounts and the director's report, because debenture holders must be recorded on a company register which other debenture holders may inspect, and when issued by a company, debentures are not subject to the rule against [...] "clogs on the equity of redemption". This old equitable rule was a form of common law consumer protection, which held that if a person contracted for a mortgage, they must always have the right to pay off the debt and get full title to their property back. The mortgage agreement could not be turned into a sale to the lender, and one could not contract for a perpetual period for interest repayments. However, because the rule limited on contractual freedom to protect borrowers with weaker bargaining power, it was thought to be inappropriate for companies. In Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd the House of Lords held that an agreement by New Patagonia to sell sheepskins exclusively to Kreglinger in return for a £10,000 loan secured by a floating charge would persist for five years even after the principal sum was repaid. The contract to keep buying exclusively was construed to not be a clog on redeeming autonomy from the loan because the rule's purpose was to preclude unconscionable bargains. Subsequently, the clog on the equity of redemption rule as a whole was abolished by what is now section 739 of the Companies Act 2006. In Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne the House of Lords applied this so that when Knightsbridge took a secured loan of £310,000 from Mr Byrne and contracted to repay interest over 40 years, Knightsbridge could not then argue that the contract should be void. The deal created a debenture under the Act, and so this rule of equity was not applied.|$|E
