Its origins, however, date further back to Microsoft's Cairo operating system project, with the component serving as the Content Indexer for the Object File System.

40|$|Mobile cloud {{computing}} (MCC) {{has recently been}} drawing increased attention in academia as well as industry. Content retrieval is a critical service, for many mobile cloud applications and in turns relies on other resources and tools, e. g., internal storage, <b>content</b> <b>searching</b> and sharing, etc. Previous {{studies have shown that}} conventional ICN interest query schemes and <b>content</b> <b>searching</b> architectures, if not properly designed, can cause significant performance degradation and energy consumption, especially for large scale MANETs. In this paper, we specifically address the scalability and energy efficiency of the content retrieval scheme in mobile {{cloud computing}}. We propose a direction-selective forwarding scheme for the content query method that decreases traffic overhead and energy cost caused by duplicate copies of the query packets. We also advocate the parallel search method of multiple caches to increase the hit rate. Simulation experiments show that the proposed scheme yields significant improvements in efficiency and scalability for the content retrieval in large scale MANETs...|$|R
40|$|The World Wide Web {{is growing}} at such a pace that even the biggest {{centralized}} search engines are able to index {{only a small part}} of the available documents on the Internet. The decentralized structure, together with the features of self-organization and fault-tolerance, makes peerto-peer networking an effective information-sharing model; however, <b>content</b> <b>searching</b> still remains a serious challenge of large scale peer-to-peer networks. In this paper we present SemreX, a semantic overlay for desktop literature / document retrieval in peer-to-peer networks. We present a semantic overlay algorithm by which semantically similar peers are locally clustered together, and long-range connections are rewired for a short-cut in peer-to-peer networks. Based on the semantic overlay, a heuristic query routing algorithm is proposed for efficient <b>content</b> <b>searching.</b> We conduct a comprehensive simulation to evaluate the search performance of our algorithms. Results show that search in our SemreX semantic overlay greatly improves search efficiency. c ○ 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The {{pages that}} are {{discovered}} by web crawls are often distributed and fed into another computer {{that creates a}} veritable map of resources uncovered. The bunchy clustermass {{looks a little like}} a graph, on which the different pages are represented as small nodes that are connected by links between the pages. The excess of data is stored in multiple data structures that permit quick access to said data by certain algorithms that compute the popularity score of pages on the web based on how many links point to a certain web page, which is how people can access any number of resources concerned with diagnosing psychosis. Another example would be the accessibility/rank of web pages containing information on Mohamed Morsi versus the very best attractions to visit in Cairo after simply entering ‘Egypt’ as a search term. One such algorithm, PageRank, proposed by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is well known and has attracted a lot of attention because it highlights repeat mundanity of web searches courtesy of students that don’t know how to properly research subjects on Google.The idea of doing link analysis to compute a popularity rank is older than PageRank. Other variants of the same idea are currently in use - grade schoolers do the same sort of computations in picking kickball teams. But in all seriousness, these ideas can be categorized into three main categories: rank of individual pages and nature of web site <b>content.</b> <b>Search</b> engines often differentiate between internal links and external links, because web masters and mistresses are not strangers to shameless self-promotion. Link map data structures typically store the anchor text embedded in the links as well, because anchor text can often provide a “very good quality” summary of a web page’s content.|$|E
