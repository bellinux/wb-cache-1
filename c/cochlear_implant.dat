5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans {{may be caused by}} a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the opinions {{and knowledge of}} Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals on <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants.</b> Previous research presented showed the controversial opinions on what was known about <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> {{as a result of}} speculation in the Deaf community. This thesis consisted of surveying Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals {{in order to have a}} better understanding of what is known about <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> and the opinions that concur due to incorrect or correct knowledge. Thirteen subjects, including eight Deaf and seven hard-of-hearing individuals, completed the assessment. The results indicated that uncertainty about <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> still remains; therefore, it is necessary to educate individuals on how <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> benefit and work. This is essential to make informative decisions and form opinions surrounding <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> and the Deaf community...|$|R

30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> on the school failure of deaf who attend mainstream classes by comparing them to their normal-hearing peers as well as deaf without <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants.</b> This case–control study included participants aged 8 – 18  years. The number of school years failed was obtained from school records. The greatest differences in achievement levels were found between hearing students {{and those who were}} deaf without <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants.</b> <b>Cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> provide educational opportunities for hearing-impaired students, yet those without <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> remain at a great disadvantage. These findings suggest that measures promoting greater equity and quality for all deaf students allow achievement levels closer to those of the not impaired.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to recent}} {{advances}} in technology, <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> allow some deaf people to interact with others more efficiently. There are interior and exposed components that require a medical procedure. Especially those who receive <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> earlier in life show improvements. Spoken language development varies widely for those with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> due {{to a number of}} different factors including: age at implantation, frequency, quality and type of speech training. Some evidence suggests that speech processing occurs at a more rapid pace in some pre-lingually deaf children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> than those with traditional hearing aids.|$|R

25|$|Cochlear {{implants}} {{are only}} approved {{for people who}} are deaf in both ears; as of 2014 a <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> had been used experimentally in some people who had acquired deafness in one ear after they had learned how to speak, and none who were deaf in one ear from birth; clinical studies as of 2014 had been too small to draw generalizations from.|$|E
25|$|Neuroprosthetics {{is an area}} of {{neuroscience}} {{concerned with}} neural prostheses, that is, using artificial devices to replace the function of impaired nervous systems and brain related problems, or of sensory organs. The most widely used neuroprosthetic device is the <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> which, as of December 2010, had been implanted in approximately 220,000 people worldwide. There are also several neuroprosthetic devices that aim to restore vision, including retinal implants.|$|E
25|$|Cochlear {{implantation}} restores {{access to}} the acoustic signal in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss. The acoustic information conveyed by an implant is usually sufficient for implant users to properly recognize speech of people they know even without visual clues. For <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> users, {{it is more difficult}} to understand unknown speakers and sounds. The perceptual abilities of children that received an implant after the age of two are significantly better than of those who were implanted in adulthood. A number of factors have been shown to influence perceptual performance, specifically: duration of deafness prior to implantation, age of onset of deafness, age at implantation (such age effects {{may be related to the}} Critical period hypothesis) and the duration of using an implant. There are differences between children with congenital and acquired deafness. Postlingually deaf children have better results than the prelingually deaf and adapt to a <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> faster. In both children with cochlear implants and normal hearing, vowels and voice onset time becomes prevalent in development before the ability to discriminate the place of articulation. Several months following implantation, children with cochlear implants can normalize speech perception.|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{deals with}} issues of <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants.</b> It is focused on pre-school {{children}} one year before attending basic school. Thesis discusses all requisites that precede, accompany and follow cochlear implantation. We primarily determined the possibilities of children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants,</b> whether they can reach approximate levels of communication as intact children {{of the same age}} specifically in development of passive vocabulary and in the ability of understanding of speech. We choose the test Diagnosis of Language Development (Diagnostika jazykového vývoje) by Gabriela Seidlová Málková and Filip Smolík. The results of tests of children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> were compared with tests of intact children of the same age. Next we used analysis of expert literature and interviews with teachers to determine which particular factors have underlying influence in the process of therapy of children after cochlear implantation and which influence them enough so children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> approach communication levels of intact children. These factors were tracked in case studies of two girls with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants.</b> KEYWORDS: <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants,</b> passive vocabulary, understanding of speech, preschool age, speech therap...|$|R

25|$|Much of {{the strongest}} {{objection}} to cochlear implants has come from within the Deaf community, {{some of whom are}} pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the Deaf community, cochlear implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. This is an old problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the 'normal' body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is {{something that needs to be}} cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> can act as a tool Deaf people can use to access the 'hearing world' without losing their Deaf identity.|$|E

25|$|As of 2013, {{the three}} <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> devices {{approved}} {{for use in}} the U.S. were manufactured by Cochlear Limited (Australia), Advanced Bionics (USA, a division of Sonova) and MED-EL (Austria). In Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and Canada, an additional device manufactured by Neurelec (France, a division of William Demant) was available. A device made by Nurotron (China) was also available {{in some parts of the}} world. Each manufacturer has adapted some of the successful innovations of the other companies to its own devices. There is no consensus that any one of these implants is superior to the others. Users of all devices report a wide range of performance after implantation.|$|E
40|$|Prosody can be {{characterized}} as the rhythm and the melody of speech. Prosodic features convey emotions, thoughts and geographic origins of each individual. Spoken language without prosody would be monotonous, without variations in loudness and rate. Children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> perceive speech in a different way than children with normal hearing. Consequently the speech produced by a child with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> may sound different. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine prosodic skills in Swedish children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> and to compare them with the prosodic skills in Swedish children with normal hearing. The purpose of the study was also to examine differences between these two groups and to characterize those differences. Eight children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> and eight controls matched to age, sex and regional accent were included in the study. The children’s production and perception of prosody was tested. The results show that there are differences in prosodic skills between the children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> and their matched controls at word, phrase and discourse levels. The differences were significant in production but not in perception. Observed differences in the speech of the children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> included omission of unstressed syllables and function words, difficulties producing contrast of tonal word accents and pro-longed maintenance of phonological processes. The study contributes to the knowledge about prosodic and linguistic skills in Swedish children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants...</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter reviews {{recent studies}} {{looking at the}} impact of <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> on the {{development}} of reading and writing of deaf children. Although there is good evidence that <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> have significantly improved the spoken language of many children with severe to profound hearing loss, their impact on literacy—something that deaf children have traditionally found challenging—has proved to be considerably less consistent. In particular, benefits that are evident {{in the early years of}} education are often reduced as children progress through school. The aim of the chapter is to identify factors that affect the impact of <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> at different stages of learning to read and write by considering both the skills that underpin early and later literacy for deaf children and factors affecting the efficacy of <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants.</b> The chapter concludes with a consideration of how the literacy development of deaf children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> can best be supported through the use of interventions that enable the development of robust phonological coding...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to acoustically analyze speech {{performance}} of Cantonese-speaking children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> over a three-month period, and compare it with that of the hearing controls. Three categories of sounds in Cantonese were focused: vowels /i/, /ɛ/, /a/, /ɔ/ and /u/ (first and second formant frequencies), fricatives /s/ and /f/ (noise centre of gravity), and affricates /ts/ and /tsh/ (accuracy, production pattern and duration). Twenty-one subjects with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> and 21 hearing subjects matched with age and gender were recruited. Speech samples were recorded and analyzed. The results showed that children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> demonstrated statistically significant deviated performance for vowels, fricatives, and affricates when compared with the hearing controls. However, children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> showed an overall improvement in speech performance for all the sound categories at the second recording.

40|$|Background: The {{number of}} {{children}} with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> who have other difficulties such as attention deficiency and cerebral palsy has increased dramatically. Despite the need {{for information on the}} results of cochlear implantation in this group, the available literature is extremely limited. We, therefore, sought to compare the levels of auditory perception in children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> with and without additional disabilities. Methods: A spondee test comprising 20 two-syllable words was performed. The data analysis was done using SPSS, version  19. Results: Thirty-one children who had received <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> 2  years previously and were at an average age of 7. 5  years were compared via the spondee test. From the 31 children, 15 had one or more additional disabilities. The data analysis indicated that the mean score of auditory perception in this group was approximately 30 scores below that of the children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> who had no additional disabilities. Conclusion: Although there was an improvement in the auditory perception of all the children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants,</b> there was a noticeable difference in the level of auditory perception between those with and without additional disabilities. Deafness and additional disabilities depended the children on lip reading alongside the auditory ways of communication. In addition, the level of auditory perception in the children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> who had more than one additional disability was significantly less than that of the other children with <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> who had one additional disability...|$|R
