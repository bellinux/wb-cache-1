40|$|A {{numerical}} model, {{the design}} and experimental data of a <b>chopper</b> <b>disk</b> Q-switched CO_ 2 laser is presented. The numerical model describes the influence-of the diffraction on the temporal and spatial properties of the Q-switched laser pulse. It includes {{the interaction of the}} spatial distribution of the laser field with the spatial distribution of the gain medium, the diffraction of the laser field due to edge effects of the rotating <b>chopper</b> <b>disk,</b> as well as the unstable resonator configuration. The laser pulse properties are discussed for different small signal gains and different angular velocities of the <b>chopper</b> <b>disk</b> and compared with the experimental results. The Q-switched CO_ 2 laser produces pulses with a peak power of 600 kW at a pulse duration of 200 ns, and an average output power of 1. 3 kW. (orig.) 83 refs.

The method uses the inner and outer sectionsof a single <b>chopper</b> <b>disk</b> to modulate the monochromator and the laser beam, eliminating the need of complexelectronic filters, and two additional PIN photodiodes for scattered light compensation. The method has beennumerically simulated using LabVIEW in order to investigate the influence of the modulator finite switching timeand the finite resolution of the digital acquisition system.

40|$|The {{detrimental}} {{temperature rise}} due to eddy currents in large <b>chopper</b> <b>disks</b> from aluminium alloy operated at high rotation frequencies was investigated experimentally and compared to calculations obtained with finite element analyses. We {{found that for}} magnetic field strengths which are commonly used for polarized neutron beam guidance, the temperature rise is only about 20 K, a value which does not compromise {{the use of these}} aluminium choppers. Furthermore, the induced magnetic field due to the eddy currents does not significantly affect the polarizing field. These findings will form the basis of our chopper development from this material.

2500|$|The {{pneumatic}} siren, {{which is}} a free aerophone, consists of a rotating disk with holes in it (called a <b>chopper,</b> siren <b>disk</b> or [...] ), such that the material between the holes interrupts a flow of air from fixed holes {{on the outside of}} the unit (called a stator). As the holes in the rotating disk alternately prevent and allow air to flow it results in alternating compressed and rarefied air pressure, i.e. sound. [...] Such sirens can consume large amounts of energy. To reduce the energy consumption without losing sound volume, some designs of pneumatic sirens are boosted by forcing compressed air from a tank that can be refilled by a low powered compressor through the siren disk.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAxial eye {{growth rates}} in the chicken are {{controlled}} by local retinal image-processing circuits. These circuits quantify the loss of contrast for different spatial frequencies and promote axial eye growth rates in correlation {{with the amount of}} retinal image degradation (“deprivation myopia”). They also distinguish whether the plane of focus lies in front of or behind the retina. How the sign of defocus is detected still remains unclear. Cues from chromatic aberration are not important. In an attempt to isolate retinal circuits controlling the development of myopia or hyperopia, young chickens were raised in flickering light of different frequencies (12 and 6 Hz) and duty cycles (4 – 75 %) produced by rotating <b>chopper</b> <b>disks.</b> The effects of flickering light on refractive errors and change in axial growth rates induced by translucent occluders or defocusing lenses were measured by infrared retinoscopy and A-scan ultrasound, respectively. Retinal electrical activity was evaluated by flicker ERG after matching flicker parameters and stimulation brightness at retinal surface. Changes in retinal and vitreal dopamine content caused by flicker in occluded and normal eyes were determined by HPLC-ECD. Strikingly, suppression of myopia occurred for similar flicker parameters, whether induced by translucent occluders (“deprivation”) or negative lenses (“defocus”). The degree to which myopia was suppressed was correlated with the duration of flicker dark phase and with the ERG amplitude. In contrast, suppression of hyperopia did not correlate with these parameters. We conclude that two different retinal circuits with different temporal characteristics are involved in the processing of hyperopic defocus/deprivation and of myopic defocus, the first one dependent on flicker ERG amplitude. However, we did not find any correlation between the rate of dopamine release and the degree of inhibition of deprivation myopia in flickering light...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} provide the large {{chemistry}} and materials science {{as well as the}} geosciences communities with a powerful tool for rapid data acquisition, a time-of-flight powder diffractometer to be installed at the new Munich reactor has been designed. The time-of-flight technique is expected to outperform a monochromator instrument by at least an order of magnitude in data acquisition time, particularly on small samples of less than a cubic centimetre. The construction of this innovative type of diffractometer utilizes modern components such as focusing super-mirror neutron guides, a four-unit highspeed <b>disk</b> <b>chopper</b> system and linear position-sensitive detectors covering a solid angle of about 2 pi steradian. The diffractometer design enables an easy enlargement of the focal spot size and is therefore equally well suited for the texture analysis of large geological and archaeological samples.

40|$|We {{describe}} the <b>Disk</b> <b>Chopper</b> Spectrometer (DCS) at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). The maximum measured flux at the sample, averaged over the 3 cm width and 10 cm {{height of the}} beam, with all choppers turning at 20, 000 revolutions per minute and phased to transmit neutrons through the widest slots on each disk, is approximately 3 104 n cm 2 s 1. In this configuration the elastic resolution FWHM (full width at half maximum height) with an incident wavelength of 6 A is 67 leV. In an alternative configuration, achieved by changing the chopper phases so that neutrons pass through somewhat narrower slots, the elastic resolution FWHM at 6 A is 34 leV. Useful wavelengths range from about 1. 5 A to at least 12 A. The DCS {{has been used for}} a variety of measurements, including quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) studies of systems such as water in confined geometries and biological molecules in solution...|$|R
40|$|A high-flux {{backscattering}} spectrometer and a time-of-flight <b>disk</b> <b>chopper</b> spectrometer {{are used}} to probe the molecular mobility of model freeze-dried phospholipid liposomes at a range of temperatures surrounding the main melting transition. Using specific deuteration, quasielastic neutron scattering provides evidence that, {{in contrast to the}} hydrocarbon chains, the headgroups of the phospholipid molecules do not exhibit a sharp melting transition. The onset of motion in the tails is located at temperatures far below the calorimetric transition. Long-range motion is achieved through the onset of whole-lipid translation at the melting temperature. Atomistic simulations are performed on a multibilayer model at conditions corresponding to the scattering experiments. The model provides a good description of the dynamics of the system, with predictions of the scattering functions that agree with experimental results. The analysis of both experimental data and results of simulations supports a picture of a gradual melting of the heterogeneous hydrophobic domain, with part of the chains spanning increasingly larger volumes and part of them remaining effectively immobile until the thermodynamic phase transition occurs...|$|R
40|$|The slow {{dynamics}} of supercooled water is studied by modelling {{the spectrum of}} test particle fluctuations: intermediate scattering function (ISF). The theoretical models are compared with experimental measurements by quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results. The {{dynamics of}} supercooled water can be decoupled into a product of translational and rotational dynamics. While the translational dynamics is modelled well by {{a product of a}} ISF representing short time in-cage vibrations and long time cage relaxation processes, the rotational dynamics is an aspect we shall study in this thesis. We introduce a model for the first, second and third order rotational correlation functions, which are required for the computation of the rotational intermediate scattering function corresponding to the incoherent QENS spectra from supercooled water. The model is tested against MD data generated from an extended-simple-point-charge (SPC/E) model of water and is found to be satisfactory. The analysis {{can be used as a}} practical method for extracting rotational relaxation parameters from QENS spectra measured at large Q from supercooled bulk water or interfacial water in porous materials. (cont.) By confining water in nano-pores of silica glass, we can bypass the crystallization and study the pressure effect on the dynamical behavior in deeply supercooled state using incoherent QENS technique. we investigated the dynamics of water confined in nanoporous alumino-silicate matrices, from ambient temperature to the deeply supercooled state. We collected data on three instruments, with widely different resolutions, the Fermi <b>chopper</b> (FCS), the <b>disk</b> <b>chopper</b> (DCS) and the backscattering (HFBS) spectrometers at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NIST NCNR). The confining systems were lab synthesized nanoporous glasses MCM- 41 -S and MCM- 48 -S. Inside the pores of these matrices the freezing process of water is retarded so that freezing occurs at a temperature about 50 K less than in bulk water. Thus, with the combined use of different instruments and nano-pore confinement, we were able to study the system over a wide temperature range, 160 - 325 K, with different energy resolutions. The data from all the three spectrometers were analyzed using a single consistent expression based on the relaxing cage model (RCM) for the translational and rotational dynamics. (cont.) A remarkable slowing down of the translational and rotational relaxation times has been observed. The behavior of shear viscosity j 7 or equivalently the structural relaxation time T of a supercooled liquid as it approaches the glass transition temperature is called 'fragile' if it exhibits non-Arrhenius character, such as that described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) law; otherwise, with q and obeying Arrhenius law, it is called 'strong'. The fragile behavior is typical to ionic and van der Waals systems. In contrast, a liquid being strong reflects that its structural makeup, to a large extent by strong (commonly covalent) bonds forming a network structure. Bulk water is considered as a fragile liquid at room temperature but for supercooled water, a 'fragile-to-strong' (F-S) transition at around 228 K has been proposed to occur at around 228 K, based on a thermodynamic argument. The F-S transition in a molecular liquid like water may be interpreted as a variant of kinetic glass transition predicted by the ideal Mode-Coupling Theory (MCT), where the real structural arrest transition is avoided by an activated hoping mechanism below the transition. Experiments at DCS and HFBS for water in MCM- 41 -S with 14 A pore diameter were also done under selective pressures, from ambient to 2400 bar. (cont.) We observe a clear evidence of a cusp-like F-S dynamic transition at pressures lower than 1600 bar. Here we show that the transition temperature decreases steadily with an increasing pressure, until it intersects the homogeneous nucleation temperature line of bulk water at a pressure of 1600 bar. Above this pressure, it is no longer possible to discern the characteristic feature of the F-S transition. The discussion part of this thesis concludes that the high-temperature liquid corresponds to the high-density liquid (HDL) of which the hydrogen bond network is not fully developed to conform a locally tetrahedral coordination, while the low-temperature liquid corresponds to the low-density liquid (LDL) of which the more open, locally 4 -coordinated, ice-like hydrogen bond network is fully developed. Identification of the end point of F-S transition with a possible second critical point is also discussed. by Li Liu. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Until a {{critical}} hydration level is reached, proteins do not function. This critical level of hydration {{is analogous to}} a similar lack of protein function observed for temperatures below a dynamical temperature range of 180 - 220 K that also {{is connected to the}} dynamics of protein surface water. Restoration of some enzymatic activity is observed in partially hydrated protein powders, sometimes corresponding to less than a single hydration layer on the protein surface, which indicates that the dynamical and structural properties of the surface water is intimately connected to protein stability and function. Many elegant studies using both experiment and simulation have contributed important information about protein hydration structure and timescales. The molecular mechanism of the solvent motion that is required to instigate the protein structural relaxation above {{a critical}} hydration level or transition temperature has yet to be determined. In this work we use experimental quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and molecular dynamics simulation to investigate hydration water dynamics near a greatly simplified protein system. We consider the hydration water dynamics near the completely deuterated N-acetyl-leucine-methylamide (NALMA) solute, a hydrophobic amino acid side chain attached to a polar blocked polypeptide backbone, as a function of concentration between 0. 5 M- 2. 0 M under ambient conditions. We note that roughly 50 - 60 % of a folded protein's surface is equally distributed between hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, domains whose lengths are on the order of a few water diameters, that justify our study of hydration dynamics of this simple model protein system. The QENS experiment was performed at the NIST Center for Neutron Research, using the <b>disk</b> <b>chopper</b> time of flight spectrometer (DCS). In order to separate the translational and rotational components in the spectra, two sets of experiments were carried out using different incident neutron wavelengths of 7. 5 {angstrom} and 5. 5 {angstrom} to give two different time resolutions. All the spectra have been measure at room temperature. The spectra were corrected for the sample holder contribution and normalized using the vanadium standard. The resulting data were analyzed with DAVE programs ([URL] The AMBER force field and SPCE water model were used for modeling the NALMA solute and water, respectively. For the analysis of the water dynamics in the NALMA aqueous solutions, we performed simulations of a dispersed solute configuration consistent with our previous structural analysis, where we had primarily focused on the structural organization of these peptide solutions and their connection to protein folding. Further details of the QENS experiment and molecular dynamics simulations are reported elsewhere...|$|R
