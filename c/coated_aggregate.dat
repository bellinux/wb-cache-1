40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professor Steven Cramer; Pages: 168. Specifications which {{limit the amount of}} fine material that adheres to coarse aggregates tend to be vague. For example, the Wisconsin state specifications require coarse aggregates used in portland cement concrete to be free of deleterious substances and adherent coatings; however, neither the washing procedure nor the desired end result of aggregate washing is specified. The purpose of this research was to identify which aggregate coatings in Wisconsin are deleterious and to determine what degree they affect concrete durability and strength. To this end, coarse aggregates containing surface coatings were collected throughout the state and characterized with the California cleanness test, methylene blue adsorption test, and x-ray diffraction. Based on the results of these tests, a subset of the sampled aggregates was selected to further study the effects of the coatings on concrete performance. It was hypothesized that coatings containing clay material are more deleterious than coatings containing either dust or carbonate material. The 10 -batch mixing plan tested coarse aggregates fiom three different sources and in the following three conditions: (1) <b>coated</b> <b>aggregates</b> that were sampled in the field, (2) washed aggregates that were washed in the laboratory to remove the existing coating, and (3) <b>coated</b> <b>aggregates</b> that were manufactured with dust and clay fines to increase the extent of the coating.

40|$|Preparation {{of double}} layered {{specimen}} at laboratory scale {{is important in}} evaluating the performance of bond strength between pavement layers since it is normally less costly. It however involved single face compaction at wearing course layer during the specimen preparation which raised potential skepticism over {{the quality of the}} layer compacted at single face only. This paper presents the properties of single face compacted porous asphalt (SFCPA) specimen compared to conventional double face compacted porous asphalt (DFCPA) specimen.

The permeability and abrasive loss were investigated for specimens fabricated at 3 thicknesses of 35 mm, 50 mm and 65 mm at an allowable limit of ± 1 mm. 50 blows compaction at each face according to PWD specification is adopted for DFCPA specimen, which resulted in compacting effort of 100 blows compaction for SFCPA specimen was applied for every thickness. For both tests, SFCPA possessed lower permeability and abrasive losses compared to DFCPA.

The PB used for modification according to wet process are 15 %, 20 %, 25 % and 30 % by weight of Optimum Bitumen Content (OBC). OBC of 4. 2 % was concluded for conventional asphalt mixtures. The stability and flow values of the conventional and modified Asphalt Mixture were compared. The average Stability of the modified Margalla asphalt mixtures when 15 % PB was used was much higher as compared to conventional asphalt mixtures. But when PB was used beyond 15 %, the Marshall stability showed a decreasing trend for Margalla aggregates, increasing trend for Karak aggregates and decreasing trend for Burhan aggregates. This decline in stability is attributed to a decline in interlocking of aggregates due to lubricating effect. The corresponding flow for the Modified asphalt mixtures first showed a decreasing trend for Margalla aggregates at 15 % PB modification but beyond 15 %, an increasing trend in flow as compared to conventional asphalt mixtures The decrease in flow or increase in Marshall Stability is attributed to improvement in interlocking and decline in flow or stability is attributed to a decline in interlocking offered by binder and PB <b>coated</b> <b>aggregate</b> particles in modified asphalt...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} investigate the properties of aggregate with a new cement coating applied, and to test the effect of including this aggregate in a bituminous road mixture. The investigation was divided into three main areas of study. They were, chemical and physical testing of the aggregate, and testing of a bituminous road mixture containing the modified aggregate, namely porous asphalt wearing course. Chemical testing involved a regime to show the affinity between coated and uncoated aggregates, and bitumen, in terms of adsorption, and desorption {{in the presence of}} water. Physical testing included all the common tests for demonstrating the advantageous properties of an aggregate. These tests included, the shear box test, the polished stone value test, the aggregate crushing value test and tests for surface roughness. Porous asphalt was chosen as a suitable road material for testing the effects of the modified aggregate on a bituminous material, as it is a stone matrix dependant mixture and is currently enjoying increased acceptance Europe wide as a driver friendly, high quality surfacing material. Tests applied included the repeat load axial, and the repeat load indirect tensile tests. In order to undertake large parts of the testing program, much of the equipment was constructed by the researcher at Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU). This included the shear box apparatus and the repeat load axial test apparatus. These were both designed to the relevant British standards and verified as being so.

The secondary aggregates, namely Croxden natural gravel aggregates, which is rejected by road engineers for use in road surfacing was upgraded with a specifically designed cement coating. Asphalt mixtures mechanical properties in terms of stiffness modulus, deformations and rutting were determined and analyzed using state-of-the-art laboratory test equipment and supported by technical literature from different information and resources. Three aggregate types were considered in this study; Arcow rock crushed aggregates(as a control aggregate), Croxden aggregate (as a secondary or low quality <b>aggregates)</b> and cement <b>coated</b> Croxden <b>aggregate</b> (as an upgraded material). One aggregate gradation was designed for all mixture types and the adopted aggregate gradation had a nominal maximum aggregate size (NMAS) of 14 mm. Two binder types were selected, 100 / 150 pen binder and 40 / 60 pen binder to represent the soft and hard binders respectively that are commonly used by road engineers. This research also documents a survey of literature review that led to the design of a novel machine that is eagerly needed by the pavement industry to boost the knowledge and understanding of real tyre-road interaction. Computer software, SOLIDWORKS, was used to create a 3 -dimentional model of the machine that was jointly named by the Highway Agency and Tarmac ltd., as Low Cost Asphalt Tasting Equipment (LoCATE). The machine was designed for use {{and for the first time}} to investigate the performance of the said mixtures under real traffic loading and environmental conditions and to correlate its results with those obtained using Repeated Load Indirect Tensile Test (RLIT) and Repeated Load Axial Test (RLAT), which were carried out at 10 °C, 20 °C, 30 °C and 45 °C. At an advanced stage of this research work and when the cost of fabricating LoCATE was found impossible to be met by LJMU, wheel tracking tests were done on the materials studied as a replacement of LoCATE and this part of the research program was achieved at Wolverhampton's bituminous testing laboratories in collaboration with Tarmac Ltd.

Soot aggregates were first numerically generated using the diffusion limited cluster aggregation algorithm to produce fractal aggregates formed by log-normally distributed polydisperse spherical primary particles in point-touch. These aggregates were then processed by adding {{a certain amount of}} primary particle overlapping and necking to simulate the soot morphology observed from transmission electron microscopy images. After this process, a layer of WAM coating of different thicknesses was added to these more realistic soot aggregates. The radiative properties of these <b>coated</b> soot <b>aggregates</b> over the spectral range of 266 - 1064 nm were calculated by the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) using the spectrally dependent refractive index of soot for four aggregates containing N-p = 1, 20, 51 and 96 primary particles. The considered coating thicknesses range from 0 % (no coating) up to 100 % coating in terms of the primary particle diameter. Coating enhances both the particle absorption and scattering cross sections, with much stronger enhancement to the scattering one, as well as the asymmetry factor and the single scattering albedo. The absorption enhancement is stronger in the UV than in the visible and the near infrared. The simple corrections to the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans fractal aggregates theory for uncoated soot aggregates are found not working for <b>coated</b> soot <b>aggregates.</b> The core-shell model significantly overestimates the absorption enhancement by coating in the visible and the near infrared compared to the DDA results of the coated soot particle.

Parameters measured for Phase I included: heat of hydration, maturity, and rheology tests were performed on the fresh paste samples, and compressive strength, degree of hydration, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging tests were conducted on the cured specimens. For Phases II and III tests included slump and air content on fresh concrete and compressive and tensile strengths, rapid air void analysis, and rapid chloride permeability on hardened concrete...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} selected {{findings from}} an experimental investigation that aimed {{to exploit the}} use of multidirectional carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) fabric as combined shear and flexural reinforcement in concrete beams. The results of the bond behaviour of rectangular prismatic concrete beams reinforced with three different CFRP fabric reinforcement configurations, a plain U-shaped channel, a U-shaped channel with <b>aggregate</b> <b>coating,</b> and a lipped U-channel section with intermittent closed loops, are presented. By considering the load response and the failure behaviour of the beams, it is shown {{that the use of}} an <b>aggregate</b> <b>coating</b> on internal and external surfaces of the CFRP channel ensured a better composite action between the CFRP reinforcement and the concrete than that between the plain CFRP channel and the concrete. On the other hand, provision of an anchorage system at the top end of the sides of the CFRP channel ensured a greater post-breakage capacity and a ductility compared to the beam with the plain CFRP channel. It is then shows that the use of U-shaped CFRP channels with <b>aggregate</b> <b>coating</b> and an anchorage system consisting of a lipped channel section with intermittent closed loops provided improved strength and ductility in concrete beams. The research output has potential to develop reinforcement systems for structurally optimised non-prismatic concrete geometries and also as permanent formwork/reinforcement in thin concrete members...|$|R

The long term performance of asphaltic pavements is {{highly dependent on}} the mechanical behaviour of the asphaltic mixture during construction (mixing and compaction) and operation; inadequate mixture compaction leads to faster moisture and oxygen diffusion, ravelling, rutting and poor fatigue life.

The Cable Creek Bridge is separately nominated to the National Register of Historic Places as a particularly prominent example of the style. The road surface is <b>coated</b> with red <b>aggregate</b> to continue the design theme.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the {{rehabilitation}} and improvements of road networks in Sri Lanka exhibited a rapid development. As a result many of roads were undergone for new asphalt surfacing with hot mix asphalt, {{at least a}} wearing course, and the black top. However, with this rapid development, few premature failures were also observed {{in many of these}} newly constructed asphalt roads covering all part of Sri Lanka. Pre-mature cracking, removal of top thin film of wearing layer, bleeding and localized failures were among them. Bitumen played a very important role in hot mix asphalt and improvement for bitumen can enhanced the improved properties of HMA significantly. In this research, instead neat 60 / 70 grade of bitumen, it was used modified 60 / 70 grade, with Nano silane, enhancing anti-stripping and bonding capabilities. Research was comprised three stages of testing, lab trials, plant trials and filed trial in Colombo- Kandy road section. Results showed significant improvement for marshal properties. The stability and flow increased by 24 % and 35 %, respectively. The anti-stripping property was also increased significantly, even after 6 hr, boiling test, it showed elevated no of <b>coated</b> <b>aggregates.</b> In addition, the mix was very well after few weeks, and very sticky condition proved that the strong bonding ability. All enhanced characteristics can be caused to exhibit improved performance and can be lead to extended life period of road construction...|$|R
