25|$|The {{simplest}} type {{of possible}} attack is the intercept-resend attack, where Eve measures the quantum states (photons) sent by Alice and then sends replacement states to Bob, prepared {{in the state}} she measures. In the BB84 protocol, this produces errors in the key Alice and Bob share. As Eve has {{no knowledge of the}} basis a state sent by Alice is encoded in, she <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> which basis to measure in, {{in the same way as}} Bob. If she chooses correctly, she measures the correct photon polarization state as sent by Alice, and resends the correct state to Bob. However, if she chooses incorrectly, the state she measures is random, and the state sent to Bob cannot be the same as the state sent by Alice. If Bob then measures this state in the same basis Alice sent, he too gets a random resultas Eve has sent him a state in the opposite basis—with a 50% chance of an erroneous result (instead of the correct result he would get without the presence of Eve). The table below shows an example of this type of attack.|$|E

500|$|Q. David Bowers said of {{the sudden}} passage of the {{legislation}} [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> what happened behind the scenes". Carothers wrote that Kasson had opposed nickel coinage, but nevertheless introduced the bill for it during the rush of {{the final day of}} the congressional session, [...] "There was no report and no explanation... The influences that brought about the passage of the measure in this fashion were never revealed." [...] Numismatic historian Don Taxay suggested that by March 3, 1865, [...] "the wide circulation of the bronze cent and two-cent piece had made a three-cent coin superfluous." ...|$|E

In 2014, Brice Ezell of PopMatters wrote that Kid A is [...] "more fun {{to think and}} write about {{than it is to}} actually listen to" [...] and [...] "far less compelling representation of the band's talents than The Bends and OK Computer". In 2016, Dorian Lysnkey wrote in the Guardian: [...] "At times, Kid A is dull enough to make you fervently wish that they’d merged the highlights with the best bits of the similarly spotty Amnesiac.

2500|$|The cantata was {{a highly}} {{successful}} genre in the early 18th century. The French cantata, which {{should not be confused}} with the Italian or the German cantata, was [...] "invented" [...] in 1706 by the poet Jean-Baptiste Rousseau and soon taken up by many famous composers of the day, such as Montéclair, Campra, and Clérambault. Cantatas were Rameau's first contact with dramatic music. The modest forces the cantata required meant it was a genre within the reach of a composer who was still unknown. Musicologists <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> at the dates of Rameau's six surviving cantatas, and the names of the librettists are unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Hermocrates {{is one of}} {{the persons}} {{appearing}} in Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias. Plato originally might have planned a third dialogue named Hermocrates, but failed to compose it. F. M. Cornford writes: [...] "Since the dialogue that was to bear his name was never written, we <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> why Plato chose him. It is curious to reflect that, while Critias is to recount how the prehistoric Athens of nine thousand years ago had repelled the invasion from Atlantis and saved the Mediterranean peoples from slavery, Hermocrates would be remembered by the Athenians as the man who had repulsed their own greatest effort at imperialist expansion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} swamp forests {{have almost}} entirely been removed as the plain {{has been converted}} to rice paddies, other agriculture, and urban areas like Bangkok. Much of the wildlife that once inhabited these plains has disappeared, including {{a large number of}} fish in the river systems, birds such as vultures, the Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae), the sarus crane (Grus antigone) and animals such as tigers, Asian elephants, Javan rhinoceroses, and the much-hunted Schomburgk's deer. Today we <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> at the original habitat and wildlife by comparing it with neighbouring countries. It is believed that the area [...] would have consisted of freshwater swamps inland and salty mangroves on the coast and the river estuaries. The swamp would have been covered in Phragmites marsh grasses. Today there is a small area of this remaining in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, a relic of the original landscape.|$|E
50|$|In 1696 Aurangzeb now {{commanded}} Bishan Singh {{to serve}} in his ruinous Deccan Wars - strange for an officer {{who had just been}} dismissed for failure in his appointed task. His real motive <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>guessed</b> from Bishan Singh's action. The Raja pleaded with and bribed Mughal officials, Aurangzeb's sons, and his favorite daughter Zinat-un-nissa, until the order was changed to a summons for his 7-year old son Jai Singh II.|$|R

50|$|Another {{interesting}} specific of {{the texts}} {{is that many of}} them have been written multiple times, for reasons that <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>guessed</b> at. Due to the previous copy being erased before a new copy is made, each repetition is written somewhat shifted compared to the previous copy. It is unknown whether the copies were made right after each other, or weeks, months or even years apart. Multiple copies of the same text make identifying false chains easier.|$|R
2500|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show theory of mind ability—or inability—in animals. Two examples serve as demonstration: first, Povinelli et al. (1990) presented chimpanzees with the choice of two experimenters from whom to request food: one who had seen where food was hidden, and one who, by virtue of one {{of a variety of}} mechanisms (having a bucket or bag over his head; a blindfold over his eyes; or being turned away from the baiting) does not know, and <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>guess.</b> They found that the animals failed in most cases to differentially request food from the [...] "knower". By contrast, Hare, Call, and Tomasello (2001) found that subordinate chimpanzees were able to use the knowledge state of dominant rival chimpanzees to determine which container of hidden food they approached. William Field and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh have no doubt that bonobos have developed ToM and cite their communications with a well known captive bonobo, Kanzi, as evidence.|$|E
2500|$|To add to {{the mystery}} {{surrounding}} the first American flag, experts <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>guess</b> the reason Congress chose stripes, stars, and the colors red, white, and blue for the flag. Historians and experts discredit the common theory that the stripes and five-pointed stars derived from the Washington family coat of arms. While this theory adds to Washington's legendary involvement {{in the development of}} the first flag, no evidence other than the obvious one that his coat of arms, like the Stars and Stripes, has stars and stripes in it exists to show any connection between the two. Washington was aware that [...] "most admire ... the trappings of elevated office," [...] but for himself claimed [...] "To me there is nothing in it." [...] However, he frequently used (for example, as his bookplate) his family coat of arms with three five-pointed red stars and three red-and-white stripes, on which is based the flag of the District of Columbia. The use of red and blue in flags at this time in history may derive from the relative fastness of the dyes indigo and cochineal, providing blue and red colors respectively, as aniline dyes were unknown.|$|E
2500|$|In 1687, {{he resumed}} his {{connection}} with the theatre by furnishing the music for Dryden's tragedy, Tyrannick Love. In this year, Purcell also composed a march and passepied called Quick-step, which became so popular that Lord Wharton adapted the latter to the fatal verses of Lillibullero; and in or before January 1688, Purcell composed his anthem Blessed are they that fear the Lord by express command of the King. A few months later, he wrote the music for D'Urfey's play, The Fool's Preferment. In 1690, he composed the music for Betterton's adaptation of Fletcher and Massinger's Prophetess (afterwards called Dioclesian) and Dryden's Amphitryon. During the first ten years of his mastership, Purcell composed much- precisely how much we <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>guess.</b> In 1691, he wrote the music for what is sometimes considered his dramatic masterpiece, King Arthur, or The British Worthy [...] In 1692, he composed The Fairy-Queen (an adaptation of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream), the score of which (his longest for theatre) was rediscovered in 1901 and published by the Purcell Society. The Indian Queen followed in 1695, in which year he also wrote songs for Dryden and Davenant's version of Shakespeare's The Tempest (recently, this has been disputed by music scholars), probably including [...] "Full fathom five" [...] and [...] "Come unto these yellow sands". The Indian Queen was adapted from a tragedy by Dryden and Sir Robert Howard. In these semi-operas (another term for {{which at the time}} was [...] "dramatic opera"), the main characters of the plays do not sing but speak their lines: the action moves in dialogue rather than recitative. The related songs are sung [...] "for" [...] them by singers, who have minor dramatic roles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>guessed</b> at, it seems {{unlikely}} to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the Luwians <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>guessed</b> at. A wide variety of {{suggestions}} exist, even today, which {{are connected to the}} debate over the original homeland of the Indo-European speakers: suggestions include the Balkans, the Lower Volga and Central Asia. Even then, little can be proved about the route that the ancestors of the Luwians took to end up in Anatolia. It is also unclear whether the separation of the Luwians from the Hittites and the Pala occurred in Anatolia or earlier.|$|R

This title {{is thought to}} be unique in England though again with {{uncertain}} origins. The pub is more commonly known as 'The Rag and Mop'; several of Whitwick's public houses developed nicknames, some of which - like The Rag and Mop - have origins which <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>guessed</b> at.

50|$|The u-stems {{descended from}} PIE nouns in -us, {{many of which}} were {{masculine}} nouns in -tus. They were formally parallel to the i-stems, but because of sound changes they had become a distinct class. They were less common than the i-stems overall, and appeared in all three genders, although neuter u-stems were likewise very rare. The masculine and feminine u-stems were declined the same, with a nominative singular in -uz. The neuters ended in -u, but since there are no neuter plurals attested their plural inflection <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>guessed.</b>|$|R
