Global {{seasonal}} {{forecasts of}} meteorological drought using the {{standardized precipitation index}} (SPI) are produced using two data sets as initial conditions: the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis (ERAI); and two seasonal forecasts of precipitation, the most recent ECMWF seasonal forecast system and climatologically based ensemble forecasts. The forecast evaluation focuses on the periods where precipita-tion deficits {{are likely to have}} higher drought impacts, and the results were summarized over different regions in the world. The verification of the forecasts with lead time indicated that generally for all regions the least reduction on skill was found for (i) long lead times using ERAI or GPCC for monitor-ing and (ii) short lead times using ECMWF or <b>climatological</b> seasonal <b>forecasts.</b> The memory effect of initial conditions was found to be 1 month of lead time for the SPI- 3, 4 months for the SPI- 6 and 6 (or more) months for the SPI- 12. Re-sults show that dynamical forecasts of precipitation provide added value with skills at least equal to and often above that of <b>climatological</b> <b>forecasts.</b> Furthermore, {{it is very difficult to}} improve on the use of <b>climatological</b> <b>forecasts</b> for long lead times. Our results also support recent questions of whether seasonal forecasting of global drought onset was essentially a stochastic forecasting problem.

From {{the perspective of}} drought quantification, knowledge of the land surface conditions is vital for determining the impacts a drought event is having on both the environment and society. Although such land surface information is essential for quantifying drought in real-time, the precise effect of land surface moisture deficits on future drought conditions is unknown. Forecasting of recovery from drought events is undoubtedly reliant on its intensity, yet the lead time at which a drought {{can be expected to}} recover is poorly understood. Due to this gap in knowledge, this study attempts to quantify the expected lead time for drought recovery, and the rate of drought recovery, by examining the loss of sensitivity to initial conditions within a <b>climatological</b> <b>forecast.</b> From this perspective, the expected recovery time from a specific drought event is quantified, based on a case study in the Upper Colorado River Basin in Southwestern USA for two initialization dates in years 2003 through 2008.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of forecasts to observations is evaluated using an ensemble approach with data {{drawn from a}} pseudo-operational ensemble Kalman filter. For Gaussian statistics and a forecast metric defined as a scalar function of the forecast variables, the effect of observations on the forecast metric is quantified by changes in the metric mean and variance. For a single observation, expressions for these changes involve a product of scalar quantities, which can be rapidly evaluated for large numbers of observations. This tech-nique is applied to determining <b>climatological</b> <b>forecast</b> sensitivity and predicting the impact of observations on sea level pressure and precipitation forecast metrics. The climatological 24 -h forecast {{sensitivity of}} the average pressure over western Washington State shows a region of maximum sensitivity {{to the west of}} the region, which tilts gently westward with height. The accuracy of ensemble sensitivity predictions is tested by withholding a single buoy pressure observation from this region and comparing this perturbed forecast with the control case where the buoy is assimilated. For 30 cases, there is excellent agreement between these forecast differences and the ensemble predictions, as measured by the forecast metric. This agreement decreases for increasing numbers of observations.

To this extent, an observational product of monthly mean temperature (E-OBS), as well as monthly time series of teleconnection indices (CPC, NOAA) for the period 1951 – 2010 are evaluated.

This study describes a systematic approach to selecting optimal statistical recalibration methods and hindcast designs for producing reliable probability forecasts on seasonal-to-decadal time scales. A new recalibration method is introduced that includes adjustments for both unconditional and conditional biases in the mean and variance of the forecast distribution, and linear time-dependent bias in the mean. The complexity of the recalibration can be systematically varied by restricting the parameters. Simple recalibration methods may outperform more complex ones given limited training data. A new cross-validation methodology is proposed that allows the comparison of multiple recalibration methods and varying training periods using limited data. Part I considers the effect on forecast skill of varying the recalibration complexity and training period length.

In this study, we analyze {{the performance of}} nine operational global ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) relative to climatology-based forecasts for 1 to 5 -day accumulated precipitation based on the monsoon seasons 2007 - 2014 for three regions within northern tropical Africa. To assess the full potential of raw ensemble forecasts across spatial scales, we apply state-of-the-art statistical postprocessing methods in form of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS), and verify against station and spatially aggregated, satellite-based gridded observations. Raw ensemble forecasts are uncalibrated, unreliable, and underperform relative to climatology, independently of region, accumulation time, monsoon season, and ensemble. Differences between raw ensemble and <b>climatological</b> <b>forecasts</b> are large, and partly stem from poor prediction for low precipitation amounts. BMA and EMOS postprocessed forecasts are calibrated, reliable, and strongly improve on the raw ensembles, but - somewhat disappointingly - typically do not outperform climatology.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{forecast of}} storm surge, the long wavelength sea level response to meteorological forcing, is imperative for flood warning purposes. There remain {{regions of the}} world where operational forecast systems have not been developed and in these locations it is worthwhile considering numerically simpler, data-driven techniques to provide operational services. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of a class of data driven methods referred to as rule based models to the problem of forecasting storm surge. The accuracy of the rule based model is found to be comparable to several alternative data-driven techniques, all of which result in marginally worse but acceptable forecasts compared with the UK's operational hydrodynamic forecast model, given the reduction in computational effort. Promisingly, the rule based model is considered to be skillful in forecasting total water levels above a given flood warning threshold, with a Brier Skill Score of 0. 58 against a <b>climatological</b> <b>forecast</b> (the operational storm surge system has a Brier Skill Score of up to 0. 75 for the same data set). The structure of the model can be interrogated as IF–THEN rules and we find that the model structure in this case is consistent with our understanding of the physical system. Furthermore, the rule based approach provides probabilistic forecasts of storm surge, which is much more informative to flood warning managers than alternative approaches. Therefore, the rule based model provides reasonably skillful forecasts in comparison with the operational forecast model, for a significant reduction in development and run time, and is therefore considered to be an appropriate data driven approach that could be employed to forecast storm surge in {{regions of the world}} where a fully fledged hydrodynamic forecast system does not exist, provided a good observational and meteorological forecast can be made...|$|E
40|$|The Limpopo Basin in {{southern}} Africa {{is prone to}} droughts which affect the livelihood {{of millions of people}} in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Seasonal drought early warning is thus vital for the whole region. In this study, the predictability of hydrological droughts during the main runoff period from December to May is assessed using statistical approaches. Three methods (multiple linear models, artificial neural networks, random forest regression trees) are compared in terms of their ability to forecast streamflow with up to 12  months of lead time. The following four main findings result from the study. 1. There are stations in the basin at which standardised streamflow is predictable with lead times up to 12  months. The results show high inter-station differences of forecast skill but reach a coefficient of determination as high as 0. 73 (cross validated). 2. A large range of potential predictors is considered in this study, comprising well-established climate indices, customised teleconnection indices derived from sea surface temperatures and antecedent streamflow as a proxy of catchment conditions. El Niño and customised indices, representing sea surface temperature in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, prove to be important teleconnection predictors for the region. Antecedent streamflow is a strong predictor in small catchments (with median 42  % explained variance), whereas teleconnections exert a stronger influence in large catchments. 3. Multiple linear models show the best forecast skill in this study and the greatest robustness compared to artificial neural networks and random forest regression trees, despite their capabilities to represent nonlinear relationships. 4. Employed in early warning, the models can be used to forecast a specific drought level. Even if the coefficient of determination is low, the forecast models have a skill better than a <b>climatological</b> <b>forecast,</b> which is shown by analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROCs).

In particular, in Chapter 2 we consider ensemble data assimilation using both a global dynamical model and <b>climatological</b> <b>forecast</b> error information, and, in Chapters 3 and 4, using both a global dynamical model {{and at least one}} higher-resolution limited-area dynamical model. Focus is given to applying data assimilation for atmospheric state estimation. Introductory material on ensemble forecasting is given in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, I first investigate how the forecast background-error climatology can be used to help improve state estimates, and subsequent forecasts initialized from those state estimates. ``Climatological perturbations'' derived from an estimate of the background-error covariance matrix are added to the dynamic ensemble that has been forecasted from the previous analysis time, enlarging the space of possible analysis increments. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional toy model test this method and illustrate that climatologically augmenting the dynamical forecast ensemble during the analysis has a positive impact on state estimation and forecast accuracy. Chapter 3 studies data assimilation that considers state information from various spatial scales. In practice, it is common for regional-scale weather forecasts to be created using limited-area atmospheric models which have relatively high spatial resolution. Limited-area model forecasts require lateral boundary conditions, which often come from a lower resolution forecast model (with different model physics) defined over a larger, often global, domain. Here I describe how data assimilation may be performed on a composite forecast state containing information from all available forecast models, and show results from numerical experiments that detail {{the benefits of}} this approach. Chapter 4 of this thesis explores forecast model bias, which is the result of uncertain, unknown or incorrect model physics. I adapt a strategy for correcting forecast model bias to use when performing data assimilation using the composite state method described in Chapter 3.

Climate diagnostics suggest that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation phenomenon is a main driver of interannual variability of seasonal precipitation in the basin. One-season (March–May) lead predictors of the seasonal precipitation are identified from the large-scale ocean–atmosphere–land system, including sea level pressures, sea surface temperatures, geopotential height, air temperature, and the Palmer Drought Severity Index. A nonparametric approach based on local polynomial regression is proposed for generating ensemble forecasts.

With this in mind, a wet-season onset date is defined based on the accumulation of rainfall to a predefined threshold, starting from 1 September, for each square of a 1 ° gridded analysis of daily rainfall across the region. Consistent with earlier studies, the interannual variability of the onset dates is shown to be well related to the immediately preceding July¿August Southern Oscillation index (SOI). Based on this relationship, a forecast method using logistic regression is developed to predict the probability that onset will occur later than the climatological mean date.

40|$|Since the {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system, small errors in the initial condition of any numerical weather prediction (NWP) model amplify as the forecast evolves. To estimate and possibly reduce the uncertainty of NWP associated with initial-condition uncertainty (ICU), ensemble forecasting has been proposed which is a method of, differently from the traditional deterministic forecasting, running several model forecasts starting from slightly different initial states. In this dissertation, the impact of ICU and short-range ensemble forecasting (SREF) on quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs), {{as well as on}} sea-level cyclone position and central pressure, is examined for a case of explosive cyclogenesis that occurred over the contiguous United States. A limited-area model (the PSU/NCAR MM 4) is run at 80 -km horizontal resolution and 15 layers to produce a 25 -member, 36 -h forecast ensemble. Lateral boundary conditions for the MM 4 model are provided by ensemble forecasts from a global spectral model (the NCAR CCM 1). The initial perturbations of the ensemble members possess a magnitude and spatial decomposition which closely match estimates of global analysis error, but they were not dynamically-conditioned. Results for 80 -km ensemble forecast are compared to forecasts from the then operational Nested Grid Model (NGM), a single 40 -km MM 4 forecast, and a second 25 -member MM 4 ensemble based on a different cumulus parameterization and slightly different initial conditions. Acute sensitivity to ICU marks ensemble QPF and the forecasts of cyclone position and central pressure. Ensemble averaging always reduces the rms error for QPF. Nearly 90 % of the improvement is obtainable using ensemble sizes as small as 8 - 10. However, ensemble averaging can adversely affect the forecasts related to precipitation areal coverage because of its smoothing nature. Probabilistic forecasts for five mutually exclusive, completely exhaustive categories are found to be skillful relative to a <b>climatological</b> <b>forecast.</b> Ensemble sizes of [...] , 10 can account for 90 % of improvement in probability density function. Our results indicate that SREF techniques can now provide useful QPF guidance and increase the accuracy of precipitation, cyclone position, and cyclone's central pressure forecasts.

40|$|Traditionally, navigation-related {{forecasts}} {{in central}} Europe cover short- to medium-range lead times {{linked to the}} travel times of vessels to pass the main waterway bottlenecks leaving the loading ports. Without doubt, this aspect is still essential for navigational users, but {{in light of the}} growing political intention to use the free capacity of the inland waterway transport in Europe, additional lead time supporting strategic decisions is more and more in demand. However, no such predictions offering extended lead times of several weeks up to several months currently exist for considerable parts of the European waterway network. This paper describes the set-up of a monthly to seasonal forecasting system for the German stretches of the international waterways of the Rhine, Danube and Elbe rivers. Two competitive forecast approaches have been implemented: the dynamical set-up forces a hydrological model with post-processed outputs from ECMWF general circulation model System 4, whereas the statistical approach is based on the empirical relationship ("teleconnection") of global oceanic, climate and regional hydro-meteorological data with river flows. The performance of both forecast methods is evaluated in relation to the <b>climatological</b> <b>forecast</b> (ensemble of historical streamflow) and the well-known ensemble streamflow prediction approach (ESP, ensemble based on historical meteorology) using common performance indicators (correlation coefficient; mean absolute error, skill score; mean squared error, skill score; and continuous ranked probability, skill score) and an impact-based evaluation quantifying the potential economic gain. The following four key findings result from this study: (1) as former studies for other regions of central Europe indicate, the accuracy and/or skill of the meteorological forcing used has a larger effect than the quality of initial hydrological conditions for relevant stations along the German waterways. (2) Despite the predictive limitations on longer lead times in central Europe, this study reveals the existence of a valuable predictability of streamflow on monthly up to seasonal timescales along the Rhine, upper Danube and Elbe waterways, and the Elbe achieves the highest skill and economic value. (3) The more physically based and the statistical approach are able to improve the predictive skills and economic value compared to climatology and the ESP approach. The specific forecast skill highly depends on the forecast location, the lead time and the season. (4) Currently, the statistical approach seems to be most skilful for the three waterways investigated. The lagged relationship between the monthly and/or seasonal streamflow and the climatic and/or oceanic variables vary between 1 month (e. g. local precipitation, temperature and soil moisture) up to 6 months (e. g. sea surface temperature).

The results indicate improved calibration of probabilistic and accuracy of point forecasts in comparison with the raw ensemble and <b>climatological</b> <b>forecasts.</b> The mixture EMOS model significantly outperforms the TN and LN EMOS methods, moreover, it provides better calibrated forecasts than the TN-LN combination model and offers an increased flexibility while avoiding covariate selection problems.

40|$|We have designed, developed, {{and tested}} {{a method for}} {{generating}} long-range forecasting systems for predicting environmental conditions at intraseasonal to seasonal lead times (lead times of several weeks to several seasons). The resulting systems use statistical, multimodel, and lagged average ensemble approaches. The ensemble members are generated by multiple regression models that relate globally distributed oceanic and atmospheric predictors to local predictands. The predictands are three tercile categorical forecast targets. The predictors are selected based on their long-lead correlations to the predictands. The models are selected based on their lagged average ensemble skill at multiple leads determined from cross-validated, multidecadal hindcasts. The main system outputs are probabilistic long-lead forecasts, and corresponding quantitative assessments of forecast uncertainty and confidence. Our forecast system development process shows a high potential for meeting {{a wide range of}} military and national intelligence requirements for operational long-lead forecast support. The main testbed for our system development was long-range forecasting of environmental conditions in Pakistan. This problem was selected based on DoD and national intelligence priorities for long-range support. For this test case, the system uses 81 ensemble forecast members that predict the probability of summer precipitation rates in north-central Pakistan up to six months in advance. The cross-validated hindcast results from the test case system are substantially more skillful than reference <b>climatological</b> <b>forecasts</b> at all leads. The test results also show that the combination of multiple forecast member predictions in a multimodel, lagged average ensemble approach yields more accurate forecasts than any one forecast member individually.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 The {{deterministic}} predictive {{skill of}} CFSv 2 is analyzed {{with respect to}} lead time and temporal averaging period. We also examine the spatial distributions of error and bias for synoptic-scale parameters and the impacts of ENSO on forecast skill. The errors in a small CFSv 2 ensemble forecast saturate at a lead time of approximately 3 and 5 weeks for Z 500 and CHI 200, respectively. Skill over <b>climatological</b> <b>forecasts</b> is restricted to lead times shorter than 2 weeks. SST, which evolves much more slowly over time, is skillfully predicted through {{the first month of}} the forecasts. Patterns of error and bias are robust across lead times and temporal scales, increasing in amplitude as lead time increases and temporal scale decreases. Several significant biases were found in the CFSv 2 reforecasts, such as too little convection over tropical land regions and too much convection over oceanic regions. Simulated tropical convection patterns and associated teleconnections degrade with forecast lead time. Large-scale tropical convection in CFSv 2 is more stationary than in reality. MJOs in the model propagate eastward too slowly and rarely traverse beyond the Maritime Continent. The wavenumber-frequency power spectrum for CFSv 2 tropical convection is, more so than analyzed/observed spectra, largely described by its background (red) spectrum, lacks distinct peaks for the MJO and Kelvin waves, and confirms the propagation issues noted above. These flaws in tropical convection, which may be tied to mean state biases originating from cumulus parameterization, affect atmospheric teleconnections and could thus degrade extended global forecast skill...|$|R
40|$|Solar flares produce {{radiation}} {{which can}} have an almost immediate effect on the near-Earth environment, making it crucial to forecast flares in order to mitigate their negative effects. The number of published approaches to flare forecasting using photospheric magnetic field observations has proliferated, with varying claims about how well each works. Because of the different analysis techniques and data sets used, it is essentially impossible to compare {{the results from the}} literature. This problem is exacerbated by the low event rates of large solar flares. The challenges of forecasting rare events have long been recognized in the meteorology community, but have yet to be fully acknowledged by the space weather community. During the interagency workshop on "all clear" forecasts held in Boulder, CO in 2009, the performance of a number of existing algorithms was compared on common data sets, specifically line-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity images from MDI, with consistent definitions of what constitutes an event. We demonstrate the importance of making such systematic comparisons, and of using standard verification statistics to determine what constitutes a good prediction scheme. When a comparison was made in this fashion, no one method clearly outperformed all others, which may in part be due to the strong correlations among the parameters used by different methods to characterize an active region. For M-class flares and above, the set of methods tends towards a weakly positive skill score (as measured with several distinct metrics), with no participating method proving substantially better than <b>climatological</b> <b>forecasts.</b> Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{models can}} provide {{reliable}} forecasts through {{the knowledge of}} the conceptual relationship between the predictand and predictors. An empirical model of monthly precipitation forecast (predictand) in South and Southeast Brazilian is presented in this paper, based on estimates of the variability of the Atlantic Ocean (OA) and Pacific Ocean (OP) sea surface temperature (SST) as predictors. The data sets of SST and precipitation were reduced in dimension: (a) A cluster analysis defined the monthly precipitation regions with homogeneous characteristics and (b) The rotated principal component analysis allowed to reduce the dimension of SST time series. The empirical model, based on linear regression analysis, was designed to forecast the average precipitation in homogeneous regions based on the time series of the scores of the principal components of SST as predictors. Lagged forecasts up to 4 months were performed. The results indicate similarities in the skill of the empirical model using SST modes with different lags. The SST scores constitute a robust set of predictors of the precipitation mainly over the SE Brazil, pointing out a significant contribution of modes with high amplitudes in the tropical and subtropical OP, completed by the SST variations in the subtropical belt of the South Atlantic. The positive extreme values of precipitation were under-estimated by the empirical model in all homogeneous regions. In the case of the South Region of Brazil the precipitation also are over-estimated. The annual cycle and the low frequency variations are well captured by the empirical model. The best performance of the model is obtained in the Southeastern region of Brazil. The empirical model forecasts are better than the <b>climatological</b> <b>forecasts</b> in all rain categories in the homogeneous regions. Pages: 517 - 52...|$|R

InMatei et al. (1), we demonstrated multiyearpredictability of monthly mean strength ofAtlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).
