This paper describes a new machine learning method based on ensembles of rules. Each rule consists of a <b>conjuction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small number of simple statements (“cuts”) concerning the values of individual input variables. These rule ensembles produce predictive accuracy comparable to the best methods. However their principal advantage lies in interpretation. Because of its simple form, each rule is easy to understand, as is its influence on the predictive model. Similarly, the degree of relevance of each of the respective input variables can be assessed. Graphical representations are presented {{that can be used to}} ascertain the dependence of the model jointly on the variables used for prediction. 1...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest {{in the development of}} mining algorithms for data streams. Dealing with concept drift {{is one of the major}} challenges researchers are faced with when designing these algorithms. We propose a framework for mining k-CNF-expressions from a data stream. A k-CNF expression is a logical formula in conjunctive normal form, i. e., <b>a</b> <b>conjuction</b> <b>of</b> disjunctive clauses. k-CNF expressions play an important role in Computational Learning Theory where it has been shown that they are PAC-learnable [1]. We can thus derive theoretical bounds on the number of examples needed to achieve a given accuracy (with a certain confidence). We believe that these results can be used to detect and quantify concept drift and help us in finding the optimal settings for a window-based approach (related to [2]). Another benefit of CNF-expressions is that they are easy to understand. We can see them as logical constraints that hold on the data. Because they are logical formulas, we can reason with them in order to understand the dynamics of the concept drift and predict these dynamics on a higher level. This poster presents an incremental algorithm for mining k-CNF expres-sions from a data stream.

40|$|Shortened) Sequences of {{spectra of}} the nova-like cataclysmic {{variable}} (CV) BZ Cam were acquired on 9 nights in 2005 - 2006 {{in order to}} study the time development of episodes of wind activity known to occur frequently in this star. We confirm past results that the P-Cygni absorption components of the lines mostly evolve from a higher expansion velocity to lower velocity as an episode progresses. We also commonly find blueshifted emission components in the Halpha line profile, whose velocities and durations strongly suggest that they are also due to the wind. We suggest that the progression from larger to smaller expansion velocities is due the higher velocity portions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wind concentration moving beyond {{the edge of the}} continuum light of the disk first, leaving a net redward shift of the remaining absorption profile. We also derive a new orbital ephemeris for BZ Cam, using the radial velocity of the core of the HeI 5876 AA line, finding P = 0. 15353 (4). Using this period the wind episodes in BZ Cam are found to be concentrated near inferior <b>conjuction</b> <b>of</b> the emission line source. This result confirms that the winds in nova-like CVs are often phase dependent, in spite of the puzzling implication that such winds lack axisymmetry. We argue that the radiation-driven wind in BZ Cam receives an initial boost by acting on gas that has been lifted above the disk by the interaction of the accretion stream with the disk, thereby imposing flickering time scales onto the wind events, as well as leading to <b>an</b> orbital modulation <b>of</b> the wind due to the non-axisymmetric nature of the stream/disk interaction.

40|$|The ten-year binary delta Sge (M 2 Ib-II+B 9. 5 V) is a zeta Aur binary {{containing}} an abnormally cool component. Combining {{our analysis}} of {{the system as a}} visual binary with Batten's radial-velocity solution leads to the following properties: i = 40 deg, a = 51 mas = 8. 83 A. U. = 1893 solar radius, hence d = 173 pc; M(sub B) = 2. 9 solar mass and M(sub M) = 3. 8 solar mass; and R(sub B) = 2. 6 solar radius and R(sub M) = 152 solar radius. This interpretation of the orbit places the M supergiant on the asymptotic giant branch. We have collected ultraviolet spectra throughout the star's 1980 - 90 orbit, concentrated around the <b>conjuction</b> <b>of</b> 1990. The wind of the M giant appears in these as narrow shell lines of singly ionized metals, chiefly Fe II, with P-Cyg profiles at many phases, which show the slow variation in strength expected for the orbit but no pronounced atmospheric eclipse. The terminal velocity of the wind is 16 - 18 km/s, and its excitation temperature is approximately 10, 000 K. Most of the broadening of the wind lines is caused by differential expansion of the atmosphere, with (unmeasurably) low turbulent velocities. Nontheless, the mass loss rate (1. 1 +/- 0. 4 X 10 (exp - 8) solar mas/yr) is almost the same as found previously by Reimers and Schroder for very different assumptions about the velocity structure. Also seen in the spectrum throughout the orbit are the effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variable, high-speed wind as well as evidence for accretion onto the B 9. 5 star. This high-speed wind absorbs in species of all ionization stages observed, e. g., C II, Mg II, Al III, SI IV, C IV, and has a terminaal velocity in the range 200 - 450 km/s. We presume this wind originates at the B dwarf, not the M supergiant, and speculate that it comes from an accretion disk, as suggested by recent models of magnetically moderated accretion. Evidence for accretion is redshifted absorption in the same transitions formed in the high-speed wind, as well as broad emission lines of singly ionized metals. This emission seems to be scattered out of the continuum of the B star. Finally, we discuss Auger ionization by accretion luminosity as the cause of the high ionization in these high-speed flows as well as the source of the extended circumstellar clouds of Si(3 +) and C(3 +) ions in zeta Aur binaries...|$|R

The hind flippers acted as hydrofoils, and the efficiency, thrust power and coefficient of thrust were calculated from unsteady wing theory. The propulsive efficiency was high at approximately 0. 85. The thrust power increased curvilinearly with velocity. The drag coefficient ranged from 0. 012 to 0. 028 and {{was found to be}} 2. 8 - 7. 0 times higher than the theoretical minimum. The drag coefficient was high compared with that of phocid seals examined during gliding or towing experiments, indicating an increased drag encumbered by actively swim-ming seals.

40|$|A trial {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{influence}} of the plant residue management in <b>conjuction</b> with application <b>of</b> different nitrogen sources on wheat yield and components, at the Agricultural Faculty of ShahidChamran University of Ahvaz during 2011 - 2012. The experimental design was splitplot at randomized completed block design arrangement. The main plot were different wheat residue management at three levels(residue moving, residue incorporated to the soil and burning) and the subplot were different nitrogen resources (control, 75 & 150 kg/ha urea, Supernitroplus biological fertilizer) SNBF and 75 kg/ha urea fertilizer+ SNBF. The result showed that the plant residues are able to improve the wheat yield and components. Whereas, in most traits, the residue burning increased and the residue moving deceased the most trait. The residue incorporated to the soil was the intermediate treatment. Although residue incorporated to the soil had the highest 1000 seed weight and harvest index and it had negative effect on biological yield. The highest grain yield (6. 6 tone/ha) and the lowest (2. 6 tone/ha) were obtained at Supernitroplus and residue removing treatment. Biological fertilizer application had negative effect and in most traits there was no significant different between biological fertilizer and no nitrogen application (Control). Whereas the application of biological fertilizer in combined with chemical fertilizer had positive effect and the highest seed number in spike and 1000 seeds was found at biological fertilizer in combined with chemical fertilizer...|$|R

40|$|I. Abstrak This {{research}} is entitled “Penggunaan Present Perfect Tense Bahasa Inggris oleh Siswa SMK Kesehatan Bakti Nusantara Gorontalo (Sebuah Analisis Kesalahan) ”. The objectives {{of this research}} are to identify and classify the errors made by students of SMK Kesehatan Bakti Nusantara Gorontalo and analyze them based on Ellis 2 ̆ 7 (1997) theory about error analysis. Ellis categorizes three types of errors in the learner 2 ̆ 7 s language namely omission, misinformation, and misordering. The writer used descriptive method in this research. The writer used a writing test consisting of present perfect tense material {{in order to get}} the data from the students. The data were collected from two classes of SMK Kesehatan Bakti Nusantara Gorontalo in Nursing 1 and Nursing 2 which have studied about present perfect tense. There were 21 students in each class who took the test. The results of this research show that there are several errors that students made in the use of present perfect tense. The errors are classified into omission, misinformation, and misordering. The errors of omission include omission of verb ending in regular verb, omission of the auxiliary verb have/has, omission of preposition since and for, and omission of subject. The errors of misinformation include misinformation of past participle form of regular verb, misinformation of past participle form of irregular verb, misinformation of the auxiliary verb have/has, misinformation of the preposition since and for and misinformation of object. The errors of misordering include misodering <b>of</b> have/has in <b>a</b> question, misordering <b>of</b> preposition since and for, misordering of adverb already and misordering <b>of</b> <b>conjuction</b> yet. This is research supports Ellis 2 ̆ 7 s (1997) theory about error analysis...|$|R
