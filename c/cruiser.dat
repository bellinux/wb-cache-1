On 13 August 1910 Duke of Edinburgh ran aground on Atherfield Ledge, Isle of Wight. She was successfully refloated, but in the resulting Court-martial to investigate the incident, the ship's Captain and Navigating Officer were severely reprimanded and the latter dismissed from the ship. She helped to rescue the survivors of the SS Delhi which ran aground off the coast of Morocco in December 1911. From 1913 to 1914 she served with the 1st <b>Cruiser</b> Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, Courageous was {{assigned}} to the 3rd Light <b>Cruiser</b> Squadron of the Grand Fleet. She became flagship of the 1st <b>Cruiser</b> Squadron near the end of 1916 when that unit was re-formed after most of its ships had been sunk at the Battle of Jutland in May. The ship was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917 by the addition of mine rails on her quarterdeck that could hold over 200 mines, but never laid any mines. In mid-1917, she received half a dozen torpedo mounts, each with two tubes: one mount {{on each side of the}} mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of the rear turret on the quarterdeck. On 30 July 1917, Rear-Admiral Trevylyan Napier assumed command of the 1st <b>Cruiser</b> Squadron and was appointed Acting Vice-Admiral Commanding the Light <b>Cruiser</b> Force until he was relieved on 26 October 1918.|$|E

5|$|Arriving {{back home}} in early 1890, Calliope was placed in reserve and {{remained}} there {{for the next seven}} years. In June 1897 the <b>cruiser</b> was present at Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee Review of the Fleet at Spithead. That same year Calliope became a tender to , an older and larger armoured <b>cruiser</b> used as seagoing training ship for boys. Calliope also was occasionally used as a training <b>cruiser,</b> and toured the Mediterranean from February to April in 1900, and again in March 1901, and March 1902. During the summer 1902 she undertook a training cruise in home waters May–June 1902 under the command of Captain E. D. St. A. Ommanney, visiting Campbeltown, Belfast Lough, Portishead, Dartmouth, Lyme Regis and Guernsey; before taking part in the Coronation Naval Review.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the treaty}} was signed, German {{soldiers}} had already entered {{the port of}} Klaipėda. Adolf Hitler, on board the <b>cruiser</b> Deutschland, personally toured the city and gave a short speech. The armada sailing to Klaipėda included the <b>cruiser</b> Admiral Graf Spee, the light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, and Köln, two destroyer squadrons, three torpedo boat flotillas, and one tender flotilla. At the time the Lithuanian navy had only one warship, the Prezidentas Smetona, a 580-ton converted minesweeper. While the Germans were celebrating {{the return of the}} city, European politicians expressed fears that the Free City of Danzig would be Hitler's next target.|$|E

5|$|By 1910, the Regia Marina {{had decided}} {{to dispose of the}} {{obsolescent}} <b>cruiser.</b> Rumors that year of a potential sale to the Ecuadorian Navy prompted Peru to buy the old French <b>cruiser</b> , though Ecuador did not end up purchasing Umbria. Instead, in December 1910, the Regia Marina sold Umbria to the Haitian Navy, but she did not arrive in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, until 13 June 1911. After the sale, the ship was renamed Consul Gostrück. The ship was rumored to be carrying Cipriano Castro, the deposed president of Venezuela, though they later proved to be false. A German captain, Willy Meyer, was hired to take command of the ship upon its arrival in Haiti, but due to the lengthy delays, he quit. The <b>cruiser</b> sank shortly after entering service because her crew was not experienced in handling the ship. Umbria was eventually raised and towed to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for disposal in 1913.|$|E

She became a cadet training ship in January 1908 and {{was assigned to the}} 4th <b>Cruiser</b> Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station. On 6 August 1911 Cornwall ran aground on Pinnacle Rock, off Cape Sable Island in Nova Scotia while assisting the protected <b>cruiser</b> , which had also run aground.

She is considered {{by some to be}} the world's first armoured <b>cruiser</b> and was intended to attack enemy merchant ships. The ship was named after the naval architect Henri Dupuy de Lôme. Dupuy de Lômes completion was delayed by almost two years by problems with her boilers, but she was finally commissioned in 1895 and assigned to the Northern Squadron (Escadre du Nord), based at Brest, for most of her career. The ship made a number of visits to foreign ports before she began a lengthy reconstruction in 1902. By the time this was completed in 1906, the <b>cruiser</b> was regarded as obsolete and Dupuy de Lôme was placed in reserve, aside from one assignment in Morocco.|$|E

The ship was completed on 22 March 1904 and was initially assigned to the 2nd <b>Cruiser</b> Squadron of the Channel Fleet. Essex was placed in reserve in March 1906 and suffered a six-inch gun explosion in July while training. She was recommissioned in September 1909 and assigned to the 4th <b>Cruiser</b> Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station.
