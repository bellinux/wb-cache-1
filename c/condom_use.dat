5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with their spouses. Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for natural family planning, and contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty. The Church's rejection of <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> is widely criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence of AIDS and HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of <b>condom</b> <b>use,</b> and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> alone.|$|E

5|$|This is {{believed}} to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is around 4–5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios, meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom-free by about 50%. <b>Condom</b> <b>use</b> also reduces the transmission risk significantly. <b>Condom</b> <b>use</b> is much more effective at preventing male-to-female transmission than vice versa. Previous HSV-1 infection may reduce the risk for acquisition of HSV-2 infection among women by a factor of three, although the one study that states this has a small sample size of 14 transmissions out of 214 couples.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS {{has had a}} {{great impact}} on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large {{economic}} impacts. There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact. The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including the Catholic Church's position not to support <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> as prevention. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Two {{hundred and}} seventy seven {{homosexual}} men participating in an AIDS study in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, were interviewed in July to December 1986 regarding {{their experiences with}} the <b>use</b> of <b>condoms</b> during anogenital intercourse. It appeared {{that in many cases}} the <b>condoms</b> <b>used</b> could not be described as reliable, or were not used safely. In 8 % (117 / 1468) of cases the condom tore or slipped off. When different condoms were compared, it was seen that "qualified" anal condoms functioned best. Other anal condoms functioned worse, and in many cases even worse than classic vaginal condoms. Whether these differences exclusively depended on differences in quality cannot be assessed. Men who buy a qualified anal condom are possibly more motivated and thus also less likely to have failures. Regarding the apparent unreliability of the <b>condoms</b> <b>used,</b> homosexual men are advised to refrain from anogenital intercourse. When this is not feasible, a qualified anal <b>condom</b> should be <b>used...</b>|$|R
5|$|Non-governmental {{organizations}} such as Population Services International (Malawi), an organization that strives to improve the health of Malawians, and Banja La Mtsogolo, an organization that distributes information and resources related to family planning, have conducted campaigns advertising <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> as an effective form of protection against HIV/AIDS. Banja La Mtsogolo provides condoms to both men and women, and has significantly improved the availability of condoms for women in particular. Because of efforts by Population Services International, Banja La Mtsogolo, and many other organizations, condoms have become more widely available to many people in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. <b>Condom</b> <b>use</b> decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
5|$|Consistent <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> {{reduces the}} risk of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
40|$|We {{estimated}} the HIV risk reduction {{that could be}} attained by using a rapid HIV home test (HT) to screen sexual partners versus <b>using</b> <b>condoms</b> in different proportions of anal intercourse (AI) occasions among {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM). Special attention was paid to the role of the window period during which infected cases go undetected. Our results show that if MSM engage in AI without condoms following a non-reactive HT result, they have lower chances of becoming infected by someone still in the window period than by following heuristics and <b>using</b> <b>condoms</b> inconsistently. For MSM who do not <b>use</b> <b>condoms,</b> <b>use</b> of HT as a screening device may be a useful risk reduction strategy. This advantage increases with higher HIV population prevalence. With higher HIV incidence, this strategy will not provide any advantage if <b>condoms</b> are <b>used</b> in as little as one out of four occasions...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} conducted {{in public schools}} in São Paulo city, Brazil, studied the awareness and use of emergency contraception (EC) and its possible implications on the <b>condoms</b> <b>use.</b> Among the 4929 students, 55. 6 % had already had sex, 19. 5 % had got pregnant and 7. 3 % had had abortions. <b>Condoms</b> were <b>used</b> by 88. 6 % and were options {{for those who did}} not have a steady relationship. The EC was used by 30. 3 % after a faulty condom usage, and by the older ones, with a steady part-ner. It is needed to be given contraceptive alternatives to reduce the risk and provide access to other contraceptives...|$|R

5|$|Programs {{encouraging}} sexual abstinence do {{not appear}} to affect subsequent HIV risk. Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor. Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior. A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV. Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> in those who test positive. It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the prev-alence of risk behaviors, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in clients of female sex workers, and to compare them with men selected from the general population. Study Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study of men re-cruited from commercial sex venues in Lima, Peru from January to February 2002. Subjects answered a survey and provided a urine sample. Results: Men reported that in the recently concluded commercial sex encounter, 95. 8 % <b>used</b> <b>condoms,</b> and 85. 8 % always <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> with female sex workers. Only 16 % reported always <b>using</b> <b>condoms</b> with their stable partners; 50. 8 % always <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> with casual, noncommercial partners; and 59. 6 % always <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> for homo-sexual anal sex.

50|$|From {{just before}} 1900 to the {{beginning}} of World War I, almost all <b>condoms</b> <b>used</b> in Europe were imported from Germany.

50|$|Over 80% of {{the workers}} had had sexual {{intercourse}} {{before the age of}} 19. 44.1% of the women previously had an abortion. 41.7% <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> all the time, 20.7% on occasion, and 36.5% reported that they never <b>used</b> <b>condoms.</b>|$|R
40|$|One hundred six {{black males}} {{completed}} a questionnaire concerning attitudes and {{knowledge about the}} <b>use</b> of <b>condoms</b> and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Of the 106 males in the study, 27 (26 %) reported that they "always" <b>used</b> <b>condoms,</b> 31 (29 %) did not <b>use</b> <b>condoms</b> and had low intentions of using them, and 48 (45 %) reported high intentions to <b>use</b> <b>condoms.</b> Results indicated that knowledge about AIDS was exceptionally high for black males in all three groups. Black males with low intentions to <b>use</b> <b>condoms</b> reported significantly more negative attitudes about the <b>use</b> of <b>condoms</b> (eg, <b>using</b> <b>condoms</b> is disgusting) and reacted with more intense anger when their partners asked about previous sexual contacts, when a partner refused sex without a condom, or when they perceived condoms as interfering with foreplay and sexual pleasure. A significantly larger percentage of low intenders were treated for gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, and genital warts than males in the other groups. Drug use did not differentiate the three groups, although marijuana was used more often by males in the low-intender group. Finally, {{a larger percentage of}} black males in the low-intender group reported experiences with anal intercourse and sex with a prostitute, but considered themselves at lower risk for AIDS than did their high-intender or steady-user counterparts...|$|R
25|$|Safe sex is sexual {{activity}} engaged in {{by people who}} have taken precautions to protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV.
