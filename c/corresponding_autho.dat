In particular, the use of quasivelocities in the analysis of symmetry that leads to unusual momentum conservation laws is investigated, as is the applications of these conservation laws and discrete symmetries to the qualitative analysis of nonholonomic dynamics.

Although {{nowadays}} inter-Korean {{trade is}} primarily shipped by sea, very limited {{attention has been}} paid to the specific role of maritime transport in inter-Korean relationships. Based upon a 20 -year database of daily vessel movements, this paper relates the changing geography of inter-Korean connections with the evolution of the North Korean economy and territory. Main results show the convergence between inter-Korean economic cooperation and shipping growth. South Korean ports also provide a logistics platform facilitating North Korea‟s transit trade with the rest of the world. The convergence or divergence between economic integration and hub dependence are discussed and provide a base for further research. 1 <b>Corresponding</b> <b>autho...</b>|$|E

Clearly, this simple route avoids the usage of traditional transition metal oxide substrates which have been suggested and used for stabilizing the planar structure for a long time. Considering the experimental success in the synthesis of N-GQDs and in the stabilization of Au nanoparticles on N-doped graphene, we expect our proposed method to stabilize planar structure will be realized experimentally and will be useful for industrial level applications.

We adapt here the standard approach to the dynamics of mechanical dissipative systems, in which the driving force, i. e. the gradient of the system’s Lagrangian function, is balanced against {{the rate of the}} dissipation function. In our case the driving force is the loss of the droplet’s free energy due to the increase of its base radius, while the dissipation occurs due to viscous flows in the core of the droplet and due to frictional processes {{in the vicinity of the}} advancing contact line, associated with attachment of fluid particles to solid. Within this approach we derive closed-form equations for the evolution of the droplet’s base radius, and specify several regimes at which different dissipation channels dominate.

However, in recent years a wealth of new datasets has become available. Therefore, we take a more data-centric approach and propose a unified framework for studying climate, with an aim towards characterizing observed phenomena as well as discovering new knowledge in the climate domain. Specifically, we posit that complex networks are well-suited for both descriptive analysis and predictive modeling tasks. We show that the structural properties of ‘climate networks ’ have useful interpretation within the domain. Further, we extract clusters from these networks and demonstrate their predictive power as climate indices. Our experimental results establish that the network clusters are statistically significantly better predictors than clusters derived using a more traditional clustering approach. Using complex networks as data representation thus enables the unique opportunity for descriptive and predictive modeling to inform each other. <b>Corresponding</b> <b>Autho...</b>|$|E

This exten-sion is obtained through the generalization of the estimated steepest descent—used in classic RSM—using ideas from interior point methods, especially affine scaling. The new search direction is scale independent, which is important for practition-ers since it avoids some numerical complications and problems commonly encoun-tered. Furthermore, this paper derives a heuristic that uses this search direction iteratively. The heuristic is intended for problems in which each simulation run is expensive and the computer budget is limited, so that the search needs to reach a neighborhood of the true optimum quickly. Moreover, although the heuristic is meant for stochastic problems, it can be easily simplified for deterministic ones. Numerical illustrations give encouraging results.

Recently, transport of massless Dirac fermions in the band of "topological" states has been demonstrated. States of the second type were predicted by Tamm and Shockley long ago. They do not have a topological background and are therefore strongly dependent on the properties of the surface. We study the problem of the conductivity of Tamm-Shockley edge states through direct transport experiments. Aharonov-Bohm magneto-oscillations of resistance are found on graphene samples that contain a single nanohole. The effect is explained by the conductivity of the massless Dirac fermions in the edge states cycling around the nanohole.
