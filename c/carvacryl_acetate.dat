40|$|The {{phytochemical}} {{investigation of}} both volatile and fixed metabolites of Clinopodium taxifolium (Kunth) Govaerts (Lamiaceae) was performed {{for the first}} time. It allowed the isolation and characterization of the essential oil and six known compounds: carvacrol (1), squalane (2), uvaol (3), erythrodiol (4), ursolic acid (5), and salvigenin (6). Their structures were identified and characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS), and corroborated by literature. The essential oil of the leaves was obtained by hydrodistillation in two different periods and analyzed by GC-MS and GC coupled to Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). A total of 54 compounds were detected, of which 42 were identified (including trace constituents). The major constituents were carvacrol methyl ether (18. 9 – 23. 2 %), carvacrol (13. 8 – 16. 3 %) and, <b>carvacryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (11. 4 – 4. 8 %). The antibacterial activities were determined as Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus. The hexane and methanol extracts exhibited activity only against Klebsiella pneumoniae (250 and 500 μg/mL respectively), while the ethyl acetate extract was inactive. The hypoglycemic activity was evaluated by the in vitro inhibition of α-glucosidase. The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract showed strong inhibitory activity with IC 50 = 24. 88 µg/mL, however methanolic and hexanic extracts showed weak activity. As a pure compound, only ursolic acid showed a strong inhibitory activity, with IC 50 = 72. 71 μM...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEpileptic syndromes {{are highly}} {{prevalent}} neurological conditions and {{can often be}} disabling. In order to find an alternative for treatment, this study evaluated anticonvulsant effects of <b>carvacryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (CA), a derivative of monoterpene carvacrol, after seizures induced by pilocarpine (P 400), picrotoxin (PIC) or pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). We also analyzed the CA effects on Na+, K+-ATPase and δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA-D) activities in hippocampus mice after seizures induced by P 400, PIC or PTZ. In addition, glutamate, δ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine and aspartate levels in mice hippocampus treated with CA after seizures induced by P 400, PIC or PTZ were also measured. CA produced anticonvulsant effects against seizures induced by P 400, PIC or PTZ, and its effects were reversed by flumazenil, suggesting that action mechanism can be mediated by GABAergic system. CA increased GABA levels, but did not alter glutamate and aspartate concentrations in mice hippocampus after seizures induced by P 400, PIC or PTZ when compared with seizures induced by P 400, PIC or PTZ (p< 0. 05), respectively, as well as decreased glutamine content in mice hippocampus after seizures induced by PIC when compared with seizures induced by PIC (p< 0. 05). In addition, CA also increased Na+, K+-ATPase and δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activities after seizures induced by P 400, PIC or PTZ when compared with seizures induced by P 400, PIC or PTZ (p< 0. 05), respectively. This study demonstrated that CA could be a future therapeutic option for treatment of epilepsy, with a multifactorial brain action mechanism...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStudies showing anxiolytic-like {{properties}} of natural products have grown. This paper evaluated if <b>carvacryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (CA) could be studied {{as an alternative}} drug to treat anxiety disorders. Elevated plus maze (EPM) tests, light-dark box (LDB) tests, and marble-burying tests (MBTs) were performed on mice. In the first protocol, the anxiolytic-like activities of CA 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg at single doses were compared {{to those of the}} vehicle, buspirone 5 mg/kg (BUSP) and diazepam 1 mg/kg (DZP). In the second protocol, the anxiolytic-like actions of CA were tested for GABAergic and serotonergic systems. The time spent in the open arms (TSOA) and the number of open arms entries (NOAE) were measured in EPM; the time spent in the light box (TSLB) and the number of entries to light box (NELB) were measured in LDB; and the number of marbles buried (NMB) were measured in MBT. CA increased TSOA and NOAE in the EPM, as well as TSLB and NELB in the LDB and the NMB in the MBT. The anxiolytic-like activity of CA 25; 50; 75 and 100 mg/kg was not associated with psychomotor retardation in the open field test and in the Rota rod test, contrarily with what happened with DZP. In the second protocol, to suggest the mechanism of action of CA, flumazenil 25 mg/kg ip (FLU) and WAY 100, 635 10 mg/kg ip (WAY– 5 -HT 1 A antagonist) were also used. FLU+CA 100 reduced TSOA in the EPM when compared to CA 100 but WAY+CA 100 did not. In LDB, FLU+CA 100 reduced the TSLB when compared to CA 100 but WAY+CA 100 did not. In the MBT, FLU+CA 100 inhibited the effect of CA 100 on the NMB but WAY+CA 100 did not. In conclusion, CA seems to have an anxiolytic-like effect, probably due to GABAergic agonist action, without psychomotor side effects...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCarvacrol is a {{compound}} isolated from some essential oils. It {{has been reported}} to possess anthelmintic activity. Acetylation of this monoterpene has been proposed as a potential way to reduce the toxicity and enhance the pharmacological effects of carvacrol. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of <b>carvacryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (CA) using in vitro and in vivo assays with gastrointestinal nematodes of small ruminants. The egg hatching test (EHT), larval development test (LDT) and adult worm motility (AWM) assessment were conducted to evaluate the effect of the acetylated product and pure carvacrol on Haemonchus contortus eggs, larvae and adults. The structural changes induced in adult H. contortus were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). CA and carvacrol acute toxicity was evaluated in mice. Finally, the efficacy of 250 mg/kg CA and 2. 5 mg/kg monepantel (positive control) were evaluated in 30 sheep naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes by the fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). In vitro tests were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by comparison with Tukey’s test. The efficacy was calculated by the Boot Street program using the arithmetic average. The number of eggs in feces (epg) of the groups were transformed to log (x+ 1) and subjected to ANOVA to compare differences among the groups by Tukey’s test. The level of significance was P< 0. 05. CA and carvacrol inhibited larval hatching by 89. 3 and 97. 7 % at doses of 8. 0 and 1. 0 mg/ml, respectively. At the concentration of 2 mg/ml, CA and carvacrol inhibited 100 % of larval development. At a concentration of 200 μg/ml, CA and carvacrol inhibited the motility of adult worms by 100 % and 58. 3 % at 24 h post-exposure, respectively. CA caused cuticle and vulvar flap wrinkling and bubbles to emerge from the tegument. Carvacrol caused more discreet effects on the cuticle and vulvar flap. The LD 10 and LD 50 of CA were 566. 7 mg/kg and 1544. 5 mg/kg, respectively. The LD 10 and LD 50 of carvacrol were 546. 8 mg/kg and 919 mg/kg, respectively. CA and monepantel reduced the epg of sheep by 65. 9 and 96. 4 %, respectively, at 16 days post-treatment. CA showed in vitro and in vivo anthelmintic activity and was less toxic than carvacrol...|$|E
