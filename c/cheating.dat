5|$|<b>Cheating,</b> where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs.

Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cheat</b> codes may {{sometimes}} produce unusual or interesting effects which don't necessarily make the game easier to play. For example, one <b>cheat</b> in Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis makes dinosaurs appear [...] "undead". Another example {{occurs in the}} game Dungeon Siege, where activating the <b>cheat</b> to extend the range of a bow also allows the enemies to fire at the same distance, thereby eliminating the advantage the <b>cheat</b> would have given. A <b>cheat</b> may even make the game harder to play; for instance, one could give the enemy special abilities, increase general difficulty, make neutral bystanders attack the player or grant the player a disadvantage such as low health points. <b>Cheats</b> in Grand Theft Auto games can make NPCs start rioting or wield weapons. In Grand Theft Auto III, the player can activate a <b>cheat</b> to enable blowing off the limbs of NPCs, a feature originally included in the game. Recently however, Rockstar Games has not included such violent or unusual <b>cheat</b> codes in its games, instead choosing to focus on <b>cheats</b> such as vehicle spawns, player effects (for example, invincibility) and weapon spawns.|$|R
