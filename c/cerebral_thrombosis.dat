5|$|In 1948, Hastings {{published}} his autobiography, simply titled The Autobiography of Sir Patrick Hastings, {{and the following}} year published Cases in Court, a book giving his views on 21 of his most noted cases. The same year he published Famous and Infamous Cases, a book on noted trials through history, such as those at Nuremberg. In early 1948, he suffered a small stroke which forced him to retire permanently from work as a barrister. On 11 November 1949, {{he and his wife}} travelled to Kenya, where their son Nicky had moved {{to start a new life}} after the end of the Second World War. While there, he suffered a second stroke due to the air pressure, and he never fully recovered. Hastings spent the next two years of his life living in a flat in London, before dying on 26 February 1952 of <b>cerebral</b> <b>thrombosis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although few {{patients}} with spontaneous intracranial hypotension develop <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis,</b> {{the association between}} these two entities seems too common to be simply a coincidental finding. We describe two cases of spontaneous intracranial hypotension associated with <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis.</b> In one case, extensive <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis</b> involved the superior sagittal sinus and multiple cortical cerebral veins. In the other case, only a right frontoparietal cortical vein was involved. Several mechanisms could {{contribute to the development}} of <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis</b> in spontaneous intracranial hypotension. When spontaneous intracranial hypotension and <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis</b> occur together, it raises difficult practical questions about the treatment of these two conditions. In most reported cases, spontaneous intracranial hypotension was treated conservatively and <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis</b> was treated with anticoagulation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine whether}} overweight/obesity is a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease in children. The study included 53 children with non–neonatal-onset <b>cerebral</b> sinovenous <b>thrombosis</b> or arterial ischemic stroke. The pre-valence of overweight/obesity was compared between this cohort and healthy children from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In addition, <b>cerebral</b> sinovenous <b>thrombosis</b> patients were compared to a group of matched hospitalized controls. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was significantly higher in the <b>cerebral</b> sinovenous <b>thrombosis</b> cohort (55 %), but not the arterial ischemic stroke cohort (36 %), relative to national controls (32 %; P. 04 and P. 81, respectively). Similarly, the prevalence of overweight/obesity was significantly higher in the <b>cerebral</b> sinovenous <b>thrombosis</b> cohort than in Colorado controls (25 %; P. 02). In conclusion, the prevalence of overweight/obese was significantly increased in <b>cerebral</b> sinovenous <b>thrombosis</b> patients as compared to both national and local controls. Results should be evaluated in a larger multi-institutional cohort...|$|R
40|$|Background: Thrombosis of the {{internal}} cerebral veins is a dangerous form of <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis</b> (CVT). Diagnosis: Bilateral thalamic involvement is frequently encountered in internal <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis,</b> because both thalami drain into the vein of Galen and straight sinus. However, unilateral thalamic edema has also been observed in cases of occlusion of the vein of Galen, possibly due to collateral venous drainage. Patients with unilateral congestion of the thalamus in <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis</b> had mostly left-sided involvement, indicating that right-sided unilateral thalamic involvement in <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis</b> may be clinically silent. Own Patients: We report on three patients with unilateral internal venous thrombosis, two on the left, one on the right. The right-sided thrombosis was clinically silent and a purely incidental finding...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose-Pregnancy is {{associated}} with increased risk of venous thrombotic events, including <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis.</b> We aimed to study the complications and outcome of subsequent pregnancies in women with previous <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis.</b> Methods-Follow-up study of women with acute <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis</b> at childbearing age included in a previously described cohort (International Study of Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis). Patients were interviewed by local neurologists to assess rate of venous thrombotic events, pregnancy outcomes, and antithrombotic prophylaxis during subsequent pregnancies. Results-A total of 119 women were included, with a median follow-up of 14 years. Eighty-two new pregnancies occurred in 47 women. In 83 % (68 of 82), some form of antithrombotic prophylaxis was given during at least 1 trimester of pregnancy or puerperium.

40|$|Background and Purpose-The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the incidence of adult <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis.</b> Methods-A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among all 19 hospitals located in 2 Dutch provinces serving 3. 1 million people. Adult <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis</b> cases diagnosed between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010, were identified using the Dutch financial coding system for hospital care and the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision. Medical records of potential patients were hand searched to identify <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis</b> cases. The Dutch National Bureau for Statistics provided population figures of the 2 provinces during 2008 to 2010. Results-Among 9270 potential cases, we identified 147 patients diagnosed with <b>cerebral</b> venous <b>thrombosis.</b> Of these, 53 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria; therefore, 94 patients were included in the analysis. The overall incidence was 1. 32 per 100 000 person-years (95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 61). Among women between the ages of 31 and 50 years, the incidence was 2. 78 (95 % CI, 1. 98 - 3. 82).

Approximately 50 % of these neonates showed clot extension or other complications on follow-up imaging that were obtained within 72 hours with either magnetic resonance imaging or computed topography. Five neonates were treated with anticoagulation, and none of these patients developed new infarcts or hemorrhages.
