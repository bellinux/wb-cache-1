Clear evidence was obtained for the competing two-phase coexistence of anti ferromagnetic charge-ordered (CO) and ferromagnetic (FM) phases that exhibit mesoscale phase separation below the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) at ~ 164 K. In addition, we observed some regions of mixed CO- and FM-domain contrast attributed earlier to formation of the new CO-FM phase. Using in situ heating/cooling TEM experiments, we interpret this effect as the interfacial wetting phenomenon inherent to the first-order CO-FM phase transition, {{rather than to the}} formation of new CO-FM phase. It is evidenced by the partial magnetic melting of CO phase at interfaces with the FM phase,thereby creating charge-disordered spin-glass metastates.

Our objective {{was to assess the}} potential biological availability of Co and the reactions and fate of soluble Co(II) after addition to soils with varying physical and chemical characteristics. A potential risk in quantifying exchangeable Co in soils using isotope dilution techniques is the possible presence of two species of Co in soil solution and adsorbed on soil solid phases [Co(II) and Co(III) ], coupled with the possibility that when an isotope of Co is added it may undergo a change in oxidation state during the measurement phase. In this study, we have utilized an isotope dilution technique with cation exchange and high-performance liquid chromatography−inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to determine the isotopically exchangeable <b>Co</b> <b>fraction</b> in several soils with varying characteristics such as differing Al, Fe, and Mn oxide content; pH; and organic carbon content.

The mean time scales involved are typically of order 104 s and the probability distribution shows two peaks over {{a large part of}} the bistable regime of this surface reaction. We use measurements of the resulting CO 2 rate as well as photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM) to characterize these rare transitions. From our dynamic data we can extract probability distributions for the CO 2 rate. We use x–t plots from PEEM measurements to describe the transitions, which are–as we demonstrate–characterized by one wall moving through the field of view in PEEM measurements. The resulting probability distributions for the CO 2 rate are shown to depend strongly on the value, Y, of the <b>CO</b> <b>fraction</b> in the reactant flux inside the bistable regime. We find that the probability distribution is strongly asymmetric indicating that the two basins of attraction are rather different in depth and width. This is also concluded from the PEEM measurements, which show in one case a rather sharp and narrow domain wall going one way, while it is rather wide and diffuse for the motion in the opposite direction. To have two basins of attraction in the bistable regime, which are rather different in nature is reminiscent of other bistable systems such as, for example, optical bistability, although the time scales involved in the present system are entirely different...|$|E

All of the models also predict the same CO-to-H 2 conversion factor, to within a factor of a few. However, when we look more closely at the details of the CO distribution, we find larger differences.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of WC-VC-Co and WC-Co thermal spray powders and coatings of equal <b>Co</b> mass <b>fractions</b> {{has led to}} a new quantitative insight into some of the processes occurring during coating deposition and to an explanation of the difference in abrasion resistance between WC-VC-Co and WC-Co coatings. In both materials, during coating deposition the WC grains acquire a less angular morphology and a finer mean size than in the powders and a significant fraction of WC grains is decarburized, with the formation of W 2 C and Co 6 W 6 C. Changes in the morphology of the (W,V) C grains could not be detected on account of their typical irregular shape, but their mean size also decreased. The outer surfaces of the carbides grains, therefore, dissolve in the Co at the high deposition temperatures and no re-precipitation on the un- dissolved grains occurs during cooling because of the very high cooling rate. As a result, a fraction of W, V and C remains in solution in the Co, although it is difficult to measure because the Co composition in the coatings varies from point to point. The higher abrasion resistance of the WC-VC-Co coatings relative to WC-Co coatings of equal <b>Co</b> mass <b>fraction</b> is attributed mainly to the finer WC grain size in the WCVC-Co coatings (even when starting from equal grain size in the powders), the lower <b>Co</b> volume <b>fraction</b> (due to the density of (W,V) C being lower than the density of WC) and the presence of the (W,V) C grains, which, on account of their hardness and fine size, are not only resistant to abrasion but also to fracture...|$|R
40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}}, CLC, is a combustion concept with inherent {{separation of}} CO 2. The fuel and combustion air are kept apart {{by using an}} oxygen carrier consisting of metal oxide. The oxygen carriers {{used in this study}} were prepared from commercially available raw materials by spray-drying. The aim {{of the study was to}} subject the particles to long-term operation (> 1000 h) with fuel and study changes in particles, with respect to reactivity and physical characteristics. The experiments were carried out in a 10 -kW chemical-looping combustor operating with natural gas as fuel. 1016 h of fuel operation were achieved. The first 405 h were accomplished using a single batch of NiO/NiAl 2 O 4 -particles. The last 611 h were achieved using a 50 / 50 mass-mixture of (i) particles used for 405 h, and (ii) a second batch of particles similar in composition to the first batch, but with an MgO additive. Thus, at the conclusion of the test series, approximately half of the particles in the reactor system had been subjected to > 1000 h of chemical-looping combustion. The reason for mixing the two batches was to improve the fuel conversion. Fuel conversion was better with the mixture of the two oxygen carriers than it was using only the batch of NiO/NiAl 2 O 4 -particles. The <b>CO</b> <b>fraction</b> was slightly above the equilibrium fraction at all temperatures. Using the oxygen-carrier mixture, the methane fraction was typically 0. 4 - 1 % and the combustion efficiency was around 98 %. The loss of fines decreased slowly throughout the test period, although the largest decrease was seen during the first 100 h. An estimated particle lifetime of 33000 h was calculated from the loss of fines. No decrease in reactivity was seen during the test period...|$|E
40|$|Chemical-looping {{combustion}}, CLC, {{is a novel}} combustion concept with inherent {{separation of}} CO 2. This study evaluates the performance of spray-dried nickel-based oxygen carrier particles prepared from commercially available materials. The possibility to optimize the methane conversion while retaining the oxygen transport capacity by mixing different NiO-based oxygen carriers was evaluated and results showed that such optimization was indeed possible. Experiments were carried out in a batch reactor {{as well as in}} a continuous 300 -W unit. Experiments in the batch reactor evaluated the performance of two different spray-dried particles, individually and mixed, at two different temperatures, 850 °C and 950 °C. The reference particle, referred to as N-VITO in this study, contained only NiO and NiAl 2 O 4 while the other spray-dried particle was similar to the reference but contained a small amount of MgO as additive in the starting material. It was found that the reference particle had good oxygen-transport characteristics, but that methane conversion left room for improvement. The particle with MgO addition, on the other hand, showed excellent methane conversion, but poor oxygen transport capability, especially at the lower temperature. The 50 / 50 mass-mixture of the two particles resulted in a potent oxygen-carrier batch with the desired qualities. Three experimental series were conducted in the 300 -W CLC-unit; (i) using only the reference particle, (ii) using a mixture of the reference particle and the particle with MgO-addition, and (iii) using the previous mixed oxide system together with a small quantity of a high-surface impregnated oxygen-carrier based on NiO and Al 2 O 3. It is shown that the methane conversion to CO 2 is dependent primarily on the solids flux in the reactor system, but also on the temperature in the fuel reactor. Results showed that the operation was more stable and {{that it was possible to}} obtain better fuel conversion when the mixtures of two or three different oxygen carrier particles were used. With these mixtures, the methane fraction could be brought down to < 0. 1 % while still maintaining a low <b>CO</b> <b>fraction...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} use of 14 CO measurements to constrain hydroxyl radical (OH) {{concentrations in the}} atmosphere is investigated. 14 CO is mainly produced in the upper atmosphere from cosmic radiation. Measurements of 14 CO at the surface show lower concentrations compared to the upper atmospheric source region, {{which is the result}} of oxidation by OH. In this paper, the sensitivity of 14 CO mixing ratio surface measurements to the 3 -D OH distribution is assessed with the TM 5 model. Simulated 14 CO mixing ratios agree within a few molecules 14 CO cm − 3 (STP) with existing measurements at five locations worldwide. The simulated cosmogenic 14 CO distribution appears mainly sensitive to the assumed upper atmospheric 14 C source function, and to a lesser extend to model resolution. As a next step, the sensitivity of 14 CO measurements to OH is calculated with the adjoint TM 5 model. The results indicate that 14 CO measurements taken in the tropics are sensitive to OH in a spatially confined region that varies strongly over time due to meteorological variability. Given measurements with an accuracy of 0. 5 molecules 14 CO cm − 3 STP, a good characterization of the cosmogenic 14 <b>CO</b> <b>fraction,</b> and assuming perfect transport modeling, a single 14 CO measurement may constrain OH to 0. 2 – 0. 3 × 10 6 molecules OH cm − 3 on time scales of 6 months and spatial scales of 70 × 70 degrees (latitude×longitude) between the surface and 500 hPa. The sensitivity of 14 CO measurements to high latitude OH is about a factor of five higher. This is in contrast with methyl chloroform (MCF) measurements, which show the highest sensitivity to tropical OH, mainly due to the temperature dependent rate constant of the MCF–OH reaction. A logical next step will be the analysis of existing 14 CO measurements in an inverse modeling framework. This paper presents the required mathematical framework for such an analysis...|$|E

The seasonal cycle of <b>CO</b> 2 mole <b>fraction</b> is damped with elevation. While the amplitude of the seasonal cycle is 28. 5 μmol mol − 1 at 10 m above the ground, it is only 10. 7 μmol mol − 1 in the layer of 2500 – 3000 m corresponding to the lower free atmosphere above the well-mixed boundary layer. The maximum mole fraction in the layer of 2500 – 3000 m can be observed around 25 March on average, two weeks ahead of that of the marine boundary layer reference (GLOBALVIEW). By contrast, close to the ground, the maximum <b>CO</b> 2 mole <b>fraction</b> is observed late December, early January. The specific seasonal behavior is attributed to the climatology of vertical mixing of the atmosphere in the Carpathian Basin...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{relationship}} between the local blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) signals caused by neural stimulation (fBOLD) and the global BOLD signals induced by hypercapnia (hBOLD) has not been fully investigated. In this study, we examine whether fBOLD is modulated by hBOLD signals, by means of experiments using a relatively wide range of inhaled carbon dioxide (CO 2) for a long duration of 5 minutes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were recruited, each undergoing 6 separate experiments by inhaling gas mixtures with different <b>fractions</b> of <b>CO</b> 2 (room air, 3 %– 7 %). Each experiment contained 3 phases, prehypercapnic, hypercapnic, and posthypercapnic, during which boxcar visual stimulus was given. The local fBOLD signals were measured from areas showing activation patterns highly correlated with the visual stimulus paradigm, whereas the global hBOLD signals were measured from areas showing no visual activations. Percentage changes in fBOLD during transient-state hypercapnia and steady-state hypercapnia were both investigated in response to varying degrees of hypercapnic perturbations. RESULTS: The hBOLD signals increased with increase of inhaled <b>CO</b> 2 <b>fractions.</b> The duration for the hBOLD signals to reach steady state prolonged with increase of inhaled <b>CO</b> 2 <b>fractions.</b> Normalize...|$|R
