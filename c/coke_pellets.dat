40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} simulation procedure for analyzing hydrogen, oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} gases injections mixed with pulverized coals within the tuyeres of blast furnaces. Effective use of H 2 rich gas is highly attractive into the steelmaking blast furnace, considering the possibility of increasing the productivity and decreasing the specific {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} becoming the process less intensive in carbon utilization. However, the mixed gas and coal injection is a complex technology since significant changes on the inner temperature and gas flow patterns are expected, beyond to their effects on the chemical reactions and heat exchanges. Focusing on the evaluation of inner furnace status under such complex operation a comprehensive mathematical model has been developed using the multi interaction multiple phase theory. The BF, considered as a multiphase reactor, treats the lump solids (sinter, small <b>coke,</b> <b>pellets,</b> granular coke and iron ores), gas, liquids metal and slag and pulverized coal phases. The governing conservation equations are formulated for momentum, mass, chemical species and energy and simultaneously discretized using the numerical method of finite volumes. We verified the model with a reference operational condition using pulverized coal of 215  kg per ton of hot metal (kg thm− 1). Thus, combined injections of varying concentrations of gaseous fuels with H 2, O 2 and CO 2 are simulated with 220  kg thm− 1 and 250  kg thm− 1 coals injection. Theoretical analysis showed that stable operations conditions could be achieved with productivity increase of 60 %. Finally, we demonstrated that the net carbon utilization per ton of hot metal decreased 12 %...|$|E
30|$|An {{optical image}} was {{obtained}} by a microscope (Leica DM 4500 P) from which a reflected image of a polished <b>coke</b> <b>pellet</b> is converted to an electronic image through a camera. The amplitude of the electrical pulses of the electronic image {{is a function of}} the light intensities of grey levels, determined by the reflectance of the different phases in the optical image. An analogue of the electronic image is transmitted to a discriminator, which contains a densitometer where the image is divided into a matrix of approximately 400, 000 picture points on a hexagonal point raster. Each of these points consists of an electrical signal. The densitometer divides the amplitudes of the electrical signal into intervals of grey level bands on a grey scale with 100 intervals. The grey spectrum is adjustable according to the brightness of the image. Operations such as stage movement, data processing, measurement of variable field data are done automatically (Fig.  3 b).|$|R

Different <b>pellet</b> compositions were prepared by changing the percentage of Dela ore, lime and coke and thereafter firing them under different temperatures {{with the aim of}} obtaining required physical properties enabling its subsequent reduction to metallic iron. Reducibility of pellets at different temperatures were done by the packed coke bed crucible method developed by the authors, for those pellets which satisfied the required porosity and compression strength parameters. By observing the micro structure of specimen before reduction and after packed bed reduction, the quality of the pellets so produced was assed. This method may be adopted in the lab as a relatively cheap method to study reducibility of iron ores...|$|R
30|$|Reliable and {{representative}} characterization of {{those aspects of}} coke structure that are pertinent to some coke quality consideration {{can be achieved by}} means of reflected light microscopy coupled with a computerized image analysis system. Special care should be taken for sampling of <b>coke</b> sample for <b>pellet</b> preparation and its polishing. The industrial significances of these measurements in this relationship to such coke properties are strength and reactivity. Coke’s porous structure is a function of both the materials carbonized and the conditions of carbonization and aim of this work was to determine the qualitative influence of some of these factors with a view to use such data for the specific structural characterization. The nature of the coal charge is obviously a major factor in determining the coke structure and in general, low rank high volatile coals with sufficient fluidity to ensure that all components are fused together tend to produce high porosity cokes.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{simultaneous}} {{injection of}} pulverized coal and charcoal {{in the blast}} furnace has recently received remarkable attention due to its potential to decrease the coke consumption and increase productivity. This paper is focused on modeling the simultaneous injection of pulverized coal and charcoal into the blast furnace through the tuyeres with oxygen enrichment. This model treats the blast furnace as a multi-phase reactor and six phases are considered simultaneously, namely: gas, lump solids (lump iron ore, sinter, <b>pellets,</b> <b>coke</b> and small coke), hot metal, molten slag, pulverized coal and charcoal. Conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy and chemical species are solved simultaneously based on the finite volume method. The model is validated with a base case of actual operation using 215 kg/thm of pulverized coal injection and afterwards mixed injection of coal and charcoal are simulated for injection rate of 250 kg/thm. Model {{results indicated that the}} productivity of the blast furnace could be increased up to 25 % with simultaneous injection combined with oxygen enrichment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Mathematical {{model for}} a pilot scale iron ore pellet {{induration}} furnace has been developed which considers the process of induration including the reactions of limestone, magnetite and coke. The differential equations of energy, mass and momentum are solved simultaneously. The profiles of temperature, pressure and concentration are obtained. Performing separate experiments on sub processes; drying, firing and cooling have checked {{the validity of the}} model. At first, a mixture of iron ore is selected and then the percentage of limestone is changed. The maximum metallization and fired pellet strength with minimum sticking vs. basicity is obtained. In the next stage the percentage of coke in iron ore is altered and all of physical and chemical property of the pellets are measured. Finally, the optimum percentage of coke in the iron ore is determined. By using different percentage of <b>coke</b> in the <b>pellet</b> the experiments are performed in three conditions. In the first condition, inlet gas temperature is decreased alone. In the second condition, inlet gas temperature and total indurtion time are decreased together and in the third condition, in addition to above conditions, oxygen injection t...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{reaction}} rate and the morphology of intermediate reaction products during iron ore reduction when iron ore and carbonaceous materials are agglomerated together with or without Portland cement. The reaction was performed at high temperatures, and used small size samples in order to minimise heat transfer constraints. Coke breeze and pure graphite were the carbonaceous materials employed. Portland cement was applied as a binder, and pellet diameters were in the range 5. 6 - 6. 5 mm. The experimental technique involved the measurement of the pellet weight loss, {{as well as the}} interruption of the reaction at different stages, in order to submit the partially reduced pellet to scanning electron microscopy. The experimental temperature was in the range 1423 - 1623 K, and the total reaction time varied from 240 to 1200 s. It was observed that above 1523 K the formation of liquid slag occurred inside the pellets, which partially dissolved iron oxides. The apparent activation energies obtained were 255 kJ mol(- 1) for <b>coke</b> breeze containing <b>pellets,</b> and 230 kJ mol(- 1) for those pellets containing graphite. It was possible to avoid heat transfer control of the reaction rate up to 1523 K by employing small composite pellets. FapespCNP...|$|R
40|$|In blast furnaces, {{particles}} like <b>coke,</b> sinter and <b>pellets</b> enter from {{a hopper}} and are distributed on the burden surface by a rotating chute. Such particulate flows suffer occasionally from chocking and particle segregation at bottlenecks, which hinders efficient throughflow. To {{get a more}} fundamental insight into these effects, we started a combined experimental and numerical program to investigate such particulate flows. For this purpose we employ discrete particle model simulations of granular monodisperse and bidisperse particles flowing down inclined rotating chutes. In these simulations, non-inertial effects due to rotation are implemented through Coriolis and centrifugal forces. A rolling resistance model is also implemented to study {{the effect of a}} non-spherical shape of the particle. In addition, a granular chute flow set-up has been constructed for experimental validation of the model. Different measurement techniques will be used to measure the solid fraction, particle velocity, granular temperature and bed height in the chute, which are compared with the results from discrete particle model simulations. The influence of polydispersity, non-uniformity of particles, rotation speed and angle of inclination of the chute will bestudied. Here we present results obtained from preliminary simulations for the averaged particle velocity, bed height and granular temperature along the length of chute for different rotation speeds. We find an interesting interplay between the Coriolis force, which pushes the granular flow to the sidewall of the chute and decelerate the flow, and centrifugal forces that accelerate the flow...|$|R
40|$|In blast furnaces, {{particles}} like <b>coke,</b> sinter and <b>pellets</b> enter from {{a hopper}} and are distributed on the burden surface by a rotating chute. Such particulate flows suffer occasionally from particle segregation during transportation caused by differences in density or size. To {{get a more}} fundamental insight into these effects, we started an experimental study to investigate the effect of rotation on such particulate flows. Here, as a first step, we present an experimental study of granular flow of monodisperse 3 mm spherical glass particles flowing with a constant mass rate through a rotating smooth rectangular chute, which is inclined at a fixed angle. Experiments are performed for a sufficiently long time to study steady (but streamwise accelerating) flow. Particle image velocimetry (PIV), electronic ultrasonic height sensors, and a dynamic weighing scale are {{used to measure the}} surface velocity of the particle stream, the particle bed height and mass flow rate in the chute, respectively. The influence of rotation speed and angle of inclination of the chute is studied. We find an interesting interplay between the Coriolis force, which pushes the granular flow to the sidewall of the chute and tends to diminish the acceleration of the flow, and centrifugal forces that accelerate the flow. The velocity components display a complex dependence on the spanwise and streamwise position in the chute. The bed height in the chute is also influenced by these effects of system rotation. These measurements provide a well-defined set of observations for refining and validating computer simulations of granular flows, and point out some important limitations of physical experiments. We present preliminary three-dimensional discrete particle simulations, which show that the experimental measurements of bed height and surface particle velocity in a chute inclined at 30 ° can be predicted nearly quantitatively both without and with rotation of the chute...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{industries}} in this world are now producing iron, either by the root of directly or indirectly. India is now not only producing iron ore pellets but also exporting it to other countries. Use of iron ore pellets not only increase the productivity of the plant but also produce good quality iron. So {{it is essential to}} know about the various factors which affect the reducibility of the iron ore pellet. In our project we aim at studying the effect of size of iron ore pellet on its reduction kinetics {{and in the course of}} our experimentation we aim at arriving at particular pellet size that gives both increases in productivity and decrease <b>coke</b> rate. <b>Pellets</b> are approximately spherical lumps formed by agglomeration of the crushed iron ore fines in presence of moisture and binder, on subsequent induration at 1300 °C. In these times with the areas of iron ore use increasing, it is very important to use raw materials that not only increase the productivity of plant but also produce a better quality iron. Blast furnace raw materials have changed in character greatly in the last 2 or 3 decades. Formerly, they used to be raw iron ores, raw lime stone and coke. There are now being increasingly being replaced by pre fluxed sinter and pellets and liquid and gaseous fuels. Few examples of revolutionary changes brought to the present day iron making industries by use of pellets are Essar steel, TATA steel, Jindal Steel etc. Reduction of various sizes of iron ore pellets were carried out with non coking coal in a stainless steel reactor of size 10 * 5 cm. The stainless steel reactor was half filled with non coking coal powder of size - 72 # and the weighed oven dried pellet was placed centrally on this non coking coal powder bed and then the remaining portion of the reactor was filled with coal powder then it was covered with an air tight cover having a hole for escape of gases. The reactor was introduced into a muffle furnace and soaked there for 1 hour. The reactor was then cool inside the muffle furnace up to 1500 C and then taken out and cooled in air and weight loss was calculated by electronic balance and hence % of reduction was calculated as [(Weight loss in iron ore pellet X 100) / (Total initial O 2 present in iron ore pellet with iron) ] We can conclude that as we increase the size of iron ore pellet, this results in decrease in the reducibility of iron ore pellets. The most optimal size range for reducibility to be effective in industrial application is 10 mm to 20 mm...|$|R
