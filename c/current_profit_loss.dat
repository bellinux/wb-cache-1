40|$|This study {{examines}} whether International Financial Reporting Standard IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (IAS 8) {{is used to}} engage in opportunistic reporting practices by Australian companies. IAS 8 requires prior period errors to be amended retrospectively by restating the comparatives as if the error had never occurred (International Accounting Standards Board, 2009). Hence, the impact of any prior period errors is shown through retained earnings rather than being included in the <b>current</b> period’s <b>profit</b> or <b>loss.</b> Managers could use this treatment for prior period errors as a method for manipulating current period earnings. If this is the case, then characteristics that have been shown in prior research to predict the presence of earnings management should also be associated with prior period error corrections that adjust prior earnings...|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} {{a failure}} of the market to price the implications of a <b>current</b> <b>loss</b> (<b>profit)</b> for a future <b>loss</b> (<b>profit).</b> In a 120 -day window following the quarterly earnings announcement date, a portfolio of firms with extreme <b>losses</b> (<b>profits)</b> exhibits a - 6. 58 percent (3. 55 percent) abnormal return. These patterns in stock returns translate into an annualized return of approximately 21 percent on a hedge portfolio that takes a long position in an extreme profit firm quintile and a short position in an extreme loss firm quintile. The results also demonstrate that this loss/profit anomaly is incremental to, and more pronounced than previously documented accounting-related anomalies. In an effort to explain this finding, we show that this mispricing is related to differences between conditional and unconditional probabilities of losses/profits, as if stock prices do not fully reflect conditional probabilities in a timely fashion. A battery of sensitivity tests shows that this loss/profit anomaly is robust to alternative risk adjustments, distress risk, short sales constraints, transaction costs, and sample periods. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective – The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the profit distribution method applied in Islamic banks in Indonesia and to propose better method in order to improve sharia risk compliance. Methods – Employing a descriptive quantitative method and literature review. This paper evaluate weaknesses of the <b>current</b> <b>profit</b> distribution method and proposes daily revenue index to solve the problems arising from using current method which is unfairness between bank and customers. Results – By the two <b>current</b> <b>profit</b> distribution methods which use monthly revenue index calculated only at the end of the month, there are potential injustices occur. Therefore, instead of using monthly index, daily index is proposed. There are two steps in calculating profit distribution by using daily revenue index: (1) Accumulating Source of Fund (SoF), Reserve Requirement (RR), and Source of Fund after Reserve Requirement (SoFaRR), and (2) Determining Average Financing (AF), Revenue Index (RI), Cost Index (CI), Revenue Sharing Index (RSI), and Profit Sharing Index (PSI). Conclusion - Daily revenue index will solve the unfairness problems arise from <b>current</b> <b>profit</b> distribution method applied in Islamic banks. Daily revenue index is also applicable if Islamic banks apply <b>profit</b> and <b>loss</b> sharing instead of revenue sharing. </p...|$|R

40|$|On February 25, 2010, the Court of Justice {{rendered}} {{its decision}} in the X Holding case. 2 The Court ruled that the Dutch tax consolidation regime {{is compatible with the}} freedom of establishment. The territoriality principle justifies the limitations on the regime’s scope of application in an intra-EU context. With its ruling, the Court basically followed the opinion of Advocate General (hereinafter: ‘AG’) Kokott, she delivered on November 19, 2009. Kokott advocated the position that the Dutch tax consolidation regime may generally be regarded as being compatible with the freedom of establishment (at least {{to the extent that it}} entails that an aggregation of <b>current</b> business <b>profits</b> and <b>losses</b> realized by resident and non-resident group companies is impossible). Accordingly, today, it seems clear that the Dutch tax consolidation regime in its current design may be kept in place.

If the <b>profit</b> <b>loss</b> is small then near rationality may be claimed even if the hypothesis of rationality is statistically rejected. An application to Indian manufacturing is presented, which suggests that rationality cannot be rejected and that the profit function is remarkably flat around the optimum. This is consistent with positive effort returns to increasing the wage beyond its efficient level. Keywords: efficiency wages, near-rationality, panel data, India...|$|R

For this purpose, a PBUC model has been developed and utilized, using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Simulations are {{used to determine the}} relationship between the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of a certain price forecast and the <b>loss</b> of <b>profit,</b> for four different types of power plants. A Combined Cycle (CC) power plant and a pumped storage unit show highest sensitivity to incorrect forecasts. A price forecast with a MAPE of 15 %, on average, yields 13. 8 % and 12. 1 % <b>profit</b> <b>loss,</b> respectively. A classic thermal power plant (coal fired) and cascade hydro unit are less affected by incorrect forecasts, with only 2. 4 % and 2. 0 % <b>profit</b> <b>loss,</b> respectively, at the same price forecast MAPE. This paper further demonstrates that if price forecasts show an average bias (upward or downward), using the MAPE as measure of the price forecast might not be sufficient to quantify <b>profit</b> <b>loss</b> properly. <b>Profit</b> <b>loss</b> in this case has been determined as a function of both shift and MAPE of the price forecast...|$|R
