5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners.</b> Each of its crossflow cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E

30|$|Figure  4 {{also shows}} that the {{lubrication}} oil film between <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> and piston ring can be qualitative characterized by the variation of contact resistance values between them. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> and piston ring {{are mainly composed of}} metallic materials. Electric will generated by the friction of the CLPR. Since the lubrication oil is weak conductive, if the contact resistance was used to measure the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> and piston ring during the test, for the same-type of lubrication oil, when the contact resistance value increased, it indicated that the lubrication oil and film thickness between the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> and piston ring became sufficient and thick and vice versa.|$|R
25|$|For 2011, the Shelby GT500 {{received}} significant performance enhancements {{and other}} upgrades. Arguably {{the most important}} of the GT500's upgrades is a new aluminum engine block for the car's supercharged 5.4L DOHC V8, replacing the cast-iron block used previously. The block's cylinder bores are coated with an iron and iron oxide composite that is applied with Plasma Transferred Wire Arc (PTWA) technology, which was developed jointly by Ford and Flamespray Industries (www.flame-spray.com). The developers of PTWA received the IPO 2009 National Inventor of the Year award. The coating allows for the replacement of traditional cast-iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> and marks Ford's first use of this process. Between this and the use of lighter-weight aluminum for the engine block, the new block is 102lbs lighter than the previous cast-iron version, contributing to a reduction in the overall weight of the GT500 compared to the 2010 model. Thanks to the new liner coating, which has friction-reducing characteristics, and a revised exhaust, horsepower production from the 5.4L V8 has increased slightly for a total of @6200rpm. The combination of the lighter engine, EPAS, and aerodynamic enhancements result in an improvement in fuel efficiency for the 2011 GT500 relative to the 2010 model that eliminates the car's gas guzzler tax.|$|E
500|$|To {{meet the}} {{increasing}} demand for Merlin engines, Rolls-Royce started building work on a new factory at Crewe in May 1938, with engines leaving the factory in 1939. The Crewe factory had convenient road and rail links to their existing facilities at Derby. Production at Crewe was originally planned to use unskilled labour and sub-contractors with which Hives felt {{there would be no}} particular difficulty, but the number of required sub-contracted parts such as crankshafts, camshafts and <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> eventually fell short and the factory was expanded to manufacture these parts [...] "in house".|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of articulated connecting rods {{was regarded as}} a [...] "nuisance" [...] by Arthur Rubbra, a Rolls-Royce engine designer, as there were inherent problems with the arrangement. The complicated geometry meant that a pair of rods had different effective lengths, giving a longer stroke on the articulated side; consequently the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> on that side had to be lengthened to prevent the lower piston ring from running out of the cylinder skirt. Articulated rods were used in the Goshawk engine, but were not embodied in the later Rolls-Royce Merlin, for which Arthur Rowledge had designed a revised blade and fork system.|$|E

30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{lubricant}} film characteristic between <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> and piston ring provides a key comparable parameter to evaluate the performance of CLPR. Various methods have been implemented to measure the oil film thickness [25]. Dearlove et al. [26] simultaneously measured mid-stroke lubricant film thickness using the Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and friction force in a single piston ring-floating liner. Mills et al. [27] applied the technique of Ultrasonic Sensing in IC engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> applications by mounting elements to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner.</b> Other methods such as capacitative [28], induction [29] also have been used to measure the oil film thickness between <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> and piston ring.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the tribological performance through investigating protective additive layer and friction coefficient and implementing the quantitative wear measurements on the rubbed surface of the sliding pairs. The specimens of oil ring were rubbed against cast iron engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> under boundary lubrication conditions. The ring and liner surfaces were examined by optical, scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. The elemental analysis of surfaces was performed by using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Surface observations showed that coating was removed from the ring surface.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{simulations}} {{already exist}} {{to model the}} piston ring–cylinder liner contact; however, very few models {{have been used to}} investigate the optimum surface texture. An axi-symmetric, time-dependent two-dimensional semi-deterministic texture-roughness model of the piston ring to <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> contact with periodic boundary conditions and mass preserving global cavitation has been developed. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> texture, generated by honing, was con-sidered deterministically on the global scale, after an investigation comparing deterministic and homogenized solutions. The surface texture of a real <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> was measured with white light interferometry and an algorithm developed to generate an artificial periodic texture representative of the real sur-face. The effect of <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> plateau roughness has been incorporated on the local scale by homogenization of the Reynolds equation and calculation of flow factors from real surface topog-raphy. Using the homogenization technique to incorporate the effect of surface roughness leads to a more efficient solution than mesh refinement of the deterministic problem as the roughness {{does not need to be}} resolved on the global solution domain, allowing for significantly less degrees of freedom in the global problem. The lubricant boundary pressures have been calculated using results from a numerical ring-pack model and the lubricant viscosity has been adjusted based on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> wall temperature. It was found from the result of a comparison between deterministic and homogenized solutions that surface texture should be modelled on the global and not on the averaged roughness scale as is the case with many previous investigations...|$|R
40|$|In an {{automotive}} powertrain system, the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} critical components which possesses the intricate structural configurations coupled with complex pattern of various operational loads. This paper attempts to develop a concrete and practical procedure for the optimization of <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> distortion for achieving future requirements regarding exhaust emissions, fuel economy, and oil consumptions. First, numerical calculation based on finite element method (FEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is performed to capture the mechanism of <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> distortion under actual engine operation conditions. Then, a spectrum analysis approach is developed to describe the distribution characteristic of operational loads (thermal and mechanical) around the circumference of a distorted cylinder bore profile; the FFT procedure provides an efficient way to implement this calculation.
