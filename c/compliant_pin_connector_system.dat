50|$|A {{general rule}} is that DCE devices provide the clock signal (internal clocking) and the DTE device synchronizes on the {{provided}} clock (external clocking). D-sub connectors follow another rule for pin assignment. DTE devices usually transmit on <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 2 and receive on <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 3. DCE devices are just the opposite: <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 2 receives and <b>pin</b> <b>connector</b> number 3 transmits the signals.|$|R

40|$|For decades, tin-lead {{has been}} used as the primary surface finish for <b>compliant</b> <b>pins</b> and plated through holes (PTH) of printed circuit board (PCB) in {{press-fit}} connections. Therefore, most test results on press-fit performance are focused on the tin-lead finishes for the connections. Due to the discontinuation of the use of lead in electric and electronic components, the trend of using lead-free manufacturing for PCB’s and connectors is being vigorously pursued by the industry. The present study is intended to evaluate press-fit connections using various lead-free finishes on <b>compliant</b> <b>pins</b> and PTH’s and then compare to tin-lead finish. The lead-free finishes for the <b>compliant</b> <b>pins</b> are plated with matte and bright pure tin, and the lead-free finishes for the PTH’s are electroplated Au, OSP, and immersion tin, Au, and Ag finishes. In the design of experiments (DOE) of the current study, single pin tests were used to obtain the DOE outputs of insertion and retention forces for eye-of-the-needle (EON) <b>compliant</b> <b>pins</b> in PTH’s. For all three EON finishes (two pure tin and one tin-lead), the DOE results show that finished PTH size is the most important factor to determine the insertion force. The insertion force is a strong inverted linear function of finished PTH size (i. e., a larger force is required for a smaller finished PTH size). The impact from pin installation/repair cycle is the second factor behind the finished PTH size. The finishes of EON and PTH are only minor factors for the insertion force. In contrast to the insertion force, the retention force is rather flat regarding the finished PTH size. The DOE results also indicate the EON finish is ranked as the number one factor to affec...|$|R

50|$|The rotor basket had {{two sets}} of connectors, two with 26 pins and two with 10 pins, at each end that mated with the main assembly. Both 26 <b>pin</b> <b>connectors</b> were {{connected}} to the keyboard to enable the switching of the signal direction through the rotors. Both 10 <b>pin</b> <b>connectors</b> on each side were hard-wired with each other. If a signal that entered {{on one of the}} 26 pins left the rotor pack on one of these 10 pins, that signal was redirected back into the rotors on the entry side to perform a new pass through the rotors. This loop-back, the so-called re-entry, created complex scrambling of the signal and could result in multiple passes through the rotor pack, depending on {{the current state of the}} rotor wiring.|$|R
