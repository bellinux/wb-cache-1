40|$|Introduction: Newly {{constructed}} earth {{channels and}} steep {{cut and fill}} slopes on construction projects need temporary protection from water erosion until a protective cover of vegetation can be grown. In some instances the temporary protective measures can be left in position to serve {{as part of the}} permanent system. Various kinds of vegetative and <b>chemical</b> <b>mulches</b> are available for use as temporary control measures, and other materials such as jute, fiberglass roving, and excelsior blanket are also in use. However, for large volumes of flow and for high velocities, more substantial materials are required. One class of such materials is referred to as ECRM, or Erosion Control and Revegetation Mats. These are designed primarily for use on steep slopes and in drainage channels where high velocities of flow are encountered, and where mulches are not effective. Mirafi engineers, in cooperations with 3 M Company, have developed an ECRM called Miramat, which is a flexible, three-dimensional web of bonded binyl monofilaments. Since commercial introduction, it has gained rapid market acceptance, but more information was desired on its performance capabilities and limitations. The objective {{of the present study was}} to conduct performance tests in the laboratory of two ECRMs, Miramat and Enkamat. one measure of the protective ability of such material is the flow velocity it can withstand before excessive erosion occurs. The determination of this permissible velocity was one of the objectives of these tests...|$|R

Mulches included 1 -year-old hardwood sawdust, 5 -year-old hardwood sawdust, and 1 -year-old pine needle mulch. Herbicide adsorption (Kd values) of the samples was determined for diuron, terbacil, and simazine. The soils, mulches, and interfaces adsorbed nearly 10 times as much diuron and {{more than twice as much}} simazine as terbacil. Adsorption of the herbicides was three to five times greater to the mulches than to the soils. Adsorption was significantly correlated with the organic matter content of the mulch. Adsorption was not related to herbicide solubility.

40|$|Tasmanian tree dieback seems largely {{caused by}} {{prolonged}} drought, although agricultural activity, noisy miners and possums cannot be totally absolved from blame. Tasmanian woody plant thickening has {{been attributed to}} either the cessation of burning or the cessation of grazing. In a study area in the northern Midlands tree cover is shown to have increased between 1968 and 2002 where it was initially sparse, and to have decreased where it was initially dense. This pattern is attributed to the combined effects of less frequent burning and prolonged drought in the period, compared to earlier decades. Increases in woody plant cover can lead to changes in woody plant composition, with eucalypt dieback more likely where wattles, she-oaks and prickly box thicken. Although cultivation before planting or direct seeding helps in tree establishment, ripping and breaking up of the soil column have the opposite effect. There is evidence showing that successful planting or seeding of trees has been aided by the use of any two of post-planting <b>chemical</b> weed control, <b>mulching</b> and more than one watering. The use of stakes and guards in plantings appears irrelevant to their success...|$|R
40|$|This {{synthesis}} of post-fire treatment effectiveness reviews {{the past decade}} of research, monitoring, and product development related to post-fire hillslope emergency stabilization treatments, including erosion barriers, <b>mulching,</b> <b>chemical</b> soil treatments, and combinations of these treatments. In the past ten years, erosion barrier treatments (contour-felled logs and straw wattles) have declined in use and are now rarely applied as a post-fire hillslope treatment. In contrast, dry mulch treatments (agricultural straw, wood strands, wood shreds, etc.) have quickly gained acceptance as effective, though somewhat expensive, post-fire hillslope stabilization treatments and are frequently recommended when values-at-risk warrant protection. This change has been motivated by research that shows the proportion of exposed mineral soil (or conversely, the proportion of ground cover) {{to be the primary}} treatment factor controlling post-fire hillslope erosion. Erosion barrier treatments provide little ground cover and {{have been shown to be}} less effective than mulch, especially during short-duration, high intensity rainfall events. In addition, innovative options for producing and applying mulch materials have adapted these materials for use on large burned areas that are inaccessible by road. Although longer-term studies on mulch treatment effectiveness are on-going, early results and short-term studies have shown that dry mulches can be highly effective in reducing post-fire runoff and erosion. Hydromulches have been used after some fires, but they have been less effective than dry mulches in stabilizing burned hillslopes and generally decompose or degrade within a year...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Soil Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. This study forms {{part of an}} ARC Nietvoorbij {{research}} project on the long-term effect of different groundcover management practices in vineyards. This study concentrated on the root distribution of the vines after different groundcover practices were used for one decade. The vineyard on the research farm of the Agricultural Research Council at Robertson, South Africa, was divided into 56 equally distributed trail blocks, 14 treatments with four replicas each. For the study Chardonnay cultivar on 99 Richter rootstock was used. This study concentrated on only eight treatments. The eight different cover crop practices consisted of the mechanical treatment, <b>chemical</b> treatment, straw <b>mulch</b> treatment, permanent cover crop treatment and four annual cover crop treatments. The annual cover crop treatments consisted of triticale cover crop that was sprayed with an herbicide before bloom, a triticale cover crop that was left to die naturally, a grazing vetch cover crop that was sprayed with an herbicide before bloom and a grazing vetch cover crop that was left to die naturally. The vineyard was established in November 1992 while the different treatments started in April 1993. Root studies were conducted during the 2002 / 2003 season. In this study the auger method {{was used to determine}} root density (mm/cm³).

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that {{recruitment}} of Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata is facilitated by shrubs, in particular by the non-dominant evergreen shrub Euclea racemosa subsp. schimperi, both in open grazing land and protected areas. A series of experiments was carried out in Central Tigray to identify the critical processes in O. europaea regeneration that make E. racemosa shrubs better recruitment foci than other shrubs or open areas. Movement from open field to open field caused by runoff is the only form of secondary dispersal of olive seeds. Post-dispersal seed predation is limited and concentrated in narrow strips (< 1 m) along stone bunds, independent of shrubs. <b>Mulch</b> <b>chemical</b> properties have no significant effect on germination. However, seeds under E. racemosa are two times more likely to germinate than seeds under Acacia etbaica or in the open field. Dense crowns and better physical mulch properties offer higher moisture availability and a better protection against desiccation. Seedlings below E. racemosa have a higher survival rate and vitality compared to seedlings in the open field. Seedling survival rate did not differ significantly under Euclea and Acacia shrubs. Goats actively feed on O. europaea seedlings while cattle only induce trampling. Seedlings are better protected against goat browsing under shrubs than in the open field. E. racemosa and A. etbaica offer equal protection. These results suggest that O. europaea regeneration is subject to passive and active facilitation in the germination stage leading to the conclusion that initial recruitment patterns are defined by disperser-mediated facilitation rather than herbivore-mediated recruitment limitation. Efforts to restore African wild olive woodlands should therefore concentrate on increasing facilitation for seedlings and reducing competition for saplings. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Mulching and/or topsoil {{incorporation}} of plant residues from green manure legumes can increase cropping system sustainability, and can supply and retain nutrients. Two field experiments {{were conducted in}} Italy over the period of 2006 - 2007, to investigate the effect of faba bean grown in a temperate environment to fruit morphology, quality and chemical composition of the subsequent melon (Cucumis melo L.) crop. Flowering faba bean plants were managed as mulch on the melon plant rows and cut and incorporated into the soil, in comparison with cultivated soil (control) and black plastic mulch. The plastic mulch increased the soil temperature by about 2 °C compared to cultivated soil. Interestingly, melon plants mulched with faba bean plants and plastic produced higher fruit weight and pulp percentage, but the soil management practices also affected fruit <b>chemical</b> composition. Plastic <b>mulch</b> and faba bean plants induced an increase of total soluble solids and a decrease of acidity. Plastic mulch alone induced the lowest glucose content (0. 13 g 100 g- 1); treatments with faba bean plants favored the highest fructose accumulation in melon fruits (0. 23 g 100 g- 1). No clear differences emerged among the treatments with regard to sucrose accumulation in 'Baggio', but the faba bean plants managed as mulch induced a high sucrose concentration in 'Yago' fruits. Treatments with faba bean plants induced the highest K+ accumulation (3324 and 3077 mgkg- 1 f. w.); in fact, K+ scarcely accumulated in melon fruits harvested from plants mulched with plastic (2543 mgkg- 1 f. w.). Faba bean mulching also drastically increased the PO 43 - accumulation. However, unclear responses were obtained for SO 42 - increment for 'Baggio', while 'Yago' showed drastic SO 42 - accumulation by mulching with faba bean plants.

40|$|The use of contour hedgerows {{is widely}} {{advocated}} to sustain crop production and reduce soil loss on steeplands in the Three Gorges Area of China. However, {{little is known}} about the effects of soil management on soil fertility within these systems, or about the spatial gradients in soil nutrients that may develop in terraces formed behind the vegetative barriers. Therefore, we carried out a study on the effects of various long-term soil management practices on soil fertility and spatial variation of fertility between hedgerows. At a site in the Three Gorges Area, China, we applied five treatments to a contour hedgerow system: control (no fertilizer and manure); chemical fertilizer (CF); <b>chemical</b> fertilizer and <b>mulch</b> (CF + MU); pig manure (PM); and mulch, pig manure, and chemical fertilizer (CF + PM + MU). Soil samples were collected from the topsoil horizon (0 - 20 cm) of the selected five treatments in 2006 after 11 crop cycles, and physical and chemical properties were analyzed. The results showed that chemical fertilizer clearly improves nutrient status of the topsoil, while pig manure also increased the amount of soil organic matter. This increase in organic matter was associated with an increase in soil aggregate stability, a reduction in bulk density, and reduced penetration resistance of the soil. Mulch with pig manure and chemical fertilizer was the best management practice for improving soil quality and crop yields in the Three Gorges Area. Further, mulch and pig manure addition also decreased the magnitude of the spatial variation, but did not offset the soil fertility gradients because tillage resulted in significant movement of soil. More favorable soil properties were found at the lower positions within each alley, regardless of the management practice applied...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Agriculture {{contributes}} about 30 % of GDP growth in Cambodia and rice production {{is the most}} important agricultural activity. Eighty five percent of rice cultivation is conducted under rainfed lowland conditions, where the soils are typically infertile, sandy and acidic. Traditionally, after the rice crop is harvested the paddy fields are left fallow, {{due to a lack of}} irrigation and a lack of awareness of potential post-rice alternative cropping options. With the recent development and adoption of improved, photoperiod non-sensitive rice varieties, the opportunities for post-rice second cropping have increased. Among the second crop options are mungbean and peanut However, there remain significant production constraints to second cropping with legumes in the rainfed lowland rice environment, including infertile acidic soils, poor soil structure, and limited availability of water. To establish the ‘best-bet’ management options for mungbean and peanut cropping after rice in the rainfed lowland environment of Cambodia, this thesis examined a range of planting techniques, irrigation methods and irrigation frequency, and soil amendments (chemical fertiliser, lime, cow manure and mulch). The thesis reports the results from three field experiments and one glasshouse experiment which were conducted during the dry-season (November-March) in 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10. The experiments were conducted at the Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI). It was hypothesised that : (i) the growth and grain yield of legumes would be improved by the use of single row raised beds; (ii) higher water use efficiency would potentially come from the use of double-row raised beds under conditions of infrequent water application; (iii) more frequent irrigation (every day, every 4 days) would result in higher total dry matter and higher grain yield, than with infrequent irrigation (every 8, 12 or 16 days); (iv) the incorporation of cow manure into the crop seedbed would improve total dry matter and grain yield; (v) the use of <b>chemical</b> fertilizer, <b>mulches</b> and lime will all potentially improve the growth and yield of grain legumes. The results of field studies in the 2008 - 09 dry-season indicated that there were significant effects of planting bed formation on root depth and plant height at flowering, and on pod number per plant and grains per pod at maturity; however, these effects did not result in significant differences in final grain yield (GY), which for mungbean averaged 254 kg/ha and for peanut, 431 kg/ha. The frequency of irrigation had a significant effect on the final grain yield of peanut but not for mungbean. The GY and total dry matter (TDM) of peanut was reduced by 37 and 25 %, respectively, when the irrigation frequency was reduced from every 4, 8 or 12 days, to every 16 days. The results of the first field experiment in the 2009 - 10 dry-season indicated that for mungbean the use of drip irrigation three times per week gave the lowest GY (212 kg/ha), while hand-watering every three days produced the highest GY (575 kg/ha). There was no difference between GY for the furrow irrigation treatments every week (449 kg/ha) or every two weeks (453 kg/ha). For peanut, both drip irrigation and furrow irrigation at an interval of once every two weeks resulted in significant reductions in final grain yield of 25 - 47 % and 26 %, respectively, when compared with frequent irrigation regimes. Although peanut biomass was not reduced with the use of drip irrigation, final GY was low on account of the peanut pegs not being able to penetrate the soil. When compost mix was applied to the seedbed, there was no beneficial impact on crop establishment or final GY of either mungbean or peanut, while it reduced TDM for both legumes in the furrow and drip irrigation treatments. For the drip irrigation treatment with compost mix application, average TDM and GY for mungbean were reduced by 48 % and 57 %, respectively, relative to the other irrigation treatments, while under the least frequent irrigation regime (once every 14 days) there was an average reduction of TDM by 18. 6 %. A glasshouse experiment conducted in the 2009 - 10 dry-season found that total dry matter and pod yield of mungbean and total dry matter of peanut of the treatments of omission of rice straw and chemical fertilizer was half of those in the all applied control, while the omission of compost mix and lime did not have any apparent effects on the growth and yield of either legume. A third experiment undertaken in the 2009 - 10 dry-season gave significantly higher mungbean grain yields (46 and 34 % higher) from furrow irrigation once per week and daily hand-watering, when compared with furrow irrigation once every two weeks. In addition, the water use efficiency in terms of TDM and GY for the furrow irrigation once per week and daily hand-watering, were significantly higher than furrow irrigation once every two weeks and hand watering three times per week. In summary, it was concluded that there was no difference in use of single row or double row raised beds in terms of the final grain yield of mungbean or peanut. However, the minimum irrigation frequency for optimising the yield of mungbean or peanut grown during the dry-season in the lowland environment needs to be at least once every week during the growing season. The incorporation of chemical fertilizer was the most important soil amendment for optimising growth and final grain yield for both legumes. The incorporation of lime only had a small effect due to the high initial soil pH. The potential value of the incorporation of compost mix remained inconclusive and probably requires further assessment to clarify the reasons for the apparent negative effect on crop growth recorded in this study. The incorporation of grain legumes into the rice-based cropping systems in the lowland rice environment of Cambodia, have the potential to significantly increase the income of smallholder farmer producers. While the GY of the legumes in these field experiments was relatively low (between 200 and 600 kg/ha), the gross value were often significantly better than that from rice. With an average peanut yield of 500 kg/ha the gross value was US$ 893 /ha, while for mungbean the return ranged from between US$ 300 and US$ 900 /ha, compared with US$ 595 /ha for a rice crop with an average yield of 2500 kg/ha. For mungbean, the use of raised beds prevents water-logging, while weekly furrow irrigation was found to be adequate to ensure reasonable final yields. Over the cropping season mungbean required a total water application of approximately 270 mm, while for peanuts the requirement was about 345 mm. Further research is needed on aspects of varietal performance and pest management for both mungbean and peanut in the lowland rice based cropping systems of Cambodia...|$|R
