40|$|Full-scale basic eperimental {{investigations}} on the undercarriage-soil-interaction {{have been}} carried out with a pistenbully vehicle and using a bentonite-water mixture as a model for deep sea soils. Starting with bollard-pull-tests, quasistationary driving tests and drawbar-pull-tests {{have been carried}} out at a shearing strength of the soil between 4. 0 and 4. 6 kPa. As a result of this work recommendations are given for the conception of the <b>caterpillar</b> <b>vehicle</b> in order to assure optimal drawbar-pull and careful sea ground treatment. The recommendations comprise the basic design of the undercarriage, the caterpillar track construction, the vehicle weight and the weight distribution. At the same time a prognosis is given on the most important resulting driving parameters.

40|$|AbstractThe article {{describes}} the case of multivariable random loading, which occurs when the caterpillar suspension component acts {{as a set of}} loads of independent random processes. In the danger zone details of the changes in the components of the stress tensor are independent random processes. As an example of parts operating at such a loading the author discusses tracked vehicle road arm. Presently, there are no standard techniques for the estimatation of fatigue life under random multivariable loading currently available. The {{article describes}} the method of estimating the fatigue life for this type of load, based on the calculation of microplastic deformation. It uses a structural model of the material, based on the description of the deformation diagram of dependence by Ramberg-Osgood. To identify the model of accumulation of damage conventional mechanical and fatigue characteristics of the material were used. Accounting for natural dispersion of fatigue characteristics allowed to get the result {{as a function of the}} probability of failure-free operation. The validity of the approach is confirmed by comparing the calculation results with the experimental data. The practical application of the technique is illustrated by the example of predicting the durability and reliability of heavily loaded parts of the high-speed <b>caterpillar</b> <b>vehicle...</b>|$|E

50|$|Hornsbys thought {{civilian}} {{applications of}} the caterpillar track would be popular, but they only ended up selling one vehicle. Holt Manufacturing and C.L. Best Tractor Co. (the originator was Daniel Best) of the USA recognised its potential and sold many tracked vehicles; their vehicles were steered by a front wheel, unlike modern tanks. Hornsbys, with no incentives from military orders, {{did not see the}} same glowing future for the type of vehicle.

40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the {{cushioning}} systems of caterpillar tractors, which contain the non-linear elasto-dissipative links at the operation {{on the different}} soil background and under the different operating conditions. The paper purpose is to create the program set for the scientific and designing studies of cushioning systems, which allow to solve the creation problems of agricultural <b>caterpillar</b> <b>vehicles</b> on the high engineering level during the shortest periods. The new technique, the new mathematical model and the new program set for the determination of motion fairness indicators of vehicle-tractor assembly and for the property optimization of its cushioning systems with view to the improvement of motion fairness have been developed. The properties of cushioning systems of T- 5 outlook tractor, which allow to have the vibration level on the driver's seat not more the permissible level {{according to the international}} standard, have been determined and have been recommended by the State Special Design Office at the Volgograd Tractor Works PO. The cushioning system properties to be recommended have been used in the suspension of T- 5 outlook tractor, the program set has been introduced in the educational process of Volgograd Polytechnical Institute according to 1502 "Motor Vehicles and Tractor Making".

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the assumptions made and solutions {{used in a}} newly designed low-bed semi-trailer for the transportation of heavy and oversized loads, especially heavy self-propelled road machinery. During the design phase, special {{attention was paid to}} the versatility of the semi-trailer. The semi-trailer consists of 4 main modules: a hydraulic removable gooseneck allowing for coupling the semi-trailer to a tractor unit, an extendable low bed, a 2 -axle bogie and a 3 -axle bogie. The modules can be combined in different ways to create different configurations of the semi-trailer. Owing to that, the carrying capacity of the semi-trailer can be easily matched to the equipment carried. Depending on the current needs, the semi-trailer can have 2, 3 or 5 axles, a payload from 28 to 65 tons, and a length from 13. 2 to 20. 1 m. Wheeled and <b>caterpillar</b> <b>vehicles</b> can drive onto the lowbed from the front, after the gooseneck has been detached. The length and width of the bed can be adjusted within the range of 2 and 0. 6 m, respectively. An important advantage of this semi-trailer is the fact that in a 2 -axle configuration it meets the regulations for standard trailers and can be driven in public roads and carry normal loads without a special permission. Thanks to the fact that all its wheels are steered and controlled by a hydraulic steering system, the semi-trailer has very good manoeuvrability despite its long length. The semi-trailer meets rigorous safety demands – it is equipped with...|$|R
50|$|An {{off-road}} vehicle {{is considered to}} be any type of vehicle which is capable of driving on and off paved or gravel surface. It is generally characterized by having large tires with deep, open treads, a flexible suspension, or even <b>caterpillar</b> tracks. Other <b>vehicles</b> that do not travel public streets or highways are generally termed off-highway vehicles, including tractors, forklifts, cranes, backhoes, bulldozers, and golf carts.|$|R
50|$|As of 2012, {{there are}} 23 trails, {{including}} 21 runs with {{different levels of}} difficulty (green, blue, red and black), plus one forest itinerary and one connection track. The lift system includes 1 four-seats chairlift, 3 two-seats chairlifts, 5 T-bars, and 2 small lifts. Besides classic alpine skiing, the center offers other activities such as snowboarding, snowmobiles, snowshoe trekking, cross-country skiing, trips in <b>caterpillar</b> track <b>vehicles</b> (snowtracks), nighttime excursions to the mountain shelters, and a very scenic eight-kilometers downhill run {{from the top of}} Mount Caviahue to the shores of Lake Agrio. There are also two kennels offering dogsleds. The village has dozens of hotels and other lodging facilities, and the whole ski resort (including the village, the base and the mountain slope) includes restaurants, grillrooms, coffee bars and tearooms, travel agencies, mountain shelters, a snowpark, a children's nursery, and a skiing school.|$|R
5000|$|Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Porokhovschikov(Rus: Александр Александрович Пороховщиков) (1892-1941/43) was Russian {{military}} engineer, {{tank and}} aircraft inventor, known mostly {{for the development}} of Vezdekhod, the first tank (resembling modern tankette) in 1914-1915. Vezdekhod means: [...] "He who goes anywhere" [...] or [...] "all-terrain vehicle". Vezdekhod was also the first <b>caterpillar</b> amphibious all-terrain <b>vehicle.</b> Subsequently Porokhovschikov added wheels to his tank for steering, making it also the first tank design to combine caterpillar and wheel ways of movement. However the steering was ineffectual and his design rejected.|$|R
5000|$|Guests ride in <b>caterpillar</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{down the}} rabbit hole. Pieces of furniture, picture frames, and vases swirl around as guests [...] "fall" [...] down the tunnel. As guests enter through the Doorknob, {{they see the}} White Rabbit running off with Alice in pursuit. Guests then pass by Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum and {{encounter}} the White Rabbit, worrying about being late. Then the guests go through the garden of flowers, who sing [...] "All in the Golden Afternoon". Riders then pass the Caterpillar, who blows smoky letters and asks [...] "Who are you?" [...] and a Dandelion, who pops up, roaring, thinking that Alice and the riders are weeds. Next, guests enter the Tulgey Wood, where they and Alice meet the Cheshire Cat, {{as well as a}} pencil bird, an accordion owl, an eyeglasses bird, a horn-shaped duck with its ducklings, an umbrella bird, a cage bird, and a pair of hammer birds nailing a sign to a tree. They then go through the hedge maze and past some singing playing-cards who are painting a white rose tree red, splashing nearby bushes with paint. The White Rabbit announces the Queen of Hearts (and the king) and she plays croquet, using a flamingo as a club and a hedgehog as a ball. The King tells the riders: [...] "Rule 42: The Queen always wins," [...] and the hedgehog ends up rolling into a rose tree. The guests then enter the Queen's courtroom and the Queen orders their execution while a brigade of playing-cards leap towards the guests. Riders escape by pushing their way through the courtroom doors past two guards poised to attack. The vehicles then leave the ride building's second floor and descend in a winding path on a giant vine past the ride queue, before heading to the final scene at the Mad Tea Party. After the Mad Hatter and March Hare sing [...] "A Very Merry UnBirthday", Alice proclaims that it's her unbirthday too. The White Rabbit ducks as a giant unbirthday cake with a dynamite candle explodes and the ride vehicles exit back to where they began.|$|R

At Stepping Stone, shortly before the Pelly and Yukon rivers meet, they can rest at a hospitality stop before turning north. From Stepping Stone to Scroggie Creek the trail consists of a mining road or [...] "cat" [...] road, named for the <b>Caterpillar</b> tracked mining <b>vehicles</b> that use it. Before organizers coordinated schedules with the mining equipment operators, racers often {{had to contend with}} heavy machinery blocking the trail or turning it into a muddy path. The Scroggie Creek dog drop is at the confluence of the Stewart River and Scroggie Creek.|$|R
5000|$|A bogie ( [...] ) is a wheeled wagon or trolley. In {{mechanics}} terms, a bogie is {{a chassis}} or framework carrying wheels, {{attached to a}} vehicle. It can be fixed in place, as on a cargo truck, mounted on a swivel, as on a railway carriage or locomotive, or sprung as in the suspension of a <b>caterpillar</b> tracked <b>vehicle.</b> Usually, two bogies are fitted to each carriage, wagon or locomotive, one at each end. An alternate configuration often is used in articulated vehicles, which places the bogies (often jacobs bogies) under {{the connection between the}} carriages or wagons. Most bogies have two axles, as this is the simplest design, but some cars designed for extremely heavy loads have been built with up to five axles per bogie. Heavy-duty cars may have more than two bogies using span bolsters to equalize the load and connect the bogies to the cars. Usually, the train floor is at a level above the bogies, but the floor of the car may be lower between bogies, such as for a double decker train to increase interior space while staying within height restrictions, or in easy-access, stepless-entry, low-floor trains.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1920s, tracked {{vehicles}} became common, particularly the <b>Caterpillar</b> 60. Rubber-tired <b>vehicles</b> came into {{use in the}} 1940s. To dig canals, raise earth dams, and do other earth-moving jobs, these tractors were equipped with a large thick metal plate in front. (The blade got its curved shape later). In some early models the driver sat on top in the open without a cabin. There are three main types of bulldozer blades: a U-blade for pushing and carrying dirt relatively long distances, a straight blade for [...] "knocking down" [...] and spreading piles of dirt, and a brush rake for removing brush and roots. These attachments (home-built or built by small equipment manufacturers of attachments for wheeled and crawler tractors and trucks) appeared by 1929.|$|R
5000|$|Original {{plans for}} Disneyland {{show that there}} was {{supposed}} to be an [...] "Alice in Wonderland" [...] walk-through attraction in 1955, but time and budgetary restrictions forced planners to defer the attraction and the designated space was instead occupied by the Fantasyland Theater (now the location of [...] "Pinocchio's Daring Journey"). Three years later (1958), an [...] "Alice in Wonderland" [...] ride-through opened, with Mouseketeer Karen Pendleton dressed as Alice appearing at the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Now located on {{the north end of the}} building occupied by [...] "Mr. Toad's Wild Ride," [...] "Alice in Wonderland" [...] differed from other Fantasyland dark rides which appeared as openings in flat, faux-stone walls (the extended arms of Sleeping Beauty's Castle) and decorated with colorful banners and canopies made of sheet metal. Instead, [...] "Alice in Wonderland" [...] featured a stylized, oversized garden of towering blades of grass, dandelions and a tall mushroom that served as the attraction's ticket booth. The <b>caterpillar</b> ride <b>vehicles</b> moved gracefully along a winding path of massive leaves, helping create the illusion that guests had shrunk to a tiny size, thus imitating Alice's experiences in Wonderland. This attraction also differed by the vehicles negotiating a path that involved both upward and downward inclines, necessitating three wheels instead of four.|$|R

50|$|In 1966 the {{experimental}} Ob'yekt 288 rocket tank, powered by two aerial GTD-350 turbine engines {{with a combined}} power of 691 hp (515 kW), was first built. Trials indicated that twin propulsion was {{no better than the}} turbine engine which had been in development since 1968 at KB-3 of the Kirov Plant (LKZ) and at WNII Transmash. The tank from LKZ equipped with this turbine engine was designed by Nikolay Popov. It was constructed in 1969 and designated Ob'yekt 219 SP1. It was renamed the T-64T, and was powered by a GTD-1000T multi-fuel gas turbine engine producing up to 1,000 hp (746 kW). During the trials {{it became clear that the}} increased weight and dynamic characteristics required a complete redesign of the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>caterpillar</b> track system. The second prototype, designated Ob'yekt 219 SP2, received bigger drive sprockets and return rollers. The number of wheels was increased from five to six. The construction of the turret was altered to use the same compartment, 125 mm 2A46 tank gun, auto loader and placement of ammunition as the T-64A. Some additional equipment was scavenged from the T-64A. The LKZ plant built a series of prototypes based on Ob'yekt 219 SP2. After seven years of upgrades, the tank became the T-80.|$|R
