This condition is true as long as the electrons can shield out electric fields. A cloud of electrons will surround any charge with an approximate radius known as the Debye length. For that reason this approximation means the size scale is much larger than the Debye length.

In parametric adjustment, {{one can find}} an observation equation h(X)=Y relating observations Y explicitly in terms of parameters X (leading to the A-model below). In conditional adjustment, there exists a <b>condition</b> <b>equation</b> g(Y)=0 involving only observations Y (leading to the B-model below) — with no parameters X at all. Finally, in a combined adjustment, both parameters X and observations Y are involved implicitly in a mixed-model equation f(X,Y)=0. Clearly, parametric and conditional adjustments correspond to the more general combined case when f(X,Y)=h(X)-Y and f(X,Y)=g(Y), respectively.

40|$|This project aims at the {{consolidation}} of the data from integrated fieldwork in Swabian Alb test area since 1996 to 2013 {{as well as the}} height systems computations. Reliable data were checked by height differences and gravity values, after that they were grouped into 5 closed loops with 56 out of 121 observed points. Potential differences were computed from height differences which acquired from spirit levelling and gravity value, then least square adjustment was adopted. Observation equation (A-matrix) and <b>condition</b> <b>equation</b> (B-matrix) were applied in the adjustment, a weight matrix was also assigned in the adjustment. Geopotential differences were computed based on the Helmert orthometric height at point 580, then geopotenial numbers of the other points were computed by adding the geopotential number with the adjusted potential differences, then height systems could be determined as well as height corrections. In the closed loop adjustment especially adjustment of several loops with many data, <b>condition</b> <b>equation</b> adjustment is preferred because of the smaller size of design matrix compared to the observation equations and the advantage of condition equations over observation equations is that loop misclosures can be determined by <b>condition</b> <b>equation.</b> The results from both equations are the same. The difference of the geopotential numbers between unweighted and weighted adjustment is up to 0. 0129 m 2 /s 2 and the difference of height systems between unweighted and weighted adjustment is up to 0. 0013 meter or 1. 3 millimeter, so the height system computations were not significantly affected by the assigned weight. The difference of height corrections between unweighted and weighted adjustment is up to 10 - 8 m so the assigned weights did not affect height correction results. Normal corrections give the smallest values while dynamic corrections give the largest values because the test area is located at latitude 48. 485 ° instead of latitude 45 ° so the correction values are quite large...|$|E

The area <b>condition</b> <b>equation</b> for {{cadastral parcel}} considerations of scale parameters and geometric constraints is first constructed. The effects of the scale error on area adjustment results are then derived, and statistical hypothesis testing is presented to determine the significance of the scale error. Afterwards, Helmert's variance component estimation based on least-squares adjustment using the <b>condition</b> <b>equation</b> with additional parameters is proposed to determine the weight between the coordinate and area measurements of the parcel. Practical tests are conducted to illustrate the implementation of the proposed methods. Four schemes for solving the inconsistencies between the registered areas and the digitized areas of the parcels are studied. The analysis of the results demonstrates {{that in the case of}} significant systematic errors in cadastral map digitization, the accuracies of the adjusted coordinates and areas are improved by introducing scale parameters to reduce the systematic error influence in the parcel area adjustment. Meanwhile, Helmert's variance component estimation method determines more accurate weights of the digitized coordinates and parcel areas, and the least-squares adjustment solves the inconsistencies between the registered areas and the digitized areas of the parcels.
