In addition, {{in the presence of}} ants aphids may increase the quantity or quality of honeydew produced, which is costly. Through these mechanisms, ant attendance can reduce aphid <b>colony</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates.</b> However, it is unknown whether demand from within the ant colony can affect the ant-aphid interaction. In a factorial experiment, we tested whether the presence of larvae in Lasius niger ant <b>colonies</b> affected the <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of Aphis fabae colonies.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Fluid and {{sediment}} dynamics affect benthic community dynamics and structure in manifold ways. We single out three community-structuring {{processes that are}} both strongly affected and amenable to controlled manipulation: microbial population growth, faunal recruitment, and particle feeding. Attachment and <b>colony</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of microbes depend {{on the details of}} near-bed fluid exchange. Their emigration and <b>colony</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> are affected by erosion of microbial films and by abrasion during sediment transport. Recruitment and successional patterns of metazoans, especially those resulting from the settlement of weakly swimming, small larvae and juveniles, also are very sensitive to local variations in boundary layer flow pattern and strength. While the importance of particle fluxes to suspension feeders has long been apparent, the foraging patterns {{of a growing number of}} surface deposit feeders are being found to reflect a dependence upon sediment transport. Although these three processes have spatial and temporal scales amenable to both laboratory and field experimentation, proper dynamic scaling of laboratory model flows may not always be easy. Even the simplest two-phase (particles plus liquids, where particles can be bacteria, floes, larvae, or sediments) flows must match appropriate laboratory and field Reynolds number, Froude number, particle-fluid density (weight per unit volume) ratio, and the ratio of boundary layer thickness to particle size, if the laboratory flow model is to provide accurate results...|$|R

Litter nesting ants respond to food and nest site availability, and adding food and nests may increase ant species richness and abundance. However, litter decomposers share food resources with ants, and increasing food availability may speed decomposition processes, eliminating twigs and seeds in which litter ants nest. We manipulated ant food and nest resources in three habitat types (forest, high-shade coffee, and low-shade coffee) to determine ant community responses after 1 and 2 mo. We examined changes in numbers of ant species, colonies, workers, brood, <b>colony</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate,</b> and ant species composition. Habitat type strongly affected ant communities, influencing ant species richness, numbers of colonies and workers, and ant species composition. However, food addition and nest addition did not affect these community characteristics. <b>Colony</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> did not differ with food addition but was greater in forest and low-shade coffee compared with high-shade coffee. Habitat differences in colony growth may be because of presence of an aggressive species (Wasmannia auropunctata Roger) in high-shade coffee plots or naturally low arthropod densities {{during a time when}} ant colonization was low.

Fewer studies have documented such patterns within species. No data exist directly documenting the influence of <b>colony</b> size on <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> for microscopic, colonial organisms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine if similar negative relationships between <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> and size hold for colonial organisms, we developed a technique for measuring the <b>growth</b> of individual <b>colonies</b> of a bloom-forming, toxic cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa using microscopy and digital image analysis. For five out of six genotypes of M. aeruginosa isolated from lakes in Michigan and Alabama, we found significant negative relationships between <b>colony</b> size and <b>growth</b> <b>rate.</b> We found large intraspecific variation in both the slope of these relationships and in the <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>colonies</b> at a standard size.

These results have shed new light on the rela-tionships between ants and EFN-bearing plants such as in tropical and temperate systems.

A hundred isolates of Fusarium from Chili were collected in Boyolali, Central Java. Morphological characterization revealed that isolates performed varied colony phenotypes. Based on colony phenotype pattern, isolates were classified into five groups. From each group, one hypovirulent isolate was selected based on <b>colony</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> on potato dextrose agar media. The selected hypovirulent isolates were used for virulence assay in apple. The result showed that there were four hypovirulent isolates i. e. : B 6, C 15, D 19, and E 20 isolates. Total RNA extraction of the identified hypovirulent isolates revealed the existence of viral RNA in C 15 isolate. Based {{on the existence of}} viral RNA in C 15 isolate, the hypovirulent traits were due to mycoviral infection, whereas the hypovirulent traits performed by the other three were due to genetic factors...|$|E
40|$|Global declines of pollinators raise {{concerns}} about the stability of pollination services to wild and crop plants. Bees are highly important pollinators and strongly depend on (flowering) plants that provide their key resources (pollen, nectar, resin). How variations in landscape related resource diversity affect the foraging behaviour and colony fitness of bees is however largely unknown. We investigated long term resource effects on the colony development of the subtropical, perennial Australian stingless bee species Tetragonula carbonaria (Apidae: Meliponini). Colonies were experimentally placed in three landscape types with increasing levels of resource diversity: plantations, forests and gardens. Pollen, nectar and resin intake, the nutritional quality of pollen and honey storages as well as overall <b>colony</b> <b>growth</b> and reproduction were recorded and compared over a three years time period. We found foraging patterns to be largely similar across landscapes. Resource amounts and availability as well as pollen diversity were highest in gardens but low in forests and plantations. Likewise, nutritional quality of honey was highest in gardens, whereas pollen quality was equally high in gardens and plantations. Accordingly, <b>colony</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> and reproduction were highest in gardens but highly variable in forests and plantations. Our findings confirm the importance of resource availability, diversity and composition in determining <b>colony</b> <b>growth</b> and hence fitness of social bees. However, highest resource diversity is not necessarily associated with large natural habitats. Bees may thrive in landscapes with even small patches of high resource diversity, as frequently found in disturbed landscapes...|$|R

Our first objective was to assess the host specificity of the parasitic phorid fly, Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier, in the laboratory against two ant species native to the United States, Solenopsis geminata (F.) ? S. xyloni McCook and Forelius pruinosus (Roger) as well as the invasive Solenopsis invicta Buren. Parasitic phorid flies are thought to suppress fire ant populations by shifting worker ant behaviors from foraging to defense. Reduced foraging would result in decreased nutrient intake for the ant colony and, consequently, a decrease in competitive ability with other ant species. Therefore, host specificity was tested in terms of fly attack preference and also ant behavioral response to the presence of the flies, as these behaviors may influence the ability of P. tricuspis to mediate interspecific competition. Pseudacteon tricuspis was tested under choice and no-choice conditions. Choice tests were included to examine the possibility that P. tricuspis will inadvertently attack native ants if stimulated into attack behavior by the presence of S. invicta. The flies were never observed attacking either native ant species in choice or no-choice tests, whereas flies readily attacked S. invicta in both test types. Furthermore, only S. invicta responded to the presence of the flies via characteristic defensive postures. Pseudacteon tricuspis, therefore, was determined to be highly host specific to S. invicta relative to Solenopsis geminata [x] xyloni and F. pruinosus. Our second objective was to investigate the effects of P. tricuspis on the competitive interactions between S. invicta and F. pruinosus. We tested the effect of P. tricuspis on the <b>colony</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of S. invicta and F. pruinosus when the two ant species were competing for protein in laboratory competition arenas. We also quantified the effect of the phorid flies on the foraging rates of S. invicta and F. pruinosus. Though S. invicta significantly reduced its foraging rate {{in the presence of the}} phorid flies, we did not detect an effect of the flies on <b>colony</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of either species. We conclude that P. tricuspis is unlikely to have a measurable effect on S. invicta populations in the field...|$|R
