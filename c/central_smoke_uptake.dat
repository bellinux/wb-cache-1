40|$|Purpose Cigarette {{smoking is}} the major cause of {{laryngeal}} cancer. The time to first cigarette after waking in the morning is a behavior associated with several dimensions of nicotine dependence including the dose of <b>smoke</b> <b>uptake.</b> We hypothesized that a short TTFC {{increases the risk of}} laryngeal cancer. Methods The analysis was based on data from a hospital-based case–control study of laryngeal cancer. The current analysis included only subjects who were ever cigarette smokers, including 570 cases and 343 controls (832 whites and 81 blacks). Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for smoking history and other potential confounders. Incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute from 1975 to 2006 were analyzed for trends in laryngeal cancer. Results There was a dose–response relationship between TTFC and supraglottic cancer. Compared to subjects who smoked more than 60 min after waking, the adjusted odds ratio was 1. 51 (95 % CI, 0. 63 – 3. 61) for 30 – 60 min and 3. 13 (95 % CI, 1. 56 – 6. 30) for 0 – 30 min. No association was observed between TTFC and cancer of the glottis. In blacks, the TTFC was not associated with the risk of laryngeal cancer. Trends in SEER rates were similar for cancer of the glottis and supraglottis, indicating that the site-specific differences were not affected by unknown confounders.

METHODS: A case-control study of histologically confirmed head and neck cancer was conducted that included 1055 cases and 795 controls with a history of cigarette smoking. RESULTS: The pack-years–adjusted odds ratio was 1. 42 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 1. 02 - 1. 99) for an interval of 31 minutes to 60 minutes to first cigarette after waking and 1. 59 (95 % CI, 1. 19 - 2. 11) for an interval of 1 minute to 30 minutes.

METHODS: A case-control study of histologically confirmed lung cancer was conducted. The current analysis included 4775 lung cancer cases and 2835 controls who were regular cigarette smokers. RESULTS: Compared with subjects who smoked their first cigarette > 60 minutes after waking, the pack-years–adjusted odds ratio was 1. 31 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 1. 11 - 1. 54) for subjects who smoked 31 minutes to 60 minutes after waking and 1. 79 (95 % CI, 1. 56 - 2. 07) for subjects who smoked within 30 minutes of waking. The risk estimates were similar when smoking was modeled as total years, smoking status (current vs former), number of cigarettes smoked per day, years since quitting, and excess odds ratio.

There is limited understanding {{of the effect of}} phenological stage at the time of smoke exposure on taint development. The aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the variation in <b>smoke</b> <b>uptake</b> and taint development between and within seasons. METHODS AND RESULTS: Smoke was applied to field-grown Merlot grapevines at 12 stages of vine development over three growing seasons. Key periods of vine sensitivity to smoke taint in wine were (i) from shoots at 10 cm to full bloom (low levels of smoke taint); (ii) from berries at pea size to the onset of veraison (variable levels of smoke taint); and (iii) between 7 days post-veraison and harvest (high levels of smoke taint). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of taint in wine varied depending on the phenological timing of grapevine smoke exposure. Taint was elevated when exposure occurred between 7 days post-veraison and harvest. The carry-over of smoke constituents the following season was not detectable in wine but yields were reduced.

The biochemical markers in DCM were directly injected into the GC system and separated on a DB- 1 MS column using a 9. 4 min temperature program. The method was validated in urine and saliva between the limits of quantitation (1. 0 - 15 mug ml(- 1) thiocyanate, 0. 010 - 3. 0 mug ml(- 1) nicotine and cotinine in urine, 0. 010 - 1. 0 mug ml(- 1) nicotine and cotinine in saliva).

40|$|Smoke derived taint in {{grapes and}} wine {{is an issue}} of {{increasing}} significance and severity for the wine industry internationally. On commencement of this research, insufficient knowledge existed as to the effects of smoke on grapevines and the development of smoke taint in wine, with no substantial published information. This research was undertaken to investigate the effect of smoke exposure to grapevines on the development of smoke aromas, flavours and compounds in final wines. As such, this study pioneers the purposeful application of smoke to grape bunches and field-grown grapevines to establish the direct link between smoke exposure and the development of smoke taint in wine. This research identified key periods of grapevine sensitivity to <b>smoke</b> <b>uptake</b> as: (1) from shoots 10 cm in length to full-bloom (low levels of smoke taint); (2) from berries pea size to the onset of veraison (variable levels of smoke taint); and (3) from 7 days post veraison to harvest (high levels of smoke taint). A novel smoke application methodology consisting of a smoke generator and greenhouse-grade tent was developed to facilitate the accurate application of smoke treatments to field-grown grapevines. Smoke treatments were applied to grapevines at key stages during the seasonal growth cycle, on repeated occasions and at a range of densities and durations. Elevated concentrations of guaiacol, 4 -methylguaiacol, 4 -ethylguaiacol, 4 -ethylphenol, eugenol and furfural were detected, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, in wines made from fruit exposed to smoke; whereas these compounds were either not detected or detected in trace concentrations in wines produced from unsmoked (control) fruit. Wine sensory analysis established a difference between smoked and unsmoked wines, with smoked wines exhibiting ‘smoky’, ‘dirty’, ‘earthy’, ‘burnt’ and ‘smoked meat’ aromas.

40|$|Background: The high {{global burden}} of asthma and tobacco smoking among Indigenous people may {{potentially}} {{be reduced by}} appropriate interventions that target prevention of tobacco <b>smoke</b> <b>uptake</b> and improved asthma management. The latter includes targeted treatment based on airway inflammation. We undertook a feasibility study in two Darwin schools with {{a high proportion of}} Indigenous youth to determine the feasibility of an innovative, peer-led, school-based education program called the Asthma and Smoking Prevention Project (ASPP). A subset of children with reported persistent respiratory symptoms were also clinically evaluated to determine the lower airway inflammatory profile and optimize asthma management. Methods: The ASPP is founded on an evidence-based three-step program and targets improving asthma management and preventing the uptake of tobacco smoking. The program uses a student-centered approach in which senior students (peer leaders) deliver the ASPP to Grade 7 students using activities, videos, and games. Students completed questionnaires related to asthma and smoking at baseline and 3 months after program delivery. Students with respiratory symptoms at 3 months were invited for a comprehensive clinical evaluation and tests including sputum induction. Results: The ASPP was well received. Of the 203 students involved, 56 (28 %) were Indigenous and 70 % completed baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Self-reported asthma was high (19 %), 10 % of students reported smoking and 63 % reported exposure to tobacco at home. Of the 22 students who were clinically evaluated, 41 % were Indigenous. Clinically important airway inflammation was high; 23 % had Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide Levels ≥ 35 ppb, 88 % had airway neutrophilia (> 15 %), and 29 % had airway eosinophilia (> 2. 5 %). Optimization of medication and management was required in 59 % of students. Conclusion: Our study has demonstrated the implementation of the ASPP was well received by the schools {{as well as by the}} students. The high prevalence of clinically important airway inflammation and suboptimal asthma management highlights the need for a community-based study on persistent respiratory symptoms in adolescents to reduce the burden of chronic lung disease particularly for Indigenous Australians.

40|$|Abstract Background US mentholated {{cigarette}} {{sales have}} increased considerably over 50 years. Preference for mentholated cigarettes is markedly higher in Black people. While menthol {{itself is not}} genotoxic or carcinogenic, its acute respiratory effects might affect inhalation of cigarette smoke. This possibility seems consistent with the higher lung cancer risk in Black men, despite Black people smoking less and starting smoking later than White people. Despite experimental data suggesting similar carcinogenicity of mentholated and non-mentholated cigarettes, the lack of convincing evidence that mentholation increases puffing, inhalation or <b>smoke</b> <b>uptake,</b> and the similarity of lung cancer rates in Black and White females, a review of cigarette mentholation and lung cancer is timely given current regulatory interest in the topic. Methods Epidemiological studies comparing lung cancer risk in mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette smokers were identified from MedLine and other sources. Study details were extracted and strengths and weaknesses assessed. Relative risk estimates were extracted, or derived, for ever mentholated use and for long-term use, overall and by gender, race, and current/ever smoking, and meta-analyses conducted. Results Eight generally good quality studies were identified, with valid cases and controls, and appropriate adjustment for age, gender, race and smoking. The studies afforded good power to detect possible effects. However, only one study presented results by histological type, none adjusted for occupation or diet, and some provided no results by length of mentholated cigarette use. The data do not suggest any effect of mentholation on lung cancer risk. Adjusted relative risk estimates for ever use vary from 0. 81 to 1. 12, giving a combined estimate of 0. 93 (95 % confidence interval 0. 84 - 1. 02, n = 8), with no increase in males (1. 01, 0. 84 - 1. 22, n = 5), females (0. 80, 0. 67 - 0. 95, n = 5), White people (0. 87, 0. 75 - 1. 03, n = 4) or Black people (0. 90, 0. 73 - 1. 10, n = 4). Estimates for current and ever smokers are similar. The combined estimate for long-term use (0. 95, 0. 80 - 1. 13, n = 4) again suggests no effect of mentholation. Conclusion Higher lung cancer rates in Black males cannot be due to their greater preference for mentholated cigarettes. While some study weaknesses exist, the epidemiological evidence is consistent with mentholation having {{no effect on the}} lung carcinogenicity of cigarettes. </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} smoking behaviour in a population of habitual cigarette smokers. Measurements were made 5 times, at intervals of 4 weeks whilst smoking cigarettes with tar yields above 10 mg. After switching to lower yield cigarettes (reductions of at least 3 mg tar and 0. 2 mg nicotine) a further 6 visits were made at intervals of 6 weeks. A group of subjects followed the same protocol but without switching. Tobacco <b>smoke</b> <b>uptake</b> was estimated by measuring pre and post-smoking plasma nicotine, cotinine, carboxyhaemoglobin (HbCO) and expired carbon monoxide (infinity). Smoke generation was measured with the subject smoking through a holder acting as a flow meter. The data from visits 2 - 6 showed large between-subject variability but little between-session variability indicating that these measures were reproducible. However, the large variation in measurements of plasma nicotine may limit {{the use of this}} variable unless sample collection is carefully controlled. There were observed gender differences in smoke generation which could be explained in terms of anatomical size. Examination of the interrelationships between measurements of smoking showed that although some indices were highly correlated, much of the variation in the relationship could not be explained Indicating that no one measurement can give an overall indication of smoke exposure. 497 people expressed an interest in the study but only 53 managed to complete. Of these 44 met the study criteria: 26 switched to a lower yield brand and 18 remained on their own brand. The switching group showed significant increases in puff volume, peak puff flow, puff number and total puff volume, whilst pre-smoke Hbinfinity, the HbCO boost, mean plasma cotinine and puff interval showed significant reductions. These changes resulted in an average level of regulation of about 56 %. The majority of these changes were maintained over the post-switch period, however, puff number, puff interval and total puff volume showed short-term adaptation by returning to baseline values after an initial change. It is concluded that the effects of switching to lower yield cigarettes persist for at least 8 months (average level of regulation of about 65 %) and that this has Important implications for the strategy of reducing cigarette smoke exposure. It was postulated that smoking results in transient changes in pulmonary ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) and this mechanism may explain the discrepancy between the relative boost for the non-lnvasive and Invasive methods of measuring changes in HbCO on smoking. Both breath-hold and mean alveolar methods were significantly affected by posture Induced changes in VA/Q Indicating that equilibration between CX) in blood and the lungs cannot be assumed for these methods. However, these techniques do provide a reasonable estimate of Hb? before smoking as long as the same method and conditions are adhered to. Although unaffected by changes in posture, the rebreathing method also failed to reflect changes in Hb? on smoking since the relative infinity boost was only half that for Hbinfinity. It is therefore concluded that none of the alveolar sampling techniques give a reliable indication of the acute changes In Hbinfinity associated with smoking...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Exposure to <b>smoke</b> and <b>uptake</b> of taint imparting phenols in {{grapes and}} wines is a {{significant}} problem in bushfire-prone regions of Australia and other countries. The effects of smoke exposure on taint occurrence in wines, however, can be variable. This study assessed the influence of cultivar on uptake and accumulation of smoke-borne phenols in grapes and of subsequent processing and winemaking methods on extraction of phenols into wines. Methods and Results: Smoke-exposure experiments were conducted in commercial vineyards of Chardonnay, Merlot and Sauvignon Blanc 14 days after the onset of veraison. At maturity, grapes were harvested for winemaking, which included malolactic fermentation (MLF) for Merlot. Volatile and glycoconjugated phenols were determined in grapes and the resultant wines. All cultivars had a similar concentration of smoke-derived total phenols in their grapes. The apparent extraction of total phenols from grapes into wines, however, differed markedly among the three traditional winemaking methods. Red winemaking (Merlot) with skin contact extracted 88 % of total grape phenols, whereas white winemaking either by crushing before pressing (Sauvignon Blanc) or by whole-bunch pressing without crushing (Chardonnay), respectively, released 39 and 18 % of total phenols. For Merlot wines, MLF {{did not affect the}} extraction of total smoke-derived phenols. Conclusions: Under standardised exposure conditions (duration, intensity and phenology), the three cultivars studied accumulated a similar concentration of total phenols in grapes. The grape-processing and winemaking methods, however, can bring about a fourfold difference in the concentration of total phenols of wines. The smoke-derived phenols extracted from grapes into wine and the distribution of these phenols between the volatile and conjugated pools were not affected by MLF...|$|R

Methods: Data were collected at 3 home visits during a 7 -day study period from {{a convenience sample}} of 24 households with a child 5 years or younger. Three child urine samples and 2 air and surface samples from the living room and the child bedroom were taken in homes of nonsmokers (n = 5) and hookah-only smokers (n = 19) comprised of daily hookah smokers (n = 8) and weekly/monthly hookah smokers (n = 11). Results: Nicotine levels in indoor air and on surfaces in the child bedrooms in homes of daily hookah smokers were significantly higher than in homes of nonsmokers. Uptake of nicotine, NNK, and acrolein in children living in daily hookah smoker homes was significantly higher than in children living in nonsmoker homes. Uptake of nicotine and NNK in children living in weekly/monthly hookah smoker homes was significantly higher than in children living in nonsmoker homes. Conclusions: Our data provide the first evidence for uptake of nicotine, the tobacco-specific lung carcinogen NNK, and the ciliatoxic and cardiotoxic agent acrolein in children living in homes of hookah smokers. Our findings suggest that daily and occasional hookah use in homes present a serious, emerging threat to children's long-term health. © The Author 2014.

Estimates of mouth level exposure (MLE) to nicotine, 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanone (NNK), pyrene and acrolein {{were obtained by}} chemical analysis of spent cigarette filters. Estimates of <b>smoke</b> constituent <b>uptake</b> were achieved by analysis of urinary biomarkers for total nicotine equivalents (nicotine, cotinine, trans– 3 ′-hydroxycotinine plus their glucuronide conjugates), NNK (total 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanol (NNAL) plus glucuronide), pyrene (1 -hydroxy pyrene plus glucuronide) and acrolein (3 -hydroxylpropyl-mercapturic acid) plus the nicotine metabolite cotinine in plasma and saliva. The objective of our study was to confirm the correlations between measures of human exposure obtained by filter analysis and biomarkers. Significant correlations (p< 0. 001) were found between MLE and the relevant biomarker for each smoke constituent. The adjusted values of the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were 0. 80 (nicotine), 0. 77 (acrolein) and 0. 44 (pyrene). NNK correlations {{could not be obtained}} because of the low NNK yield of Canadian cigarettes. Unexpectedly high levels of acrolein biomarker found in non-smokers urine on one of the two days sampled emphasised the need for more than one sampling occasion per period and an awareness of non-tobacco sources of smoke constituents under investigation. No consistent dose response, in line with ISO tar yield smoked, of MLE estimates was found for nicotine, pyrene and acrolein and respective biomarkers.

[...] Hungarian salami is one of the world's two trade names for salami, Milano salami being the other. These fermented sausages combine smoke and mold application in one. The traditional technology used to produce them is based on the Italian pre-drying technique developed during the nineteenth century, but they are smoked and their pH does not drop below 5.5, so the final flavor of the product is not acidic.|$|R

Increased epithelial permeability produced by cigarette smoke is likely to be mediated though depletion of the Total Antioxidant Capacity. Oxidative stress has been recognized as a <b>central</b> feature of <b>smoke</b> induced chronic bronchitis. Imbalance between oxidants and Total Anioxidant Capacity is also an established fact in these patients. 60 patients with chronic bronchitis included in the study. Their base line clinical examination, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide, alpha tochopherol and Total Antioxidant Capacity were measured. 100 healthy non-smokers’ were served as controls. The mean malondialdehyde levels and nitric oxide in the patients at base line were higher than Controls (p< 0. 001). Plasma alpha-tocopherol and total antioxidant capacity were lower (p< 0. 001) in the patients compared to controls. The present study shows that initially the plasma lipid peroxide (MDA) levels were high and antioxidants. (alpha- tocopherol, total antioxidant capacity) were low in patients with chronic bronchitis. Our results suggest the presence of oxidative stress and decrease in total antioxidant capacity in chronic bronchitis...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} {{of cigarette smoke}} and high-level occupational asbestos exposure produces a synergistic increase {{in the incidence of}} lung cancer; however, smoking does not affect the incidence of mesothelioma. Here we present the results of tests of two theories that have been proposed to explain this phenomenon; namely, that pleural mesothelial cells are resistant to cigarette smoke-induced damage and that the pleural connective tissue acts as a barrier that prevents smoke from reaching the mesothelial cells. To test these hypotheses, excised whole rat lung preparations were exposed to either internal (intratracheal) or external (pleural surface) smoke. For comparison, additional excised lung preparations were exposed to solutions of hydrogen peroxide either externally or intratracheally. Mesothelial cells exposed to external smoke showed widespread, dose-dependent uptake of Trypan blue. Mesothelial cells did not take up Trypan blue after exposure to internal smoke. Bronchial epithelial cells exposed to internal <b>smoke</b> did show <b>uptake,</b> but to a lesser degree than externally exposed mesothelial cells. Examination by scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that internal smoke did not affect mesothelial cell ultrastructure, whereas external smoke produced obvious mesothelial cell damage and mesothelial cell detachment. Catalase and deferoxamine, scavengers of active oxygen species, provided protection against smoke-induced mesothelial cell injury, but inactivated catalase did not. External hydrogen peroxide produced a very similar, dose-dependent pattern of Trypan blue uptake and ultrastructural changes. Intratracheal hydrogen peroxide also damaged mesothelial cells, but the extent of damage was always less than with comparable concentrations of external hydrogen peroxide.

It was developed {{to make it easier}} to get to Shasta, California (which paid him $2,000) in the Central Valley and was first used in 1852. The route, called Noble's Road, left the main trail near Lasson's meadow (now Rye Patch Reservoir) in Nevada, and bypassed most of the large Applegate-Lassen loop north almost to Goose Lake (Oregon-California) on the Oregon-California border. This reasonably easy wagon route followed the Applegate-Lassen Trail to the Boiling Spring at Black Rock in Black Rock Desert and then went almost due west from there to Shasta, California, in the <b>Central</b> Valley via <b>Smoke</b> Creek Desert to present-day Honey Lake and present-day Susanville before passing North of Mt. Lassen and on to Shasta (near present-day Redding). The route today can be approximated by taking Nevada State Route 49 (Jungo Road) from Winnemucca, Nevada, to Gerlach, Nevada, and from there to Susanville via Smoke Creek Road. From there, California State Route 44 through Lassen Volcanic National Park to Redding approximates the rest of the trail. It depended upon springs for water, as there were no dependable creeks along most of the route. East of Mt. Lassen, it used part of Lassen's road in reverse over a distance of about 20 mi. In that section of trail, a traveler going to Shasta City might travel north passing another traveler going south to Sutter's Fort California.|$|R
40|$|The {{prime movers}} used for ships today have certain {{limitations}} in their load response. As a ship accelerates, the diesel engine {{due to the}} temporary inability of the turbocharger to supply a sufficient amount of air to burn completely the fuel quantity required to meet the increasing load, emits smoke. One way of addressing this issue {{is the use of}} a hybrid diesel-electric configuration. Examples of ships with where a hybrid system could be useful, are vessels with fast maneuvering requirements with rapidly changing propeller demand. This Thesis investigates the improvement in performance of a combustion engine with the assistance of an electric motor, with appropriate control systems, for transient load <b>uptake,</b> <b>smoke</b> emission reduction, reduced pollutant emissions and lower fuel consumption. The Hybrid Integrated Propulsion POwertrain (HIPPO- 1) test bed at NTUA/LME consists of a medium-duty 448 kW, turbocharged marine diesel engine, a water brake and an AC electric motor with frequency inverter rated at 110 kW, coupled to a water brake on the same shaft in a parallel hybrid configuration. The main purpose of the electric motor in the HIPPO- 1 powertrain is to assist the diesel engine at lower speed bands, where the engine produces low torque, to meet faster the increasing torque demand. For the hybrid diesel electric powertrain, two energy control management strategies are proposed, that dictate the required torque from the electric motor so as to track a reference air-to-fuel ratio/stoichiometric (lambda value) in the diesel engine. The reference lambda values are stored in lookup tables which consider engine parameters, such as produced torque, speed and intake manifold pressure, derived from experimental data during steady-state operation. The feasibility and validity of the proposed control strategy was tested experimentally, using rapid prototyping development tools. The tested loading time series is based on performance data from ship-board measurements with a multitude of engine loading conditions. A comparison between the hybrid powertrain and the standard engine setup (without the assistance from the electric motor), shows the benefits of a hybrid setup during transient loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|Bialous and Yach have {{recently}} {{published an article}} in Tobacco Control in which they claim that all smoking-machine standards stem from a method developed unilaterally by the tobacco industry within the Cooperation Centre for Scientific Research Relative to Tobacco (CORESTA). Using a few highly selective quotations from internal tobacco company memos, they allege, inter alia, that the tobacco industry has changed the method to suit its own needs, that because humans do not smoke like machines the standards are of little value, and that the tobacco industry has unjustifiably made health claims about low “tar” cigarettes. The objectives of this paper are to review the development of smoking-machine methodology and standards, involvement of relative parties, outline {{the significance of the}} results and explore the validity of Bialous and Yach's claims. The large volume of published scientific information on the subject together with other information in the public domain has been consulted. When this information is taken into account it becomes obvious that the very narrow and restricted literature base of Bialous and Yach's analysis has resulted in them, perhaps inadvertedly, making factual errors, drawing wrong conclusions and writing inaccurate statements on many aspects of the subject. The first smoking-machine standard was specified by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a federal government agency in the USA, in 1966. The CORESTA Recommended Method, similar in many aspects to that of the FTC, was developed in the late 1960 s and published in 1969. Small differences in the butt lengths, smoke collection and analytical procedures in methods used in various countries including Germany, Canada and the UK, developed later, resulted in about a 10 % difference in smoke “tar” yields. These differences in methodology were harmonised in a common International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) Standard Method in 1991, after a considerable amount of interlaboratory comparisons of the developing methodology had been undertaken by CORESTA. As acknowledged by Bialous and Yach, the purpose of the standards is to determine the “tar”, nicotine and carbon monoxide content of cigarette smoke when the cigarette is smoked under precisely defined conditions, and hence to allow a comparison of the yields from different cigarettes when smoked under identical conditions. Such yields are not predictive of the yields humans obtain when smoking, nor were they ever expected to be so, since no two smokers smoke exactly the same nor does a smoker smoke a cigarette the same way on every occasion. This purpose has been stated consistently many times, originally by the FTC in 1967 and subsequently in the scientific literature, published by the tobacco industry and health/regulatory authorities, over the last 35 years. From the 1950 s onwards numerous public health scientists have advocated that lower “tar” cigarettes should be developed {{on the grounds that they}} may reduce to some extent the risks of smoking, while at the same time advocating that the best way to avoid risks is not to smoke. Some health authorities have have used the standard machine-smoking yields to set limits on “tar” as a way of reducing the health impact of cigarette use. The tobacco industry has co-operated with these health authorities by developing cigarettes with lower “tar” but has also followed public health advice by not advertising lower “tar” cigarettes as safe cigarettes. The available evidence, taken as a whole, indicates that compensation by smokers who switch from a high to a low “tar” cigarette is partial in the short term, and that such smokers do obtain a reduction in <b>smoke</b> component <b>uptake...</b>|$|R

The Kiyaska name meaning [...] "Cutt Offs" [...] came about when Smoke told Bull Bear and his followers that they were cut off from the tribe. The Itéšiča name meaning [...] "Bad Faces" [...] originated from when Bull Bear threw some dust in the face of Smoke after he told Bull Bear that he been cut off. His longstanding feud with Bull Bear which resulted in Bull Bear's death by the hands of Red Cloud in 1841. Chief Smoke's headdress wasn't just another ordinary headdress. In fact it wasn't like any other chief's headdress it was amazingly detailed and designed with the finest and longest eagle feathers available. It was longer than Chief Touch the Clouds's headdress, and it had special significance. Indeed it was most honored and sacred among the Lakotas. When Chief Smoke stood or walked in full headdress, there was a magnificent train of eagle feathers trailing or dragging on the ground for many feet behind him. He earned these eagle feathers one by one. The Lakota people made and awarded him this headdress for his status as a great warrior as well as his many good deeds and a life devoted to and for his people. Chief Smoke’s height was 6’5, and he weighed at least 250 pounds and was robust.|$|R
