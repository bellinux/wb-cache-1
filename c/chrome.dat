After that, they sent California <b>Chrome</b> to Harris Farms {{where he was}} turned out on pasture.

5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, <b>chrome</b> yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of <b>chrome</b> yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment <b>chrome</b> red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. <b>Chrome</b> green is a mixture of Prussian blue and <b>chrome</b> yellow, while the <b>chrome</b> oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{was then}} the second largest gold {{producer}} in the world, after South Africa. The colony's gold output had expanded greatly during the 1930s, and it remained the territory's main source of income during the war, though many extracting operations were diverted towards strategic minerals, most prominently <b>chrome</b> and asbestos. Southern Rhodesia {{became one of the}} two main sources of <b>chrome</b> for the Allies (South Africa was the other) and the world's third largest producer of asbestos after Canada and the Soviet Union. By {{the end of the war}} the mines at Shabani and Mashaba were turning out 1.5million tonnes of asbestos a year, in addition to 600,000 tonnes of <b>chrome.</b> Gold output reached peak levels in 1941–42 and thereafter subsided. Southern Rhodesia also exported tungsten, mica and tin, and provided coal for the copper mines of Northern Rhodesia and the Congo. The Southern Rhodesian government encouraged private enterprise to form secondary industries to exploit the colony's natural resources and increase production, but also set up some state industries in an attempt to spark growth. The establishment of the RATG prompted a minor economic boom, and also caused the primary direct demand placed on Southern Rhodesia's black population during the early stages of the war—a programme of conscripted labour to build the aerodromes.|$|E
5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} to pull the motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a <b>chrome</b> grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais <b>chrome</b> stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E

5000|$|Picture postcards (PPCs) can be {{assigned}} to [...] "the Golden Age of Postcards" [...] (1898-1919), {{the time of the}} linens (circa 1930-1950), or to the modern <b>chromes</b> (after 1940). Modern <b>chromes</b> are color photographs and thus differ from photochromes generated from black and white photographs before ca. 1915. PPCs can also be differentiated on the basis of other features: undivided backs are typical for c1901-1906, and divided backs for c1907-1915, while white border cards are common from c1915-1930.|$|R

5|$|Ferrochromium alloy is commercially {{produced}} from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium. Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development was {{the discovery that}} steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and <b>chrome</b> plating (electroplating with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.|$|E
40|$|We empirically {{assess whether}} browser {{security}} warnings are as ineffective {{as suggested by}} popular opinion and previous literature. We used Mozilla Firefox and Google <b>Chrome’s</b> in-browser telemetry to observe over 25 million warning impressions in situ. During our field study, users continued through a tenth of Mozilla Firefox’s malware and phishing warnings, a quarter of Google <b>Chrome’s</b> malware and phishing warnings, {{and a third of}} Mozilla Firefox’s SSL warnings. This demonstrates that security warnings can be effective in practice; security experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal of communicating security information to end users. We also find that user behavior varies across warnings. In contrast to the other warnings, users continued through 70. 2 % of Google <b>Chrome’s</b> SSL warnings. This indicates that the user experience of a warning can {{have a significant impact on}} user behavior. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for warning designers and researchers. ...|$|R

John Resig, Mozilla's JavaScript evangelist, further commented on the {{performance}} of different browsers on Google's own suite, commenting on <b>Chrome's</b> [...] "decimating" [...] of the other browsers, but he questioned whether Google's suite was representative of real programs. He stated that Firefox 3.0 performed poorly on recursion-intensive benchmarks, such as those of Google, because the Mozilla team had not implemented recursion-tracing yet.|$|R
