50|$|Louis Essen, a {{physicist}} from Nottingham, made {{advances in the}} quartz clock in the 1930s at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, to produce the quartz ring clock in 1938, and the caesium clock, known as the atomic clock, in 1955. During the war he invented the <b>cavity</b> resonance <b>wavemeter</b> to find the first accurate value {{of the speed of}} light. The atomic clock works on differences in magnetic spin. Before Essen's invention, the second was defined on the orbit of the Earth around the Sun; he changed it in 1967 {{to be based on the}} hyperfine structure of the caesium-133 atom. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), in Paris, takes the average of 300 atomic clocks around the world.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} high {{frequency}} millimetre wave oscillators is performed operating at W- band and above, using test bench equipment designed and constructed in St. Andrews. Octave tuneable oscillators have been designed, constructed, {{and used to}} characterise developmental Gunn devices, {{as well as to}} provide ideal oscillators for test bench measurement systems. These oscillators have been sold to many millimetre-wave laboratories throughout Britain. The operation, optimisation and characterisation of these oscillators is described in detail, and various non-linear effects are explained and modelled successfully. The wideband tuneability and matching has also allowed evaluation of new developmental Gunn devices to accurately determine the optimum operating frequency range of the devices. This was part of a developmental program by GEC Hirst and MEDL which has now produced state of the art GaAs Gunn oscillators at 94 GHz. Much of the characterisation of the oscillators is performed using novel quasi-optical techniques, which has allowed low loss accurate performance at these very high frequencies. Several quasi-optical techniques are described and the design, manufacture and evaluation of many optical components are given. In particular, the frequency and harmonic content of the oscillators was determined using a Martin-Puplett Interferometer which utilised a frequency counting technique. This enabled easy wideband measurements to be performed with much greater accuracy than traditional <b>cavity</b> <b>wavemeters.</b> In addition, a state of the art noise bench has been designed and constructed for operation at W -band and above, that utilises a novel open resonator to effect a very high Q suppression filter. The system has been shown to make noise measurements at much lower power levels and with greater sensitivity than comparable systems...|$|R
40|$|A compact DFB {{tunable diode}} laser {{operating}} around 1. 572 m m {{was used to}} study the cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy of carbon dioxide near 1. 572 m m. It was experimentally demonstrated that a narrow-band continuous wave laser {{could be used in}} combination with a high -finesse optically stable cavity to perform highly sensitive direct absorption spectroscopy using ideas from the field of cavity ring down spectroscopy in a simple experimental setup. Laser radiation was coupled into optical cavity via accidental coincidences of laser frequency with one of multitude modes of the cavity. Absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide was obtained, the absorption signals were extracted from the measurement recording only the highest light intensity that leaked out of the optical <b>cavity.</b> A <b>wavemeter</b> was used to record accurate frequency of the laser. An absorption sensitivity of about 3. 39 × 10 – 7 cm – 1 has been achieved...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution cavity {{enhanced}} {{absorption spectroscopy}} (CEAS) using a 1. 5 μm cw narrow line width tunable diode laser (TDL) and an optical cavity {{which consists of}} two ultra-high reflectivity (R > 99. 999 %) mirrors separated {{at a distance of}} 60 cm is described. Laser radiation is coupled into the optical cavity via accidental coincidences of laser frequency with one of the multitude modes of the cavity. Absorption spectrum of the vibrational combination band of CO 2 has been obtained, the absorption signals were extracted from a measurement recording only the highest light intensity at a specified time period that leaks out of the <b>cavity.</b> A <b>wavemeter</b> was used simultaneously to record accurate frequency of the laser. An absorption sensitivity of about 4. 8 × 10 - 9 cm - 1 has been achieved. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Essen {{worked on}} radar and {{developed}} a number of instruments, including the <b>cavity</b> resonance <b>wavemeter.</b> It was this work that suggested to Essen {{the possibility of a}} more precise measurement of the speed of light. In 1946, in collaboration with A.C. Gordon-Smith, he used a microwave cavity, of precisely known dimensions, and exploited his expertise in time-measurement to establish the frequency for a variety of its normal modes. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light. Their result, 299,792±3 km/s, was substantially greater than that from the prevailing sequence of optical measurements that had begun around the start of the 20th century and Essen had to withstand some fierce criticism and disbelief. Even NPL director Sir Charles Galton Darwin, while supporting the work, observed that Essen would get the correct result once he had perfected the technique. Moreover, W.W. Hansen at Stanford University had used a similar technique and obtained a measurement which was more consistent with the conventional (optical) wisdom. However, a combination of Essen's stubbornness, his iconoclasm and his belief in his own skill at measurement (and a little help with calculations from Alan Turing) inspired him to refine his apparatus and to repeat his measurement in 1950, establishing a result of 299,792.5±1 km/s. This was the value adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. Most subsequent measurements have been consistent with this value. In 1983, the 17th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures adopted the standard value, 299,792.458 km/s for the speed of light.|$|R
