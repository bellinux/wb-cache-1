40|$|Assuming {{that type}} I atrial flutter is a macroreentrant circuit, its cycle length should {{vary with the}} atrial dimensions. In order to test this hypothesis, flutter cycle length was {{measured}} while inducing atrial volume and pressure changes by postural and pharmacological means in seven patients undergoing a therapeutic programmed stimulation for type I atrial flutter <b>conversion.</b> <b>Right</b> atrial volume was estimated from B-mode echocardiography data. Basal values were compared with those obtained during inspiration, expiration, Valsalva maneuver, negative tilt (head down), and positive tilt (head up) with 0. 8 - 1. 6 mg p. o. nitroglycerin. The right atrial size increased slightly from 17. 8 to 18. 3 cm 2 (P = 0. 04) during the pressure load induced by negative tilt (+ 3 mmHg), with a corresponding lengthening of the flutter cycle length from 228 to 233 msec (P = 0. 02). Similarly, pressure unloading of - 2 mmHg by positive tilting and nitrates {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in right atrial size to 16. 6 cm 2 (P = 0. 04), with a corresponding decrease in cycle length from 228 to 219 msec (P = 0. 03). Respiratory maneuver yielded similar results with an inspiratory cycle lengthening, expiratory shortening, and further shortening during Valsalva maneuver. These experiments demonstrate a direct relation between cycle length and atrial volume in human type I atrial flutter. They underline the importance of the right heart preload and atrial size for the electrophysiological characteristics of type I atrial flutter. Beside its fundamental interest, this finding is important for the understanding of the mechanism of maintenance and therapeutic responses of this common arrhythmia...|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the voting and <b>conversion</b> <b>rights</b> held by SPAC shareholders, only well-received {{transactions}} are typically approved by the shareholders. When a deal is proposed, a shareholder has three options. The shareholder can approve the transaction by voting in favor of it, elect to sell their shares in the open market, or vote against the transaction and redeem their shares for a pro-rata share of the trust account. (This is significantly different from the blind pool - blank check companies of the 1980s, which were a form of limited partnership that did not specify what investment opportunities the company plans to pursue.) The assets of the trust are only released if a business combination is approved by the voting shareholders, or a business combination is not consummated within 24 months of the initial offering.

The calibration curves for two analytes were linear (R 2 ≥ 0. 9950, n = 4) over the concentration range of 0. 2 - 30 ng/mL for Atorvastatin and 1 - 250 ng/mL for Glimepiride. Mean extraction recoveries 80. 34 ± 9. 43 for Atorvastatin and 88. 19 ± 7. 13 for Glimepiride. Intra- and inter-run mean percent accuracy was between 85 % - 115 % and percent imprecision was ≤ 15 %.
