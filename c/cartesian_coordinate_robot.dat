The major components of arc welding robots are the manipulator or the mechanical unit and the controller, which {{acts as the}} robot's [...] "brain".

50|$|A <b>cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>robot</b> (also called linear robot) is an {{industrial}} robot whose three principal axes of control are linear (i.e. they {{move in a}} straight line rather than rotate) and are at right angles to each other.The three sliding joints correspond to moving the wrist up-down,in-out,back-forth. Among other advantages, this mechanical arrangement simplifies the Robot control arm solution. Cartesian coordinate robots with the horizontal member supported at both ends are sometimes called Gantry robots; mechanically, they resemble gantry cranes, although the latter are not generally robots. Gantry robots are often quite large.|$|E

40|$|When doing femur {{fracture}} reduction surgery, both {{patient and}} surgeon {{are exposed to}} {{a great amount of}} radiation, which is harmful to their health. Computer assisted orthopaedic surgery (CAOS) is a less invasive approach for its ability to reduce the usage of image intensifier. Various robots have been developed for femur fracture reduction surgery. Most of these robots are beared on serial architecture. The low transportable load and poor accuracy are both inherent in serial robots, which makes them inappropriate for femur fracture reduction. Some fully parallel robots using the "Stewart platform" are also developed for femur fracture reduction, but their restricted workspace limits their performance. To balance the accuracy and workspace, a new hybrid robot with six degree-of-freedom is reported here. It possesses the characteristic of the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>robot,</b> all the movement of the actuators are linear, which makes its movement smooth for low speed fracture reduction procedure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The {{goal of this}} work {{is to provide a}} robot with the abilities to navigate in an iudoor enviromnent and to identify openings like a door as au erltrauce or an exit. Our research platform is the Labmate hardware purchased from Transitions Research Corporation, Connecticut, USA. We have built on top of the Labnate a souar proximity system aud a vision system. No global map or world model or higher-level knowledge is stored in the system. Vision is used to guide the robot to move towards a door. In the visiou module, vertical lines are the primary features used for door detection. It also gives au approximate direction of the door detected so as to direct the moveineut of the robot. Primitive obstacle avoidance algorithms, which only enable the robot to move away from obstacles are not sufficieut for our purpose because these algorithms do not take the goal into consideration. Some sophisticated algorithms like the poteutial field method could take the target point into consideration, but the target has to be specified in a coordinate system with respect to the environnlent. Instead of <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinates,</b> a <b>robot</b> center polar <b>coordinate</b> system is used in specifying the direction of motion.

40|$|International audience— This paper {{presents}} a development of Inverse Kinematic Model (IKM) {{of a class}} of Continuum Bionic Handling Arm (CBHA). The modeling approach is inspired from {{a model of a}} hyper-redundant backbone-based manipulator, combined with an optimal placement of the backbones. The latter is obtained using an optimization algorithm, based on a Sequential Quadratic Program (SQP). The main interest of developing such model is to design an autonomous control of the CBHA. The high number of Degrees of Freedom (DoF) present on the continuum structure of the CBHA, makes difficult the synthesis of the analytical IKM for the overall arm. To resolve this issue, it is proposed to assimilate the CBHA's behavior to that of a hyper-redundant robot manipulator. This robot is represented by a concatenation of hybrid (parallel and serial) vertebrae along the vertebral column or backbones of the CBHA. The combination of all these vertebra allows the reconstruction with optimal configuration of the real posture of the continuum arm inside its workspace, with only the knowledge of the <b>Cartesian</b> <b>coordinates</b> of the <b>robot</b> pose. Simulations and experimental validation of the model demonstrate the efficiency of the modeling approach for this class of CBHA...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Gantry loader {{which is}} also called as gantry robot {{is a kind of}} <b>cartesian</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>robot</b> with two or more linear motions.

The wireless gantry loader enables a convenient maintenance and a stable productivity by the reduction of wire broken from fatigue. The developed loader system is controlled by PC-based motion controller and is communicated by wireless LAN devices. The line from a power source to the loader system was substituted by attaching trolley bar on the traveling beam. The loader system was designed to be moved with high speed and high repeatability, and the motion was observed continuously by monitoring system in the PC-based controller.
