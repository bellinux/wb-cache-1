25|$|On October 17, 1980, 100,000 {{gallons of}} Hudson River water leaked into the Indian Point 2 {{containment}} building from the fan <b>cooling</b> <b>unit,</b> undetected by a safety device designed to detect hot water. The flooding, covering the first 9 {{feet of the}} reactor vessel, was discovered when technicians entered the building. Two pumps that should have removed the water {{were found to be}} inoperative. NRC proposed a $2,100,000 fine for the incident.|$|E
25|$|Shinji {{agrees to}} pilot Unit 01 against the angel {{alongside}} Rei in Unit 00. He destroys {{it with an}} experimental positron rifle, which requires the entire electrical power output of Japan to power. Rei is nearly killed defending Shinji from the Angel's return fire, but he saves her by <b>cooling</b> <b>Unit</b> 00 in water and prying open its cockpit using Unit-01's knife. Rei, normally cold and emotionless, shares a smile with him.|$|E
25|$|In February 1996, the {{electricity}} and heating {{were transferred to}} a European Gas Turbines (EGT) 4.9MWe Typhoon gas turbine combined heating, power and <b>cooling</b> <b>unit.</b> It included a 6MW Thermax air conditioning (cooling) vapour absorption machine (VAM). The £6m HVAC system reduced energy costs by 35%, and paid for itself within three years. A second turbine was added, without a second chimney. However, in 2008 the BBC admitted that the energy system was being used for emergency purposes only as it had become cost-ineffective to use full-time. Excess electricity produced at night has not been returned to the National Grid, as originally planned. In November 2003, the turbine's chimneys caught fire, bringing TV output to a halt. After the fire the turbines were no longer used regularly.|$|E

500|$|The Campo de la Piedra Pómez ignimbrites (...) have {{a surface}} area of [...] They have a volume of [...] and are {{separated}} in two layers which form one <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> despite their different colour and mineral composition. They both contain pumice and lithic fragments and are poor in crystals. Both have a pyroclastic texture with pumices bearing a porphyritic texture. Dating techniques yield different ages; the most reliable one (argon–argon dating on sanidine) indicates that these ignimbrites were erupted 73,000 ± 23,200 years ago. Other proposed dates go {{as far back as}} 0.555 ± 0.11 mya. They do not cross topographic surfaces and were generated by tranquil release from the ground rather than through the collapse of an eruption column. The surface has been exposed to wind erosion, forming yardangs and ripple marks. The source of this eruption is unknown; the Robledo caldera may be the origin of this eruption but this is controversial. The ignimbrites of Piedra Pómez are covered with a desert varnish similar coating, some bearing signs of endolithic lifeforms.|$|E
