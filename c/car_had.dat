5|$|Noise level {{regulation}} was revised: {{the noise}} emitted from the <b>car</b> <b>had</b> {{to be less}} than 113dB (measurement taken at 15 meters {{from the edge of the}} track).|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 2012, {{he died in}} a {{car crash}} under {{controversial}} circumstances. The Cuban government stated that the driver had lost control of the vehicle and collided with a tree, while Payá's children and one of the car's passengers asserted that the <b>car</b> <b>had</b> been deliberately run off of the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} 25-year-old {{substitute}} teacher from Kingston, Amy Glauner, was found on Joppenbergh after an October 1998 search. Police determined that she died of head trauma following a fall. Her <b>car</b> <b>had</b> been found {{in a parking lot}} by the mountain.|$|E
25|$|The {{first digit}} {{identifies}} the car number, where the trailer <b>cars</b> <b>has</b> a 3, {{the second and}} fifth <b>cars</b> <b>has</b> a 1 & the middle <b>cars</b> <b>has</b> a 2.|$|R
50|$|The M1 <b>car</b> <b>has</b> two single-arm pantographs, and the M2 <b>car</b> <b>has</b> one.|$|R

5|$|The concept <b>car</b> <b>had</b> a Connolly Leather-trimmed {{interior}} {{produced by}} Callow & Maddox, and was fitted with {{front and rear}} heated windscreens, electric windows, air conditioning, heated electrically adjustable seats with an Alpine CD player. The dashboard was supplied by Veglia.|$|E
5|$|After the Hungarian Grand Prix on 13 August, {{five teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at the Silverstone Circuit on 15–17 August. McLaren test driver Olivier Panis was fastest {{on the first}} day, ahead of Frentzen. Williams test driver Bruno Junqueira's <b>car</b> <b>had</b> a water leak, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Panis remained the fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen's Arrows <b>car</b> <b>had</b> a sensor failure, limiting his team's testing time; the car's floor {{had to be removed}} to install a new sensor. Panis was again fastest {{on the final day of}} testing. Ferrari opted to test the suspension and tyres of Michael Schumacher's car at the Fiorano Circuit. Schumacher later moved to the Mugello Circuit, with Barrichello conducting engine and setup tests, and Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer remained at Fiorano for development work on new car components. Prost opted to test at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza on 17–18 August with driver Jean Alesi. Benetton conducted a five-day, one-car test at the Danielson Circuit, with test driver Mark Webber on aerodynamic development for the first four days and Alexander Wurz concentrating on practice starts the last day.|$|E
5|$|At a {{press conference}} {{arranged}} by Cuban authorities on 30 July, Modig and Carromero stated that the crash was an accident and no other car was involved. Speaking in 2013 to the Washington Post, Carromero denied this version of events, stating {{that he had been}} drugged and threatened by Cuban authorities who had forced him to make a false statement. He stated instead that the <b>car</b> <b>had</b> been rammed by another vehicle with Cuban government license plates, causing the fatal crash.|$|E
5000|$|Electric and nitro <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> come a {{long way}} in terms of power. Electric <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> gone from non-rebuildable brushed motors and NiCad {{batteries}} to brushless motors and LiPo. Nitro <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> gone from small engines to huge [...]36-.80 engines that are used in big monster trucks.|$|R
2500|$|Weakening (W) {{allows the}} {{addition}} of arbitrary elements to a sequence. [...] Intuitively, this is allowed in the antecedent because we can always restrict the scope of our proof (if all <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> wheels, then it's {{safe to say that}} all black <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> wheels); and in the succedent because we can always allow for alternative conclusions (if all <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> wheels, then it's safe to say that all <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> either wheels or wings).|$|R
50|$|The KuMoHa 719 <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> one PS16 lozenge-type pantograph. Sets H10 to H18 have single-arm pantographs. The KuHa 718 <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> a toilet.|$|R
5|$|KCMG's No 47 <b>car</b> <b>had</b> its {{qualifying}} lap times disallowed {{after it}} was discovered in post-qualifying scrutineering that the vehicle's skid block had insufficient rigidity and had been excessively flexible. The penalty meant Team SARD Morand's No. 43 car was promoted to second in LMP2 and the No. 47 entry was required to start from the pit lane with a 30-second time penalty.|$|E
5|$|Kovalainen's <b>car</b> <b>had</b> {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres {{at the front}} of the car during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun in the opposite direction to which they were designed, causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause of the problem, had adjusted his front wing to compensate for the understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1982, a train derailed at a {{malfunctioning}} crossover switch {{south of}} the Federal Triangle station. In attempting to restore the train to the rails, supervisors failed to notice that another <b>car</b> <b>had</b> also derailed. The other rail car slid off the track and hit a tunnel support, killing three people and injuring 25. Coincidentally, this crash occurred about 30 minutes after Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the nearby 14th Street Bridge during a major snowstorm.|$|E
50|$|The end <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> {{conventional}} 2+2 abreast unidirectional seating, {{and a small}} lounge space {{behind the}} driving cabs. The inner <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> semi-open compartments.|$|R
5000|$|All <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> Westinghouse XDA1 controls. 6001-6488 had Westinghouse 1432 motors, all {{following}} <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> General Electric 1220 motors.

50|$|The 1000 and 1030 series <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> {{unidirectional}} reclining seating with a {{seat pitch}} of 1000 mm, while the 1200 and 1230 series <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> flip-over transverse seating.|$|R
5|$|That night, {{the agents}} {{investigate}} the forest; Scully discovers strange ash on the ground, leading her to suspect cult activity. However, a local detective arrives and orders them to leave. Driving {{back to their}} motel, Mulder and Scully encounter {{a flash of light}} at the spot their <b>car</b> <b>had</b> malfunctioned earlier. When the car loses power, Mulder realizes that nine minutes disappeared after the flash, a phenomenon reported by alien abductees.|$|E
5|$|The FBB {{closed the}} Security Zone checkpoints, {{but by then}} Stauffenberg's <b>car</b> <b>had</b> been let through two of them {{as he left the}} area. Contrary to the imposed {{security}} doctrines in place, Stauffenberg and his adjutant were able to pass through the closed Security Zone 3 checkpoint and proceed to the airport for the flight to Berlin. They succeeded in getting away before clarity of the events could be established by the military and security personnel at the Wolf's Lair complex.|$|E
5|$|The United States adopted half-tracks {{in large}} numbers {{as they could be}} built more quickly and cheaply by {{civilian}} vehicle producers than vehicles from the established armored vehicle manufacturers. The M2 Half Track <b>Car</b> <b>had</b> first been intended as an artillery tractor, but was also used for carrying the machine gun squads of armored infantry regiments and for reconnaissance units until faster and better-armed M8 Greyhound armored cars were available.|$|E
50|$|The {{passenger}} stock consists of 149 high-floor, bi-directional, single-articulated cars, each 28 metres (92 feet) long. The <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> four doors {{on each side}} and each train is normally composed of two cars coupled together. A third <b>car</b> <b>has</b> been added on the busiest routes since 2010. Each <b>car</b> <b>has</b> 70 seats and has a total capacity of 284 passengers.|$|R
50|$|The two M1 <b>cars</b> each <b>have</b> two single-arm pantographs, and the M1' <b>car</b> <b>has</b> one.|$|R
50|$|Another {{mechanical}} {{difference between}} the two types of car is that the 'D' end <b>car</b> <b>has</b> a spring-loaded buffer at the driving cab end whereas the 'A' end <b>car</b> <b>has</b> a solid buffer.|$|R
5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second <b>car</b> <b>had</b> stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of clergy was {{severely}} limited, Soegijapranata roamed from church to church to attend to parishioners, actively preaching and serving as the de facto head of the Catholic Church in the country; this was in part to counteract rumours of his detention by the Japanese. He travelled by foot, bicycle, and carriage, as his <b>car</b> <b>had</b> been seized. He sent pastors to apostolic prefectures in Bandung, Surabaya, and Malang {{to deal with the}} lack of clergy there. Soegijapranata worked to ensure that the seminary would continue to produce new pastors and appointed the recently ordained Father Hardjawasita as its rector. He also granted native priests the authority to perform marriages. To calm the Catholic populace, he visited their homes and convinced them that the streets were safe.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the United States National Anthem, the children of the late sports marketer Ed Shull gave the command for drivers to start their engines. On the pace laps, Johnson, after changing his engine, and teammate Earnhardt, who had to move to a back-up <b>car,</b> <b>had</b> to fall behind all the other drivers in the event after doing major changes during practice. At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, he drove to pit road for a pit stop.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cars</b> <b>have</b> a five-digit number: {{the second}} digit {{identifies}} {{the role of}} car, the last three digits the set number (001 - 116, 301 - 567). A-end <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> odd numbers, D-end even numbers.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the <b>car</b> <b>has</b> contributed to changes in employment distribution, shopping patterns, social interactions, manufacturing priorities and city planning; increasing use of <b>cars</b> <b>has</b> reduced the roles of walking, horses and railroads.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} stage, {{the first major}} climb, the Ballon d'Alsace, made its debut. Four riders were the fastest climbers: Trousselier, René Pottier, Cornet and Aucouturier. Of those four, Trousselier and Aucouturier {{were the first to}} be dropped, and Cornet had to drop in the final kilometers. The top was {{therefore}} reached first by René Pottier, without dismounting, at an average speed of 20km/h. Cornet, who reached the top second, had to wait 20 minutes for his bicycle with higher gear, because his support <b>car</b> <b>had</b> broken down.|$|E
5|$|Ole Ewé, {{a former}} member of BOPA—another group in the Danish {{resistance}} movement—disagreed with the description of the attempt to kill the Gestapo leader Hoffman on the Roskildevej road. In the film, the <b>car</b> <b>had</b> Nazi flags, and a soldier and his son are killed by resistance gunfire. Ewé said that on that day he and other BOPA members were enlisted to kill Arno Oskar Hammeken, a Gestapo informer. Flammen, who also received tips about the informer's whereabouts, appeared there and shot up the car. Ewé said that the man in the car was in civilian clothes and there were no Nazi flags on the car.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1975, Catholic civilians Colm McCartney and Sean Farmer {{were stopped}} {{in their car}} at another fake British Army {{checkpoint}} at Altnamachin (near Newtownhamilton). They were driving home from a Gaelic football match in Dublin. The two men were found shot dead nearby. Earlier that night, three RUC officers in an unmarked <b>car</b> <b>had</b> been stopped at the same checkpoint but allowed through. However, the officers suspected that the checkpoint was fake. After receiving radio confirmation {{that there were no}} authorised checkpoints in the area that night, they reported the incident and requested help from the British Army to investigate it, but no action was taken. RUC officer John Weir claims that UDR corporal Robert McConnell was involved in the attack.|$|E
50|$|Standard class <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> regular 2+2 seating. The two bilevel <b>cars</b> <b>had</b> Green (first class) {{accommodation}} on {{the upper}} decks with 2+1 seating, and standard-class accommodation on the lower decks, also with 2+1 seating.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>car</b> <b>has</b> a motor {{developing}} [...] and 380 Nm torque, {{allowing the}} car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h {{in less than four}} seconds.

The <b>car</b> <b>has</b> a brake operated energy recovery system, developed from the Rechargeable Energy Storage System (RESS) technology developed for Formula E cars.|$|R
2500|$|Here’s an example: Suppose we {{see before}} us {{a parking lot}} full of {{hundreds}} of cars. We decide {{to go around the}} entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After an hour or so we have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> bad tires”. Or we could say: “It’s not true that ‘All the <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> good tires”. Let us go to another lot. Here we discover that “All the <b>cars</b> <b>have</b> good tires.” We might say, “There’s not a single instance of a <b>car</b> <b>having</b> a bad tire.” [...] Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.|$|R
