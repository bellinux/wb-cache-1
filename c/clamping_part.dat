40|$|A 3 ’-deoxy- 3 ’-C-methylenephosphonate {{modified}} diribonucleotide {{is highly}} resistant to degradation by spleen phosphodiesterase and not cleaved {{at all by}} snake venom phosphodiesterase. Despite that both the vicinal 2 -hydroxy nucleophile and the 5 ’-oxyanion leaving group are intact, the 3 ’-methylenephosponate RNA modification is also highly resistant towards the action of RNase A. Several different approaches were explored for conjugation of oligoethers to PNA with internally or N-terminal placed diaminopropionic acid residues. Using a post PNA-assembly procedures oligoether attachment to both N-terminal and sidechain amino groups was achieved. Use of a new oligoether functionalized amino acid allows inclusion of oligoether conjugates during on-line machine assisted synthesis, allowing combination of methods for attachment of different oligoethers and co-conjugation of neocuproine cleaver. We have previously shown that PNA-neocuproine conjugates can act as artificial RNA restriction enzymes (PNAzyme). In the present study we have additionally conjugated the PNA with different entities and also constructed systems where the PNA is designed to clamp the target RNA forming a triplex. Some conjugations are detrimental for the activity while most are silent which means that conjugation {{can be done to}} alter physical properties without losing activity. Conjugation with a single oligoether close to the neocuproine does enhance the rate almost two folds compared to the system without the oligoether. The systems designed to clamp the RNA target by forming a triplex are effective if the <b>clamping</b> <b>part</b> is not too long. Changing the direction of a closing base pair, from a GC to a CG pair, enhances the rate of cleavage with a clamping PNAzyme and without compromising the selectivity, leading to the so far most efficient artificial nuclease reported. Tris(2 -aminobenzimidazole) conjugates with antisense oligonucleotides are effective site-specific metal-free RNA cleavers. Here we investigate conjugates with peptide nucleic acids (PNA). In a first study we show that RNA degradation occurs with similar rates and substrate specificities as in experiments with DNA conjugates. In a second study we show that tris(2 -aminobenzimidazole) based artificial nucleases cleave RNA substrates, which form a bulge upon binding to the PNA, with turnover of substrate and a cleavage rate that is also dependent on the bulge sequence. Two methods of analysis for the kinetics, based on IE-HPLC separation of oligonucleotide fragments and analysis of Cy 5 -labelled oligonucleotide fragments by denaturating PAGE on a DNA sequencer respectively are also compared. To be able to target microRNAs also at stages where these are in a double stranded or hairpin form we have looked at BisPNA designed to clamp the target and give sufficient affinity to allow for strand invasion. We show that BisPNA complexes are more stable with RNA than with DNA. In addition, 24 -mer BisPNA (AntimiR) constructs form complexes with a hairpin RNA that is a model of the microRNA miR- 376 b, suggesting that PNA-clamping may be an effective way of targeting microRNAs...|$|E

40|$|Force-measuring clamps {{have been}} invented to {{facilitate}} and simplify {{the task of}} measuring the forces or pressures applied to <b>clamped</b> <b>parts.</b> There is a critical need to measure clamping forces or pressures in some applications for example, while bonding sensors to substrates or while clamping any sensitive or delicate parts. Many manufacturers of adhesives and sensors recommend clamping at specific pressures while bonding sensors or during adhesive bonding between parts in general. In {{the absence of a}} force-measuring clamp, measurement of clamping force can be cumbersome at best because of the need for additional load sensors and load-indicating equipment. One prior method of measuring clamping force involved the use of load washers or miniature load cells in combination with external power sources and load-indicating equipment. Calibrated spring clamps have also been used. Load washers and miniature load cells constitute additional <b>clamped</b> <b>parts</b> in load paths and can add to the destabilizing effects of loading mechanisms. Spring clamps can lose calibration quickly through weakening of the springs and are limited to the maximum forces that the springs can apply. The basic principle of a force-measuring clamp can be implemented on a clamp of almost any size and can enable measurement of a force of almost any magnitude. No external equipment is needed because the component(s) for transducing the clamping force and the circuitry for supplying power, conditioning the output of the transducers, and displaying the measurement value are all housed on the clamp. In other words, a force-measuring clamp is a complete force-application and force-measurement system all in one package. The advantage of unitary packaging of such a system is that it becomes possible to apply the desired clamping force or pressure with precision and ease...|$|R

40|$|A {{design of}} a micro {{latching}} fastener [...] a micro "mouse trap" [...] is presented, which has self-closing compliant latches that clamp a free planar part inserted between them. The selfclosing of the latches is induced by the insertion of the part which releases the potential energy stored in the "cocked" state of the device, {{in the manner of}} a mouse trap. The closed latch can re-open by cocking the micro mouse trap. The selfclosing action of the micro mouse trap allows the inaccurate insertion of the free part and leads to very accurate final positioning, with the insertion force required to induce the selfclosing being very small.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} years welded {{titanium}} components have been extensively applied in aeronautical and aerospace industries because of their high specific strength and corrosion resistance properties. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid state welding process, currently industrially utilized for difficult to be welded or “unweldable ” aluminum and magnesium alloys, able to overcome the drawbacks of traditional fusion welding techniques. When titanium alloys are concerned, additional problems arise {{as the need for}} very high strength and high temperature resistant tools, gas shield protection and high stiffness machines. Additionally, the process is characterized by an elevated sensitivity to temperature variations, which, in turn, depends on the main operative parameters. Numerical simulation represents the optimal solution in order to perform an effective process optimization with affordable costs. In this paper, a fully 3 D FEM model for the FSW process is proposed, that is thermo-mechanically coupled and with rigid-viscoplastic material behavior. Experimental <b>clamping</b> <b>parts</b> are modeled and the thermal loads are calculated at the varying of the cooling strategy.

To achieve that goal, we present a study of the Young's modulus E of electroplated nickel used in the LIGA technique. This mechanical parameter was obtained by the analysis of vibration frequencies of free-clamped microcantilevers.

The experimental results are compared to the frequencies derived from a pure elastic finite element model. The variation of the boundary conditions, in particular the description of the <b>clamped</b> <b>part</b> of the devices, leads to a good agreement between the experimental and the simulation. The correlation between these two methods leads to the determination of the Young's modulus of the device.

These results are in good agreement with our previous values obtained by steady-state bending tests and other works reported in the literature.

40|$|Scheduling is a {{key factor}} for {{productivity}} and competitiveness of corporations. Effective scheduling can improve on-time delivery, reduce inventory, cut lead time, and improve resource utilization. Production scheduling, however, has been widely recognized to be extremely difficult because of its combinatorial nature. In this dissertation, optimization-based solution methodologies are developed for the scheduling of job shops with batch machines, machine setup requirements, and machining centers. ^ Job shop is a typical environment for manufacturing low-volume and high-variety parts. In a job shop, parts with various due dates and priorities are to be processed on diverse types of machines. Unlike most machines that can process one part at a time, a batch machine can simultaneously process multiple parts with the same processing requirement in a 2 ̆ 2 batch. 2 ̆ 2 For some machines, significant setup time is required in-between the processing of {{two different types of}} parts, and parts of the same type can be processed back-to-back with negligible adjustment time in-between. Trade-off among efficiency and due date performance is often the difficulty encountered in industries. A machining center is an advanced NC machine that can continuously perform a variety of operations on a part by automatically changing the cutting tools. It has several pallets to hold fixtures which in turn <b>clamp</b> <b>parts</b> for processing, and a tool magazine to store the cutting tools needed. Machine setups, lot split, tool loading, and coordination of multiple resources are the key issues addressed. ^ The scheduling problems are modeled as integer programs with a 2 ̆ 2 separable 2 ̆ 2 structure that is critical for efficiently solving the problems. Lagrangian relaxation is used to decompose the problems into smaller and easier subproblems with intuitive appeal. A new algorithm is presented that combines dynamic programming for solving low level subproblems and interleaved conjugate gradient method for high level problem. The new method significantly has improved convergence and computation efficiency, and provides high quality solutions for the scheduling of job shops with batch and setup machines, and in the scheduling of a machining center. ...|$|R

Some terminals are already capable of actively correcting the loosening of the mechanical clamping. In this diploma thesis an active terminal based on shape memory alloy was designed with the knowledge of the previous solutions of terminals and the theoretical background. The compensation capability is due to a cylinder made from shape memory alloy, which is located in a drill hole on the bottom of a screw. In regular operation mode, the active terminal acts like a common screw terminal. If there is an excessive raise in temperature due to the loosening of a condutor in the terminal, the previously compressed shape memory alloy in the martensite phase will phase change into the austenite phase. The shape memory alloy cyclinder tries to expand to restore his pre-compression form. Due to this, there is a raise in the contact force which will stay after the terminal cooled down because of the restoration of the contact.
