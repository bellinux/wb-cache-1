The settlement work story I was inclined to dismiss as a myth. Settlement work in a beautiful woman generally means <b>crowsfeet</b> or a broken heart. Jane, according to my sight and belief, possessed neither.|$|E

[...] "Modern {{methods of}} massage and cold cream have kept away the <b>crowsfeet,</b> and {{fortunately}} I had the Rogerson complexion to start with. You wouldn't think I was really thirty-eight, would you? Thirty-eight! Twenty years ago I thought anybody who was thirty-eight {{was a perfect}} female Methuselah. And now I feel so horribly, ridiculously young, Louisa. Every morning when I get up I have to say solemnly to myself three times, 'You're an old maid, Nancy Rogerson,' to tone myself down to anything like a becoming attitude for the day." ...|$|E
60|$|Years {{had told}} upon George {{more than they}} had upon Philip, and, though there were no touches of grey in the flaming red of his hair, the bloodshot eyes, and the {{puckered}} <b>crowsfeet</b> beneath them, {{to say nothing of}} the slight but constant trembling of the hand, all showed that he was a man well on in middle-life, and who had lived every day of it. Time, too, had made the face more intensely unpleasant and vulgar-looking than ever. Such Caresfoot characteristics as it possessed were, year by year, giving place, in an increasingly greater degree, to the kitchen-maid strain introduced by the mother. In short, George Caresfoot did not even look a gentleman, whereas Philip certainly did.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah, I {{remember}} now,' {{replied the}} donkey, 'but the stones return so quickly to their places, that you {{certainly would be}} crushed to death unless {{you have in your}} hands a bunch of <b>crowsfoot</b> and of five-leaved trefoil.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Weatherley sat quite {{still in}} his chair. He had {{obviously}} forgotten his secretary's presence in the room, and Arnold, who had seated himself at his desk and was engaged in sorting out some papers, took the opportunity {{now and then to}} glance up and scrutinize with some attention his employer's features. There were certainly traces there of the change at which Mr. Jarvis had hinted. Mr. Weatherley had the appearance {{of a man who had}} once been florid and prosperous and comfortable-looking, but who had been visited by illness or some sort of anxiety. His cheeks were still fat, but they hung down toward the jaw, and his eyes were marked with <b>crowsfeet.</b> His color was unhealthy. He certainly had no longer the look of a prosperous and contented man.|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} to tell how old this Jackson was; for he had no beard, and no wrinkles, except small <b>crowsfeet</b> about the eyes. He might have seen thirty, or perhaps fifty years. But according to his own account, he had been to sea ever since he was eight years old, when he first went as a cabin-boy in an Indiaman, and ran away at Calcutta. And according to his own account, too, he had passed through every kind of dissipation and abandonment in the worst parts of the world. He had served in Portuguese slavers on the coast of Africa; and with a diabolical relish used to tell of the middle-passage, where the slaves were stowed, heel and point, like logs, and the suffocated and dead were unmanacled, and weeded out from the living every morning, before washing down the decks; how he had been in a slaving schooner, which being chased by an English cruiser off Cape Verde, received three shots in her hull, which raked through and through a whole file of slaves, that were chained.|$|E

60|$|He did {{not dare}} to seek too near Plouhinec, lest {{somebody}} who knew the story might guess what he was doing, so he went away further towards the south, where the air was softer and the plants are always green. From the instant it was light, till the last rays had faded out of the sky, he searched every inch of ground where the magic plants might grow; he scarcely gave himself a minute to eat and drink, but at length he found the <b>crowsfoot</b> in a little hollow! Well, that was certainly a great deal, but after all, the <b>crowsfoot</b> was of no use without the trefoil, and there was so little time left.|$|R

50|$|Argyrodendron peralatum is {{a species}} of large trees, of the plant family Malvaceae. The trees are more {{commonly}} known as in the Red Tulip Oak or Red <b>Crowsfoot.</b> They grow naturally only (endemic) in north eastern Queensland, Australia between Tully and Cooktown. The most distinctive feature of Argyrodendron peralatum is that the trunks form large characteristic buttresses.|$|R
50|$|The Germans dropped <b>crowsfeet.</b> These {{were made}} from two {{segments}} of sheet metal welded together into a tetrapod with four barbed points and then painted in camouflage colours. They came in two sizes with a side length of either 3 or 2+1/2 in. They were dropped from aircraft in containers {{the same size as}} a 500 kg bomb and were dispersed by a small explosive charge. They were used to attack airfields and roads with a view to bursting tires.|$|E

50|$|Argyrodendron actinophyllum {{is a large}} {{rainforest}} tree, {{native to}} eastern Australia. Common names include black booyong, blackjack, blush tulip oak, <b>crowsfoot</b> elm and Mackay tulip oak. The heartwood is coloured pink-brown. One of the most distinctive features of Argyrodendron actinophyllum is the large deep green leaves that radiate out from central stems - hence the name actino=ray, phyllum=leaf. Also the trunks form large characteristic buttresses.|$|R

6000|$|When {{the beggar}} knew that Bernez {{would give him}} no trouble, he told him how, during that very night, the treasures under the stones would be uncovered, and how in a very few minutes they could take enough to make them both rich for life. But he kept silence as to the fate that awaited {{the man who was}} without the <b>crowsfoot</b> and the trefoil, and Bernez thought that nothing but boldness and quickness were necessary. So he said: ...|$|R
50|$|Diphasiastrum digitatum {{is known}} as groundcedar, running cedar or <b>crowsfoot,</b> along {{with other members of}} its genus, but the common name fan clubmoss can be used to refer to it specifically. It is the most common species of Diphasiastrum in North America. It is a type of plant known as a clubmoss, which is within one of the three main {{divisions}} of living vascular plants. It was formerly included in the superspecies Diphasiastrum complanatum. For many years, this species was known as Lycopodium flabelliforme or Lycopodium digitatum.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not me!' {{answered}} the sorcerer, {{holding up the}} <b>crowsfoot</b> and the five-leaved trefoil, 'for these will preserve me. But {{in order to keep}} my riches, I was obliged to sacrifice a Christian to the stones, and an evil fate threw you in my way.' And as he spoke he stretched out the magic herbs to the stones, which were advancing rapidly. As if acknowledging a power greater than theirs, the monstrous things instantly parted to the right and left of the wizard, but closed their ranks again as they approached Bernez.|$|R
40|$|Summary This paper {{assesses the}} changes in weed man-agement {{technologies}} for cropping that have occurred over the last twelve years. Information has been sourced from papers from the last four Australian Weeds Confer-ences and the First International Weed Control Con-gress. Management technologies have been placed into four categories. Bio-technologies/control, cultural/mechanical management technology, computer technology modelling and synthesized herbicides and within these broad cat-egories {{there are a number}} of sub-categories (Table 1). BIO-TECHNOLOGIES/CONTROL Biological control The number of papers on new or ex-isting agents for biological control more than doubled at the 1990 conference and has remained static since then.

60|$|I came amid these {{reflections}} to {{the brow}} of a hill, from which I {{expected to see}} Glentanner, a modest-looking yet comfortable house, its walls covered with the most productive fruit-trees {{in that part of}} the country, and screened from the most stormy quarters of the horizon by a deep and ancient wood, which overhung the neighbouring hill. The house was gone; a great part of the wood was felled; and instead of the gentlemanlike mansion, shrouded and embosomed among its old hereditary trees, stood Castle Treddles, a huge lumping four-square pile of freestone, as bare as my nail, except for a paltry edging of decayed and lingering exotics, with an impoverished lawn stretched before it, which, instead of boasting deep green tapestry, enamelled with daisies and with <b>crowsfoot</b> and cowslips, showed an extent of nakedness, raked, indeed, and levelled, but where the sown grasses had failed with drought, and the earth, retaining its natural complexion, seemed nearly as brown and bare as when it was newly dug up.|$|R

'"With all his {{conscience}} and one eye askew"-- [...] Love, let me quote these lines, {{that you may}} learn [...] A man is likewise counsel for himself, [...] Too often, in that silent court of yours-- [...] "With all {{his conscience}} and one eye askew, [...] So false, he partly took himself for true; [...] Whose pious talk, when most his heart was dry, [...] Made wet the crafty <b>crowsfoot</b> round his eye; [...] Who, never naming God except for gain, [...] So never took that useful name in vain; [...] Made Him his catspaw and the Cross his tool, [...] And Christ the bait to trap his dupe and fool; [...] Nor deeds of gift, but gifts of grace he forged, [...] And snakelike slimed his victim ere he gorged; [...] And oft at Bible meetings, o'er the rest [...] Arising, did his holy oily best, [...] Dropping the too rough H in Hell and Heaven, [...] To spread the Word by which himself had thriven."

50|$|He next {{became a}} manager, opening theatres at Penrith, Hexham, Barnard Castle, and Bishop Auckland. He lost money, and joined Mr. Brunton's company of {{players on the}} Norwich circuit, and took to comic parts. His first {{appearance}} in London was made at Covent Garden on 1 October 1800 as Bob Acres, in which he succeeded remarkably, and as Crack in the musical farce of the 'Turnpike Gate.' By {{the middle of his}} second season Mr. Harris cancelled the original arrangement for five years by re-engaging him for seven, with an increased salary. In certain classes of character he secured a position of recognised preeminence. Oxberry (p. 278) calls him 'unquestionably the best drunken man on the stage.' At Covent Garden Theatre, saving only for a brief professional visit to America in 1832, Blanchard remained continuously for thirty-four years. He was especially noted for his Shakespearian impersonations of Fluellen, Sir Hugh Evans, Menenius, and Polonius. According to Leigh Hunt, his best performance was the Marquis de Grand-Château in the musical toy show of the 'Cabinet.' Leigh Hunt also praises highly his Russett in Colman's 'The Jealous Wife.' Similar testimony to his skill is borne by all the best dramatic critics of the time. The last character created by him was that of Counsellor <b>Crowsfoot</b> in Douglas Jerrold's comedy of 'Nell Gwynne,' produced at Covent Garden Theatre on 9 January 1833, which was warmly spoken of in the 'Athenæum,' 12 January 1833.|$|R
