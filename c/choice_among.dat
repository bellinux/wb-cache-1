5|$|Denmark's first churches {{from the}} 9th century were built of timber {{and have not}} survived. Hundreds of stone churches in the Romanesque style {{were built in the}} 12th and 13th centuries. They had a flat-ceilinged nave and chancel with small rounded windows and round arches. Granite {{boulders}} and limestone were initially the preferred building materials, but after brick production reached Denmark {{in the middle of the}} 12th century, brick quickly became the material of <b>choice.</b> <b>Among</b> the finest examples of brick Romanesque buildings are St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted (c. 1170) and the unique Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg (c. 1200) with its five tall towers.|$|E

The record number of theaters was later beaten by , which was released in 4,362 theaters in the United States109 more than Spider-Man 3. Tracking data {{a month before the}} U.S. release reflected over 90% awareness and over 20% first <b>choice</b> <b>among</b> moviegoers, statistics that estimated an opening weekend of over $100 million for Spider-Man 3. Online tickets for Spider-Man 3 were reported on April 23, 2007 to have been purchased at a faster ratethree times at Movietickets.com and four times at Fandangothan online ticket sales for Spider-Man 2. On May 2, 2007, Fandango reported the sales rate as six times greater than the rate for Spider-Man 2. The strong ticket sales caused theaters to add 3:00 AM showings following the May 4, 2007 midnight showing to accommodate the demand.|$|E
5|$|The film's opening was {{considered}} a hit taking into account how the story was not based on a popular existing source, and the film itself was void of the franchise's main character, Harry Potter. It was the top <b>choice</b> <b>among</b> moviegoers, representing 47% of the weekend's total $157.6 million tickets sales. On its second Friday, it had a gradual drop of 37% ($18.5 million) from the week before, the second best Friday drop for any Harry Potter film, behind The Philosopher's Stone. This was {{in part due to}} Black Friday, the most lucrative day of the Thanksgiving Day stretch. It ended up grossing $45.1 million in its second weekend (a drop of just 39.4%), finishing 2nd at the box office behind newcomer Moana.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all other}} Pokémon RPGs, Diamond and Pearl {{begin in the}} protagonist's hometown. After viewing a {{television}} report about a media-conducted search for a Red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake (Johto's Lake of Rage), the protagonist {{and his or her}} best friend travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Starly, the protagonist and his or her rival examine the case. The player is then given a <b>choice</b> <b>among</b> the three Pokémon found in the briefcase (Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup) with which to battle the Starly. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor.

40|$|This paper {{integrates}} reference-dependent preferences into joint mod-elling of both revealed- and stated-choice data. We applied {{our model}} to revealed <b>choices</b> <b>among</b> new vehicles and stated <b>choices</b> <b>among</b> con-ventional, hybrid, biodiesel, and electric vehicles. The hypothesis of reference-dependence {{in the price}} attribute was supported by our data. For other attributes reference dependence was insignificant. The final model showed that individuals were loss averse. The inclusion of ref-erence dependence did change estimates of the fuel-specific constants significantly. An illustration {{showed that even though}} individuals were loss averse it did not affect calculations of overall market shares...|$|R

40|$|Farmers' {{decisions}} to purchase crop insurance and their <b>choices</b> <b>among</b> alternative products are analyzed using a two-stage estimation procedure. The influences of risk perceptions, competing risk management options, as well structural and demographic differences are evaluated. The likelihood for crop insurance usage {{is found to}} be higher for larger, older, less tenured, more highly leveraged farms, and by those with higher perceived yield risks. The marginal effects of size, age, perceived yield risk, perceived importance of risk management activities, and other structural and demographic variables are identified in terms of their influences on <b>choices</b> <b>among</b> alternative crop insurance products.

He named Licata his consigliere, who was a popular <b>choice</b> <b>among</b> the younger family members. When DeSimone's underboss Simone Scozzari was deported to Italy in 1962 for being an illegal immigrant, Nick Licata became DeSimone's underboss.|$|E

25|$|The use of Marian art by Catholics {{worldwide}} accompanies specific {{forms of}} Marian devotion and spirituality.

25|$|A semi-automatic, or self-loading shot gun is {{a firearm}} that {{requires}} only a trigger pull for each round that is fired, unlike a single-action revolver, a pump-action firearm, a bolt-action firearm, or a lever-action firearm, which all require the shooter to chamber each successive round manually. In 1898, John Moses Browning invented the first semi-sutomatic shot gun, later patenting it in 1900. Naming it the Auto-5, Browning's semi-automatic relied on long recoil operation. This design remained the dominant form in semi-automatic shotguns for approximately 50 years, being widely {{used and the}} preferred weapon of <b>choice</b> <b>among</b> soldiers fighting in World War I.
