40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s cross-border co-operations were in the making along the entire Hungarian border. The most significant such cross-border co-operation along the eastern border was the <b>Carpathians</b> <b>Euroregion,</b> that can be regarded as a mega regional model. Later the Hajdú-Bihar – Bihor and the Bihar – Bihor euroregions were established following the model of small regional euroregions. Communities on {{the two sides of the}} Romanian-Hungarian border have the same needs and demands. These could be satisfied with the establishment of an Eurometropolis, an European Regional Co-operation Group. Positive results are suggested by the fact that this form of co-operations has already been used successfully...|$|R

GEOGRAPHY AND TRENDS OF DEVELOPING ETHNIC FESTIVAL TOURISM IN THE UKRAINIAN PART OF THE <b>CARPATHIAN</b> <b>EUROREGION</b> Maria Topornytska* *Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, Ukraine 41, Doroshenko St., UA – 79000 L’viv, Ukraine, Topornytska_Maria@i. ua Abstract Ethnic festivals are the motive basis as well as a resource of tourism, hence they are the object of studying the geography of tourism. Their development is of great importance for the region, results in new tourist destinations and growth of income in the countryside.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the actual state and condition of territorial inequalities at the Romanian-Hungarian border region, which shows - at present - an evident {{advantage of the}} Hungarian side, {{from the point of}} view of complex socio-economical aspects. This advantage is especially outstanding for the Hungarian side in the field of infrastructural supply (drinking water, natural gas, and public sewage networks), but it is valid for some characteristics of human capital, too, (above all, with regard to the illiteracy rate and the proportion of highly skilled persons with bachelor degree). Despite these difficulties, these inequalities are not insurmountable and should not affect efficient cross-border cooperation between the two countries. This regional inventory facilitates the evaluation of the starting-point of this kind of cooperation and also depicts some aspects of the interregional cooperation of the four counties north of the Romanian-Hungarian border region which belong to the <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Euroregion...</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the problem}} of a rural region in the peripheral position. Bojkovice micro-region on the Czech (Moravian) -Slovak border has been chosen as a case study. Economic transformation of productive and non-productive branches, demographic development (depopulation and aging) and networking in the area were characterized by using statistical data and field research. Development, understood as improvement in {{quality of life and}} not in sense of quantitative growth, is highlighted with regard to the changing perception of the countryside. The question remains: how to use peripherality for prosperity? Peripheral countryside is known as “the right countryside” in comparison to suburbanized and globalized countryside in core regions. Based on the research, production embedded in local sources and traditions, ecological agriculture using the protection of landscape and soft tourism are proposed as solutions. Networking like the association of municipalities, LEADER local action group or White <b>Carpathian</b> <b>Euroregion</b> could be the instruments of micro-regional collaboration. The human and social factors seem to be more important than objective conditions. Long-term population stability is the main advantage. However, a lower level of formal education could be a problem. The character of social capital is considered as a decisive circumstance - whether it is passive social capital resistant to outer innovations or active social capital open for now ideas...|$|E
