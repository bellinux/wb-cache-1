Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} plunge milling.

When one tooth of {{the cutting tool}} crosses the minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> boundary, the tool would enter into the ploughing zone with no chip formation. Therefore, it is significant to predict the ploughing volume and forces in micro-milling. In this work, the ploughing mechanism for micro-milling is proposed by considering the minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> effects. A 3 D chip geometry is developed to calculate <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> ploughing volume and ploughing forces in micro 5 -axis flat-end milling with a flat-end mill. The local parallel sliced tool based method is then applied to get cutter-workpiece engagement domain where the cutting flutes entry and exit the workpiece, minimum <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> and depth of cut are required to predict ploughing forces. Local parallel sliced method divides the cutting tool into several slices that are perpendicular to the tool axis along the local coordinate system.

40|$|Grinding {{is now a}} well {{established}} process utilised for both stock removal and finish applications. Although significant research is performed in this field, grinding still experiences problems with burn and high forces {{which can lead to}} poor quality components and damage to equipment. This generally occurs in grinding when the process deviates from its safe working conditions. In milling, <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters are utilised to predict and maintain process outputs leading to improved control of the process. This thesis looks to further the knowledge of the relationship between <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> and the grinding process outputs to provide an increased predictive and maintenance modelling capability. Machining trials were undertaken using different <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters to understand how these affect the process outputs. The <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters were maintained at different grinding wheel diameters for a constant productivity process to determine the impact of <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> at a constant material removal rate. Additional testing using a modified pin on disc test rig was performed to provide further information on process variables. The different <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> parameters provide control of different process outputs in the grinding process. These relationships can be described using contact layer theory and heat flux partitioning. The contact layer is defined as the immediate layer beneath the contact arc at the wheel workpiece interface. The size of the layer governs the force experienced during the process. The rate of contact layer removal directly impacts the net power required from the system. It was also found that the specific grinding energy of a process is more dependent on the productivity of a grinding process rather than the value of <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> Changes in <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> at constant material removal rate result in microscale changes in the rate of contact layer removal when compared to changes in process productivity.

The prediction of cutting forces derives from a simplified orthogonal process. A finite element (FE) model is employed to simulate two-dimensional cutting forces in orthogonal microcutting, with the ploughing and tool edge effect taken into consideration. The flow stress of workpiece material is modelled by using the Johnson–Cook constitutive material law. The FE model is used to evaluate the critical <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> and to extract the cutting force coefficients. The cutting force coefficients are modelled as a function of instantaneous uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> which is independent of cutting speed but influenced by tool edge radius. To rectify the issue of sharp increase of the force coefficients under very small uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness,</b> a critical uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> value is introduced and the coefficients are adjusted by using a tangent slope for uncut <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> smaller than the critical value.

To that end, an experimental setup has been developed in which the chipping can be performed under very well defined conditions. In this setup it is possible to control the rate of indentation of the chipping tool and also to measure the force on the tool. The setup admits also that the angle of the wood specimen with respect to the cutting plane can be varied in both a horizontal and a vertical plane. To determine the deformations, a Digital Speckle Photography (DSP) equipment is used, which together with image processing software makes it possible to determine the strain field {{on the surface of the}} wood specimen. One observation that can be made in these studies is that prior to the creation of a chip, there is a localization of strains in a thin region starting from the edge of the tool and directed parallel to the grain.

40|$|Main {{objectives}} of the present work are characterisation of the chip formation mechanisms and tribological process behaviour in grinding at low speeds. The technological area of interest was marked off by cutting speeds of some few meters per second and depths of cut in the magnitude of a micron typical machining parameters {{in a number of}} abrasive gear finishing processes, e. g. gear honing. The chip formation mechanisms have been investigated by single grain scratching tests. It has been shown, that low cutting speeds in combination with small <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> enhance micro-ploughing and make the chip formation less efficient. Higher values for cutting speed and larger <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> result in increasing micro-cutting. For the most efficient chip formation, the values for cutting speed and <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> have to be chosen as high as possible. Investigations of the tribological process behaviour have been carried out in grinding experiments. They were aimed at quantifying the influence of friction and tool specification on the effective material removal. Experimental findings allow to differentiate the friction influence dependent on the chosen cutting speed and (equivalent) <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> by application of the Stribeck diagram. The most efficient material removal was achieved at a boundary lubrication condition, when the cutting speed and <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> were set at their highest values. This result confirms the single grain tests findings. Applying an abrasive wear map, process behaviour of different tool specifications at constant grinding conditions was found out to correlate with the effective single grain <b>chip</b> <b>thickness.</b> The higher it is, the higher are the process friction, effective material removal and tool wear. At low <b>chip</b> <b>thickness</b> values, due to dominating micro-ploughing, high compressive residual stresses in the workpiece subsurface are induced.

The paper presents a classification of the profile types of cutting edges, which can be divided by form (flat, round), size (small, large, super-large), and symmetry (symmetrical and asymmetrical). The profile of the cutting edge is characterized by the following parameters: profile height, pitch of crests spherical radius of crest. A review of the curved cutting edge profile types allows us to build the geometrical constructions to define a form and the sizes of the chip load made by the cutting edge from a billet. It is shown that parameters of the cutting edge profile influence the form and the sizes (thickness and width) of the chip load. The <b>chip</b> load <b>thickness</b> provided by the curved cutting edge mills exceeds that of observed when using the “smooth” cutting edge mills. A thickening degree of the chip load is changed with changing form and sizes of the cutting edge mill profile. Larger thickening is observed if the chip load is limited from below and from above by the marks of a single tooth (the first or second etc.), and a length of the other teeth marks is minimum. The most achievable <b>chip</b> load <b>thickness</b> is equal to feed per revolution. Studying the references allowed us to formulate some rules to choose a cutting edge profile depending on a type of the processed material and a desirable roughness of the processed surface. It is important to note the following. When choosing a profile of the cutting edge it is possible to be guided by the rule: as a hardness of the processed material increases and a desirable roughness of the processed surface decreases it is necessary to use mills with a profile of the smaller height and pitch. </p...|$|R
