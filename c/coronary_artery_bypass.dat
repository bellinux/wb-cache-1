5|$|<b>Coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>bypass</b> {{surgery is}} one such operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E

Material and methods. 96 patients with stable angina of II-III functional classes received basic therapy included ASA (125 mg daily) to prevent atherothrombotic complications. Platelet ability to aggregation was assessed with laser aggregometer. Resistance to ASA was determined, if cumulative index of platelet aggregation (after stimulation with ADF, 5 μmoll) remain {{on the level of}} 50 - 70 % in spite of ASA. Atherothrombotic complications (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, cerebral stroke) were registered during 24 - 36 months. Results.

Atherothrombotic complications were registered in 66 % of patients with ASA resistance (myocardial infarction or unstable angina were observed in 14 patients of 21 ones) and in 27 % of patients with sensitivity to ASA (myocardial infarction or unstable angina were observed in 19 of 70 ones).

This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of cardiac rehabilitation program's first phase on the level of anxiety among patients hospitalized for <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> <b>bypass</b> surgery. Methods &amp; Materials: In this randomized clinical trial, sixty patients were selected using block sampling and randomly allocated into experimental and control groups. Data were gathered using a questionnaire including the spiel burger's standardized questionnaire. The level of anxiety was measured in both groups. Then, the first phase of cardiac rehabilitation program (including physical exercise, and daily living activities) was carried out in the experimental group. Finally, patients in the experimental group discussed their experiences of surgery. Control group Patients received usual care. The level of anxiety was measured in both groups the day before surgery and at the time of discharge. Data were analyzed using t-test, chi-square, and Friedman tests in SPSS. Results: Findings showed that the level of anxiety had no significant differences between two groups at the time of admission. After implementing the rehabilitation program, the level of anxiety decreased significantly (P&lt; 0. 001) in the experimental group.

Several arteries and veins can be used, however internal mammary artery grafts have demonstrated significantly better long-term patency rates than great saphenous vein grafts. In patients with two or more coronary arteries affected, bypass surgery is associated with higher long-term survival rates compared to percutaneous interventions. In patients with single vessel disease, surgery is comparably safe and effective, and may be a treatment option in selected cases. Bypass surgery has higher costs initially, but becomes cost-effective in the long term. A surgical bypass graft is more invasive initially but bears less risk of recurrent procedures (but these may be again minimally invasive).|$|E
