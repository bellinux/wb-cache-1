40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design (i) a {{stripper}} system where heat is used to strip ammonia (NH{sub 3 }) and carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) from a diluted draw solution; and (ii) a condensation or absorption system where the stripped NH{sub 3 } and CO{sub 2 } are captured in condensed water to form a re-concentrated draw solution. This study supports the Industrial Technologies Program of the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and their Industrial Energy Efficiency Grand Challenge award solicitation. Results from this study show that stimulated Oasys draw solutions composed of a complex electrolyte solution associated with the dissolution of NH{sub 3 } and CO{sub 2 } gas in water can successfully be stripped and fully condensed under standard atmospheric pressure. Stripper bottoms NH{sub 3 } concentration can reliably be reduced to < 1 mg/L, even when starting with liquids that have an NH{sub 3 } mass fraction exceeding 6 % to stimulate diluted draw solution from the forward osmosis membrane component of the process. Concentrated draw solution produced by fully condensing the stripper tops was show to exceed 6 M-C with nitrogen-to-carbon (N:C) molar ratios on the order of two. Reducing the operating pressure of the stripper column serves to reduce the partial vapor pressure of both NH{sub 3 } and CO{sub 2 } in solution and enables lower temperature operation towards integration of industrial low-grade of waste heat. Effective stripping of solutes was observed with operating pressures as low as 100 mbar (3 -inHg). Systems operating at reduced pressure and temperature require additional design considerations to fully condense and absorb these constituents for reuse within the Oasys EO system context. Comparing empirical data with process stimulation models confirmed that several key parameters related to vapor-liquid equilibrium and intrinsic material properties were not accurate. Additional experiments and refinement of material property databases within the chosen process stimulation software was required to improve the reliability of process simulations for engineering design support. Data from experiments was also employed to calculate critical mass transfer and system design parameters (such as the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP)) to aid in process design. When measured in a less than optimal design state for the stripping of NH{sub 3 } and CO{sub 2 } from a simulated dilute draw solution the HETP for one type of <b>commercial</b> <b>stripper</b> packing material was 1. 88 ft/stage. During this study it was observed that the heat duty required to vaporize the draw solution solutes is substantially affected by the amount of water boilup also produced to achieve a low NH{sub 3 } stripper bottoms concentration specification. Additionally, fluid loading of the stripper packing media is a critical performance parameter that affects all facets of optimum stripper column performance. Condensation of the draw solution tops vapor requires additional process considerations if being conducted in sub-atmospheric conditions and low temperature. Future work will focus on the commercialization of the Oasys EO technology platform for numerous applications in water and wastewater treatment as well as harvesting low enthalpy energy with our proprietary osmotic heat engine. Engineering design related to thermal integration of Oasys EO technology for both low and hig-grade heat applications is underway. Novel thermal recovery processes are also being investigated in addition to the conventional approaches described in this report. Oasys Water plans to deploy commercial scale systems into the energy and zero liquid discharge markets in 2013. Additional process refinement will lead to integration of low enthalpy renewable heat sources for municipal desalination applications...|$|E

Similar to other glycol ethers, it is used as a carrier/solvent in printing/writing inks.

25|$|Mechanical {{removal of}} overpaint include {{physical}} techniques {{to remove the}} coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, white spirit, industrial methylated spirits (denatured alcohol), acetone, and Dichloromethane which is usually found {{in the form of}} a <b>commercial</b> paint <b>stripper.</b> The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. Wiping the solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.|$|R
40|$|Using sieve-tray air {{stripping}} as a {{means of}} removing contaminants from surfactant solutions was studied to determine if tray air stripping can be applied successfully to treating surfactant-containing wastewaters and, if so, to develop a quantitative approach for designing tray air-stripping systems for treating surfactant-containing wastewaters. High-concentration surfactant solutions were prepared and contaminated with five different volatile organic compounds. Removal of the organic compounds was evaluated using a <b>commercial</b> sieve-tray air <b>stripper.</b> Overall, the air stripper was able to efficiently remove the contaminants from solution, and correction of Henry's Law constants for micellar solubilization-induced volatility reduction allowed tray air-stripper design equations to quantitatively predict air-stripper removal for all contaminants. Foaming within the air stripper could be controlled with low concentrations of a silicone-polymer antifoaming agent. Although adding antifoaming agents may be undesirable for some applications, other applications can benefit from the operational and performance advantages of sieve-tray air strippers. Issues related to air-stripper design for low-volatility compounds are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background {{and aims}} : In {{our daily lives}} hand tools are often used in many work situations. With respect to design characteristics, hand tools can be {{considered}} a risk factor when a high level of repetition are required or when awkward postures are adopted. Therefore attention to ergonomics design rules for hand tools is {{the most important factor in}} design process. With this in mind, the aim of the present study is to evaluate a new model of home stripper which designed based on ergonomics rules.   Methods : Ten healthy female subjects participate in this study. Seven tests were considered for each subject. The subject was instructed to strip a cucumber using six commercial models as well as with a new model, separately. The surface electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded from three muscles: biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and flexor digitorum. To make possible the comparison between models in all experiments varied between the subjects, the raw EMG signals was normalized.   Results : For biceps brachii muscle, the analysis of variance revealed that there was no significant difference on the mean EMG data among all models, however muscular activity for the new model of stripper was found lower than the other models. The results indicated that the changes among the mean EMG data of models for triceps brachii, and flexor digitorum muscle were found significant. Tukey tests shows that differences between the EMG data for the new model with one commercial model were significant.   Conclusion : A new model with <b>commercial</b> models of <b>stripper</b> was tested to evaluate the effects of design characteristics on EMG signals. The results of this study show that muscular activity is mostly related to specific design of hand tools considering form, shape and product design aspects...|$|R
