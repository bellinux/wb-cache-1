40|$|Caffeine exerts {{positive}} effects on cognitive and behavioral processes, especially in sub-optimal conditions when arousal is low. Apart from caffeine, coffee contains other compounds including the phenolic compounds ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and the chlorogenic acids, which have purported antioxidant properties. The chlorogenic acids are the most abundant family of compounds found in coffee, yet their effects on cognition and mood have not been investigated. This study aims to ascertain whether a <b>coffee</b> <b>rich</b> in chlorogenic acid modulates brain function. The present pilot study examined the acute effects of decaffeinated coffee with regular chlorogenic acid content and decaffeinated coffee with high chlorogenic acid content on mood and cognitive processes, as measured by behavioral tasks and event-related potentials (ERPs). Performance and ERP responses to a battery of cognitive tasks were recorded at baseline and following the equivalent of three cups of coffee in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of 39 healthy older participants. Compared with the decaffeinated coffee with regular chlorogenic acid and placebo, caffeinated coffee showed a robust positive effect on higher-level mood and attention processes. To a lesser extent, the decaffeinated coffee high in chlorogenic acid also improved some mood and behavioral measures, relative to regular decaffeinated coffee. Our pilot results suggest that non-caffeine compounds in coffee such as the chlorogenic acids may be capable of exerting some acute behavioral effects, thus warranting further investigation...|$|E

40|$|The dietary {{modulation}} of gut microbiota, {{suggested to}} be involved in allergy processes, has recently attracted much interest. While several studies have addressed the use of fibres to modify intestinal microbial populations, information about other components, such as phenolic compounds, is scarce. The aim of this work was to identify the dietary components able to influence the microbiota in 23 subjects suffering from rhinitis and allergic asthma, and 22 age- and sex-matched controls. The food intake was recorded by means of an annual food frequency questionnaire. Dietary fibre tables were obtained from Marlett et al., and the Phenol-Explorer database was used to assess the phenolic compound intake. The quantification of microbial groups was performed using an Ion Torrent 16 S rRNA gene-based analysis. The results showed a direct association between the intake of red wine, a source of stilbenes, and the relative abundance of Bacteroides, and between the intake of <b>coffee,</b> <b>rich</b> in phenolic acids, and the abundance of Clostridium, Lactococcus and Lactobacillus genera. Despite epidemiological analyses not establishing causality, these results support the association between polyphenol-rich beverages and faecal microbiota in allergic patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} effects of {{prolonged}} intake of cafetière <b>coffee,</b> which is <b>rich</b> in the diterpenes cafestol and kahweol, on serum aminotransferase and lipid concentrations. DESIGN: Randomised parallel controlled trial. SUBJECTS: 46 healthy men and women aged 19 to 69. INTERVENTION: Consumption of five to six strong cups (0. 9 litres) a day of either cafetière (22 subjects) or filtered coffee (24 subjects) for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean changes in serum aminotransferase and lipid concentrations. RESULTS: Cafetière coffee raised alanine aminotransferase concentration by up to 80 % above baseline values relative to filtered coffee. After 24 weeks the rise was still 45 % (9 U/l (95 % confidence interval 3 to 15 U/l), P = 0. 007). Alanine aminotransferase concentration exceeded the upper limit of normal in eight of the 22 subjects drinking cafetière coffee, being twice the upper limit of normal in three of them. Cafetière coffee raised low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations by 9 - 14 %. After 24 weeks the rise was 0. 26 mmol/l (0. 04 to 0. 47 mmol/l) (P = 0. 03) relative to filtered coffee. Triglyceride concentrations initially rose by 26 % with cafetière coffee but returned close to baseline values within six months. All increases were reversible after the intervention was stopped. CONCLUSIONS: Daily consumption of five to six cups of strong cafetière coffee affects the integrity of liver cells as suggested by small increases in serum alanine aminotransferase concentration. The effect does not subside with prolonged intake. High intakes of <b>coffee</b> brews <b>rich</b> in cafestol and kahweol may thus be responsible for unexplained increases in this enzyme activity in apparently healthy subjects.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{capacity of}} coffee brews prepared with different coffeemakers (filter, plunger, mocha, and espresso) {{was measured by}} colorimetric (total phenolic compounds and ABTS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy techniques (Fremy's salt and TEMPO). The mocha coffeemaker had the highest yield in coffee antioxidant extraction per gram of ground roasted coffee, but espresso <b>coffee</b> was <b>richest</b> in terms of antioxidant intake (per milliliter of coffee brew) followed by mocha, plunger, and filter. Both Folin-Ciocalteu (total phenolic compounds) and ABTS assays reacted with standard solutions of chlorogenic acids (CGA) and melanoidins (MO-Ala and MO-Gly). However, Fremy's salt was mainly scavenged by chlorogenic acids, whereas the stabilized radical TEMPO was effectively scavenged by melanoidins, but not by chlorogenic acids. Thus, ESR spectroscopy allows distinguishing between phenolic and nonphenolic antioxidants. Moreover, the addition of pH-regulator agents to coffee, such as sodium carbonate (75 ppm) and bicarbonate (75 ppm), to extend its shelf life, slightly increases the pH, modifying the antioxidant capacity in those coffee brews with the highest capacity (mocha and espresso) ...|$|R

Pretreatment of cells with robusta spent coffee extract also decreased Ro photosensitizer-induced oxidative DNA damage after 24 h exposure. The higher effectiveness of Robusta spent coffee extract, with less caffeoylquinic acids and melanoidins, might be due to other antioxidant compounds, such as caffeine and other Maillard reaction products.

40|$|The {{question}} whether coffee {{has a negative}} or {{a positive impact on}} human health has been the topic of much heated debate for years. Nevertheless, recent studies have not only failed to confirm earlier concerns, but in fact suggested a positive effect of coffee intake. Latest studies revealed that people who drink at least 3 cups of coffee per day are at a lower risk for type 2 diabetes, as well as liver and colon cancer. The reports on a possible correlation between coffee drinking and heart diseases have also generated optimistic results. No adverse associations between coffee consumption and coronary heart disease, stroke, and hypertension have been found. What is more, some authors demonstrated that coffee drinking may prevent cardiovascular diseases. Composition of coffee is determined by the strength of the brew and brewing methods.

40|$|Scope: <b>Coffee</b> is <b>rich</b> in quinic {{acid esters}} of {{phenolic}} acids (chlorogenic acids) but also contains some free phenolic acids. A proportion of phenolic acids {{appear in the}} blood rapidly after coffee consumption due to absorption in the small intestine. We investigated in vitro whether this appearance could potentially be derived from free phenolic acids in instant coffee or from hydrolysis of chlorogenic acids by pancreatic or brush border enzymes. Methods and results: We quantified six free phenolic acids in instant coffees using HPLC-DAD-mass spectrometry. The highest was caffeic acid, but all were present at low levels compared to the chlorogenic acids. Roasting and decaffeination significantly reduced free phenolic acid content. We estimated, using pharmacokinetic modelling with previously published data, that the contribution of these compounds to small intestinal absorption is minimal. Hydrolysis of certain chlorogenic acids was observed with human-differentiated Caco- 2 cell monolayers and with porcine pancreatin, which showed maximal rates on 3 - and 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acids, respectively. Conclusion: The amounts of certain free phenolic acids in coffee could only minimally account for small intestinal absorption based on modelling. The hydrolysis of caffeoylquinic, but not feruloylquinic acids, by enterocyte and pancreatic esterases is potentially a contributing mechanism to small intestinal absorption...|$|R
