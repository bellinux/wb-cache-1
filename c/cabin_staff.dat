25|$|The TV {{commercial}} {{was accompanied}} by a new in-flight safety video using the same theme. The safety video, titled Bare Essentials, was shown on all Boeing 737-300-operated flights. It featured a pilot and four <b>cabin</b> <b>staff,</b> including William Coxhead, a regular in Air New Zealand safety videos. Another version was released later, this time for the Airbus A320.|$|E
25|$|The concept itself {{consisted}} of pre-packed meals or snacks — usually, Spam salads out and sandwiches back — loaded into a small, two-shelf compartment {{in the seat}} back {{in front of each}} passenger. The meal/snack for the outbound journey could be found in the top compartment, the one for the return trip in the lower section. The latter contained a pellet of dry ice placed under the plastic food container. This simple refrigeration technique prevented food for the return trip that would spend several hours inside a small, confined space from going off. For the airline's <b>cabin</b> <b>staff,</b> it eliminated handling trays while airborne and resulted in a reduction of their workload. To prevent outbound passengers from consuming meals intended for return passengers, locks needed to be installed on the lower compartment that could only be opened by <b>cabin</b> <b>staff</b> during the aircraft's turnaround at the destination airport (although these were not always effective at deterring determined passengers).|$|E
25|$|Caledonian {{sought to}} {{differentiate}} {{itself from the}} other UK independent airlines and US supplemental carriers with which it competed in the transatlantic closed group charter market by providing a personalised, high quality full-scheduled-service style inflight service that exceeded most contemporary scheduled transatlantic operators' economy class service standards by a wide margin. On a typical transatlantic 707 charter, there were individually printed menus. The inflight service began with tartan-clad <b>cabin</b> <b>staff</b> serving each passenger free cocktails from the drinks trolley at each seat row {{as soon as the}} seat belt signs were turned off. This was followed by the main meal, starting with a separately served hors d'œuvre before serving a main course of fillet of beef, Tournedos, lamb or a chicken dish, accompanied by a selection of complimentary wines. Thereafter, a dessert course was served, followed by a choice from a cheese tray and a basket of fresh fruit. The inflight service concluded with tea or coffee being served with complimentary brandies and liqueurs, as well as free cigarettes for those who smoked.|$|E

500|$|Relations {{have been}} {{turbulent}} between BA and Unite. In 2007, cabin crew threatened strike action over salary changes {{to be imposed}} by BA management. The strike was called off at the last minute, British Airways losing £80million. In December 2009, a ballot for strike action over Christmas received {{a high level of}} support, action was blocked by a court injunction that deemed the ballot illegal. Negotiations failed to stop strike action in March, BA withdrew perks for strike participants. Allegations were made by the Guardian newspaper that BA had consulted outside firms methods to undermine the unions, the story was later withdrawn. A strike was announced for May 2010, British Airways again sought an injunction. Members of the Socialist Workers Party disrupted negotiations between BA management and Unite to prevent industrial action. Further disruption struck when Derek Simpson, a Unite co-leader, was discovered to have leaked details of confidential negotiations online via Twitter. Industrial action re-emerged in 2017, this time by BA's Mixed Fleet flight attendants, whom were employed on much less favorable pay and terms and conditions compared to previous <b>cabin</b> <b>staff</b> who joined prior to 2010. A ballot for industrial action was distributed to Mixed Fleet crew in November 2016 and resulted in an overwhelming yes majority for industrial action. Unite described Mixed Fleet crew as on [...] "poverty pay", with many Mixed Fleet flight attendants sleeping in their cars in between shifts because they cannot afford the fuel to drive home, or operating while sick as they cannot afford to call in sick and lose their pay for the shift. Unite also blasted BA of removing staff travel concessions, bonus payments and other benefits to all cabin crew who undertook industrial action, as well as strike-breaking tactics such as wet-leasing aircraft from other airlines and offering financial incentives for cabin crew not to strike. The first dates of strikes during Christmas 2016 were cancelled due to pay negotiations. Industrial action by Mixed Fleet commenced in January 2017 after rejecting a pay offer. Strike action continued throughout 2017 in numerous discontinuous periods, resulting in one of the longest running disputes in aviation history. On October 31, 2017, after 85 days of discontinuous industrial action, Mixed Fleet accepted a new pay deal from BA which ended the dispute.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1980s it was {{realised}} that South Yorkshire railways {{had been cut}} back too far in the 1960s; in particular, Swinton/Wath-upon-Dearne/Kilnhurst lacked a station. The South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority put forward a four-year plan {{for the improvement of}} services and stations as part of their Rail Development Plan, this leading to the re-instatement of the [...] "Swinton Curve", from the former North Midland Railway at Swinton to the former South Yorkshire Railway at Mexborough West Junction, the building of a new station at Swinton and the re-routing of all passenger trains via this route. Immediately after reopening by British Rail in 1990 it was unstaffed, but increased passenger usage led to the establishment in the 1990s of initially a small <b>cabin</b> <b>staffed</b> for the morning peak period only. The cabin later was replaced by a brick building for the ticket office, waiting room and toilet. It is also an interchange for local bus services to Wath and Manvers.|$|R
