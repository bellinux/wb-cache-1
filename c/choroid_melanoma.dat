40|$|Summary Posterior uveal melanomas have {{recurrent}} alterations of chromosomes 1, 3, 6 and 8. In particular, {{changes of}} chromosomes 3 and 8 occur in association, appear to characterize those tumours with a ciliary body component, {{and have been}} shown to be of prognostic significance. The relevance of other chromosome alterations is less certain. We have performed cytogenetic analysis on 42 previously untreated primary posterior uveal melanomas. Of interest was the observation that as tumour size increased the involvement of specific chromosome changes, and the amount of chromosome abnormalities likewise increased. Loss, or partial deletions, of the short arm of chromosome 1 were found to associate with larger ciliary body melanomas; typically, loss of the short arm resulted from unbalanced translocations, the partners of which varied. Trisomy of chromosome 21 occurred more often in ciliary body melanomas, whilst rearrangements of chromosomes 6 and 11 were primarily related to choroidal melanomas. Our results imply that alterations of chromosome 1 are important in the progression of some uveal melanomas, and that other chromosome abnormalities, besides those of chromosomes 3 and 8, are associated with ocular tumours of particular locations. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaign Keywords: cytogenetics; translocation; uveal melanoma; phenotype The eye is the commonest site for non-cutaneous melanomas, accounting for approximately 80 % of such lesions (Scotto et al, 1976). Ocular melanomas principally arise from the uveal tract, which comprises the iris, ciliary body and the choroid, the highest incidences are for the posterior (ciliary body and <b>choroid)</b> <b>melanomas,</b> with an annual frequency, in America, of 5 – 7 case...|$|R
30|$|Skin {{cancer is}} one of a major concern of world due to its {{alarming}} increasing rate (Day and Barbour 2000). The most common type of skin cancer is known as melanoma which originate in the pigment-producing melanocytes in bottom layer of skin. Melonoma mostly occurs on sun-exposed parts of the body because intermittent sun exposure damages the skin cells’ DNA with the ultraviolet (UV) radiation, as a result melanocytes become cancerous. However, it can also occur inside eye in iris and also in <b>choroid</b> layer. <b>Melanoma</b> can be classified into malignant melanoma and non-melanoma. Malignant melanoma is less common and accounts only for 5  % of skin cancers however it this is most aggressive, complex and fatal. According to American Cancer Society (ACS), approximately 10, 130 people loss their life inside United States in year 2016 because of malignant melanoma (Siegel et al. 2016). The prevalence of melanoma raises every year. Melanoma detection of patients at early stage is of prime importance for the effective treatment. In later stages treatment become hard and melanoma can be fatal.|$|R
40|$|With {{an annual}} {{incidence}} of about 4 to 9 per {{million in the}} United States of America and European countries, uveal melanoma (UM) is a rather rare malignant disease entity [1]. UM can arise {{in any part of}} the uveal tract, that is in the iris, ciliary body and/or <b>choroid.</b> Iris <b>melanomas</b> are extremely uncommon and have a different nature as well as treatment approach. This thesis will only relate UM to choroidal and ciliary body melanomas, which take up 95 % of all UM. Most the patients are diagnosed with UM because of having (mild) visual symptoms, such as blurred and/or declined vision, light flashes, metamorphopsia (change in shape of an object) and floaters (“floating flies”). Although effective local treatment options for the primary tumor, are available, a substantial part of the patients eventually die from metastatic disease. UM metastasize haematogenously, mainly to the liver. The diagnosis of metastatic uveal melanoma disease is often several years after the primary treatment, with a median of 4 to 6 years. Once (liver) metastases have been diagnosed, the prognosis is infaust in almost all cases with a mean survival of 3 to 9 months...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To present initial {{experience}} with a novel biopsy method, the Essen biopsy forceps. Therefore, two patients with diagnostic suspicion of uveal melanoma underwent biopsy for histopathological confirmation. Case Presentation. Two patients presented with painless unilateral vision reduction. Ultrasound revealed the diagnostic suspicion of uveal melanoma. Therefore, biopsy with the Essen biopsy forceps using a sutureless 23 -gauge three-port vitrectomy system was performed. The specimens were then submitted to a pathologist and processed. Histopathology of the obtained specimen confirmed the diagnostic suspicion of <b>choroid</b> <b>melanoma</b> in both patients. Conclusion.

40|$|Metastatic {{melanoma}} to {{the gall}} bladder is extremely rare and {{is associated with}} a very poor prognosis. We report a case of choroidal melanoma metastatizing to the hepatobiliary system, with an unusual presentation. Our patient presenting with obstructive jaundice was misdiagnosed as having carcinoma of the gall-bladder, but the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma to the gallbladder was confirmed by ultrasonography guided fine needle aspiration cytology (USG-FNAC). On reviewing the past history, the patient had a history of enucleation for choroidal melanoma. Even though the liver &#x 2032;is&#x 2032; a common site for metastasis of <b>choroid</b> <b>melanoma,</b> the patient presenting with a suspected gall bladder mass &#x 2032;is&#x 2032; a rare presentation.

40|$|Ophthalmic melanomas can {{be divided}} in extra-ocular (conjunctiva, caruncle) and intraocular uveal melanomas (iris, ciliary body and <b>choroid).</b> Uveal <b>melanomas</b> account for 95 % of ocular melanomas, while only 5 % are conjunctival in origin. The extra-ocular and intra-ocular melanomas differ in {{biological}} behavior. Melanocytes originate from the neural crest and are normally present in the uveal stroma, similar to dermal melanocytes. Intraepithelial precursor lesions of invasive melanoma occur in the conjunctiva and the caruncle but within the eye an intra-epithelial (retinal pigment epithelium) precursor lesion has not betH demonstrated. Therefore a radial and vertical growth phase, as is recognized in cutaneOUI> and conjunctival melanomas, is not evident in intra-ocular melanoma. Because uveal melanomas are not easily accessible for incisional biopsy (without disruption of vision), only two lesions of melanocytic origin are defined clinically: nevus and melanoma. Progression in melanoma is clinically associated with tumor size. Most malignant <b>melanomas</b> of the <b>choroid</b> can be diagnosed by ophthalmoscopy and ultrasonography, and evidence of growth is best established by serial photography of the fundus. The uvea consists of highly vascularized tissue. There are no demonstrated lymphatics within the uveal tract, or in the posterior orbit. This explains the difference in biological behavior of ophthalmic melanomas: conjunctival melanomas spread first to regional lymph nodes whereas choroidal and ciliary body melanomas metastasize hematogenously and preferentially first to the liver. Strikingly, another intra-ocular tumor, the retinoblastoma usually does not metastasize until after it has invaded the orbit. From the orbit it gains access to lymphatic vessels in the anterior orbit. Unlike uveal melanoma, the initial metastases from retinoblastoma are often to regional lymph nodes. Uveal melanoma metastasize relatively late: the 5, 10 and 15 -year survival rates based on tumorrelated deaths vary from 65 %, 52 % and 46 %, respectively;'" to 72 %, 59 % and 53 %, respectively, in recent series. The estimated 5 -year-survival rate of cutaneous melanoma varies between 70 _ 80 %. 7. 8 Once the diagnosis of hepatic metastasis from uveal melanoma has clinically been made) the median survival is extremely poor: between two 9, 10 and seven months, II The median survival time in patients in whom the liver was either not involved at all, or not among the first sites of dissemination is 19 months...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Choroidal {{melanoma}} is {{the most}} common primary malignancy of the eye, which frequently metastasizes. The Cancer Registry of Slovenia reported the incidence of <b>choroid</b> <b>melanoma</b> from 1983 to 2009 as stable, at 7. 8 cases/million for men and 7. 4 /million for women. The aim of the retrospective study was to determinate the prognostic factors of survival for choroidal melanoma patients in Slovenia. Patients and methods: From January 1986 to December 2008 we treated 288 patients with malignant choroidal melanoma 127 patients were treated by brachytherapy with beta rays emitting ruthenium- 106 applicators 161 patients were treated by enucleation. Results: Patients with tumours thickness /= 60 years had significantly lower survival in both treatment modalities. For patients treated by brachytherapy the diameter of the tumour base and treatment time were independent prognostic factors for overall survival, for patients treated by enucleation age and histological type of tumour were independent prognosticators. In first few years after either of treatments, the melanoma specific annual mortality rate increased, especially in older patients, and then slowly decreased. Conclusions: It seems that particularly younger patients with early tumours can be cured, whereby preference should be given to eyesight preserving brachytherapy over enucleation...|$|E
40|$|In choroidal {{melanoma}} vitreous hemorrhage {{can occur}} as initial event or as complication of conservative therapy. To understand better these relations, four groups of cases were examined: 1.) 126 choroidal melanomas which were treated conservatively with Cobalt 60 applicator from 1969 till 1984. 2.) 715 choroidal melanomas {{which have been}} treated with proton-beam from 1984 to 1989. 3.) 7 tumors or pseudotumors for which for diagnostic purposes a phosphorus 32 test was necessary. 4.) 9 choroid melanomas which had conservative treatment and where vitrectomy was realized. The multifactorial analysis gave the following results: in vitreous hemorrhages occurring before treatment {{the thickness of the}} tumor represents the significant factor. In vitreous hemorrhages which occur after conservative treatment there is in the group of cobalt applicators important irradiation of the disc, as well as the thickness of the tumor and the age of the patient in the group with proton-beam irradiation. Vitreous bleeding occurring before or after therapy does not influence the vital prognosis in a negative way. We present here a therapeutic concept in cases of vitreous bleeding in <b>choroid</b> <b>melanoma</b> which is based both on our experience and on the indications of literature...|$|E
40|$|Melanomas are {{malignant}} neoplasms that originate from melanocytes. The most common {{are on the}} skin and mucous membranes. Choroidal melanomas are quite different from cutaneous melanomas with regard to presentation, metastases, and treatment. We report two cases of metastatic gastric malignant melanoma of the eye and skin, {{with reference to the}} literature. The first patient was a woman aged 23 years, who underwent gastrectomy 22 months after enucleation of the eye due to malignant <b>choroid</b> <b>melanoma.</b> The second patient was a man, 72 years old, who underwent surgery 28 months before because of malignant melanoma of the skin of the forehead. Paraffin sections, 4 μm thick were stained using a classic method, as well as immunohistochemical DAKO APAAP method, using a specific S - 100 antibody and Melan A antibodies. The stomach is considered a rare place for the development of metastases. Metastases in the stomach are often limited to the submucosal as well as the serousmuscular layer, as noted in one of our patients. Metastatic melanoma of the gastrointestinal tract should be suspected in any patient with a history of malignant melanoma and new gastrointestinal symptoms. Because of the similarity between certain common histopathological types of malignant melanoma, primarily achromatic, and types of primary cancers of the stomach, the following immunohistochemical studies are needed: Melan A and S - 100 protein (markers of malignant melanoma), as well as mucins: MUC 5 AC, MUC 2 and CDX 2 (markers of different types of primary gastric carcinoma) ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Choroidal {{melanoma}} is {{the most}} common primary intraocular malignant tumour and the second most common type of primary malignant melanoma in the body. Biologically, cutaneuous and ocular melanoma may be considered different, in terms of both metastatic diffusion and metastatic latency. The principal target organ for metastasis of the ocular melanoma is the liver. This distinctive behaviour is also sustained by different metastatic latency, as some patients present with metastatic ocular melanoma several years after the treatment of the primary tumor. Presentation of case: A 60 year-old male who had undergone left ocular enucleation for <b>choroid</b> <b>melanoma</b> 20 years ago was referred to our department with a three months history of diffuse abdominal pain, fever, weight loss and massive ascites. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and total body computed tomography (CT) scan were performed and revealed diffuse liver metastases, associated with peritoneal carcinosis, bilateral adrenal metastases and a large mass in the left kidney compatible with another secondary localization. An ultrasound guided fine needle agobiopsy (FNA) of liver lesions was performed and the pathological findings led to the diagnosis of liver metastasis from choroidal melanoma. The patient died a few weeks later for hepatic failure. Discussion: Currently, there is no consensus regarding the optimal follow-up in terms of screening modality or time interval after the treatment of the primary ocular melanoma. Conclusion: Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and a history of choroidal melanoma should be investigated for the presence of gastrointestinal or liver metastases, although the original primary malignancy was diagnosed years before the patient’s presentation...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Eye {{enucleation}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} surgical procedures. The aim of the study was to determine the causes of enucleation as seen in a major reference eye center in Serbia. Methods. Retrospective case series involving a review of all enucleation procedures performed in the period between January 2000 and December 2008 at the Institute for Eye Diseases, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade. The collected information included the basic demographic data and diagnosis of the affected eye. The diagnosis was made based on history, clinical and histological examinations. Clinical indications for enucleation were categorized as tumors, glaucoma, trauma, infections and other diseases. A statistical analysis was made using the Student's t-test. Results. There were 586 patients, 315 male and 271 female in our series. The mean age was 57. 81, ranging from 3 months to 96 years. The most common cause of enucleations was tumor (76. 11 %), (p < 0. 05). <b>Choroid</b> <b>melanoma</b> was the most common etiology leading to enucleation (81. 18 %), followed by retinoblastoma (12. 34 %). A total of 8. 02 % of enucleations were performed due to glaucoma that was primarily neovascular in 42. 55 % of cases or caused by trauma in 38. 8 % of cases. Trauma was the third common etiology of enucleation, and it was acute in 56. 26 % of cases or resulted in phthisis bulbi in 31. 25 % of cases. Enucleation caused by inflammation was performed in 2. 90 % of cases, out of which 52. 94 % of enucleations occurred after perforation of the cornea. In the group of other diseases the most common cause of enucleation was atrophy of the eye ball. Conclusion. Neoplasm, neovascular glaucoma, acute eye injury and atrophy of the eye ball are the most common causes of enucleation...|$|E
30|$|Uveal {{melanoma}} {{arises from}} melanocytes of the iris, ciliary body or the choroid. Choroidal melanoma {{is the most}} common subtype of the uveal melanoma comprising 86  % cases [1]. Various host factors that may increase the risk of uveal melanoma include Caucasian race, light skin and eye color, and propensity to sunburn [4]. Also, atypical cutaneous nevi, common cutaneous nevi, cutaneous freckles and iris nevi increase the risk of uveal melanoma [5]. The clinical presentation of uveal melanoma depends on the size and location of the tumour ranging from asymptomatic incidental detection on ophthalmic examination to a variety of visual symptoms. Common clinical features include blurred vision, visual field defect, floaters, pain and increased intraocular pressure. The initial diagnosis of uveal melanoma is usually done on fundoscopic examination. Ocular ultrasound and fluorescein angiography are useful for further characterisation. The tumour node metastasis (TNM) staging of uveal melanoma is done according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system [6]. In this system, the extent of the primary tumour (T), presence or absence of lymph node involvement (N), and presence or absence of distant metastasis (M) are used for staging the disease. T staging of iris melanoma is done according to tumour extent, associated secondary glaucoma and extraocular ocular extension. Posterior uveal (ciliary body and <b>choroid)</b> <b>melanoma</b> is graded according to tumour basal diameter and thickness, ciliary body involvement and extraocular extension. The regional lymph nodal involvement is classified as NX (cannot be assessed), N 0 (lymph node metastasis absent) and N 1 (lymph node metastasis present). Similarly, metastatic disease is designated as MX (cannot be assessed), M 0 (distant metastasis absent) and M 1 (distant metastasis present). Among subtypes of uveal melanoma, iris melanoma is associated with a better prognosis than ciliochoroidal subtype [7]. Primary goals in treating uveal melanoma are preserving vision if feasible and preventing metastatic disease. In the past, enucleation was the standard treatment for uveal melanoma; however, in recent years enucleation has been largely replaced by various forms of radiation therapy (brachytherapy, proton beam irradiation and Gamma Knife) [8].|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To study VP 22 light {{controlled}} delivery of antisense oligonucleotide (ODN) to ocular cells in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The C-terminal half of VP 22 was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and mixed with 20 mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (ODNs) to form light sensitive complex particles (vectosomes). Uptake of vectosomes and light induced redistribution of ODNs in human <b>choroid</b> <b>melanoma</b> cells (OCM- 1) and in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE- 19) were studied by confocal and electron microscopy. The effect of vectosomes formed with an antisense ODN {{corresponding to the}} 3 '-untranslated region of the human c-raf kinase gene on the viability {{and the proliferation of}} OCM- 1 cells was assessed before and after illumination. Cells incubated with vectosomes formed with a mismatched ODN, a free antisense ODN or a free mismatched ODN served as controls. White light transscleral illumination was carried out 24 h after the intravitreal injection of vectosomes in rat eyes. The distribution of fluorescent vectosomes and free fluorescent ODN was evaluated on cryosections by fluorescence microscopy before, and 1 h after illumination. RESULTS: Overnight incubation of human OCM- 1 and ARPE- 19 cells with vectosomes lead to intracellular internalization of the vectosomes. When not illuminated, internalized vectosomes remained stable within the cell cytoplasm. Disruption of vectosomes and release of the complexed ODN was induced by illumination of the cultures with a cold white light or a laser beam. In vitro, up to 60 % inhibition of OCM- 1 cell proliferation was observed in illuminated cultures incubated with vectosomes formed with antisense c-raf ODN. No inhibitory effect on the OCM- 1 cell proliferation was observed in the absence of illumination or when the cells are incubated with a free antisense c-raf ODN and illuminated. In vivo, 24 h after intravitreal injection, vectosomes were observed within the various retinal layers accumulating in the cytoplasm of RPE cells. Transscleral illumination of the injected eyes with a cold white light induced disruption of the vectosomes and a preferential localization of the "released" ODNs within the cell nuclei of the ganglion cell layer, the inner nuclear layer and the RPE cells. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, VP 22 light {{controlled delivery}} of ODNs to ocular cells nuclei was feasible using white light or laser illumination. In vivo, a single intravitreal injection of vectosomes, followed by transscleral illumination allowed for the delivery of free ODNs to retinal and RPE cells...|$|E
