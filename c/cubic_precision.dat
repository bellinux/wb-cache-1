40|$|The {{standard}} Clough-Tocher split-domain scheme constructs {{a surface}} el-ement with quadratic precision. In this paper, I {{will look at}} methods for improving the degrees of freedom in Clough-Tocher schemes.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{establish}} C 1 -rational spline functions on any regular quadrilateral partition τ of a simply or multiply connected and bounded domain Ω and to get new C 1 -quadrilateral shape functions for finite element analysis. C 1 -generalized wedge functions on any quadrilateral of τ are defined and constructed. A C 1 interpolating operator with <b>cubic</b> <b>precision</b> on any quadrilateral is given...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new kind of Hermite {{interpolation}} on arbitrary domains, matching derivative data of arbitrary order on the boundary. The basic idea stems from an interpretation of mean value interpolation as the pointwise minimization of a radial energy function involving first derivatives of linear polynomials. We generalize this and minimize over derivatives of polynomials of arbitrary odd degree. We analyze the cubic case, which assumes first derivative boundary data and show that the minimization has a unique, infinitely smooth solution with <b>cubic</b> <b>precision.</b> We {{have not been able to}} prove that the solution satisfies the Hermite interpolation conditions but numerical examples strongly indicate that it does for a wide variety of planar domains and that it behaves nicely...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme for the {{absolute}} calibration {{of a set}} of three individual RASNIK elements and of their bench supports. The RASNIK elements consist of three <b>precision</b> <b>cubic</b> blocks carrying the mask, the lens or the CCD. Simulations and measurements on a dedicated bench show that this procedure leads to the required precision on the relevant RASNIK parameters (< 5 microns). These calibrated RASNIK blocks can be used later as references for a fast calibration of the RASNIK sensors {{to be used in the}} alignment system of the ATLAS muon spectrometer...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{significant}} portion of rural building&# 8217;s roof is supported by timber trusses. Increasing distance between the trusses {{can be achieved by}} using composite cross sections ("T" and "I") for beams. With this, it is possible {{to reduce the number of}} columns and trusses, bringing significant savings in material and the desired cost reduction, mainly using wood from planted forests. The Brazilian Code ABNT NBR 7190 : 1997 establishes a coefficient (&# 945;r) for the reduction of the theoretical moment of inertia (Iteo) of 0. 95 and 0. 85, for beams with "T" and "I" composite profile, respectively. However, no specification is showed about connections responsible for conferring such coefficients. This research aimed to investigate, based on static bending tests, analysis of variance and polynomial regression models (linear, quadratic, <b>cubic),</b> the <b>precision</b> of &# 945;r coefficients set by the Brazilian Code for Pinus sp. beams. We considered to evaluate influence of factors such as: nails number (3, 5, 9, 17, 33), nails size (19 × 27 mm, 19 × 33 mm), profile types (I, T) and calculation form to obtain the equivalent modulus of elasticity (Edeq) used to determine the cited coefficients. The highest values of &# 945;r were derived from beams with 17 and 33 nails, which provided similar results. The analysis also allowed admitting the adequacy, only to the beams with "T" section, of &# 945;r stipulated by the Brazilian Code. For "I" section, &# 945;r overestimates beams performance. Nails size and form of calculating Edeq were not significant in obtaining &# 945;r. The quadratic model showed the best results, indicating that the amount of 25 nails can provides the highest values of &# 945;r coefficients...|$|R
