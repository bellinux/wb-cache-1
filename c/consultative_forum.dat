The round-table meeting centered on Federal-Puntland bilateral cooperation, {{as well as the}} scheduled 2016 national elections. Among the main areas discussed within the Framework for Action were the ongoing federalization process, the implementation of previous treaties, the constitutional review process, border demarcation, resource-sharing, the integration of troops from different regions into the national army, and the establishment of a new Central State. The forum concluded with a signed agreement, which stipulates that Puntland will contribute 3,000 troops to the Somali National Army.|$|E

40|$|Following the {{decentralisation}} {{of governmental}} processes in many European countries, {{a number of}} political decisions are now being made by regional instances of government. As they gain more political autonomy, regions also take on a renewed significance as places in which to convene a number of democratic debates between a number of actors. At the same time, the democratic trends in regions have also been characterised {{by the introduction of}} participatory elements which complement the more traditional channels of representative democracy. Modern democracies are often "hybrid democracies" in which citizens and groups delegate power by electing representatives, but simultaneously retain the possibility to raise issues or participating in decision-making between elections. This thesis is specifically concerned with the contribution of the various particularistic groups in regional decision-making processes. Within this broad area of research, my project focuses on the involvement of particularistic groups through "consultative forums". <b>Consultative</b> <b>forums</b> are relatively formal participatory structures which aspire to deepen the ways in which people and groups can effectively participate in and influence the policy-processes prior to legislation being considered. They are purposely designed to help groups get their message across to government by nurturing their voices, organising a level of interaction between the various groups, and channelling the groups' message across to government. The thesis provides an in-depth exploration of the functioning of two such consultative forums: the Scottish Civic Forum and the French Regional Economic and Social Council. Based on observations collected during thirteen months of ethnographic fieldwork, the thesis critically examines {{the extent to which these}} two organisations can promote the sort of dialogue and democratic debate which could lead to an effective re-composition of political action in devolved democratic processes. Theoretically, the thesis draws from a number of contemporary debates relative to the participation of particularistic groups in modem liberal democratic processes. These debates address the commonly accepted prevalence of representative democracy, the quality of regional public spheres and the in-house functioning of participatory organisations such as the <b>consultative</b> <b>forums.</b> The thesis concludes that, while the <b>consultative</b> <b>forums</b> might not necessarily be the primary means of democratic expression in the regions, each of them fulfils a very important function. One model seeks primarily to empower smaller, vulnerable groups within policy processes. The second model foments an intensive level of interaction between key regional stakeholders. I argue that both these objectives are eminently worthwhile and that the <b>consultative</b> <b>forums</b> are able to fulfil important functions in regional public spheres.

40|$|Beyond the state: shaping {{governance}} and development policy in an Australian region, Regional Studies. The {{role of the}} state in regional development is often unclear and contested. In Australia&# 039;s Gippsland region, in the east of the state of Victoria, state actors shape trajectories of development while limiting local input to <b>consultative</b> <b>forums.</b> However, this account of regional governance obscures the role of marginalized actors. Despite limited opportunities for meaningful involvement, less powerful social groups can be influential by strategically engaging with state structures and local communities. Drawing upon a strategic-relational approach, with specific reference to the regional politics of scale, territory and relationality, this empirical study considers the {{role of the state}} and marginalized actors in shaping regional development policy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For {{the last}} twenty years, the concept of citizen {{participation}} and local democracy has largely {{been used in the}} local government discourse. These concepts are heavily related to the rights of citizens and democratic governance. Linking citizen participation to local government raises fundamental and normative questions about the nature of democracy and the skills and strategies for achieving it. This paper seeks to explore literature related to the dynamics and avenues of citizen participation and local democracy in Zimbabwean local government system. Factors which promote citizen participation and local democracy will be discussed including the issue of local government elections, participatory budget in local authorities, <b>consultative</b> <b>forums,</b> public hearings, existence of civil society organisations as well as the formal structures which exist within the local government institutions...|$|R
50|$|While most of U.S.-Canada {{trade flows}} smoothly, there are {{occasionally}} bilateral trade disputes, {{particularly in the}} agricultural and cultural fields. Usually these issues are resolved through bilateral <b>consultative</b> <b>forums</b> or referral to World Trade Organization (WTO) or NAFTA dispute resolution. In May 1999, the U.S. and Canadian governments negotiated an agreement on magazines that provides increased access for the U.S. publishing industry to the Canadian market. The United States and Canada also have resolved several major issues involving fisheries. By common agreement, the two countries submitted a Gulf of Maine boundary dispute to the International Court of Justice in 1981; both accepted the court's 12 October 1984 ruling which demarcated the territorial sea boundary. A current issue between the United States and Canada is the ongoing softwood lumber dispute, as the U.S. alleges that Canada unfairly subsidizes its forestry industry.|$|R

40|$|Refugee movements, {{international}} migration and socio-economic development are intimately bound up together. The impacts of global migratory movements {{depend on their}} political management: circumstances conducive to development require close and dependable cooperation between the countries involved. But international cooperation on refugee and migration policy - global migration governance - has to date been weak. Important institutional and policy changes are currently under way, with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 including at least some universally binding targets and indicators for migration. And in September 2016 the international community decided to prepare two global compacts - one for migration, one for refugees - within the space of two years. Both will have repercussions for the international institutional setup and the division of responsibilities between UN agencies, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Existing supranational <b>consultative</b> <b>forums</b> {{in the area of}} migration can also be expected to gain in political significance. What is required from the development perspective is a normative and institutional reordering of global migration policy - a process the German government should promote and contribute to.

This was reaffirmed in a High Court decision in 2007 when Derry City Council sought guidance on {{the procedure for}} effecting a name change. The council had changed its name from [...] "Londonderry City Council" [...] to [...] "Derry City Council" [...] in 1984; the court case was seeking clarification as to whether this had also changed {{the name of the}} city. The decision of the court was that it had not but it was clarified that the correct procedure to do so was via a petition to the Privy Council. Derry City Council since started this process and were involved in conducting an equality impact assessment report (EQIA). Firstly it held an opinion poll of district residents in 2009, which reported that 75% of Catholics and 77% of Nationalists found the proposed change acceptable, compared to 6% of Protestants and 8% of Unionists. Then the EQIA held two <b>consultative</b> <b>forums,</b> and solicited comments from the general public on whether or not the city should have its name changed to Derry.

40|$|How {{feasible}} {{is it to}} {{call upon}} ordinary people {{to come forward and}} take part in decision-making, not just locally but in relation to the institutions of central government? There have been multiple citizen participation initiatives in Britain in recent years, using citizens' juries, peoples' panels, <b>consultative</b> <b>forums</b> and other techniques. They seek to engage both already organised stakeholders and those directly affected by the outcome of an issue in political debate. There are fewer examples of new institutions which call on citizens who do not have an immediate personal interest in an issue, and observe how they work as a group, how they handle complex information, and what arguments they find persuasive. [...] . The first part of the chapter concentrates on citizens themselves, on what they bring to such an arena and how they interact once there. Later the focus turns to the matter of hosting and designing citizen participation, teasing out what may be learned from the very active attempts made by the host organisation not only to encourage and shape the deliberations of the Council itself, but also to position the results in relation to its many – not always enthusiastic – stakeholders. The chapter is organised around seven messages about how to approach the twin questions of 'citizen competence' and 'citizen capture' in ways that shift the terms of the debate, emphasising the active fostering of citizen potential and the complexities of a set of political processes into which reports from the Council had to be inserted...|$|R
