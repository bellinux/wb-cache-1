In 1973 he published a CERN document, along with his colleague Bent Stumpe, outlining the concept for a prototype touchscreen as well as a multi-function computer-configurable knob, both of which found their way onto the consoles of the finished control room.

50|$|The lumped {{capacitance}} {{model is a}} common approximation in transient conduction, which may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat transfer across the boundary of the object. The method of approximation then suitably reduces {{one aspect of the}} transient conduction system (spatial temperature variation within the object) to a more mathematically tractable form (that is, it is assumed that the temperature within the object is completely uniform in space, although this spatially uniform temperature value changes over time).

This physically large inductor at the base of the antenna has an inductive reactance which is the opposite of the <b>capacitative</b> reactance that such a vertical antenna has at the desired operating frequency. The result is a pure resistance seen at feedpoint of the loading coil; unfortunately that resistance is somewhat lower than would be desired to match commercial coax.|$|E

Dynamic logic circuits are usually faster than static counterparts, and require less surface area, but are more difficult to design. Dynamic logic has a higher toggle rate than static logic but the <b>capacitative</b> loads being toggled are smaller so the overall power consumption of dynamic logic may be higher or lower depending on various tradeoffs.

50|$|In {{the latter}} mode, the patient must sit or lie on an {{insulated}} table, {{much as in}} the case with objects to be charged electrostatically with high-voltage D.C.

Stray ground paths between the patient and foreign conductors (such as a metal table leading somewhere to earth-ground) can offer another <b>capacitative</b> reservoir besides the patient, and burns out of the area of treatment may thus result, from current passing between patient and the earth-ground. For this reason, hyfrecation and all non-ground-pad electrosurgery is performed only on conscious patients, who would be aware of the burn and discomfort from an unwanted earth-ground path. (In types of electrosurgery which do employ a ground-pad, the ground-pad path serves as such a low resistance ground to the machine, that extraneous other ground paths become unimportant, and thus with proper precautions these methods can, and often are, used on anesthetized patients).|$|E
5000|$|For example, a {{monopole}} antenna {{such as a}} metal rod fed at one end, will be resonant when its electrical length is equal to a quarter wavelength, λ/4, of the frequency used. If the antenna is shorter than a quarter wavelength, the feedpoint impedance will include capacitive reactance; this causes reflections on the feedline and a mismatch at the transmitter or receiver, even if the resistive component of the impedance is correct. To cancel the capacitive reactance, an inductance, called a loading coil, is inserted in between the feedline and the antenna terminal. Selecting an inductance with the same reactance as the (negative) <b>capacitative</b> reactance seen at the antenna terminal, cancels that capacitance, and the antenna system (antenna and coil) will again be resonant. The feedline sees a purely resistive impedance. Since an antenna which had been too short now appears {{as if it were}} resonant, the addition of the loading coil is sometimes referred to as [...] "electrically lengthening" [...] the antenna.|$|E

Thus, the temperature difference between the body and surroundings does not depend on which part of the body is chosen, since all parts of the body have effectively the same temperature. In these situations, the material of the body does not act to [...] "insulate" [...] other parts of the body from heat flow, and all of the significant insulation (or [...] "thermal resistance") controlling the rate of heat flow in the situation resides in the area of contact between the body and its surroundings.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether nifedipine inhibits <b>capacitative</b> calcium entry at clinically relevant concentrations using cultured human mvyocytes as a modelfor human myometrium. METHODS: M 1 yocyte cultures were initiated from the myometrium of term pregnant women who undenvent cesarean delivery. Paired cells {{were chosen for}} study. The cell of interest was stimulated by an intercellular calcium wave from the adjacent cell. In this fashion, release of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium was accomplished with minimal disturbance of the plasma membrane and the subplasmalemmal space (SPS) of the cell studied. Depletion of the SR calcium stores by the calcium wave activated the <b>capacitative</b> calcium current, elevated calcium in the SPS, and activated calcitm-activated potassium channels. A cell-attached patch clamp was used to monitor the outward current resulting from the calcium activation of these potassium channels. Calcium green- I fluorescence was used to simultaneously monitor changes of the deep cytosolic calcium concentrations. Experiments were performed at varying concentrations of nifedipine (0 - 10 IO mol/L). RESULTS: Nfedipine reduced outward potassium currents in a dose-dependent manner. Nfiedipine at 100 nmol/L resulted in greater than a 50 % reduction ofoutward current, indicating a significant inhibition of <b>capacitative</b> calcium entry at that concentration.
