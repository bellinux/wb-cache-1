40|$|Marking the 30 th {{anniversary of}} the {{formation}} of Orion Bank in 1970, financial historian Richard Roberts has written a history of Orion and the rise and decline of the <b>consortium</b> <b>banking</b> movement. <b>Consortium</b> <b>banks</b> were formed as joint ventures to enable banks to operate in the booming Euromarkets, with virtually every major international bank participating in a <b>consortium</b> <b>bank</b> during their heyday in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Orion Bank was one of the leading players in the Euromarkets in those decades: its shareholders were six of the biggest banks in the world from the three major trading blocks: Chase Manhattan, Royal Bank of Canada, NatWest, Westdeutsche Landesbank, Credito Italiano and Mitsubishi <b>Bank.</b> Like other <b>consortiums</b> <b>banks,</b> Orion Bank was prominent in Eurocurrency syndicated lending, but more unusually, it was also a top Eurobond lead manager. The story of Orion exemplifies the tensions inherent in the joint venture approach to business development and the strategic dilemmas facing <b>consortium</b> <b>bank</b> managements and shareholders. Richard Roberts uses primary archival papers and interviews with former Orion executives and other bankers prominent in <b>consortium</b> and investment <b>banking</b> to present an authoritative case study with great topical relevance as today's European banking industry continues to integrate across borders. Take Your Partners is also an invaluable source of reference for anyone with an interest in the Euromarkets and the development of international banking...|$|R
50|$|These factors led to {{the early}} {{construction}} of a diverse and cosmopolitan society in Worcester, outside of Cape Town, the only town that would develop as such in the Western Province during the late 19th century. In 1890 the African Banking Corporation was established in London, all branches were overseas. The Bank was formed as a <b>consortium</b> <b>bank</b> owned jointly by Lloyds Bank, National Provincial, Westminster and Standard Bank of South Africa. In December 1891, Articles of Agreement were drawn up with the Worcester <b>Bank</b> and <b>operations</b> were handed over to African Banking Corporation in February 1892.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, London-based Lloyds Bank Limited {{acquired}} the 94-branch First Western Bank and Trust Company from World Airways, Inc. of Oakland, California, {{at a price}} of US$115 million. The Delaware-registered holding company, Lloyds First Western Corporation, was formed to facilitate the purchase. In accordance with the Group's policy of non-participation in <b>consortium</b> <b>banks,</b> Lloyds Bank California relinquished its holding in London Interstate Bank in 1975.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} for the effectiveness of inter-organizational collaboration gains much attraction {{in the light of}} social network analysis. We analyze this by the case of Initial Public Offering (IPO) deal networks as this is a valuable example for the repeated collaboration of autonomous organizations on a shared goal and data is publicly available. We use the social networks established through deal activities over time as independent variables explaining the success of the IPO. Although we did not find statistically significant support for the impact of centrality for neither the lead manager nor the <b>consortium</b> <b>banks,</b> we see that the clustering among the <b>consortium</b> <b>banks</b> is a significant driver for IPO success. The higher the clustering amongst the collaborating <b>consortium</b> <b>banks</b> the better the performance of the issued share. We thereby provide initial evidence for the influence of network structure on IPO success and show that the build-up of the consortium has {{a significant impact on the}} success of the IPO. In terms of methodology, we explore a way of constructing networks from previous collaborations which form the basis for proven analysis techniques and might help to shed light on various questions in the domain of inter-organizational collaboration...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{scholarly}} interest in joint ventures and strategic alliances, the <b>consortium</b> <b>bank</b> movement represents an under-researched phase in post-war banking history. From 1964 to the mid- 1980 s, {{many of the}} largest banks in the world, including the Nordic banks, entered into international strategic alliances. Almost all of these alliances are now defunct. We follow the Norwegian banks in the Nordic consortia and find that domestic rivals do not cooperate but international rivals do. Legal prohibitions in the Nordic countries on entry by foreign banks underpinned the cooperation. The cooperation broke down when changes in domestic regulations permitted the Nordic <b>banks</b> to establish <b>operations</b> in each others' domestic markets. ...|$|R
