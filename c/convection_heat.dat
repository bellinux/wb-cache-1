25|$|In industry, thermal {{analyses}} are often {{ignored in the}} design process or performed too latenbsp&—nbsp&when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural <b>convection</b> <b>heat</b> sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this means is that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|E

Heating of food products is mostly induced by <b>convection</b> <b>heating.</b> However, the number applications of convective heating {{in combination with}} microwave <b>heating</b> are growing. <b>Convection</b> <b>heating</b> only promotes heating on the surface while microwave induce internal heating. This paper focuses on effect of <b>convection</b> <b>heating</b> sources to changes of quality properties in bakery products such as brownness and texture. <b>Heat</b> <b>convection</b> and conduction, and moisture migration due to diffusion and convection {{are the key to}} changes (transformations) in physical, chemical and structure properties in products.

In adverse convection {{we find a}} transition from forward to backward bifurcation with increasing vertical (stabilizing) field. The stability analysis of roll solutions explains the experimentally observed transition between roll and square patterns for weak horizontal (destabilizing) fields. In a range of high vertical magnetic fields two steady convective modes with different wavelengths and symmetries become critical at nearly the same threshold giving rise to competition and resonant interaction. For the oscillatory instability in normal convection {{the nature of the}} bifurcation for both traveling and standing rolls is determined. Comparison with previous theories and with experiments is made wherever possible...|$|R

40|$|Postharvest heat {{treatments}} have recently received attention {{as a means}} to prevent fungal spoilage of strawberry during shelf life. Far infrared radiation (FIR) heating technology may be an alternative to conventional methods because it can achieve rapid and contactless heating. Monte Carlo FIR radiation simulations combined with convection-diffusion air flow and heat transfer simulations were performed in the CFD code ANSYS CFX 5. 7 to investigate the suitability of the method for surface decontamination. Computations were validated against measurements with a thermographic camera. FIR heating achieved more uniform surface <b>heating</b> than air <b>convection</b> <b>heating,</b> with a maximum temperature well below the critical limit of about 50 degrees C at the same average temperature. In this configuration, the resulting surface FIR heating rate was, however, smaller or only equal to the air <b>convection</b> <b>heating</b> (at 0. 2 in s(- 1)), depending on the heater temperature used. A better configuration consisted of FIR heaters on four sides combined with a cyclic heating operation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Heat sink {{performance}} (including free convection, forced convection, liquid cooled, and {{any combination}} thereof) {{is a function}} of material, geometry, and overall surface heat transfer coefficient. Generally, forced <b>convection</b> <b>heat</b> sink thermal performance is improved by increasing the thermal conductivity of the heat sink materials, increasing the surface area (usually by adding extended surfaces, such as fins or foam metal) and by increasing the overall area heat transfer coefficient (usually by increase fluid velocity, such as adding fans, pumps, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|Displacement room airflow {{presents}} {{an opportunity to}} improve both the thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) of the occupied space. It also {{takes advantage of the}} difference in air density between an upper contaminated zone and a lower clean zone. Cool air is supplied at low velocity into the lower zone. Convection from heat sources creates vertical air motion into the upper zone where high level return inlets extract the air. In most cases these <b>convection</b> <b>heat</b> sources are also the contamination sources (e.g., people, equipment, or processes), thereby carrying the contaminants up to the upper zone, away from the occupants.|$|E
50|$|Forced {{convection}} is type of {{heat transport}} in which fluid motion {{is generated by}} an external source like a (pump, fan, suction device, etc.). Heat transfer throgh porus media is very effective and efficiently. Porous medium {{is defined as a}} material volume consisting of solid matrix with an interconnected void. Flow in porous media have revealed the Darcy law< which relates linearly the flow velocity to the pressure gradient across the porous medium.

This is a symmetrical design for restrictive plant layouts. O-type boilers are mainly used for their fast steam production and reduced maintenance cost.|$|R
40|$|Two {{extraction}} methods: microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and extraction by <b>convection</b> <b>heating</b> {{were used}} to assess the active antioxidant ingredients from Uva di Troia Canosina grape pomace. MAE gave higher yields in the recovery of resveratrol (70 μg/g versus 20 μg/g) as assessed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis. The MAE was also advantageous as it allowed reduced extraction times: 15 minutes versus 30 minutes required by conventional heating extraction. However, both methods gave extracts endowed with comparable antioxidant activity as demonstrated by the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 - picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) scavenging assay (IC 50 = 106 ± 48 μg/mL versus 110 ± 34 μg/mL, respectively). The observed antioxidant effect of the MAE extract appears to be correlated with the detected resveratrol concentration while other unidentified antioxidants may contribute to the radical scavenging effect of the extract obtained by <b>convection</b> <b>heating.</b> In agreement with previous results, our study underlays the possibility that the antioxidant properties of Uva di Troia Canosina grape could be attributed to resveratrol along with other polyphenols. Considering the multifunctional medicinal and health effects of resveratrol, the MAE method herein proposed may be considered as an efficient way to obtain resveratrol from Uva di Troia Canosina grapes...|$|R
