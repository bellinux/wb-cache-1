Since {{his father was}} a Buddhist, while his mother was a Protestant, from the young age he has often been in contact with things related to church and Protestantism. Currently he's more into Buddhism, or more specifically, Buddha himself. Ever since he was little he was curious about occult subjects. While in Elementary School, he became obsessed with the ancient civilizations of Egypt, the Maya's Easter Islands and the Inca. One of the very important moments were when he was around 18 or 19 years old, after reading Shirley MacLaine's book Out on a Limb, he became even more intrigued about the spiritual world.

60|$|But what <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> most {{interested}} <b>attention</b> {{at the moment}} that the sun's rays set the cliff's face a-shimmer, was the several black spots which now appeared quite plainly in evidence high across the gorgeous wall close to the forest's top, and extending apparently below and behind the branches.|$|R

60|$|A faint stir in {{the woods}} {{suddenly}} <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention.</b> The sound neared.

And on the path by which I had come, appeared, some yards distant, in the faint trickling light, the dark figure of my dreams.|$|E
6000|$|I glanced {{from him}} about his {{apartment}} {{and back to the}} little table. A fascicle marked very distinctly [...] "1" [...] <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention,</b> and I took it up.

5000|$|Katia Mann {{recalled}} that her husband's {{idea for the}} story came during a holiday at the Grand Hôtel des Bains in 1911: [...] All {{the details of the}} story... are taken from experience ... In the dining-room, on the very first day, we saw the Polish family, which looked exactly the way my husband described them: the girls were dressed rather stiffly and severely, and the very charming, beautiful boy of about 13 was wearing a sailor suit with an open collar and very pretty lacings.

60|$|Presently I perceived, far away, {{a single}} human figure--whether it were {{man or woman}} I could not tell--walking towards me along the path which ran {{at the bottom of}} the cleft. In those {{gigantic}} surroundings it looked extraordinarily small and lonely, although perhaps because of the intense red light in which it was bathed, or perhaps just because it was human, a living thing in the midst of all that still, inanimate grandeur, it <b>caught</b> and focused <b>my</b> <b>attention.</b> I grew greatly interested in it; I wondered if it were that of man or woman, and what it was doing here in this haunted valley.|$|R
60|$|One {{afternoon}} {{in late summer}} I was drifting down the Toledi River, casting for trout, when a movement in the bushes ahead <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention.</b> A great swampy tract of ground, covered with grass and low brush, spread out on either side the stream. From the canoe I made out two or three waving lines of bushes where some animals were making {{their way through the}} swamp towards a strip of big timber which formed a kind of island in the middle.|$|E
60|$|Two curious {{circumstances}} also <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention.</b> I saw {{a change}} to, what I call self-assertion, in my sister's manner; something {{seemed to have}} raised her in her own estimation. Then, again, Miss Jillgall was not like her customary self. She had delightful moments of silence; and when Eunice asked how I liked Mr. Dunboyne, she listened to my reply with an appearance of interest in her ugly face which was quite a new revelation in my experience of my father's cousin.|$|E
60|$|The {{stream of}} talk {{on either side}} of the host's chair was now {{beginning}} to flow cheerfully and continuously; the wine-conversation had worn itself out; and one of the elder guests--Mr. Wendell--was occupied in telling the other guest--Mr. Trowbridge--of a small fraud which had lately been committed on him by a clerk in his employment. The first part of the story I missed altogether. The last part, which alone <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention,</b> followed the career of the clerk to the dock of the Old Bailey.|$|E

40|$|Very {{recently}} {{some surprising}} and puzzling news {{appeared in the}} media: television and newspapers, reporting a phenomenon perhaps akin to a population crash. It sounded like a pandemic in that it occurs over a large area of the world—not an epidemic, an {{outbreak of a disease}} that spreads rapidly through a community. The news <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> immediate <b>attention</b> since the affected population particularly concerns my initiative to advance bioprospecting (1) and more specifically biotherapy (I lectured at the VII Biotherapy Congress, Seoul Korea, June 20 – 25, 2007). From the inception of eCAM there has been a conscious effort to capture or focus on the beneficial effects of natural products, especially those derived from marine and terrestrial animals. The jolting news concerns honeybees and a phenomenon referred to as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a disorder in which disturbing numbers of bees are disappearing from their colonies. This is of great interest for the basic science and application of products from honeybees and the broader context of agriculture and CAM.

[...] He also described the occupation of Tibet by the Chinese: [...] "I was struck with the appearance of everything being perfecly Chinese." [...] If Manning was impressed by the Potala palace, his admiration stopped there. [...] "If the palace had exceeded my expectations," [...] he wrote, [...] "the town as far fell short of them. There is nothing striking, nothing pleasing in its appearance. The habitations are begrimed with smut and dirt. The avenues are full of dogs, some growling and gnawing bits of hide which lie around in profusion, and emit a charnel-house smell; other limping and looking livid; others ulcerated; others starved and dying, and pecked at by the ravens; some dead and preyed upon. In short everything seems mean and gloomy, and excites the idea of something unreal." ...|$|R
60|$|Heavens! {{how happy}} I was on {{arriving}} at the fair! How I was enchanted {{with the world of}} fun and pageantry around me! The humors of Punch; the feats of the equestrians; the magical tricks of the conjurors! But what principally <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> was--an itinerant theatre; where a tragedy, pantomime, and farce were all acted in the course of half an hour, and more of the dramatis personae murdered, than at either Drury Lane or Covent Garden in a whole evening. I have since seen many a play performed by the best actors in the world, but never have I derived half the delight from any that I did from this first representation.|$|E
60|$|I {{discovered}} that a concave speculum hung slantingly high over his head; a movement in this <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> sharply, and I looked up to see, distorted and made fantastic but bright and beautifully colored, the magnified, reflected, evasive rendering of a palace, of a terrace, of the vista of a great roadway with many people, people exaggerated, impossible-looking because of the curvature of the mirror, going to and fro. I turned my head quickly that I might see more clearly through the window behind me, {{but it was too}} high for me to survey this nearer scene directly, and after a momentary pause I came back to that distorting mirror again.|$|E
60|$|As I hesitated about {{pushing through}} the filth-laden branches, {{something}} bright {{on the edge of}} the nest <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention.</b> It was a young heron's eye looking down at me over a long bill, watching my approach with a keenness that was but thinly disguised by the half-drawn eyelids. I had to go round the tree at this point for a standing on a larger branch; and when I looked up, there was another eye watching down over another long bill. So, however I turned, they watched me closely getting nearer and nearer, till I reached up my hand to touch the nest. Then there was a harsh croak. Three long necks reached down suddenly over the edge of the nest on the side where I was; three long bills opened wide just over my head; and three young herons grew suddenly seasick, as if they had swallowed ipecac.|$|E
6000|$|And all in {{a moment}} I <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> first real glimpse of the Church--no more just a number of St Peterses than I was so many [...] "organs," [...] or Beechwood was so many errand boys, or, for that matter, England so many counties.

6000|$|I struggled, {{but could}} not free myself from my bonds. I tried to speak, but the gag was effective; I could not make a sound. I listened for my wife's voice and my child's--listened long and intently, but no sound came {{from the other end}} of the room where their bed was. This silence became more and more awful, more and more ominous, every moment. Could you have endured an hour of it, do you think? Pity me, then, who had to endure three. Three hours--? it was three ages! Whenever the clock struck, it seemed as if years had gone by since I had heard it last. All this time I was {{struggling}} in my bonds; and at last, about dawn, I got myself free, and rose up and stretched my stiff limbs. I was able to distinguish details pretty well. The floor was littered with things thrown there by the robbers during their search for my savings. The first object that <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> particular <b>attention</b> was a document of mine which I had seen the rougher of the two ruffians glance at and then cast away. It had blood on it! I staggered to the other end of the room. Oh, poor unoffending, helpless ones, there they lay, their troubles ended, mine begun! ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the front}} page of the {{illustrated}} paper I saw lying on a table near me, he looked picturesque enough, seated on a boulder, a big strong man with a square-cut beard, his hands resting on the hilt of a cavalry sabre—and all around him a landscape of savage mountains. He <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> eye on that spiritedly composed woodcut. (There were no inane snapshot-reproductions in those days.) It was the obvious romance for the use of royalists but it arrested <b>my</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|R
6000|$|It {{was in the}} bracing {{atmosphere}} of a harvest morning, that I met by appointment Fairservice, with the horses, {{at the door of}} Mr. Jarvie's house, which was but little space distant from Mrs. Flyter's hotel. The first matter which <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> was, that whatever were the deficiencies of the pony which Mr. Fairservice's legal adviser, Clerk Touthope, generously bestowed upon him in exchange for Thorncliff's mare, he had contrived to part with it, and procure in its stead an animal with so curious and complete a lameness, that it seemed only to make use of three legs for the purpose of progression, while the fourth appeared as if meant to be flourished in the air by way of accompaniment. [...] "What do you mean by bringing such a creature as that here, sir? and where is the pony you rode to Glasgow upon?" [...] were my very natural and impatient inquiries.|$|E
60|$|At {{one of the}} {{stations}} (it was near a village of ancient aspect, nestling round a church, on a wide Yorkshire moor) I saw a tall old lady in black, {{who seemed to have}} just alighted from the train. She <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> by a singular movement of the head, not once only, but continually repeated, and at regular intervals, as if she were making a stern and solemn protest against some action that developed itself before her eyes, and were foreboding terrible disaster, if it should be persisted in. Of course, it {{was nothing more than a}} paralytic or nervous affection; yet one might fancy that it had its origin in some unspeakable wrong, perpetrated half a lifetime ago in this old gentlewoman's presence, either against herself or somebody whom she loved still better. Her features had a wonderful sternness, which, I presume, was caused by her habitual effort to compose and keep them quiet, and thereby counteract the tendency to paralytic movement. The slow, regular, and inexorable character of the motion--her look of force and self-control, which had the appearance of rendering it voluntary, while yet it was so fateful-- have stamped this poor lady's face and gesture into my memory; so that, some dark day or other, I am afraid she will reproduce herself in a dismal romance.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{arrived there}} were only four other maiden ladies with Miss Brett, but they were sewing very busily. It is very difficult, of course, for any person, however {{strongly}} impressed with the necessity in these matters of full and exact exposition of the facts, to remember and repeat the actual details of a conversation, particularly a conversation which (though inspired with a most worthy and admirable zeal for good work) was one which did not greatly impress the hearer's mind {{at the time and}} was in fact--er--mostly about socks. I can, however, remember distinctly that one of the spinster ladies (she was a thin person with a woollen shawl, who appeared to feel the cold, and I am almost sure she was introduced to me as Miss James) remarked that the weather was very changeable. Miss Brett then offered me a cup of tea, which I accepted, I cannot recall in what words. Miss Brett is a short and stout lady with white hair. The only other figure in the group that <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> was a Miss Mowbray, a small and neat lady of aristocratic manners, silver hair, and a high voice and colour. She was the most emphatic member of the party; and her views on the subject of pinafores, though expressed with a natural deference to myself, were in themselves strong and advanced. Beside her (although all five ladies were dressed simply in black) it could not be denied that the others looked in some way what you men of the world would call dowdy.|$|E
