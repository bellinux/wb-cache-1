50|$|In 1920 {{northern}} Schleswig {{became part}} of Denmark, and the border was established between Niebüll and Tonder. This meant that traffic to Sylt had to cross the German-Danish border twice, although the Danish authorities allowed sealed transit trains to operate, avoiding <b>customs</b> <b>inspections</b> of passengers. The operation of transit trains and the Hoyer-Sylt ferry ended with the inauguration of the Hindenburg causeway in 1927.|$|R
5000|$|Assigned to the 5th Naval District {{and based}} at Norfolk, Lucille Ross {{served as a}} shore and harbor patrol boat, {{assisted}} during <b>customs</b> <b>inspections,</b> sealed ships radios, and performed occasional towing services.

30|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of the CA, maintaining the balance between the efficiency and effectiveness of the <b>customs</b> <b>inspection</b> system is a constant challenge. At Taoyuan Airport, the grey area in the SECCS {{seems to be the}} incentives that attract express businesses. In 2014, more than 91  % of express cargoes used the SECCS. For example, if the SECCS moves forward to achieve effectiveness in capturing more tax evasion cargoes, and the proportion of C 3 increases from 2 – 3  % to 10  %, the economic impact and complaints from consignees and brokers must be excessive to be afforded by the CA. However, Taipei Port is developing a shipping express business with a modified system that leaves little space for tax evasion. This situation could be another case study for the trade-off between the effectiveness and efficiency of <b>customs</b> <b>inspection,</b> and the CA should seriously consider whether or not the SECCS should be a long-term strategy to keep the two different inspection standards of the SECCS in North Taiwan.|$|R
25|$|These {{locomotives}} {{have been}} refurbished from Class 37 locomotives at Barrow Hill Roundhouse by Network Rail {{and have been}} fitted with ERTMS signalling equipment.

The locomotives were formerly 37100, 37170, 37178 and 37217 respectively. A new <b>inspection</b> <b>shed</b> was built in 2008 at Coleham (Sutton Bridge Junction) in Shrewsbury for these locos.|$|R
25|$|Thus, {{numerous}} underlying cross-border {{problems are}} {{at the root of}} the difficulties of regional rail transport. A lack of track-sharing agreements means that a single operator moving goods through two or more countries is not feasible. This causes time-consuming and costly border operations - trains have to change locomotives and crews at each border crossing. There is no system of sealing wagons to avoid the need for <b>customs</b> <b>inspections</b> at borders or within transit countries.|$|R
5000|$|Inter-city train {{services}} {{crossing the}} Hong Kong-China boundary {{are known as}} Intercity Through Trains.

2500|$|The {{partition}} of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Donegal {{into an international}} frontier. This changed trade patterns to the railways' detriment and placed border posts on every line to and from Derry except the NCC route to [...] The L crossed the border between Pennyburn and Bridge End, the CDRJC crossed just beyond Strabane, and the GNR line crossed twice between Derry and Strabane. Stops for <b>customs</b> <b>inspections</b> greatly delayed trains and disrupted timekeeping.|$|R
