5|$|Author Roald Dahl {{disapproved of}} the 1971 film {{adaptation}} and declined the film rights {{to produce the}} sequel, <b>Charlie</b> <b>and</b> the Great Glass Elevator. Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of <b>Charlie</b> <b>and</b> the Chocolate Factory. The purchase was finalized in 1998, with Dahl's widow, Felicity ("Liccy"), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl Estate's subsequent protection of the source material was the main reason that <b>Charlie</b> <b>and</b> the Chocolate Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Early in the {{development}} of <b>Charlie</b> <b>and</b> the Chocolate Factory in February 2000, Warner Bros. announced their intention of marketing the film with a Broadway theatre musical after release.

The main tie-in for <b>Charlie</b> <b>and</b> the Chocolate Factory focused on The Willy Wonka Candy Company, a division of Nestlé. A small range of Wonka Bars were launched, utilizing their prominence in the film. The release of <b>Charlie</b> <b>and</b> the Chocolate Factory also rekindled public interest in Roald Dahl's 1964 book, and appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list from July 3 to October 23, 2005.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for <b>Charlie</b> <b>and</b> the Chocolate Factory {{started on}} June 21, 2004 at Pinewood Studios in England.

The Wonka Factory exterior was coincidentally constructed on the same backlot Burton had used for Gotham City in Batman (1989). The ceremonial scene required 500 local extras. The Chocolate Room/River setpiece filled Pinewood's 007 Stage. As a consequence of British Equity rules, which state that children can only work {{four and a half}} hours a day, filming for <b>Charlie</b> <b>and</b> the Chocolate Factory took six months, ending in December 2004.|$|E
