500|$|When the Hunters were {{retired in}} 1994, {{the air force}} {{made an effort to}} provide some F-5Tigers with an {{air-to-ground}} capability but this proved prohibitively expensive, and plans to replace the fleet after 2010 with a fourth-generation jet fighter were begun. A dozen F-5s were leased in 2004 to Austria for four years (while it awaited the delivery of new Eurofighters), and the Swiss maintenance of its fleet was such that they were considered [...] "low-hours" [...] by the U.S. Navy, which purchased 36in 2006–2008 to replace its aging Aggressor aircraft. This effectively reduced the F-5 inventory by half, and proposals to replace the Tigers with JAS-39 Gripens, Rafales, EADS Eurofighter Typhoons, or the advanced Super Hornet variant of the FA-18came under consideration. In the end the JAS-39 Gripen was chosen because it was the cheapest candidate. In the evaluation the JAS-39 C & JAS-30D were tested but the choice in the end was to buy 22 JAS-39E. Because SAAB don't build the 2 Seater Gripen F of the Gripen E Switzerland will first rent a few Grippen C and 2-seater Gripen D. Due to financing struggles in the MoD and the possibility of a popular initiative it is uncertain whether the JAS-39E <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> acquired.|$|E

In contrast, Marvel shared several different ideas for what Thor: Ragnarok could be with prospective filmmakers, who then went away and developed what they thought the film should be from that.

500|$|Critics {{and fans}} alike criticized the writers' seeming {{disregard}} for the Lost timeline. Based on the actions and whereabouts of characters in the third season, fans could deduce when parts of Michael's flashbacks occurred in relation to events on the island.

[...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story."

I'll have a whole bunch of them [...] and then I'll just choose which ones to make into full songs." [...] For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, [...] "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story." [...] Parker also said [...] "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me." ...|$|E
