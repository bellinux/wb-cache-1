5|$|The {{proceedings}} {{were initiated}} after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily {{give up his}} security <b>clearance</b> while working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire {{at the end of}} June 1954. Several of his colleagues testified at the hearings. As a result of the two to one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security <b>clearance</b> one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did not recommend that his security <b>clearance</b> be reinstated.|$|E

5|$|By 1890 {{official}} slum <b>clearance</b> programmes had begun. One was {{the creation}} of the world's first council housing, the LCC Boundary Estate, which replaced the neglected and crowded streets of Friars Mount, better known as The Old Nichol Street Rookery. Between 1918 and 1939 the LCC continued replacing East End housing with five or six storey flats, despite residents preferring houses with gardens and opposition from shopkeepers who were forced to relocate to new, more expensive premises. The Second World War brought an end to further slum <b>clearance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Garrison {{applied for}} an {{emergency}} security <b>clearance</b> prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no <b>clearance</b> was granted {{during the course of}} the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of {{intraperitoneal}} nitroprusside on small (urea) and middle (vitamin B 12) molecule dialysis <b>clearances</b> in patients maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis. <b>Clearances</b> were measured in six patients during the addition of 6 mg of nitroprusside to three and seven consecutive, hourly two-liter exchanges {{during the course of}} a routine dialysis treatment. Results indicate that <b>clearances</b> of urea and B 12 both increased about 35 percent with the addition of the vasodilator for three exchanges. <b>Clearances</b> immediately returned to baseline values when administration of the vasodilator was discontinued. Addition of the drug to seven consecutive exchanges resulted in a sustained 35 percent increment in <b>clearances.</b> We conclude that addition of 6 mg of nitroprusside to peritoneal dialysis solution can result in a significant increment in both small and middle molecule <b>clearances.</b> Maintenance of the higher <b>clearances</b> requires sustained administration of the drug, which can be tolerated for at least six exchanges with no adverse side effects...|$|R
5|$|Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. {{divides the}} listed {{illnesses}} and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant {{must be able}} to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the E category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive {{when it comes to the}} license categories A and B, and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive <b>clearance</b> by the general practitioner. The outcome of the medical examination may be either full <b>clearance,</b> denial, or conditional <b>clearance</b> that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).|$|E

5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an excreted dose. <b>Clearance</b> of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid <b>clearance</b> and creatinine <b>clearance</b> (CLCR).|$|E

Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical <b>clearance</b> and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway.
