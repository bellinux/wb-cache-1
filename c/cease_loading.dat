500|$|On the moors, when dried turves {{were ready}} to be collected, {{temporary}} track sections were laid {{at right angles to}} the main line, and a portable turntable was installed. A rake of twelve wagons could then be moved onto the temporary track, one at a time, to be filled by a 'filling gang'. Each wagon held about a ton, and once all twelve had been manoeuvred over the turntable back onto the main line, they would be pulled to the works by horses. With the advent of the small Lister engines, a new system was used, where three curved sections of track were used, the end one being clipped onto the top of the main line track. The engines could then push a line of forty or fifty wagons onto the temporary track. Cutting of the peat was mechanised from 1963, with the introduction of German peat-cutting machines, and by 1970, all hand cutting had <b>ceased.</b> <b>Loading</b> of the turves into wagons was also initially by hand, but gradually 'sod collectors' were introduced, which at Swinefleet had a [...] conveyor and at Hatfield a [...] one. These enabled a single side track to serve a much wider section of moor, without having to move the track. Loading turves onto the start of the conveyor was still done manually, but it became difficult to find people who wanted to do the work, and so Hymac loaders were used to load peat directly into the wagons. The success of this process at Hatfield in 1981 lead to it being used at Swinefleet as well.|$|R
40|$|When {{subjected}} to periodic loading, elastic systems containing contact interfaces might exhibit frictional slip which <b>ceases</b> after some <b>loading</b> cycles. In such cases, {{it is said}} that the system shakes down. For elastic discrete systems presenting complete contacts, it has been proved that Melan’s theorem, originally proposed for elastic-plastic problems, offers a sufficient condition for the system to shake down, provided that the contact is of an uncoupled type. In the present paper, the application of Melan’s theorem is speculated for systems involving plasticity and friction. A finite element example of an elastic-plastic solid containing a frictional crack is discussed. Fulltext published by CC BY-NC-ND</p...|$|R
30|$|During gas exploration, both {{liquid and}} gas are {{produced}} initially and {{carried to the}} outer part (well surface). This happens if the gas flow velocity is high enough to drag the liquid film and entrain the liquid droplets to the surface. But once the gas flow velocity falls (which is usually the case due the well aging) below the critical value, the liquid tends to fall back into the well bore and accumulate, a condition known as liquid loading. This accumulated liquid tends to produce an addition hydrostatic back pressure that limits the gas flow from the well. In some scenarios, {{the flow of the}} gas stops and eventually the well dies. This usually happens in the life cycle of the gas well and very common in aged gas fields (Park et al. 2009). This problem, when allowed to prolong might ‘kill’ the gas well and <b>cease</b> production. Liquid <b>loading</b> has become a major problem associated with gas production.|$|R
40|$|The Eastern Mediterranean Sea is a sink for terrigenous sediments from North Africa, Europe and Asia Minor. Its sediments {{therefore}} {{provide valuable}} {{information on the}} climate dynamics in the source areas and the associated transport processes. We present a high-resolution dataset of sediment core M 40 / 4 _SL 71 from SW of Crete spanning the last ca. 180 kyr. We analysed the clay mineral composition, the grain size distribution within the silt fraction, and the abundance of major and trace elements. We test the potential of end member modelling on these sedimentological datasets {{as a tool for}} reconstructing climate variability in the source region and the associated detrital input. For each dataset we modelled three end members. All end members can be assigned to a specific provenance and sedimentary process. In total, three end members are related to Saharan dust input and five to fluvial sediment input. One end member is strongly associated with sapropel layers. The Saharan dust end members of the grain size and clay mineral datasets show a generally enhanced dust export into the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the dry phases with short-term increases during Heinrich Events. During the African Humid Periods dust export was reduced but may not completely <b>ceased.</b> The <b>loading</b> patterns of two fluvial end members show a strong relationship to the northern hemisphere insolation, and all fluvial end members document enhanced input during the African Humid Periods. The sapropel end member most likely reflects the fixation of redox sensitive elements within the anoxic sapropel layers. Our results exemplify that end member modelling is a valuable tool for interpreting extensive and multidisciplinary datasets...|$|R
40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 6 JAN 2014 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a slower (compared with a standard) infusion {{rate of the}} loading dose of magnesium sulphate for preterm fetal neuroprotection as a strategy to reduce maternal adverse effects. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: South Australian maternity hospital. POPULATION: Fifty-one women at < 30 weeks of gestation, where birth was planned or expected within 24 hours. METHODS: Women received a loading infusion of 4 g of magnesium sulphate over either 60 or 20 minutes (followed by maintenance of 1 g/hour until birth, or for up to 24 hours). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Any maternal adverse effects associated with the infusion. RESULTS: Overall, 71 % of women experienced adverse effects during the first hour of their infusion; the difference between groups was not significant [15 / 25 (60 %) 60 -minute loading; 21 / 26 (81 %) 20 -minute loading; risk ratio (RR) 0. 74; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 51 - 1. 08]. Although no serious maternal complications occurred, adverse effects led to three women <b>ceasing</b> the <b>loading</b> treatment (1 / 25 in the 60 -minute loading group; 2 / 26 in the 20 -minute loading group; RR 0. 52; 95 % CI 0. 05 - 5. 38). Women in the 60 -minute loading group experienced significantly less warmth and flushing at 20 minutes into the infusion (7 / 25 in the 60 -minute loading group; 15 / 26 in the 20 -minute loading group; RR 0. 49; 95 % CI 0. 24 - 0. 99). No other differences between groups for maternally reported and clinical adverse effects were shown. CONCLUSIONS: A slower rate of administering the loading dose of magnesium sulphate did not reduce the occurrence of maternal adverse effects overall. Flushing and warmth at 20 minutes into the infusion was reduced with a slower infusion. ES Bain, PF Middleton, LN Yelland, PJ Ashwood, CA Crowthe...|$|R
40|$|A long-standing, though ill-understood {{problem in}} rocket dynamics, rocket {{response}} to random, altitude-dependent nozzle side-loads, is investigated. Side loads arise during low altitude flight due to random, asymmetric, shock-induced separation of in-nozzle boundary layers. In this paper, stochastic {{evolution of the}} in-nozzle boundary layer separation line, an essential feature underlying side load generation, is connected to random, altitude-dependent rotational and translational rocket response via a set of simple analytical models. Separation line motion, extant on a fast boundary layer time scale, is modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Pitch and yaw responses, taking place on a long, rocket dynamics time scale, are shown to likewise evolve as OU processes. Stochastic, altitude-dependent rocket translational motion follows from linear, asymptotic versions of the full nonlinear equations of motion; the model is valid in the practical limit where random pitch, yaw, and roll rates all remain small. Computed altitudedependent rotational and translational velocity and displacement statistics are compared against those obtained using recently reported high fidelity simulations [Srivastava, Tkacik, and Keanini, J. Applied Phys., 108, 044911 (2010) ]; in every case, reasonable agreement is observed. As an important prelude, evidence indicating the physical consistency of the model introduced in the above article is first presented: it is shown that the study's separation line model allows direct derivation of experimentally observed side load amplitude and direction densities. Finally, {{it is found that}} the analytical models proposed in this paper allow straightforward identification of practical approaches for: i) reducing pitch/yaw response to side loads, and ii) enhancing pitch/yaw damping once side <b>loads</b> <b>cease.</b> Comment: 60 pages, 8 figures, submitte...|$|R
40|$|Presented to the Faculty of the University of Alaska Anchorage [...] in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements [...] for the Degree of [...] MASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTHThe {{goal of this}} {{practicum}} {{project was}} to complete a meta-analysis and identify the location, size, and impact of fish waste piles on waterbodies in Alaska in one comprehensive report. Data collection for this project included obtaining secondary data from publicly available sources. Alaskan shorebased seafood processing facilities discharge water mixed with fish waste from an outfall(s). Once discharged, buoyant fish waste enters the water column and floats to the surface, while denser fragments sink. Fish waste accumulates on the seafloor and creates fish waste piles. A persistent fish waste pile depletes the oxygen from the water column, smothers benthic invertebrates, alters benthic habitat and creates dead zones, all which lead {{to changes in the}} overall ecosystem. As the deposited material breaks down, it produces hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which may be released into the environment and affect aquatic ecosystem health. Less than fifty percent of the facilities in the data set are in compliance with the requirement to monitor their fish waste piles. At least 115 acres of the Alaska seafloor is covered by fish waste piles and the impacts of these 115 acres are not widely known. The recovery process of benthic communities is typically different than a simple reverse of the pattern observed during its decline. It is unlikely that any benthic community impacted by these fish waste piles will recover to its original state, even if the organic <b>loading</b> <b>ceases...</b>|$|R
