50|$|The audiences' {{everyday}} {{practices with}} regards to multimedia journalism is challenging the traditional relationship between journalists and readers. Before the introduction of digital technologies, news providers have realized {{that they need to}} broaden their readership scope by providing a forum for public discussion. Commentaries and editorial pages on newspaper are thus created for satisfying such needs; however, they are limited in size and accessibility. As news agencies are adapting to the trend of multimedia journalism, readers' voices are able to heard more comprehensively. For example, the interactive feature of new media such as the Internet, especially social media, allowing journalists to directly communicate with their audience on the one hand, also enabling readers to exchange ideas among themselves on the other hand.   The emergence of interactive technology therefore undermines the classical news agenda.  Multimedia journalism converts readers to collaborators, which generates greater contact between journalists and their audience. Audiences are able to access information via more than one platforms as well as comprehending news information in detail. In addition, multiple discussion forums provided by journalism, such as the online <b>comment</b> <b>area</b> under each news report, enabling direct communication between readers and journalists.|$|E

Jeff Jarvis complained that Sidewiki [...] "takes comments away from my blog and puts them on Google. That sets up Google in channel conflict vs me. It robs my site of much of its value", and PaidContent noted that [...] "Google is walking a fine line {{in its efforts to}} innovate in some areas that have long been the domain of traditional publishers, while not alienating them." [...] PC Magazine commented that Sidewiki could [...] "push site owners to make their forums more appealing on their own, and to enhance sites with no <b>comment</b> <b>area</b> with a space for reader participation." [...] Public relations professionals saw Sidewiki as another venue that will need managing, but which offered an opportunity to engage with complaints and spot 'hot issues'. Mark Borkowski predicted that [...] "SideWiki is going to challenge PR by providing the masses with the tool for the ultimate expression of people power, something uncontainable that will need constant monitoring... SideWiki will make it impossible to promote one message and not be held to account." [...] ArsTechnica argued that the comments were of similar value to those on existing sites such as Digg and Reddit, and suggested that without the ability found in Wikipedia to delete and restructure material, it was a [...] "glorified comment system".|$|E

"Recognizing the {{importance}} of international problems provision will be made for bringing students of the college in contact with foreign countries by means of travel and study, or by means of exchange of students between this and foreign countries. It is contemplated that {{during this period of}} preparation for teaching each student shall spend at least one or two semesters, abroad. The expense for such study will not exceed the expense for a similar period of study in New York. Even if it is not possible for every student to study abroad, those students who are able to avail themselves of this opportunity will be granted this privilege. The chief objective of foreign study will be to acquaint the student intimately with the culture of the foreign people, so that in his teaching activity {{he will be able to}} interpret to American children the spirit of the people with whom he has lived." [...] This was printed in the November 1931 issue of The Elementary School Journal, in the educational news and editorial <b>comment</b> <b>area.</b> I wonder if the notion of foreign study would have entered Alexander’s mind if he was not a language student. With the concentration of his degree work centering on the German educational movement, his need to travel overseas was obvious. The time overseas did something to Alexander that he did not count on. By comparison it gave him a greater appreciation for America. He had experienced other cultures, met other people and learned much more than if he just read about them in a book.|$|E

The online version displayed multiple questions per page and <b>comment</b> <b>areas</b> {{at the end of each}} section. In order to ensure that users considered each question, a response was required for each question (users were able to answer [...] "Not Applicable"). Client-side JavaScript was used to both validate and format the user's responses. The data for each section of the QUIS was time stamped and recorded on the client computer. At the end of the questionnaire the data from all sections of the QUIS were gathered together and send as a single piece back to the server where the QUIS was deployed. This method of data collection ensures that only completed questionnaires were entered, and prevents concurrency issues between users.|$|R

By analysing public data and interviewing the founding partners, Richard Bowsher and Grant Rushmere, the findings where compared against the marketing paradigms of Ottoman (1999) and the green marketing practices of Gittell et al.

Further, where the company did promote organic rooibos and sustainability, their actions were not reflective of these behaviours from an academic point of view. Thus, there was the potential for green washing. The research concludes with suggestions for a 4 P’s green marketing framework, and <b>comments</b> on <b>areas</b> that need clarity...|$|R
