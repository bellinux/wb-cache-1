Due to the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming effects, synthetic refrigerants are being gradually phased out in accordance with the international protocols that aim to protect the environment. A refrigerator designed to work with R 134 a was used for this experiment, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) which consists of 60 % propane (R 290) and 40 % butane (R 600) was compared with R 134 a refrigerant in a vapor compression refrigerator with a total volume of 62 L. The experiments were carried out using different charges of 40, 60, 80, and 100 g for R 134 a and LPG refrigerants, the charges were measured with a digital <b>charging</b> <b>scale.</b> The K-type thermocouples were used to measure the temperatures at the inlet and outlet of the four major components (evaporator, compressor, condenser, and expansion device) of the refrigeration system. The system was instrumented with two pressure gauges at the inlet and outlet of the compressor for measuring the suction and discharge pressures. The results obtained were used to determine the thermodynamic properties of the refrigerants using Refprop, version 9. The results obtained showed that the design temperature and pull-down time set by the International Standard Organisation (ISO) for a refrigerator were achieved with LPG earlier than with R 134 a. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the system increases by 9. 5 % and the power consumption is reduced by 12 %, when compared with R 134 a. Therefore, LPG can successfully substitute R 134 a in domestic refrigerator...|$|E

In this approach, the chromophores are embedded in the electric field of its own point charges, which are evaluated through a self-consistent procedure including <b>charge</b> <b>scaling</b> {{to account for the}} screening of the dielectric. Once the crystal field is determined, dressed molecular polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities are calculated and used as input of an electrostatic interaction scheme to evaluate the crystal linear and nonlinear optical responses.

The converter consists of the <b>charge</b> <b>scaling</b> capacitor chain with two operational trans-conductance amplifiers (op amp) in voltage follower configuration. The op amps used in the design have the input common mode ranges of 0 to 11. 2 V and 4. 7 V to 14. 5 V respectively. Additional logic circuit topologies are designed, which help to switch the op amps when needed to provide a rail to rail unity gain at the output.

40|$|Most {{force field}} models for Room {{temperature}} ionic liquids cannot properly elucidate statics and dynamics. It {{is in this}} context that we set to assess {{the most efficient way to}} model RTILs while maintaining the integrity of the liquids statics and dynamics. The development approach begins with the investigation of the effects that the linear scaling of partial atomic charges on nonpolarisable force fields from a reference potential has on the structure and dynamics of the room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetraflouroborate [C 4 MIM][BF 4] and 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexaflourophosphate [C 4 MIM][PF 6]. The results show that the three-dimensional structure of the liquid is changed ever so slighter by the linear <b>scaling</b> of atomic <b>charges.</b> While dynamic properties such as viscosity and self-diffusion coefficients were majorly affected by <b>charge</b> <b>scaling.</b> Self-diffusion coefficients that span a range of four orders of magnitude between the original model and the scaled model where the ionic charge was ± 0. 6 e. Viscosity estimates calculated using the Green-Kubo and the Einstein relationships revealed that the linear <b>scaling</b> of atomic <b>charges</b> results in increased mobility of the simulated liquid. Implicit inclusion of polarisation effects was investigated, Here a new charge scheme development using Quantum mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods in CHARMM 35 interfaced with GAMESS-UK was propose. The atomic charges were derived from liquid phase calculations using an iterative procedure. This was carried out for individual ions and cation-anion pairs, for the analysis of charge transfer, within the liquid environment. The results obtained gave predictions of density, liquid structure and self-diffusion coefficients that were in excellent agreement with experimental data available. This method is preferable over the commonly used <b>charge</b> <b>scaling</b> methodology which is deem as an unphysical approach for the simulation of [C 4 MIM][BF 4] and [C 4 MIM][PF 6]. A polarisable force field based on the Drude oscillator model is presented. The model proves to be most effective for the simulation of RTILs.

As expected theoretically, counterions adsorb on the macroion surface in the amount much exceeding neutralization requirement, thus effectively inverting {{the sign of the}} macroion charge. We find two conditions necessary for charge inversion, namely, counterions must be multivalently charged and Coulomb interactions must be strong enough compared to thermal energy. On the other hand, coion condensation on the macroion suppresses the amount of charge inversion. Depending on parameters, we observe inverted charge up to about 200 % the original charge of the macroion in absolute value.

The proposed method, referred to as the Accelerated-SAR or A-SAR, is capable of updating both the lower and upper bounds in a single conversion cycle. Even in cases that it can update only one bound, it does more aggressively. The proposed technique is implemented in a 10 -bit SAR ADC circuit with 0. 5 V power supply and rail-to-rail input range.

In scenarios where the deployed chargers are static, we generally require a number of chargers to work simultaneously. However, due to the radio interference among different wireless chargers, scheduling these chargers is generally necessary. This scheduling problem is challenging since each charger's charging utility cannot be calculated independently due to the nonlinear superposition charging effect caused by radio interference. In this paper, based on the concurrent charging model, we formulate the concurrent charging scheduling problem (CCSP) {{with the objective of}} quickly fully charging all the sensor nodes. After proving the NP-hardness of CCSP, we propose two efficient greedy algorithms, and give the approximation ratio of one of them.
