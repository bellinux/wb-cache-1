40|$|The new {{paradigm}} of pharmaceutical industry is to move from batch to continuous processes {{in order to satisfy}} the stringent requirements of quality, safety and efficiency set by regulatory authorities and reduce production costs. In this perspective, freeze-drying needs to be completely rethought in order to be more integrated in the chain of production of drugs, more flexible to respond to variations in market needs and allowing the monitoring of product quality. The future of freeze-drying, as a downstream process, is therefore to move from batch to continuous. Over the past decades many ideas regarding <b>continuous</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> has been proposed, but none of them has been successfully applied. This work describes some of the drawbacks of batch freeze-drying and explains how these technical limits can solved by continuous technologies...|$|E
40|$|Governments {{worldwide}} {{have spent}} more money on nanotechnology between 1997 and 2005 than on the Apollo project. The spending trend is still going upwards. Drying is an indispensable operation in the fabrication of nanosized materials. Hence, {{it is no surprise}} to rind a large number of papers published in the past decade on drying and nano-related materials. This article reviews the literature and highlights the opportunities and challenges of freeze drying in nanotechnology. Freeze drying has found application in the production of nanoparticles for electrochemical, environmental, engineered materials, and pharmaceutical industries. The retention of the homogenous properties typically found in a solution, the small size of particles produced, and the long shelf life obtained for pharmaceutical applications are the primary reasons for choosing freeze drying. The relatively cheap operation cost compared to supercritical fluid extraction is another reason. Freezing was found to be a very important step in obtaining desired particle size and properties. Primary drying of solvent sublimation should be carried out at a temperature below the collapse temperature. Cryoprotectants are frequently necessary in preserving the original properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Spray freezing into liquid was found to be an optimal operation in order to minimize the air-liquid interfacial loss of bioactivity. A <b>continuous</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> process for production of granules of nanoparticles would be in demand, a dream that freeze-drying researchers have bad for over a decade. This freeze drying may be carried out under vacuum or at atmospheric pressure using proper gases...|$|E
40|$|Freeze-drying {{of sweet}} potato was studied using {{continuous}} and intermittent jar-infrared (FIR) assisted heating in this study. Intermittency levels of alpha = 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. were applied with a cycle time of 30 min, {{and it was}} found that the optimum intermittency level was alpha = 0. 5. The continuous (alpha = 1.) and intermittent (alpha = 0. 5) FIR-assisted freeze-drying processes were then performed using a three-level, three-factor experimental design and analyzed by response surface methodology (RSM). For both <b>continuous</b> and intermittent <b>freeze-drying,</b> the response variable of drying time was affected by drying temperature (X(1)) and sample thickness (X(3)) at the 5 % significance level; total color difference was affected by distance (X(2)) at a 95 % confidence level. In addition, rehydration ratio was significantly affected by drying temperature (X(1)) and sample thickness (X(3)) in continuous heating, and by thickness (X(3)) at a 0. 1 % level of significance. lit both continuous and intermittent FIR-assisted treatments, the coefficients of determination (R(2)) of surface response models of drying time, rehydration ratio, and total color difference were all found to be greater than 0. 90. Determination of optimum conditions was based on comparison between the control and FIR-assisted treatments. lit both continuous and intermittent treatments, optimum drying conditions could be established at 20 nun distance front FIR radiator to sample, and controlling the drying temperature in the range of 34 degrees C to 37 degrees C with 6 to 7 min sample thickness. Verification tests indicated that the generated second-order polynomial models were acceptable...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry is at {{a turning point}} of its history, shifting from a mass production of patented drugs to a more competitive, innovative and highly regulated market. In fact, {{the last few years}} has seen the rapid emergence of the industry of off-patented drugs and the increase of the requirements of quality, safety and efficiency set by regulatory authorities. In addition, in the next years, the production of personalized, ‘on-demand', drugs will replace completely the old, batch, technologies with more flexible systems and continuous processes (Byrn et al. 2015). As the future of the {{pharmaceutical industry}} is <b>continuous</b> manufacturing, also <b>freeze-drying</b> of pharmaceuticals needs to be converted to continuous and integrated into the production chain. In this perspective, the design of freezing step plays a central role to reach the more stringent requirements of quality, homogeneity and standardization of freeze-dried products (Barresi et al. 2009; Pisano et al. 2016). Both trial-and-error and black box approaches, that are widely used to design freeze-drying cycles, become not sufficient anymore. A new mindset toward research and development is required to open and look inside the ‘black box', in order to design freezing protocols that produce dried products with the desired final attributes, to predict its variability within a production and the losses due to undesired off-target products. Of course, the product structure is a key factor in the production of stable and valuable dried products, because it affects the stability of APIs, determines the drying and desorption rate and, finally, the appearance of the product, the residual moisture and the rehydration time. The objective of this work is to develop an innovative way for designing the freezing step {{in order to have a}} production of freeze-dried products with the desired attributes, and to have a good estimation of inter- and intra-vial heterogeneity. Our procedure consisted of coupling the distribution of nucleation temperature obtained from simple experimental tests with a detailed mathematical model of freezing. As case study, we compared the performances of two freezing protocols...|$|R
