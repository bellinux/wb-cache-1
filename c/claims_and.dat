5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the earthquake, most of South Africa's major banks and insurance companies had begun receiving insurance claims. By 6August 2014, ABSA had received 200 claims, Standard Bank had received 129 <b>claims</b> <b>and</b> Mutual & Federal had received 11 claims. A survey of 17 insurance companies done by finance website Justmoney showed that 5 out of the 17 companies surveyed would reject insurance claims related to the earthquake if it was proven to be mining-related.

5|$|Roosevelt had {{withdrawn}} much {{land from the}} public domain, including some in Alaska thought rich in coal. In 1902, Clarence Cunningham, an Idaho entrepreneur, had found coal deposits in Alaska, and made mining <b>claims,</b> <b>and</b> the government investigated their legality. This dragged on {{for the remainder of}} the Roosevelt administration, including during the year (1907–1908) when Ballinger served as head of the General Land Office. A special agent for the Land Office, Louis Glavis, investigated the Cunningham <b>claims,</b> <b>and</b> when Secretary Ballinger in 1909 approved them, Glavis broke governmental protocol by going outside the Interior Department to seek help from Pinchot.|$|E

5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic <b>claims</b> <b>and</b> classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the}} most powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, if not all, of the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E
5|$|By 21 June 2011, the Libyan {{government}} had dubiously {{claimed to have}} successfully shot down dozens of aircraft, including five Apaches; NATO denied these <b>claims</b> <b>and</b> no Apache losses have been acknowledged to date. On 8 July 2011, the MoD released information on {{the first month of}} Apache combat operations over Libya; noting that Apaches had engaged targets within Libya on 39 occasions. Apache operations over Libya have been heavily influenced and supported by NATO reconnaissance flights and intelligence missions; information is continually relayed to update target information, assess the threat of Surface to Air missiles (SAM), and the presence of civilians, enabling real time changes to mission profiles. On 6 August, Apaches struck a military communications facility and troops at Al Watiyah. Both the Apache and the Eurofighter Typhoon were withdrawn from Libyan operations in September 2011 as operational demands decreased.|$|E
