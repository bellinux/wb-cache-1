40|$|Abstract only We {{measured}} {{contrast sensitivity}} at three distances (330 mm, 660 mm and 4 m) with six contact lens and two multifocal spectacle corrections for presbyopia. The two spectacle corrections were D-segment bifocals and trifocals and the contact <b>lens</b> <b>corrections</b> were distance contact lens with lookover spectacles, soft progressive bifocals, soft concentric bifocals, monovision, modified monovision, and hard crescent segment bifocals. The spectacle corrections in general gave better {{results for the}} contrast sensitivity function (CSF), than did the contact <b>lens</b> <b>corrections.</b> Distance contact <b>lenses</b> with lookover spectacles performed best of the contact <b>lens</b> <b>corrections</b> used.

40|$|Abstract—Methods for {{estimating}} {{motion in}} video sequences {{that are based}} on the optical flow equation (OFE) assume that the scene illumination is uniform and that the imaging optics are ideal. When these assumptions are appropriate, these methods can be very accurate, but when they are not, the accuracy of the motion field drops off accordingly. This paper extends the models upon which the OFE methods are based to include irregular, time-varying illumination models and models for imperfect optics that introduce vignetting, gamma, and geometric warping, such as are likely to be found with inexpensive PC cameras. The resulting optimization framework estimates the motion parameters, illumination parameters, and camera parameters simultaneously. In some cases these models can lead to nonlinear equations which must be solved iteratively; in other cases, the resulting optimization problem is linear. For the former case an efficient, hierarchical, iterative framework is provided {{that can be used to}} implement the motion estimator.

40|$|Requirements for {{contemporary}} print inspection systems for industrial applications include, among others, high throughput, examination of fine {{details of the}} print, and inspection from various perspectives and different spectral sensitivity. Therefore, an optical inspection system for such tasks has to be equipped with several high-speed/high-resolution cameras, each acquiring hundreds of megabytes of data per second. This paper presents an inspection system which meets the given requirements by exploiting data parallelism and algorithmic parallelism. This is achieved by using complex field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) for image processing. The scalable system consists of several processing modules, each representing a pair of a FPGA and a digital signal processor. The main chapters of the paper focus on the functionality implemented in the FPGA. The image processing algorithms include flat-field <b>correction,</b> <b>lens</b> distortion correction, image pyramid generation, neighborhood operations, a programmable arithmetic unit, and a geometry unit. Due to shortage of on-chip memory, a multi-port memory concept for buffering streams of data between off-chip and on-chip memories is used. Furthermore, performance measurements of the processing module are presented...|$|E

Mean velocities, Reynolds stresses, and triple products were measured and are presented at axial positions ranging from x/H = 0. 2 - 14. A balance of the turbulent kinetic energy in the flow was performed. The production, convection, and diffusion of turbulent kinetic energy were computed directly from the experimental data using central differencing. A specially designed <b>correction</b> <b>lens</b> was employed to correct for optical aberrations introduced by the circular tube. This lens system allowed the accurate simultaneous measurement of axial and radial velocities in the test section. The experimental measurements were compared to predictions generated by a code that employed the k-epsilon turbulence model. Agreement was good for mean axial velocities, turbulent kinetic energy, and turbulent shear stresses. However, the modeled turbulent normal stresses where in poor agreement with the measured values. The modeled diffusion of turbulent kinetic energy was underpredicted in the region between the shear layer and the centerline of the flow giving lower values of turbulent kinetic energy downstream of the potential core than measured...|$|E

40|$|The design, {{analysis}} and preliminary {{testing of a prototype}} Adjustable Focus Optical <b>Correction</b> <b>Lens</b> (AFOCL) is described. The AFOCL {{is an active}} optical component composed of solid state lead lanthanum-modified zirconate titanate (PLZT) ferroelectric ceramic with patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent surface electrodes that modulate the refractive index of the PLZT to function as an electro-optic lens. The AFOCL was developed to perform optical re-alignment and wavefront correction to enhance the performance of Ultra-Lightweight Structures and Space Observatories (ULSSO). The AFOCL has potential application as an active optical component within a larger optical system. As such, information from a wavefront sensor would be processed to provide input to the AFOCL to drive the sensed wavefront to the desired shape and location. While offering variable and rapid focussing capability (controlled wavefront manipulation) similar to liquid crystal based spatial light modulators (SLM), the AFOCL offers some potential advantages because it is a solid-state, stationary, low-mass, rugged, and thin optical element that can produce wavefront quality comparable to the solid refractive lens it replaces. The AFOCL acts as a positive or negative lens by producing a parabolic phase-shift in the PLZT material through the application of a controlled voltage potential across the ITO electrodes. To demonstrate the technology, a 4 mm diameter lens was fabricated to produce 5 -waves of optical power operating at 2. 051 micrometer wavelength. Optical metrology was performed on the device to measure focal length, optical quality, and efficiency for a variety of test configurations. The data was analyzed and compared to theoretical data available from computer-based models of the AFOCL...|$|E

The key elements for the latter are new types of defocusing magnetic and electrostatic <b>correction</b> <b>lenses.</b> The lens systems have applications in any existing devices used to collect and focus energetic ions (including electrons). Typical devices are: mass spectrometers, leak detectors and gas analyzers, ion sources, accelerators and ion implantation systems, nuclear particle spectrometers, electron microscopes, ion microprobes, and ion‐beam lenses for cancer therapy...|$|R
40|$|We {{have seen}} in the last video how we can shift the focal point if we add a second lens to the {{original}} convex lens that is the model for our eye. This interactive animation lets you explore how to correct the vision problems of near sightedness and far sightedness. You can select either a near sighted eye, for which the eyeball is too long, or a far sighted eye, which has too short of an eyeball. You can then choose the appropriate type of eye glasses that will move the focal point onto the retina. For comparison, there is also a normal sighted eye for which the focal point is located on the retina. This eye sees distant object in focus, without the help of glasses. Play with the different arrangements, and describe what happens when you combine each of the eyes with a convex and with a concave lens. Make sure you understand which <b>correction</b> <b>lens</b> belongs to which vision problem, and why. Note how the concave lens in front of the eye spreads out the incoming rays, such that after passing through the eye's lens, they are not focused as close to the lens as before. The convex lens in front of the eye does just the opposite: now the focal point is closer to the lens than without it. And here is a tricky question: How come far sighted people can actually see far away objects just fine in focus, without eye glasses? Remember that the lens can be squeezed ??? and so far, we have looked at the eye only with the lens relaxed, that is, with the lens as thin as it can get.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the activities and}} accomplishments along with {{the status of the}} characterization of a PLZT-based Adjustable Focus Optical <b>Correction</b> <b>Lens</b> (AFOCL) test device. The activities described in this report were undertaken by members of the Center for Applied Optics (CAO) at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) under NASA Contract NAS 8 - 00188. The effort was led by Dr. Bruce Peters as the Principal Investigator and supported by Dr. Patrick Reardon, Ms. Deborah Bailey, and graduate student Mr. Jeremy Wong. The activities outlined for {{the first year of the}} contract were to identify vendors and procure a test device along with performing the initial optical characterization of the test device. This activity has been successfully executed and test results are available and preliminary information was published at the SPIE Photonics West Conference in San Jose, January 2001. The paper, "Preliminary investigation of an active PLZT lens," was well received and generated response with several questions from the audience. A PLZT test device has been commercially procured from an outside vendor: The University of California in San Diego (UCSD) in partnership with New Interconnect Packaging Technologies (NIPT) Inc. The device has been subjected to several tests to characterize the optical performance of the device at wavelengths of interest. The goal was to evaluate the AFOCL similar to a conventional lens and measure any optical aberrations present due to the PLZT material as a deviation in the size of the diffraction limited spot (blur), the presence of diffracted energy into higher orders surrounding the focused spot (a variation in Strehl), and/or a variation or spread in the location of the focused energy away from the optical axis (a bias towards optical wedge, spherical, comma, or other higher order aberrations). While data has been collected indicative of the imaging quality of the AFOCL test device, it was not possible to fully characterize the optical performance of the AFOCL alone because there were significant optical distortions due to fabrication related issues...|$|E
