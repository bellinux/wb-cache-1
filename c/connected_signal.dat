50|$|Prospecting {{and mining}} {{in the area}} first began around 1862, but the remote {{location}} and lack of transportation kept activity to a minimum. By 1904, the railroad was coming to nearby Parker, and local miners Newton Evans and Thomas Jefferson Carrigan saw an opportunity to develop the area. Within a few years, the two miners had built a 350-ton furnace, a water pipeline to the Bill Williams River, and hoists for five mine shafts. They called the new town Signal (not {{to be confused with}} the other Arizona ghost town of Signal). By 1908, the claims in the area had been consolidated by the Clara Gold and Copper Mining Company, which set up its headquarters in the mining camp that would become Swansea. That same year, what was to become the Arizona and Swansea Railroad <b>connected</b> <b>Signal</b> to Bouse some 25 mi away. These two factors spurred the growth of the town, and its population quickly grew to about 300 residents.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{methodology}} {{for the analysis}} of the dynamic supply current of digital CMOS devices is described. Especially the impact of parasitic inductance of supply lines will be investigated. Normally the dynamic current will be transmitted as conducted emission via the package to the PCB level. Together with the parasitic inductance of package and PCB traces this leads to a bounce of the IC ground level. <b>Connected</b> <b>signal</b> lines act as antennae and thus lead to radiated emission. Consequently the methodology is suitable to predict the EMI behavior of the analyzed IC. For the described di/dt-analysis the switching gates as noises sources as well as the supply lines as coupling paths will be taken into account. One major problem for performing an analysis of VLSI ICs is the complexity. This can be handled by simplifying the gate models and by analyzing only selected nets of interest...|$|E
40|$|Key message Brassinosteroids have {{important}} roles in plant development. This review focuses on the agro-nomic traits regulated by brassinosteroids in rice. Abstract Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of steroid phytohormones with wide-ranging biological activity. Genetic, genomic and proteomic studies have greatly advanced our understanding of BR signaling in Arabi-dopsis and revealed a <b>connected</b> <b>signal</b> transduction pathway from the cell surface receptor kinase BRASSI-NOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI 1) and BRI 1 -ASSO-CIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK 1) to the BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR 1) family of tran-scription factors and their targets mediating physiological functions. However, compared with the dicot model plant Arabidopsis, much less is known about BR signaling in rice, which is a monocot. In this review, we provide {{an update on the}} progress made by BR studies in rice and discuss how BR regulates various important agronomic traits to determine rice grain yield.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Bacillus subtilis {{in the year}} 2003 {{was followed by a}} decade of intensive research activity. Here we provide an overview of the lessons learned in that period. While the number of characterized kinases and phosphatases involved in reversible protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in B. subtilis has remained essentially unchanged, the number of proteins known to be targeted by this post translational modification has increased dramatically. This is mainly due to phosphoproteomics and interactomics studies, which were instrumental in identifying new tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Despite their structural similarity, the two B. subtilis protein-tyrosine kinases (BY-kinases), PtkA and PtkB (EpsB), seem to accomplish different functions in the cell. The PtkB is encoded by a large operon involved in exopolysaccharide production, and its main role appears to be the control of this process. The PtkA seems to have a more complex role; it phosphorylates and regulates a large number of proteins involved in the DNA, fatty acid and carbon metabolism and engages in physical interaction with other types of kinases (Ser/Thr kinases), leading to mutual phosphorylation. PtkA also seems to respond to several activator proteins, which direct its activity toward different substrates. In that respect PtkA seems to function as a highly <b>connected</b> <b>signal</b> integration device...|$|E
40|$|Shrinking {{devices to}} the nanoscale, {{increasing}} integration densities, and reducing of voltage levels {{down to the}} thermal limit, all conspire to produce faulty systems. Frequent occurrence of both soft faults due to noise and signal coupling, and hard faults due to process variations and defects can be expected. As error-free logic states {{can no longer be}} guaranteed, one possible solution is a paradigm shift to a fault-tolerant probabilistic framework. The probabilistic approach is based on the theory of Markov random fields (MRF), which guarantees the optimality of probabilistic reasoning and is extensible to a large number of logic variables interacting locally in small, <b>connected</b> <b>signal</b> nets. This article builds on the recent demonstration of significant noise immunity of MRF based logic elements and introduces a new redundancy element that can handle soft errors and single event upsets in sequential logic. The MRF probabilistic model is mapped onto CMOS circuitry, using feedback between transistors to reinforce the correct joint probability of valid logical states. SPICE simulations are used to compare the new MRF element with classical forms of modular redundancy elements and show that significant immunity to single-event upsets and noise can be achieved. An extension of the reinforcer concept to fault tolerance in larger systems using error correcting codes is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|A new Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. root mutant, named clg 1, was {{isolated}} from the Feldmann-Du Pont T-DNA insertional mutagenesis collection. it is characterized by primary roots that make early right-handed coils, show increased right-handed slanting, and reduced positive gravitropism. The mutant roots however did not exhibit increased resistance to IAA, but only a modest increment {{of resistance to the}} auxins 2, 4 D, and NAA, and to the auxin transport inhibitors TIBA and NPA. By contrast, the mutant roots showed a notable resistance to plant hormone ethylene (given as ACC). clg 1 appears to be new, since it complements the most known auxin and gravitropism mutants, maps to chromosome 5, and shows a phenotype largely {{different from that of the}} known ethylene mutants. The increased right-handed slanting (chirality) can possibly be a consequence of the reduced gravitropic response, since gravitropism and slanting are competitive growth-direction leading forces. The increased resistance to ethylene, seems to indicate that this phythormone plays a role in the gravitropic response of roots (as already proposed for shoots), and possibly in the regulation of the <b>connected</b> <b>signal</b> transduction pathway. The gene involved in the clg 1 mutation, which is recessive, was mapped, as above reported, to chromosome 5, close to the visible marker tt 3. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|In this paper, I outline a new {{approach}} towards media and diaspora using {{the concept of the}} ‘franchise nation’. It is my contention that current theories on migration, media and diaspora with their emphasis on exile, multiple belongings, hybrid identities and their representations are inadequate to the task of explaining {{the emergence of a new}} trend in diaspora, home and host nation relationship. This, I suggest, is a recent shift most notable in the attitudes of the Chinese and Indian governments toward their diasporas. From earlier eras where Chinese sojourners were regarded as disloyal and Indians overseas left to fend for themselves, Chinese and Indian migrants are today directly addressed and wooed by their nations of origin. This change is motivated in part by the realisation that diasporic populations are, in fact, resources that can bring significant influence to bear on home nation interests within host nations. Such sway in foreign lands gains greater importance as China and India are, by virtue of their economic rise and prominence on the world stage, subject to ever more intense international scrutiny. Members of these diasporas have willingly responded to these changes by claiming and cultivating pivotal roles for themselves within host nations as spokespersons, informants and representatives, trading on their assumed familiarity with home cultures, language and commerce. As a result, China and India have initiated a number of statecraft strategies in recent years to (re) engage their diasporas. Both nations have identified media as amongst the key instruments of their strategies. New media enhances the ability of all parties—home and host states, institutions and individuals—to participate, interact and reciprocate. While China’s centralised government has utilised the notion of soft power (ruan shili) to describe its practices, India’s efforts are diffused along the lines of nation branding via myriad labels like India Inc. and the Global Indian. To explain this emergent trend, I propose a new framework, franchise nation, defined as a reciprocal relationship between nation and diaspora that is characterised by mutual obligations and benefits. In appropriating this phrase from Stephenson, I liken contemporary statecraft operating in China and India to a business franchising system wherein benefits may be economic or cultural and; those thus <b>connected</b> <b>signal</b> their willingness for mutual exchange and concede a sense of obligation. As such, franchise nation is not concerned with remote, unidirectional interference in home nation affairs a la Anderson’s ‘long-distance nationalism’. Rather, it is a framework that seeks to reflect more closely the dynamism of the relationship between diaspora, home and host nations. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough small GTP-binding {{proteins}} of the Rho {{family have}} {{been implicated in}} signaling to the actin cytoskeleton, {{the exact nature of}} the linkage has remained obscure. We describe a novel mechanism that links one Rho family member, Cdc 42, to actin polymerization. N-WASP, a ubiquitously expressed Cdc 42 -interacting protein, is required for Cdc 42 -stimulated actin polymerization in Xenopus egg extracts. The C terminus of N-WASP binds to the Arp 2 / 3 complex and dramatically stimulates its ability to nucleate actin polymerization. Although full-length N-WASP is less effective, its activity can be greatly enhanced by Cdc 42 and phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) bisphosphate. Therefore, N-WASP and the Arp 2 / 3 complex comprise a core mechanism that directly <b>connects</b> <b>signal</b> transduction pathways to the stimulation of actin polymerization...|$|R

Other areas of current interest include the fundamental processes by which cells move - pseuclopods have been found to be generated in many different ways.
