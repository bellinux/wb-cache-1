5|$|Defeated enemies {{would drop}} {{two types of}} items: cards, which either {{unlocked}} new characters or allowed the player to boost their characters' stats when increasing their level; and bullets, {{which could be used}} on <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> had been increased to their maximum level, to transform them into higher-ranking cards. The player could also find other power-up items scattered in the arenas, which could be used to increase the speed or strength of their characters, recover health points, or make aiming easier.|$|E

50|$|Players {{take turns}} {{assuming}} {{the role of}} the Decider. The Decider reveals a Moment <b>Card</b> <b>that</b> describes a funny, embarrassing, or stressful situation for the group and a Decider <b>Card</b> <b>that</b> provides a guideline for choosing a winning Reaction. Players submit a Reaction Card from their hand face down, and the Decider selects the Reaction <b>Card</b> <b>that</b> he/she thinks is the best response to the Moment, given the Decider Card's rule.|$|R
50|$|A {{response}} <b>that</b> identifies a <b>card</b> <b>that</b> {{need not}} be inverted, or that fails to identify a <b>card</b> <b>that</b> needs to be inverted, is incorrect. The original task dealt with numbers (even, odd) and letters (vowels, consonants).|$|R
5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks is a 1980 {{adventure}} module for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game {{written by}} Gary Gygax. While Dungeons & Dragons (D) is typically a fantasy game, the adventure includes elements of science fiction, and thus {{belongs to the}} science fantasy genre. It takes place on a downed spaceship; the ship's crew has died of an unspecified disease, but functioning robots and strange creatures still inhabit the ship. The player characters fight monsters and robots, and gather the futuristic weapons and colored access <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> are necessary for advancing the story.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{version of}} the game is Two-player Tute, while the most played is Tute in Pairs, where four players form two teams. The object {{of the game is}} to score the most points in the baza (a pile next to a player that {{contains}} the <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> the player gets after winning a trick) and by declarations (holding certain combinations of cards). Due to its wide popularity, several variations of the game exist.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 28 games {{distributed}} on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were {{included with the}} console—a set of 12 in America and {{a different set of}} 10 in other countries—with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in a pack for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, Percepts, was available for free to players that sent in a survey card. A light gun accessory, Shooting Gallery, was available for purchase, and included four games on two <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> used the rifle. A final four games were released for sale in 1973, designed wholly or in part by Don Emry. The games do not enforce game rules or keep track of score; that is left up to the players.|$|E
50|$|Once {{a player}} drowns, all players discard their {{leftover}} stones, then check the cards {{they did not}} play. They receive one stone for each <b>card</b> <b>that</b> moves Pedro one space which they did not play, 1/2 for each <b>card</b> <b>that</b> moves Pedro two spaces for which they did not play (rounded down), and none for each <b>card</b> <b>that</b> moves Pedro three spaces. Once a player has been eaten by piranhas twice and receives two points, they lose, {{and all the other}} players win.|$|R

5000|$|Instant War - Any <b>card</b> <b>that</b> loses {{a battle}} is dead, or {{eliminated}} from the game. The <b>card</b> <b>that</b> wins returns to the original owner. When cards tie, only one card is played by each player in the war. A draw is possible, and game play is much quicker.|$|R
5|$|Outside of {{the main}} game, players can play an {{additional}} mode called Flick Rush, which can be played alone or with another player via wireless multiplayer. In this mode, players battle {{with a team of}} three Spirits and pit them against each other. Players fight against their opponent by flicking up cards from the touchscreen. Each card has a number value determining its attack strength, with multiple cards combining to increase the overall value. The player whose attack value is greater than their opponent's gets to attack with their Spirit. A slowly replenishing meter determines how many cards the player can send out at a time, and each Spirit has a limited amount of <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> can be replenished by swapping them out with another Spirit. The first player to eliminate all of their opponent's Spirits wins the game.|$|E
5|$|Shortwave {{listening}}, or SWLing, is {{the hobby}} {{of listening to}} shortwave radio broadcasts located on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists immersed in {{the technical aspects of}} radio reception and collecting official confirmations (QSL <b>cards)</b> <b>that</b> document their reception of distant broadcasts (DXing). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local medium wave AM broadcasters. In 2002, the number of households that were capable of shortwave listening was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.|$|E
5|$|The main {{collectibles}} {{available in}} Pokémon Channel are trading <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> display various Pokémon. The trading cards, known in game as Nice Cards, exist in three forms: Single, which simply show a picture; Motion, which are holographic; and Platinum, which are holographic {{and play the}} respective Pokémon's cries. The collectibles can be found by having Pikachu speak with other Pokémon and help them with tasks, or by ordering from Shop 'n Squirtle. There is a virtual Pokémon Mini console hidden under the player's bed that plays six games: Snorlax's Lunch Time (exclusive to Pokémon Channel) and five others previously released for the real-life Pokémon Mini.

Upon returning to the Bequest Globe between worlds, the player sees the Roman numerals in its display light up in relation to the <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> have been recovered. After recovering three of the lost artifacts, the player fails to recover the last one, the Ark of the Covenant, which {{takes the form of a}} nuclear warhead. The player is able to choose one of three endings, depending on whether they decide to enter a final doorway in the chambers of one of the two opposing factions represented by Kether and Malchut, or enter a new central chamber via the Bequest Globe.|$|E
5|$|David {{has been}} {{featured}} {{in a number of}} promotional materials for the Alien prequel films. For Prometheus, rather than focusing on the film's connection with the Alien canon, the marketing team emphasized central characters, most prominently David. On March 17, 2012, director Ridley Scott hosted a panel for Prometheus at WonderCon, where attendees were provided with Weyland Corporation business <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> provided a website and telephone number. Upon calling the number, callers were played an automated message that stated that Weyland Corporation's lines were busy, at which point a text message was sent that linked to a video narrated by Fassbender that showed David being unboxed, prior to his awakening. A month later, on April 17, an extended version of the unboxing video was released, with David providing additional insight into his function aboard the Prometheus as the ship's butler and maintenance man, as well as advertising his ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress. Released with the video was also a poster featuring David, which was printed as a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal.|$|E

5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the planned production start date. Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaac is a {{top-down}} dungeon crawler game, presented using two-dimensional sprites, {{in which}} the player controls Isaac or other unlockable characters as they explore the dungeons located in Isaac's basement. The characters differ in speed, amount of health, amount of damage they deal, and other attributes. The game's mechanics and presentation {{is similar to the}} dungeons of The Legend of Zelda, while incorporating random, procedurally-generated levels {{in the manner of a}} roguelike game. On each floor of the basement dungeon, the player must fight monsters in a room before continuing onto the next room. This is most commonly done by the character's tears as bullets in the style of a twin-stick shooter, but the player can also use a limited supply of bombs to damage enemies and clear out parts of the room. Other methods of defeating enemies become possible as the character gains power-ups, items that are automatically worn by the player-character when picked up that can alter the character's core attributes, such as increasing health or the strength of each tear, or cause additional side effects, such as for allowing charged tear shots to be fired after holding down a controller button for a short while, or a means to fire tears behind the character. Power-ups include passive items that improve the character's attributes automatically, active power-ups that can be used once before they are recharged by completing additional rooms in the dungeon, and single-use power-ups such as pills or Tarot <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> confer a one-time benefit when used, such as regaining full health, or increasing or decreasing all attributes of the character. The effect of power-ups stack, so that the player may come into highly-beneficial power-up combinations.|$|E

5|$|Veronica waits with Keith at an {{election}} party, where tensions are high {{due to the}} election being extremely close. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is nosing ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. After we learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call the numbers on the phone <b>cards</b> <b>that</b> Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that he should get a different lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends are angry about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation.|$|E
