5|$|Commentators {{have offered}} many {{theories}} for {{the origins of}} vampire beliefs, trying to explain the superstition – and sometimes mass hysteria – caused by vampires. Everything ranging from premature burial to the early ignorance of the body's decomposition cycle after death has been cited as the <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> belief in vampires.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Devol {{is viewed}} as a typical example of the Byzantine {{tendency}} to settle disputes through diplomacy rather than warfare, and was both a result of and a <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> distrust between the Byzantines and their Western European neighbors.|$|E

Given that there is usually an underlying <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{had access}} to the nuclear chemists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was able to work with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, who used the {{technique}} of neutron activation analysis. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians in Western {{cultures}} in particular often classify themselves {{as having an}} identity that defines their individual sexuality, {{as well as their}} membership to a group that shares common traits. Women in many cultures throughout history have had sexual relations with other women, but they rarely were designated as {{part of a group of}} people based on who they had physical relations with. As women have generally been political minorities in Western cultures, the added medical designation of homosexuality has been <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of a subcultural identity.|$|E

5|$|Like capital, {{the end of}} proto-globalization {{was filled}} with {{mobility}} of individuals. The time of proto-globalization was one filled with “mutual influence, hybridization, and cross-cultural entanglement”. Many historians blame this web of national entanglements and agreements as the <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> intensity and vast involvement during World War I. Between 1750-1880, the expansion of worldwide integration {{was influenced by the}} new capacities in production, transportation, and communication.|$|E
5|$|Mosaicism in horses {{is thought}} to account for some {{spontaneous}} occurrences of white, near-white, spotted, and roan horses. Mosaicism refers to mutations that occur after the single-cell stage, and therefore affect {{only a portion of}} the adult cells. Mosaicism may be one possible <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rare occurrence of brindle coloring in horses. Mosaic-white horses would be visually indistinguishable from dominant whites. Mosaicism could produce white or partially white foals if a stem cell in the developing foal underwent a mutation, or change to the DNA, that resulted in unpigmented skin and hair. The cells that descend from the affected stem cell will exhibit the mutation, {{while the rest of the}} cells are unaffected.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 89, the {{governor}} of Germania Superior, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, and his two legions at Mainz, Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax, revolted against the Roman Empire {{with the aid of}} the Germanic Chatti people. The precise <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rebellion is uncertain, although it appears to have been planned well in advance. The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military strategies, such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, as well as his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful policy of appeasement towards Decebalus.|$|E

5|$|The Dravidar Kazhagam {{came to be}} {{well known}} among the urban {{communities}} and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the Dalits. It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} twelve newborn babies in Banja Luka {{hospital}} {{due to a}} shortage of incubator bottled oxygen were cited as an immediate <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> action, but the veracity of the incident has since been questioned.

5|$|Video game critics gave Max Payne 2 highly {{positive}} reviews. Praise {{focused on}} its action and story, while criticism targeted its short length. Despite the positive reception, the game sold poorly, leading Rockstar Games' parent company Take-Two Interactive to cite Max Payne 2s sales as a <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company's reforecast finances of 2004. Max Payne 2 received several industry awards, including Outstanding Art Direction at the Golden Satellite Awards 2004, and Editors' Choice Awards from GamePro, IGN, and GameSpy.

5|$|When Said bin Taimur of Oman {{was ousted}} in a coup in July 1970 and {{replaced}} with his son Qaboos bin Said, he was sent in exile and lived at the Dorchester {{until his death in}} 1972. The McAlpine family owned the hotel until 1977 when they sold it to a consortium of businessmen from the Middle East headed by the Sultan of Brunei. On 3 June 1982, Shlomo Argov, the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom was shot and seriously injured in an assassination attempt as he left the Dorchester. The attack was the immediate <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1982 Lebanon War.|$|E

5|$|Controversy arose {{during the}} ten-lap Milan criterium {{of the ninth}} stage, when the riders staged a protest over what they viewed as unsafe riding {{conditions}} in that stage and those that preceded it. The most visible <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> protest was Rabobank rider Pedro Horrillo's accident during the eighth stage; Horrillo sustained numerous fractures and head injuries after tumbling over a barricade on the roadside while descending the Culmine di San Pietro. Horrillo fell more than , and nearly {{died as a result}} of his injuries. After spending five weeks in hospitals in both Italy and his native Spain, Horrillo eventually recovered, though the day on the Culmine di San Pietro was his last as a professional cyclist, as he retired before the 2010 season began.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Syrian superiority {{in numbers}} and equipment, the {{destruction}} of a multitude of armored vehicles and the infantry's failure to infiltrate Degania Alef was the likely <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> retreat of the main Syrian force to Samakh (Tzemah). A less-organized and sparsely numbered armored and infantry force forked off to attack Degania Bet. Eight tanks, supported by mortar fire, moved within 400 yards of the settlement defense, where they stopped to provide fire support for an infantry attack. The Syrians made two failed attempts to breach the Israeli small arms fire defense and gave up the attempt. Against this force, the Israelis had about 80 people and one PIAT. The defenses in Degania Bet were disorganized and there were not enough trenches. They also had no communication link to the command, so Moshe Dayan sent one of his company commanders to assess the situation.|$|E
5|$|Despite the cup {{success and}} arrival of new signing Geoff Hurst, Stoke laboured to a 15th-place finish in 1972–73. Smith blamed the car crash and {{subsequent}} injury to Gordon Banks in October 1972 as the <b>cause</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> club's mid-season slump, which compounded an already poor {{start to the}} season. Any concerns over relegation disappeared though with six victories in the final eight league matches. After a poor start to 1973–74, Waddington signed Alan Hudson in January 1974 to help revive the club's fortunes. The defence also improved, as Smith helped to ensure only two goals were conceded in the last nine matches of the season as Stoke finished fifth. On 23 February 1974, Smith scored the winning goal against Leeds to end their opponent's 29-match unbeaten run. Leeds went on to have a £250,000 bid for Smith turned down by Stoke in the summer.|$|E
