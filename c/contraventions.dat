He was quite content, for his hands and his brain were busy. Content, too, were his fellows of the tribe of Kerchak, searching for food in the clearing and the surrounding trees about him. No perplexing thoughts of the future burdened their minds, and only occasionally, dimly arose recollections of the near past. They were stimulated to a species of brutal content by the delectable business of filling their bellies. Afterward they would sleep--it was their life, and they enjoyed it as we enjoy ours, you and I--as Tarzan enjoyed his. Possibly they enjoyed theirs more than we enjoy ours, for who shall say that the beasts of the jungle do not better fulfill the purposes {{for which they are}} created than does man with his many excursions into strange fields and his <b>contraventions</b> of the laws of nature?

60|$|But again, these {{officials}} {{would have no}} sinecure. Crime would perhaps be less, {{for some of the}} motives of crime we may suppose would pass away. But if Socialism were carried out with any fulness, there would be more <b>contraventions.</b> We see already new sins ringing up like mustard—School Board sins, factory sins, Merchant Shipping Act sins—none of which I would be thought to except against in particular, but all of which, taken together, show us that Socialism can be a hard master even in the beginning. If it go on to such heights as we hear proposed and lauded, if it come actually to its ideal of the ant-heap, ruled with iron justice, the number of new <b>contraventions</b> will be out of all proportion multiplied. Take the case of work alone. Man is an idle animal. He is at least as intelligent as the ant; but generations of advisers have in vain recommended him the ant’s example. Of those who are found truly indefatigable in business, some are misers; some are the practisers of delightful industries, like gardening; some are students, artists, inventors, or discoverers, men lured forward by successive hopes; and the rest are those who live by games of skill or hazard—financiers, billiard-players, gamblers, and the like. But in unloved toils, even under the prick of necessity, no man is continually sedulous. Once eliminate the fear of starvation, once eliminate or bound the hope of riches, and we shall see plenty of skulking and malingering. Society will then be something not wholly unlike a cotton plantation in the old days; with cheerful, careless, demoralised slaves, with elected overseers, and, instead of the planter, a chaotic popular assembly. If the blood be purposeful and the soil strong, such a plantation may succeed, and be, indeed, a busy ant-heap, with full granaries and long hours of leisure. But even then I think the whip will be in the overseer’s hands, and not in vain. For, when it comes to be a question of each man doing his own share or the rest doing more, prettiness of sentiment will be forgotten. To dock the skulker’s food is not enough; many will rather eat haws and starve on petty pilferings than put their shoulder to the wheel for one hour daily. For such as these, then, the whip will be in the overseer’s hand; and his own sense of justice and the superintendence of a chaotic popular assembly will be the only checks on its employment. Now, you may be an industrious man and a good citizen, and yet not love, nor yet be loved by, Dr. Fell the inspector. It is admitted by private soldiers that the disfavour of a sergeant is an evil not to be combated; offend the sergeant, they say, and in a brief while you will either be disgraced or have deserted. And the sergeant can no longer appeal to the lash. But if these things go on, we shall see, or our sons shall see, what it is to have offended an inspector.|$|E
6000|$|In that {{imperfect}} {{state of}} society in which our system of representation began, {{the interests of the}} country were pretty exactly commensurate with its municipal divisions. The counties, the towns, and the seaports, accurately enough represented the only interests then existing; that is say,--the landed, the shop-keeping or manufacturing, and the mercantile. But for a century past, at least, this division has become notoriously imperfect, some of the most vital interests of the empire being now totally unconnected with any English localities. Yet now, when the evil and the want are known, we are to abandon the accommodations which the necessity of the case had worked out for itself, and begin again with a rigidly territorial plan of representation! The miserable tendency of all is to destroy our nationality, which consists, in a principal degree, in our representative government, and to convert it into a degrading delegation of the populace. There is no unity for a people but in a representation of national interests; a delegation from the passions or wishes of the individuals themselves is a rope of sand. Undoubtedly it is a great evil, that there should be such an evident discrepancy between the law and the practice of the constitution in the matter of the representation. Such a direct, yet clandestine, contravention of solemn resolutions and established laws is immoral, and greatly injurious to the cause of legal loyalty and general subordination {{in the minds of the}} people. But then a statesman should consider that these very <b>contraventions</b> of law in practice point out to him the places in the body politic which need a remodelling of the law. You acknowledge a certain necessity for indirect representation in the present day, and that such representation has been instinctively obtained by means contrary to law; why then do you not approximate the useless law to the useful practice, instead of abandoning both law and practice for a completely new system of your own? ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{all this}} I answer, {{that there is}} one darling {{inclination}} of mankind which usually affects to be a retainer to religion, though she be neither its parent, its godmother, nor its friend. I mean the spirit of opposition, that lived long before Christianity, and can easily subsist without it. Let us, for instance, examine wherein the opposition of sectaries among us consists. We shall find Christianity to have no share in it at all. Does the Gospel anywhere prescribe a starched, squeezed countenance, a stiff formal gait, a singularity of manners and habit, or any affected forms and modes of speech different from the reasonable part of mankind? Yet, if Christianity did not lend its name to stand in the gap, and to employ or divert these humours, they must of necessity be spent in <b>contraventions</b> to the laws of the land, and disturbance of the public peace. There is a portion of enthusiasm assigned to every nation, which, if it hath not proper objects to work on, will burst out, and set all into a flame. If the quiet of a State can be bought by only flinging men a few ceremonies to devour, it is a purchase no wise man would refuse. Let the mastiffs amuse themselves about a sheep's skin stuffed with hay, provided it will keep them from worrying the flock. The institution of convents abroad seems in one point a strain of great wisdom, there being few irregularities in human passions which may not have recourse to vent themselves in some of those orders, which are so many retreats for the speculative, the melancholy, the proud, the silent, the politic, and the morose, to spend themselves, and evaporate the noxious particles; for each of whom we in this island are forced to provide a several sect of religion to keep them quiet; and whenever Christianity shall be abolished, the Legislature must find some other expedient to employ and entertain them. For what imports it how large a gate you open, if there will be always left a number who place a pride and a merit in not coming in? ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} sentencing {{outcomes for}} <b>contravention</b> of family violence intervention orders in Victoria over two periods: 2004 – 05 to 2006 – 07 and 2009 – 10 to 2011 – 12. Summary This report examines sentencing outcomes for <b>contravention</b> of family violence intervention orders over two periods: 2004 – 05 to 2006 – 07 and 2009 – 10 to 2011 – 12. It also examines sentencing outcomes for <b>contravention</b> of family violence safety notices, which became available in December 2008 upon {{the commencement of}} the Family Violence Protection Act 2008 (Vic). The Use of Family Violence Intervention Orders and Safety Notices (Chapter 2) Underlying trends {{in the use of}} intervention orders and safety notices have influenced sentencing outcomes for <b>contravention.</b> The nature and extent of intervention order use has changed significantly, particularly since the introduction of the Family Violence Protection Act in 2008. Since 2004 – 05, there has been: 	an 82. 2 % {{increase in the number of}} intervention orders made by the Magistrates’ Court 	a 72. 8 % increase in reports of family violence incidents to Victoria Police 	a 295. 4 % increase in the number of children named as protected persons on intervention orders. Children now represent the single largest category of protected persons (46. 1 % of protected persons in 2011 – 12) 	an increase in family violence intervention orders initiated by Victoria Police. By 2011 – 12, the majority (67 %) of intervention orders were initiated by Victoria Police. In 2004 – 05, a minority (41 %) of intervention orders were initiated by Victoria Police. Sentencing Outcomes for Intervention Order and Safety Notice <b>Contravention</b> (Chapter 4) The sentencing outcomes for <b>contravention</b> of intervention orders have changed significantly. Between 2004 – 05 to 2006 – 07 and 2009 – 10 to 2011 – 12 : 	Fines, adjourned undertakings and community orders remained the most common sentences for intervention order <b>contravention,</b> but the distribution of these sentences changed markedly. 	Fines were imposed in 25. 8 % of cases (a decline of 30. 5 %), adjourned undertakings were imposed in 23. 4 % of cases (an increase of 27. 1 %) and community orders were imposed in 19. 2 % of cases (an increase of 9. 1 %). 	The sentencing outcomes for safety notice <b>contravention</b> were very similar to the sentencing outcomes for intervention order <b>contravention.</b> 	The use of fines declined by 34 % in cases where the <b>contravention</b> offence was the only offence sentenced, and by 32 % in cases where co-occurring offences were sentenced alongside the <b>contravention</b> offence. Accordingly, there was a shift away from fines even when controlling for wider criminality. 	For repeat intervention order <b>contravention</b> (that is, where an offender had previously been sentenced for contravening an intervention order), the use of fines almost halved and custodial sentences increased. As a result, imprisonment became, by a small margin, the most common sentence in repeat <b>contravention</b> cases (21. 7 % of cases). 	The shift away from fines was unique to <b>contravention</b> offences and did not reflect broader sentencing trends in the Magistrates’ Court. Explaining the Change in Sentencing Outcomes (Chapter 5) Based on consultations with stakeholders, the Council concludes that a change in sentencing practices – rather than a change in the nature of the <b>contravention</b> behaviour – is responsible for the most recent sentencing outcomes. Stakeholders consistently remarked on a cultural shift in the response to family violence by key criminal justice institutions, particularly the courts and police. The legislative and procedural reforms of the past five to ten years have brought about this process of cultural change. These reforms include: 	the introduction of the Family Violence Protection Act 2008 (Vic); 	procedural changes by Victoria Police, particularly pursuant to the revised Code of Practice for the Investigation of Family Violence, published in 2010; and 	the increasingly specialised nature of family violence decision-making and service provision in the Magistrates’ Court. Stakeholders commented that there is now a deeper understanding of the nature of family violence on the part of magistrates and police, which has in turn affected the sentences imposed for intervention order and safety notice <b>contravention...</b>|$|R
