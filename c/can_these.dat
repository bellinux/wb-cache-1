25|$|Many modern {{historical}} {{scholars have}} focused on the timing and the formation of the Mishnah. A vital question is whether it is composed of sources which date from its editor's lifetime, and to what extent is it composed of earlier, or later sources. Are Mishnaic disputes distinguishable along theological or communal lines, and in what ways do different sections derive from different schools of thought within early Judaism? <b>Can</b> <b>these</b> early sources be identified, and if so, how? In response to these questions, modern scholars have adopted a number of different approaches.|$|E
25|$|Some natural {{questions}} are: {{under what}} circumstances does this formalism work, and for what operators L are expansions in series of other operators like this possible? Can any function f be {{expressed in terms of}} the eigenfunctions (are they a Schauder basis) and {{under what circumstances}} does a point spectrum or a continuous spectrum arise? How do the formalisms for infinite-dimensional spaces and finite-dimensional spaces differ, or do they differ? <b>Can</b> <b>these</b> ideas be extended to a broader class of spaces? Answering such questions is the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra.|$|E
25|$|If the AMPK {{response}} to exercise is responsible {{in part for}} biochemical adaptations to training, how then <b>can</b> <b>these</b> adaptations to training be maintained if the AMPK {{response to}} exercise is being attenuated with training? It is hypothesized that these adaptive roles to training are maintained by AMPK activity and that the increases in AMPK activity in response to exercise in trained skeletal muscle {{have not yet been}} observed due to biochemical adaptations that the training itself stimulated in the muscle tissue to reduce the metabolic need for AMPK activation. In other words, due to previous adaptations to training, AMPK will not be activated, and further adaptation will not occur, until the intracellular ATP levels become depleted from an even higher intensity energy challenge than prior to those previous adaptations.|$|E

25|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{researchers}} seem to have shifted their focus from detecting, locating, and sequencing copy number variations to in depth analyses {{of the role of}} these copy number variations in the human genome and in nature in general. Evidence is needed to further validate the relationship between copy number variations and gene families as well as the role that natural selection plays in shaping these relationships and changes. Furthermore, researchers are also aiming to elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in copy number variations as it may reveal essential information regarding structural variations in general. Taking a step back, the area of structural variation in the human genome seems to be a rapidly growing research topic.

The Native Americans {{mentioned}} the evil spirits they purportedly encountered on the island long before it became a military prison. Mark Twain visited it, found the atmosphere of the island eerie, and described it as [...] "being as cold as winter, even in the summer months", and The Washington Post has also claimed that Alcatraz is a place [...] "where visitors can sense the dread of past inhabitants still trapped in the atmosphere." [...] The alleged haunting of the prison has been documented in numerous paranormal television series. Officials for Alcatraz have dismissed the reports of ghosts at Alcatraz as nonsense and deny their existence; an official for Alcatraz said in 1994, [...] "These ridiculous ghost stories will stop tourists from visiting.

And how <b>can</b> <b>these</b> people say they heard canaries? We don't have any birds in here." [...] Mary Forgione of the Los Angeles Times also stated that [...] "The National Park Service, which operates the island as a tourist site, pooh-poohs this, calling it Hollywood hype." [...] Alcatraz, run by the National Park Service, therefore does not operate an [...] "official ghost tour" [...] for tourists, but such tours, organized by independent parties, are permitted in the prison. Former prison guard Frank Healy, who served at Alcatraz {{as a young man}} from 1948 to 1951, has said that it was easy to gain a negative feeling at the prison {{at a time when it}} was all [...] "doom and gloom", although he said that if any place would have ghosts it would be Alcatraz. [...] Tracy Grant of The Washington Post, in discussing the book [...] "Ghost Hunt" [...] which documents the alleged haunting at Alcatraz, has said [...] "Authors Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson claim to be ghost hunters, and in this book they offer stories about the ghosts of inmates at Alcatraz prison and the idea that the ocean can be haunted.

Variety said that [...] "The ABC series remains one of primetime's most uncompromising efforts, and this year's latest wrinkle on flashbacks, flash-forwards and island-disappearing flashes of light does nothing to alter that perception." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Newark Star Ledger said that season 5 may finally be [...] "a day of reckoning between those viewers who embrace the show's science-fiction trappings, and those who prefer {{not to think about}} them." [...] Sepinwall also related that [...] "I loved every minute. But I'm also a geek who read Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov growing up." [...] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com criticized the use of time travel saying that [...] "when a narrator brings magic or time travel or an act of God into the picture, then uses it without restraint, the story loses its anchor to real life." [...] The critic also asked [...] "Why does it matter what Locke and Richard Alpert and Daniel Faraday or anyone else does, when they all seem as clueless and unfettered from reality as we are as viewers? How <b>can</b> <b>these</b> characters have any concrete agenda or strategic approach or philosophical perspective on anything when the rug is pulled out from under them by another Act of God every few seconds?" [...] The New York Times also commented that [...] "what has been most dispiriting about the current season is the show's willingness to abandon many of the larger and more compelling themes that grounded the elaborate plot: the struggles between faith and reason; the indictments of extreme capitalism, the futility of recovery. All that remains is the reductively limned battle between fate and free will largely playing out, now, in Jack Shephard's belief that returning to the island is his Destiny." [...] The A.V. Club said of the fifth-season finale, [...] "Me? I found the ending frustrating, but in a good way. This finale was entertaining as all get-out to me, and despite the occasional groaner moment, I think this may be Lost's most purposeful, surprising finale." ...|$|E
