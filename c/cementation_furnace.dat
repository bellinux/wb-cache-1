25|$|This is now done {{by forcing}} a jet of {{high-pressure}} oxygen into a special rotating container containing the pig iron. Some {{of the carbon}} is oxidised into carbon monoxide, CO, and carbon dioxide, CO2. This also oxidizes impurities in the pig iron. The container is rotated and the processed pig iron can {{be separated from the}} oxidised impurities. Before the mid 19th century, pig iron from the blast furnace was made into wrought iron, which is commercially pure iron. At that period, if steel was needed, particularly pure varieties of iron were heated with charcoal in a <b>cementation</b> <b>furnace</b> to produce blister steel (with about 1-2% carbon). This might be further purified using the crucible technique, but steel was too expensive to use on a large scale. However, with the introduction of the Bessemer process in the late 1850s and then other processes, the production of steel was dramatically increased. By the late 19th century most iron was being converted to steel before use.|$|E

50|$|The {{cementation}} process is an obsolete technology for making steel by carburization of iron. Unlike modern steelmaking, it increased {{the amount of}} carbon in the iron. It was apparently developed before the 17th century. Derwentcote Steel Furnace, built in 1720, is the earliest surviving example of a <b>cementation</b> <b>furnace.</b> Another example in the UK is the <b>cementation</b> <b>furnace</b> in Doncaster Street, Sheffield.|$|E
50|$|In 1934, Sandersons {{transferred}} {{their works}} to Kayser Ellison, combining the two sites {{to form a}} new, larger Darnall Works. Sandersons had finally stopped using their <b>cementation</b> <b>furnaces</b> in the 1920s, and Kayser Ellison soon demolished these, along with the west range of crucible steel shops from the 1870s.|$|R
50|$|The furnace {{was built}} in 1848 to produce steel by the {{cementation}} process by the local steel firm of Daniel Doncasters and Sons, a firm which had been established in Sheffield in 1778. By 1860 there were 250 <b>cementation</b> <b>furnaces</b> in Sheffield capable of producing 80,000 tons of blister steel and the large conical structures were a characteristic feature of the city‘s industrial landscape. The furnace on Doncaster Street is the only remaining example which is undamaged although {{there are two other}} sites in the immediate area which have examples which are partially intact, these being at Bower Spring and Millsands. The Doncaster Street furnace operated throughout World War II and a blackout cover was fitted to the furnace outlet as a precaution during air raids, this is still in place today (painted white). The furnace ceased operation in 1951.|$|R
5000|$|In 1738 Nehemiah's son William Champion {{patented}} {{a technique}} {{for the first}} industrial scale distillation of metallic zinc known as distillation per descencum or [...] "the English process." [...] This local zinc was used in speltering and allowed greater control over the zinc content of brass {{and the production of}} high-zinc copper alloys which would have been difficult or impossible to produce using cementation, for use in expensive objects such as scientific instruments, clocks, brass buttons and costume jewellery. However Champion continued to use the cheaper calamine cementation method to produce lower-zinc brass and the archaeological remains of bee-hive shaped <b>cementation</b> <b>furnaces</b> have been identified at his works at Warmley. By the mid-to-late 18th century developments in cheaper zinc distillation such as John-Jaques Dony's horizontal furnaces in Belgium and the reduction of tariffs on zinc as well as demand for corrosion-resistant high zinc alloys increased the popularity of speltering and as a result cementation was largely abandoned by the mid-19th century.|$|R

50|$|A <b>{{cementation}}</b> <b>furnace</b> {{might be}} used to convert the bar iron (if it was pure enough) into blister steel by the cementation process, either {{as an end in itself}} or as the raw material for crucible steel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process was}} {{described}} in a treatise published in Prague in 1574. It was again invented by Johann Nussbaum of Magdeburg, who began operations at Nuremberg (with partners) in 1601. The process was patented in England by William Ellyot and Mathias Meysey in 1614. [...] At that date, the [...] "invention" [...] could consist merely of {{the introduction of a}} new industry or product, or even a mere monopoly. They evidently soon transferred the patent to Sir Basil Brooke, but he was forced to surrender it in 1619. A clause in the patent prohibiting the import of steel was found to be undesirable because he could not supply as much good steel as was needed. [...] Brooke's furnaces were probably in his manor of Madeley at Coalbrookdale (which certainly existed before the English Civil War) where two <b>cementation</b> <b>furnaces</b> have been excavated. [...] He probably used bar iron from the Forest of Dean, where he was a partner in farming the King's ironworks in two periods.|$|R
5000|$|The {{establishment}} {{was successful}} and, in 1871, Sandersons decided to concentrate {{production at the}} Darnall site. To increase capacity, the firm constructed several new buildings in 1871 and 1872, {{and these are the}} oldest surviving structures on the site. <b>Cementation</b> <b>furnaces</b> had fallen out of favour, and the new buildings instead contained 180 crucible furnaces. [...] Two abutting ranges of steel shops survive, both single-storey, in brick with asbestos cement, roofed partly in slate and partly in corrugated asbestos. The south-east range provided 84 holes for steel manufacture, while the south range had 24, designed to allow the casting of big objects using the [...] "continuous teeming" [...] method of production; a further west range was similar to the south range, giving a total of 132 melting holes. The south range alone cost £6000 to construct, and it remained in use for around fifty years, briefly resuming production during World War II. The two ranges are Grade II* listed and form the core of the Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|R
50|$|In {{the century}} after the Old Blast Furnace closed, it became buried. There was a {{proposal}} for the site to be cleared and the furnace dismantled, but fortunately, {{it was decided to}} excavate and preserve it. It and a small museum were opened to celebrate 250 years of the Company in 1959. This became part of a larger project, the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. Its Museum of Iron is based in the Great Warehouse constructed in 1838 and Ironbridge Institute is based in the Long Warehouse, these two form the sides of an open space. On another side of which is the Old Blast Furnace, now under a building (erected in 1981) to protect it from the weather. The fourth side is a viaduct carrying the railway that delivers coal to the Ironbridge Power Station. One of the two tracks is due to be taken over by Telford Steam Railway as part of its southern extension from Horsehay. The Museum's archaeology unit continues to investigate the earlier history of Coalbrookdale, and has recently excavated the remains of the 17th century <b>cementation</b> <b>furnaces,</b> near the site of the Upper (formerly Middle) Forge.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cementation</b> <b>furnace</b> in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England is a Grade II Listed Building and is {{the only}} example of this type of steel making furnace to survive intact in Great Britain. It is {{situated}} on Doncaster Street in the St Vincent's Quarter just 1 km north west of the city centre.|$|E
50|$|In 1864, Auguste-Nicolas Bauche, {{expert in}} {{fire-resistant}} materials, began to produce safes and founded his first production factory in Gueux, near Reims in France. By 1867, the Gueux workshops {{had become too}} cramped. The factory was moved to Reims with more modern workshops incorporating a technological breakthrough of the time: a <b>cementation</b> <b>furnace</b> for the extreme hardening of the surface of certain steels.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} already in {{industrial}} use, as the Don Glass Works, which English Heritage believe were probably already established in 1793, centred on a glass cone. The Sanderson Brothers were able to acquire the site on a 21-year lease for £13/13/0 annual rent. As part of this, it appears that they took over the glassworks, where possible learning technological advances in one industry to develop the other, and perhaps adapting the glass cone into a <b>cementation</b> <b>furnace.</b> Both cementation and crucible furnaces were definitely in use, but the glassworks was sold off during the 1850s to Melling, Carr and Co, who operated it until {{the start of the}} 20th century. Although the glassworks then closed, and there are no above-ground remains, English Heritage consider it likely that there are significant underground structures, along with discarded glass, and this forms part of the justification for the listing of the site as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, ironworkers in Western Europe had {{developed}} the cementation process for carburizing wrought iron. Wrought iron bars and charcoal were packed into stone boxes, then sealed with clay {{to be held}} at a red heat continually tended in an oxygen-free state immersed in nearly pure carbon (charcoal) for up to a week. During this time, carbon diffused into the surface layers of the iron, producing cement steel or blister steel - also known as case hardened, where the portions wrapped in iron (the pick or axe blade) became harder, than say an axe hammer-head or shaft socket which might be insulated by clay to keep them from the carbon source. The earliest place where this process was used in England was at Coalbrookdale from 1819, where Sir Basil Brooke had two <b>cementation</b> <b>furnaces</b> (recently excavatedin 2001 - 2005). For a time in the 1610s, he owned a patent on the process, but had to surrender this in 1619. He probably used Forest of Dean iron as his raw material, but it was soon found that oregrounds iron was more suitable. The quality of the steel could be improved by faggoting, producing the so-called shear steel.|$|R
