40|$|The {{article is}} based on {{empirical}} research conducted by the author in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The research comprised licence agreements (for both export and import), concluded between 1981 - 1987 by Polish enterprises with partners from the CMEA countries. Analysing the contents of the contracts the author takes into account the stipulations of the CMEA documents which in the form of "directives" regulate the circulation of so-called „. scientific and technical works". Taken into account were the stipulations of Organizational, Methodical, Economic and Legal Foundations for Scientific and Technological Co-operation of the CMEA Member States of 1972 (in the 1986 version) and the provisions of „model forms of licencing agreements" issued by the CMEA Secretariat in 1975. The purpose of the analysis was to establish to what degree the solutions recommended for application within the CMEA influence the praxis of shaping the contents of contracts. It should be emphasized that licence relations have not yet been regulated in the acts of the so-called „CMEA common '' law". Besides, the author analyses the contents of particular clauses, especially those of importation contracts, from the viewpoint of their agreement with Polish norms regulating the transfer of technology contained in the 1986 Regulation on Principles and Procedure of Exportation and Importation of Scientific and Technical Achievements issued by the Minister of Foreign Trade. The author aims at establishing to what degree Polish licencees are able to secure for themselves preferred elements of the contents of contracts and to what degree <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>importation</b> of technology from the CMEA countries are tainted with restrictive practices. The author carries out a survey of typical licence clauses, in particular clauses regulating the extent and character of a licence, the transfer of technical documentation, the exchange of technological improvements, the licensor's legal and technical protective measures and the liability for infringing them, technical assistance, licence fees and their payments, measures to protect the secrecy of know- -how, the clauses regulating the settling of disputes and the choice of applicable law. Then, the author turns her attention to the areas of inadequate contractual regulation (especially the problems of liability and the choice of applicable law). She also discovers in importation contracts. concluded with the CMEA countries the existence of practices restricting the economic activity of Polish licences. From among the restrictive clauses indicated in the Regulation of 1986 the author finds the restrictions as to the right of granting sublicences, exportation restrictions and interdictions to question the licensor's protective title. In that connection the author deals with the character of Polish legal norms regulating the transfer of technology and analyses the relation of these provisions to the norms of the Law on Counteracting Monopolistic Practices. She concludes that restrictive licence clauses may be subject to, sanctions provided for in the Law. The last part of her article is devoted to the problem of transfer of technology within joint ventures carried out with partners from the CMEA countries. Legal foundations of such a form of co-operation and means of transfering the technology within joint ventures have been discussed.

40|$|Based on the {{findings}} of this study, the following actions are proposed for consideration by the Government of Kenya: 1. Raise public investment in maize seed breeding and agronomic research {{to make it possible for}} improvements in smallholder crop productivity. Based on research evaluating the returns to alternative investments in agriculture, public expenditures in maize seed breeding and agronomy may constitute the single most important investment to promote broad-based productivity growth and poverty reduction in Kenya. 2. Explore options for improving public and private extension programs to enable farmers to adopt improved farm technologies generated from point 1. 3. Examine options for bringing more land in Kenya under potential cultivation by smallholder farmers. Unless the land constraints in currently densely populated rural areas of Kenya are relieved, it is unlikely that a large portion of farmers in Kenya that own less than one hectare will be able to rise out of the semi-subsistence conditions that keep them trapped in poverty. 4. Support training programs to enable smallholders to develop more effective marketing strategies and to negotiate more effectively with traders, in order to raise the prices that they receive for their maize. 5. Raise public investment in road, rail, and port infrastructure to reduce marketing costs as well as the cost of modern inputs such as fertilizer to the farm gate. Rehabilitating the Kenyan railway system would be a key priority. If this were done prior to 2009, maize imports could have arrived in greater volumes much faster in early 2009 and pushed food prices down faster. 6. When early warning estimates predict a need for large import quantities, remove the import tariff soon enough to allow traders to import over a sufficiently long period to avoid transport capacity constraints and domestic stockouts. 7. Review the rationale for denying import licenses when applied for by traders. 8. Consider the costs and benefits from the standpoint of governments of transitioning from discretionary trade and marketing policy to adherence to more systematic rules-based policies. Nurturing credible commitment in regard to trade policy is likely to promote market predictability and therefore, lead to greater supplies and price stability in food markets during times of domestic production shortfalls. 9. Consider whether current proposals for international stockholding would be effective in the presence of domestic transport capacity constraints. International physical or financial reserves would not be able to relieve localized food production shortfalls unless local transport capacity is adequate to absorb sufficient imports within a concentrated period or unless import licenses are provided or the state carries out or <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> the <b>importation</b> from the international stock source.
