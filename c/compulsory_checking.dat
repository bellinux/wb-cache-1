5000|$|The Contagious Diseases Acts, {{also known}} as the CD Acts, were {{originally}} passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1864, with alterations and editions made in 1866 and 1869. In 1862, a committee was established to inquire into venereal disease (i.e. sexually transmitted infections) in the armed forces. On its recommendation the first Contagious Diseases Act was passed. The legislation allowed police officers to arrest women suspected of being prostitutes in certain ports and army towns. The women were then subjected to <b>compulsory</b> <b>checks</b> for venereal disease. If a woman was declared to be infected, she would be confined in what was known as a lock hospital until she recovered or her sentence finished. The original act only applied to a few selected naval ports and army towns, but by 1869 the acts had been extended to cover eighteen [...] "subjected districts".|$|R
50|$|The Contagious Diseases Acts were {{introduced}} in the 1860s, adopting the French system of licensed prostitution, {{with the goal of}} minimising venereal disease. Prostitutes were subjected to <b>compulsory</b> <b>checks</b> for venereal disease, and imprisonment until cured. Young women officially became prostitutes and were trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by Josephine Butler, legalised prostitution was stopped in 1886 and Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 made numerous changes that affected prostitution, including criminalising the act of procuring girls for prostitution by administering drugs or intimidation or fraud, suppressing brothels and raising the age of consent for young women from 12 to 16. This last provision undercut the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand. The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.|$|R

5000|$|This book, written {{under the}} nom de plume FF 8282, {{documents}} Archer's {{introduction to the}} prison system. He was to spend the first 22 days and 14 hours in HMP Belmarsh, a double A-Category high-security prison in South London. Although Archer spent {{less than a month}} there, Belmarsh is described as a real hell-hole. Despite this, many of the inmates are extremely kind to him and regale him with anecdotes, which he duly records.One such prisoner apparently spoken of is the inspiration to one of his short stories from Cat O'Nine Tales, [...] "It Can't Be October Already".On the other hand, some of the information Archer learns in his three weeks at Belmarsh is extremely disturbing, and he makes great play of imagining that the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, ought to be reading it and asks for his attention. One theme is the fact that some inmates are thrown into cells for first time offences even though the cellmate is a hardened criminal or murderer and/or drug addict. Further, it seems there are more heroin addicts coming out of prison than going in. This is because of both random and <b>compulsory</b> <b>checks</b> in which the inmates have discovered cannabis does not leave the system any time soon, but heroin is flushed out of the body in 24 hours providing large quantities of water have been consumed. They want a drug and this is the one they can obtain.Other inmates he talked with include an experienced Listener (for the Samaritans), who had been sexually abused through much of his childhood, existing as a sex-slave, and only knew crime. The very people set up by the institutions to protect him like social workers and magistrates, judges and policemen, let him down, and also paid to abuse him.|$|R
50|$|The {{movement}} {{also had}} to address women who thought regulations should be reformed rather than abolished. These women, often from the upper classes, thought greater control of prostitution would reduce the health risks from sexually transmitted diseases, both for the men buying sex and for their wives, and reduced the risk of women being attacked by men unable to find an outlet for their sexual urges.Thus Lady Henry Somerset, first vice-president of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, advocated reforming regulations in India rather than abolishing them. IAFactivists in all countries were consistently opposed to such a position.Supporters of regulation were able to show statements from women in prostitution that they felt safer in brothels than on the streets, health checks let them gain business by showing clients they had {{a clean bill of}} health, and government regulation removed the stigma of their occupation.

40|$|Background: Salmonella {{infection}} and diarrhoeal diseases are major causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} in the developing world. All expatriates applying for work permits in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) have to undergo a governmental <b>compulsory</b> health <b>check</b> program. Aim of the study: To estimate the number of salmonella carriers who had previously been diagnosed as free of infection. Subjects and methods: Over a period of two years, a total of 17, 918 workers in Al-Qatif area, in the Eastern Province were tested for salmonella on stool samples. Results: Three hundred and twenty eight were found to be asymptomatic carriers of salmonella. The highest frequency was found among workers from Egypt (13. 1 &#x 0025;) while Filipinos and Indians were the lowest carriers (1. 2 &#x 0025;). Salmonella serogroups E, C 1 and C 2 were most common (29 &#x 0025;, 29 &#x 0025; and 23. 5 &#x 0025; respectively) followed by serogroups B, D and C (13 &#x 0025;, 3. 7 &#x 0025; and 1 &#x 0025; respectively). No Shigella species were isolated. All carriers were given antibiotics and were instructed in prophylactic hygiene measures. After completing the course of antibiotics, they were retested and found to be clear of infection. Conclusion: The health check system in this area will contribute towards the prevention of outbreaks of infection by salmonell...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the recent Autonomous Boroughs and Regions Conference and thirty years on from its passing as Law 833 / 78, we were brought once again {{to dwell on the}} themes of <b>Compulsory</b> Health <b>Checks</b> and <b>Compulsory</b> Health Treatment. In {{accordance}} to Law 833, decreed in 1978, CHT’s for patients with mental illnesses considered as being serious, acquired the ability to be able to treat patients under the rights for the protection of health for the individual. In view of the delicacy and complexities found in applying CHT and the margin for ‘interpretation’ regarding its procedures, throughout the years a very diverse and varied image comes forth of its application in accordance to standards, even within different branches in the same territory. And {{as a result of these}} differences new recommendations were laid out during the recent ABR conference. Here, in due respect to the recent and innovative discussions about necessary improvements to the procedures adopted in CHT and CHC, we will set forth our own thoughts on the subject highlighting especially the increased attention given to the protection of the fundamental rights of the individual, be they minors or persons with psychiatric disorders subject to protection. Despite these new guidelines, the everyday practical problems in providing the service remain largely ignored whether or not we are dealing with emergency services or, as is even more the case, where patient consent is unavailable even on a long term basis...|$|R

40|$|Postavke rada temelje se na istraživanju povijesti i pojava unutar upravnoga kotara Nova Gradiška od 1886. do 1914., djelovanju njegovih institucija i svakodnevnog života njegovih stanovnika. Proučavanjem upravnih, obrazovnih, ekološko-zdravstvenih te socijalno-ekonomskih aspekata društva, stvoreni su okviri za razumijevanje pojma „svakodnevnog“ koji se uvodi kao sinonim za sveukupnost kapilarnih struktura i pojava života stanovnika novogradiškoga kotara. Povezujući povijesne pojave sa životnom svakodnevicom, ostvaren je sustavan pregled značajki prostora i ljudi u vremenskom periodu od dvadesetak godina. Nadalje, pomoću modela relacija mikro – makro i makro – makro, primijenjenih na obrađenim objektima istraživanja, pokušalo se utvrditi postoje li zakonitosti te kakav je bio odnos lokalnoga, regionalnoga i pokrajinskog konteksta. Korištenjem metodološke paradigme bazirane na kronološko-problemskom pristupu, multiperspektivnosti i vertikalnoj te horizontalnoj usporedbi podataka o kotaru Nova Gradiška s sličnim i većim upravnim jedinicama odgovorilo se na pitanje kako je bio organiziran život u kotaru Nova Gradiška. Tematski gledano, ovaj rad istražuje područje širega novogradiškoga kraja koji je nastao sjedinjenjem općine Cernik i dijela Gradiškog okružja 1886. u jedinstven kotar Nova Gradiška kao dio Požeške županije. U području školstva, zdravstva, gospodarstva i uprave, potvrđene su hipoteze, a u području demografije i modernizacije one su opovrgnute dok se u segmentu ekologije pojavio novi aspekt istraživanja. Istraživanjem specifičnih objekata, stvorena je baza za razumijevanje procesa i pojava koji su započeli krajem 19. ili početkom 20. stoljeća, a manifestirali su se u svojoj punini tek u suvremeno doba: poput sukoba Hrvata i Srba na tom području ili, posebice, važnosti uloge Andrije Štampara koji je svoje prve ideje formirao tijekom djelovanja u novogradiškom kotaru. Uvođenjem nekih rubnih tema koje dosad nisu istraživane, poput ekološko-zdravstvene historije ili humanitarnih dimenzija povijesti, sagledana je na drugačije perspektiva malog čovjeka u sveukupnosti života u jednom razdoblju novogradiške prošlosti. Premises of {{this thesis}} {{are based on}} the {{research}} of history and phenomenons in the Nova Gradiška administrative district from 1886. till 1914., work of its institutions and everyday life of its population. By studying administrative, economic, educational, ecological, health and social - economic aspects of the society the framework was created for understanding the term "everyday", which is introduced as a synonym for the totality of capillary structures and appearances of life for the population of Nova Gradiška district. Pervading and connecting historical phenomenon with everyday life and peoples features through a short time period of twenty years systematic overview of the area was created. With the help of micro - macro and macro - macro relations applied on processed objects of research it was tried to determine the existence of legality and what was the true nature of regional and broader national context. Considering the material, objects of the research were district institutions, population, marginal and privileged groups, factories and a number of different economic, social and ecological appearances in the district area of Nova Gradiška. For more efficient development of the crucial thesis these objects were put in following correlations: individual ↔ institution, village ↔ market town, market town ↔ district, district ↔ county, district ↔ district, market town ↔ town and district ↔ province. Topic of this thesis is researching a broader area of Nova Gradiška from 1886. till 1914. The area around Nova Gradiška was divided administratively and functionally since the forming of Slavonian military border in 1745. till the repeal of Gradiška regiment in 1871., in 1886. it was placed under Požega county and united with Cernik seigniory. In methodological context the thesis is based on the combination of chronological – problematic approach, multiperspectivity, interdisciplinarity and horizontal – vertical comparison of quantitive data. Because of the use of different materials, it was necessary to widen the horizon in understanding of certain areas, so I reached for the accomplishments in other areas of science, like art history, ethnology, museology and medicine. In every chapter of the thesis I tried to observe the topic from different perspective of macro and micro relations, from the dominant perspective of institutions and also from the perspective of an individual. Because of that I used multiperspectivity the same as private collections of materials, so all the findings can be interpreted on different levels. This research was focused on a number of questions and working hypothesis, and all of them were subjected to a common denominator of horizontal and vertical comparison of Nova Gradiska district with smaller, similar and bigger administrative units. By understanding the main hypothesis of the co-dependency between the Nova Gradiska district and Brod district, Pozega county and Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, we can understand how life in Nova Gradiska district was organized. By horizontal comparison of data from Nova Gradiska district and data from Brod district, and vertical comparison of data from Nova Gradiska district and Pozega county and Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, throughout all the chapters of thesis an authenticity and similarity in ways of functioning were observed. Administrative activity of Nova Gradiska district was a result of professional and political activity of the administration, and was completely under provincial and county verification. In political context Nova Gradiska district was under the events happening on a state, province and county level {{with the exception of the}} period 1895. – 1905. when the political actions were under the influence of city of Brod. During that period the Club of the Party of Rights and working movement was organized. Bad coexistence of Croats and Serbs in the area of Nova Gradiska district was transformed because of the common political interests and activity of Croatian – Serbian coalition in cooperation, which brought a late victory at elections during 1908. in Nova Gradiska district. The high treason process wasn’t directly accepted as negative in the Nova Gradiska district, but was understood in the context of what it was: manipulative tool for justifying the annexation of Bosnia and Hercegovina. Nova Gradiska district didn’t follow the demographic trends of transition since on its area the communities were homogenous with the higher rate of marriages, higher birth and higher mortality rates. The co-dependency of the man and nature in Nova Gradiska district was noticed in both directions, mans influence on nature and natures on man. In the beginning of the first industry activities at Cernik seigniory, as a result of cutting down the forest appear a land erosion causing flood and hunger. On the other hand with inadequate regulation of river Sava, a flood was caused in Posavina, and due to its slow withdrawal to river bed the population was exposed to diseases and hunger. As a surprising element in research the connection between human inadequate repairs and landscaping with the appearance of floods and hunger was noticed. Economic activity of Nova Gradiska district didn’t deviate from the whole Pozega County. The same as in Pozega County, the majority of the population was working in the primary sector, Nova Gradiska district didn’t wholly follow all the economical tendencies of the region, nor the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, so the growth of the district was slower. Nova Gradiska district was more similar, in cattle breeding for example, to Daruvar, Novska and Pakrac district then to Pozega and Brod district. In comparison to Pozega district, Nova Gradiska district had more family-household structures which were adopting harder to individual managing, in comparison to Brod area, Nova Gradiska district became more isolated with the termination of steamship station in Stara Gradiska in 1892. Nova Gradiska district experienced the economical growth from 1890. till 1900. when they started with bigger exploitation of natural resources, organizing more industrial complexes, housing bigger populations of workers and organizing the Economy exhibition of 1894. Nova Gradiska district wasn’t developing enough in the period from 1900. till 1910. – it became more backward then Brod district and average in comparation with Pozega county and whole Kingdome. In the end of 19 th and the beginning of 20 th century Nova Gradiska district was mostly rural area, oriented on primary sector, especially on cattle and plum export. Due to inadequate adjustment to the market, the ratio of population working in secondary and tertiary sectors wasn’t growing fast enough, which resulted in the whole area not being economically competitive enough in regional and broader context of Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia. Educational and health system were founded on the quality legacy inherited from the period of Military Border when every company place had a school, the same as was the military hospital built it 1846. Although the education system was modernized with school adaptation, population literacy and bigger percentage of female children in education, the main problem was school absence, which had continuity from the 18 th century. Health system was modernized with hospital adaptation, employment of adequate medical staff and <b>compulsory</b> health <b>check</b> ups for students. Bad social – economic conditions had an influence on the appearance of diseases and hunger. Population of the district was predominantly falling ill from malaria and trachoma, mostly from inadequate rehabilitation of wetlands, or terrible hygienic conditions. Bad economical conditions, destruction of the vine and the change in interest to plum cultivation, existence of a large number of entrepreneurs who were in plum cultivation and alcohol production, resulted in growth of pure ethanol production in the district area. All of the above influenced on a bigger consumption of alcohol drinks. The interesting part in studying the question of alcoholism is in the fact that in the broader regional area of Slavonia, including Nova Gradiska also, the problem of alcoholism obviously existed also in the 18 th century, since it is mentioned also by Matija Antun Relkovic. Alcoholism was recognized as an issue in Nova Gradiska district during 1906. what led to establishment of the first anti alcoholic newspaper. From the total number of anti alcoholic members’ in Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, 20...|$|R
