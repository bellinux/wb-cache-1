5000|$|For {{more than}} 20 years of operation, there was been some {{instances}} of rusting, {{but this has}} been eradicated since they were modernised in 2012. Outdated transistors were replaced at the Siemens Test Centre at Wildenrath. In addition, Cegelec replaced the electronics (including two new liquid crystal displays in the <b>centre</b> <b>cabin)</b> and replacing the seat cushions. Trams 241-245, 247, 250-252, 258, 259, 262 and 264 have been completely renovated. In early 2017, 248, 249, 260 and 266 were being modernised and therefore were not in use. After a test phase in 2013, during which time operation on line 3 was limited, trams that had been modernised were running on lines 2 and 5 from March 2014.|$|E

5000|$|The XL-5 (sometimes {{referred}} to as a [...] "dash five") was introduced in 2004. It reduces the size of the keel down the <b>centre</b> of the <b>cabin,</b> giving more room in the back seat.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{small table}} in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>cabin,</b> {{at one end of}} which sat Commodore Schley, looking over a map of the Cuban coast. At {{the other end of the}} table sat Captain Cook, the firm and strict, yet well-beloved {{commander}} of the flagship.|$|R
50|$|The Doctor tells Travers {{about the}} stolen tape {{recording}} and requests permission {{to search the}} passenger cabins. While Mel checks Lasky's locker in the gym, the Doctor tells Doland that he thinks the traitor is either him or Lasky. After searching the professor's cabin, Doland suggests the cabinet in the Hydroponics <b>centre</b> work <b>cabin.</b> There, Doland reveals the tape is in his pocket, but that he has wiped it. Taking the Doctor's gun, Doland admits to the murders. The Doctor has disarmed the gun, and Travers arrives and arrests Doland. However, he and his guard are attacked and killed by the Vervoids.|$|R

60|$|But of Johnson’s grumbling at the slop-chest I knew nothing, so {{that what}} I {{witnessed}} came with a shock of sudden surprise. I had just finished sweeping the cabin, and had been inveigled by Wolf Larsen into a discussion of Hamlet, his favourite Shakespearian character, when Johansen descended the companion stairs followed by Johnson. The latter’s cap came off after the custom of the sea, and he stood respectfully in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>cabin,</b> swaying heavily and uneasily to the roll of the schooner and facing the captain.|$|R
40|$|Motion base driving {{simulators}} {{have limited}} {{space in which}} to recreate the motions of the simulated road vehicle. Conventional motion cueing algorithms strive to <b>centre</b> the <b>cabin</b> in the simulator motion envelope to accommodate accelerations in a worst case scenario while respecting the physical boundaries. Using information about the road ahead one can preposition the cabin to an off-centre point, virtually increasing the available space so that larger motions are made possible. The prepositioning algorithm presented here was developed as an addition to a classical motion cueing algorithm and makes use of road data and vehicle speed to adjust the simulator displacement. Simulations show {{that the amount of}} acceleration presented by an x, y-sled system can, with prepositioning, be increased by up to 25 % in longitudinal and 53 % in lateral direction for an example road. A comparative study including 12 test subjects indicates that the perceived realism is rated higher with prepositioning...|$|R
500|$|Captain Francis [...] "Skipper" [...] Gidney {{became the}} first Camp Chief in May 1919 and served until 1923. He {{organized}} the first Wood Badge training, and contributed to setting up Gilwell Park as the Scouters' training <b>centre.</b> The Gidney <b>Cabin</b> was built and named in his honour in 1929 {{to serve as a}} training centre. The second Camp Chief was John Skinner Wilson, who served from 1923 until 1939. Wilson was Colonel with the British Indian Police when he became a Scout Leader in 1917. In 1921 he traveled to Gilwell Park to take leader training, which led to his retirement from the Indian Police in 1922 to become a full-time Scout Leader. He was honoured with the Bronze Wolf Award in 1937, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement.|$|R
50|$|The Huracán LP 610-4 Polizia is the {{official}} police car version of the Lamborghini specifically produced for the Italian State Police, after the two Gallardos used by the Polizia Stradale were destroyed in car crashes. This model sports various features {{not included in the}} civilian 610-4 Coupe, such as blue Polizia body colour, white stripes and lettering following the Huracán's dynamic design language, a video system positioned in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>cabin</b> with a camera fitted next to the rear view mirror, a computer, recording equipment behind the seats, a Proof Video Data System, gun holster, police radio equipment, a Paletta (the traditional hand-held stop sign used to advise motorists and traffic offenders to pull over), a removable screen, a refrigeration system at the luggage compartment {{in the front of the}} vehicle, a defibrillator, and a police beacon with blue LEDs around the base and white LED signals on the front, sides and rear of the light's aluminium shell.|$|R
60|$|The {{arrangements}} for the consultation were brief and simple. The veteran commander of the frigate received his officers with punctilious respect; and pointing to the chairs that were placed around the table, which was a fixture in the <b>centre</b> of his <b>cabin,</b> he silently seated himself, and his example was followed by all without further ceremony. In taking their stations, however, a quiet but rigid observance was paid {{to the rights of}} seniority and rank. On the right of the captain was placed Griffith, as next in authority; and opposite to him was seated the commander of the schooner. The officer of marines, who was included in the number, held the next situation in point of precedence, the same order being observed {{to the bottom of the}} table, which was occupied by a hard-featured, square-built, athletic man, who held the office of sailing-master. When order was restored, after the short interruption of taking their places, the officer who had required the advice of his inferiors opened the business on which he demanded their opinions.|$|R
60|$|When I {{opened my}} eyes I had some ado to recall where I was, but on sitting up it was brought home {{to me by my}} head {{striking}} the low ceiling with a sharp rap. On {{the other side of the}} cabin Silas Bolitho was stretched at full length with a red woollen nightcap upon his head, fast asleep and snoring. In the <b>centre</b> of the <b>cabin</b> hung a swing-table, much worn, and stained all over with the marks of countless glasses and pannikins. A wooden bench, screwed to the floor, completed the furniture, with the exception of a stand of muskets along one side. Above and below the berths in which we lay were rows of lockers, in which, doubtless, some of the more choice laces and silks were stowed. The vessel was rising and falling with a gentle motion, but from the flapping of canvas I judged that there was little wind. Slipping quietly from my couch, so as not to wake the mate, I stole upon deck.|$|R
50|$|Mel hears a {{noise in}} the air {{conditioning}} ducts and overhears creatures planning to kill all the 'animal-kind' on the ship. As she listens, she is attacked and rendered unconscious. The murderer dumps her in a disposal trolley. The Doctor enters the gym and hears the recording, including her scream when she was attacked. The Doctor runs after the trolley and rescues her.Bruchner is becoming increasingly hysterical about the situation with the Hydroponics centre, especially when Kimber disappears. It turns out that he, Edwardes and the missing guard {{have been killed by}} plant-like creatures called Vervoids - the creatures {{that came out of the}} pods when Edwardes was electrocuted. Lasky finds Bruchner burning the notes on their work in the Hydroponics <b>centre's</b> small work <b>cabin,</b> and tries unsuccessfully to reason with him. Bruchner knocks Lasky out, runs off and attacks a guard, taking his gun. He goes to the bridge, and forces Travers and the pilot to leave, then changes the course of the Hyperion to head into the black hole of Tartarus - planning to destroy the ship.|$|R
60|$|On {{the next}} morning, {{as soon as}} he was out of bed, he opened a small {{portmanteau}} in which he had put up some volumes the day before he left Pollington and to which he had not yet had recourse since the beginning of the voyage. From these he would select one or two for the use of his new friend. So he dragged out the valise from beneath the berth, while Shand abused him for the disturbance he made. On the top, lying on the other volumes, which were as he had placed them, was a little book, prettily bound, by no means new, which he was sure had never been placed there by himself. He took it up, and, standing in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>cabin,</b> between the light of the porthole and Dick's bed, he examined it. It was a copy of Thomson's 'Seasons', and on the flyleaf was written in a girl's hand the name of its late owner,--Maria Shand. The truth flashed upon him at once. She must have gone down on that last night after he was in bed, and thus have made her little offering in silence, knowing that it would be hidden from him till he was far away from her.|$|R
40|$|Every dynamic driving simulator, {{no matter}} how {{advanced}} its motion system is, has limited space in which to recreate the accelerating motions of the simulated road vehicle. The VTI driving simulator Sim IV is no exception. The classic motion cueing algorithm used in Sim IV strives to <b>centre</b> the drivers <b>cabin</b> in the simulator motion envelope and is tuned to precisely accommodate accelerations in a worst case scenario without hitting the physical boundaries. Using knowledge about the road ahead and the vehicle model one can preposition the cabin to an off-centre point, virtually increasing the available space so that larger motions are made possible. This aims to increase the impression of realism in the driving experience. The prepositioning algorithm presented in this thesis is developed as an addition to the current motion cueing algorithm and make use of road- and vehicle data to find a suitable preposition. The motion to the preposition is made under the human perception threshold to avoid rendering of false cues. Simulations show {{that the amount of}} acceleration presented by the sled can, with prepositioning, be increased by up to 25 % in longitudinal and 53 % in lateral direction. During a comparative study of the simulator motion, test subjects indicated that they had a more realistic driving experience with than without prepositioning...|$|R

The authors are solely responsible for the contents of the paper which does not represent the opinion of the European Commission. The growing demand for the utilization of personal electronic communication devices onboard commercial aircraft necessitates the assurance of safety by airline operators and regulators. This implies that the potential risks posed by the deployment of wireless communication systems on critical aircraft equipment must be carefully assessed and countermeasures taken when required. In this paper, a model based on a ray-tracing algorithm is developed to calculate the electromagnetic interference incident on the fuselage structure of a commercial airline. The source of interference is a 2. 4 GHz data communications network. Two scenarios are considered; the first assumes a base station in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>cabin</b> while the second considers four base stations, transmitting at a lower power, distributed along the cabin. The model first determines the propagation map generated by the base stations. These results are used to establish the transmission power required by the personal mobile devices which is then employed to determine the propagation map of each device. The overall electromagnetic interference map incident on the fuselage resulting from the onboard wireless network is generated by vectorially combining the resulting propagation maps. Results for the two scenarios are presented. peer-reviewe...|$|R
