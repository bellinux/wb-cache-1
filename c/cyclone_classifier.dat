40|$|Theoretical {{considerations}} {{and design of}} a new developed cyclone-classifier are described. The apparatus was developed, clearing those contaminated sludge quantities which have to be treated by the removal of Hamburg's sediment layers. Mainly the apparatus combines a hydrocyclone and a hydraulic classifier section, which is connected directly. The solid fraction of the treated contaminated sludge quantities are either thickened and cleared in the <b>cyclone</b> <b>classifier...</b>|$|E
40|$|In most mineral {{comminution}} circuit, {{the feed}} to the hydro <b>cyclone</b> <b>classifier</b> {{is composed of}} a mixture of particles having varying degrees of liberation and sizes. The different liberation degree for the minerals leads to multi density particles that are significantly differ in hydro cyclone during the classification. Hydro <b>cyclone</b> <b>classifier</b> performance calculation till now is based on single average mineral density component behavior, contradicting to the actual situation of naturally occurring ores. Therefore, present work is aimed to study the separation by size wise component classification curves of hydro cyclone operation including the study of varying density components. This involves on varying set of parameters i. e. spigot, pressure, cone angle and feed solid content. The initial studies is done with bicomponent mixture of pure magnetite and silica with 5 proportions 1 : 9, 2 : 8, 1 : 1, 8 : 2, 9 : 1 (silica: magnetite) conducted in 2 inch hydro cyclone. Further, this also includes the 3 inch hydro cyclone classification multicomponent studies, using naturally occurring iron ore slimes which have iron, alumina and silica as 3 compositions. The component analysis of iron ore {{has been done by}} combination of volumetric analysis, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry(ICP-OES) and gravimetric method for ensuring the size-wise distribution of the Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3 and Si 2 O in respective streams after separation. A set of optimized hydro cyclone operation is identified for the iron ore slimes beneficiation suitable for pellet grade product...|$|E

Preface After detailed researches in structural characteristics of traditional classifiers, we made some redesigns and modifications on the main components corresponding and contrary to certain problems occurred during the life-cycle of the machinery, while we are keeping the original profile and basic structure of the <b>cyclone</b> <b>classifier.</b> Green re-design of classifiers 1. 1 Classification rotor and auxiliary impeller By analyzing the internal structures of the 3 rd generation classifiers, the author indicates that the cage-type classification rotors are benefit from simple structures and high efficiency rates.
