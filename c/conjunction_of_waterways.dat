50|$|The European Conference of Ministers of Transport {{established}} in 1953 a classification <b>of</b> <b>waterways</b> {{that was later}} expanded {{to take into account}} the development of push-towing. Europe is a continent with a great variety <b>of</b> <b>waterway</b> characteristics, which makes this classification valuable to appreciate the different classes <b>of</b> <b>waterway.</b> There is also a remarkable variety <b>of</b> <b>waterway</b> characteristics in many countries of Asia, but there has not been any equivalent international drive for uniformity. This classification is provided by the UN Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport. A low resolution version of that map is shown here.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We aim at “heavy traffic direction” and “light traffic direction” in two-way {{waterway}} {{traffic and}} attempt to promote the transit capacity <b>of</b> two-way <b>waterway</b> system. Design/methodology/approach: We propose overtaking rules, head-on rules and a cellular automaton model for variable two-way waterway on AIS-based {{on the basis of}} NaSch (Nagel-Schreckenberg) model. Findings: By numerical simulation to the two situations which allow changing lane and prohibit changing lane, we obtain fundamental functions between traffic flux (speed) and density and find that changing lane can promote traffic flux and average speed <b>of</b> two-way <b>waterway</b> system under the premise of no impact to the traffic order, and when waterway ship traffic is dense, flux <b>of</b> <b>waterway</b> system has a visible promotion, and when traffic is sparse, average speed <b>of</b> <b>waterway</b> system adds significantly. Originality/value: The paper presents a method to analyze and promote transit capacity <b>of</b> two-way <b>waterway.</b> </p...|$|R
