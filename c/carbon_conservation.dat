REDD+ has potential to simultaneously deliver cost-effective {{climate change mitigation}} and human development 2, 3, 4, 5. However, most REDD+ analysis has used coarse-scale data, overlooked important opportunity costs to tropical forest users 4, 5 and failed to consider how to best invest funds to limit leakage, that is, merely displacing deforestation 6. Here we examine these issues for Tanzania, a REDD+ country, by comparing district-scale carbon losses from deforestation with the opportunity costs of <b>carbon</b> <b>conservation.</b> Opportunity costs are estimated as rents from both agriculture and charcoal production (the most important proximate causes of regional forest conversion 7, 8, 9). As an alternative we also calculate the implementation costs of alleviating the demand for forest conversion—thereby addressing the problem of leakage—by raising agricultural yields on existing cropland and increasing charcoal fuel-use efficiency. The implementation costs exceed the opportunity costs of <b>carbon</b> <b>conservation</b> (medians of US$ 6. 50 versus US$ 3. 90 per Mg CO 2), so effective REDD+ policies may cost more than simpler estimates suggest.

40|$|Terrestrial carbon {{resources}} are major drivers {{of development in}} West Africa. The distribution of these resources co-varies with ecosystem type and rainfall along a strong Northeast-Southwest climatic gradient. Soil organic carbon, a strong indicator of soil quality, has been severely depleted in some areas by human activities, which leads to issues of soil erosion and desertification, but this trend can be altered via appropriate management. There is significant potential to enhance existing soil carbon stores in West Africa, with benefits at the global and local scales, for atmospheric CO 2 mitigation and supporting, and provisioning ecosystem services, respectively. Three key factors impacting carbon stocks are addressed in this review: climate, biotic factors, and human activities. Climate risks {{must be considered in}} a framework of global change, especially in West Africa, where landscape managers have few resources available to adapt to climatic perturbations. Among biotic factors, biodiversity conservation paired with <b>carbon</b> <b>conservation</b> may provide a pathway to sustainable development, as evidence suggests that both may be inter-linked, and biodiversity conservation is also a global priority with local benefits for ecosystem resilience, biomass productivity, and provisioning services such as foodstuffs. Finally, human management has largely been responsible for reduced carbon stocks, but this trend can be reversed through the implementation of appropriate <b>carbon</b> <b>conservation</b> strategies in the agricultural sector, as shown by multiple studies. Owing to the strong regional climatic gradient, country-level initiatives will need to consider carbon sequestration approaches for multiple ecosystem types. Given the diversity of environments, global policies must be adapted and strategised at the national or sub-national levels to improve C storage above and belowground. Initiatives of this sort must act locally at farmer scale, and focus on ecosystem services rather than on carbon sequestration solely...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} use of carbon sources is a core objective in metabolic engineering and biorefinery. Most approaches have focused on optimizing naturally occurring pathways to improve titer, productivity, and yield. However, certain inherent limitations cannot be surpassed if natural pathways are used. Here we designed two synthetic metabolic pathways, Non-Oxidative Glycolysis (NOG) and Methanol Condensation Cycle (MCC) for the utilization of sugar and methanol, respectively. We also created a methanol auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain that depends on methanol for growth. The first project, NOG, was designed to address an intrinsic carbon inefficiency in all sugar-based biorefinery. The inefficiency in the Emben-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway (commonly called glycolysis), results in one-third of carbon being lost as CO 2 during the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. To bypass the limits of this pathway, we redesigned central metabolism to obtain better <b>carbon</b> <b>conservation.</b> The NOG pathway was designed and engineered into E. coli that avoids CO 2 loss in the conversion of sugar to acetyl-CoA. This represented a 50 % carbon improvement compared to the classical EMP pathway. While sugars can be consumed by nearly all organisms, other high-energy carbon sources are of high interest. The second project focuses on the utilization of methanol which is a cheap C 1 molecule that is more energy-rich than sugars. Methanol is produced commercially from methane in natural gas. However, current technologies for methanol conversion require high temperature and pressure. Natural biological pathways for methanol utilization are carbon and ATP inefficient. We designed the MCC and to allow conversion of methanol to higher alcohols with theoretical 100 % <b>carbon</b> <b>conservation</b> at room temperature and ambient pressure. This pathways was demonstrated using an in vitro cell-free system. Since methylotrophs (organisms that can grow on methanol) are difficult to engineer, the conversion of methanol to higher-value chemicals has been difficult. Furthermore, decades of research have failed to create a methylotrophic E. coli strain. In the third project we created a methanol auxotrophic E. coli strain that is dependent on methanol for growth.

The article highlights the post-disaster context of land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF). In particular it examines the power issue surrounding carbon management in Aceh Province, Indonesia, after the Indian Ocean tsunami (IOT) 2004. The author proposes a new institutional framework, namely the Strategic Framework for Sustainability Analysis (SFSA). The SFSA uses a series of strategic group analyses, combined with strategic resources identification and strategic policy to analyze LULUCF problems. The strategic groups in LULUCF are those that hold the decision-making power to discourage/encourage sustainability of local natural resources. Each group is assumed to reposition itself strategically {{in order to gain}} more control over resources. The IOT 2004 has led Aceh to exercise its own sustainability policies, which are set through many initiatives such as a moratorium on logging, a sustainable palm oil policy, livelihood-based <b>carbon</b> <b>conservation</b> projects, and green development policies, including disaster risk reduction.|$|E

Indonesia, the world's largest palm-oil producer, plans to double its production by 2020, with unclear implications for the other national priorities of food (rice) production, forest and biodiversity protection, and <b>carbon</b> <b>conservation.</b> We modeled the outcomes of alternative development scenarios and show that every single-priority scenario had substantial tradeoffs associated with other priorities. The exception was a hybrid approach wherein expansion targeted degraded and agricultural lands that are most productive for oil palm, least suitable for food cultivation, and contain the lowest carbon stocks. This approach avoided any loss in forest or biodiversity and substantially ameliorated the impacts of oil-palm expansion on carbon stocks (limiting net loss to 191. 6 million tons) and annual food production capacity (loss of 1. 9 million tons). Our {{results suggest that the}} environmental and land-use tradeoffs associated with oil-palm expansion can be largely avoided through the implementation of a properly planned and spatially explicit development strategy.

The main objective of the study is to analyze the potential of the Upper Magat Watershed for a carbon sequestration project. The three main development components of the project are forest conservation, tree plantations, and agroforestry farm development. At Year 30, the watershed can attain a net carbon benefit of 19. 5 M tC at a cost of US $ 34. 5 M. The potential leakage of the project is estimated using historical experience in technology adoption in watershed areas in the Philippines and a high adoption rate. Two leakage scenarios were used: baseline and project leakage scenarios. Most of the leakage occurs in the first 10 years of the project as displacement of livelihood occurs during this time. The carbon lost via leakage is estimated to be 3. 7 M tC in the historical adoption scenario, and 8. 1 M tC under the enhanced adoption scenario...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{experiment in}} the UK examined people's willingness to change energy consumption behavior under three different policy framings: energy tax, carbon tax, and personal carbon allowances (PCA). PCA is a downstream cap-and-trade policy proposed in the UK, in which emission rights are allocated to individuals. We hypothesized that due to economic, pro-environmental and mental accounting drivers PCA would have greater potential to deliver emissions reduction than taxation. Participants (n = 1, 096) received one version of a survey with the same energy-behavior–related questions and identical incurred costs {{under one of the}} following framings: energy tax (where carbon was not mentioned), carbon tax, and PCA. Results suggest that policies that draw people's attention to carbon (PCA and carbon taxation) could have greater impact on their stated willingness to reduce energy consumption, and on the reduction amounts prompted, than would a non-overt price signal (energy tax).

Using household surveys, key informant interviews, and participatory mapping exercises, we present three 'lived' land tenure contexts in Indonesia to highlight their socially and ecologically situated natures and to consider the role of tenure pluralism in shaping PMRV. We then raise and interrogate three questions for incorporating lived land tenure contexts into a legitimate PMRV system: 1) Who holds the right to conduct PMRV activities?; 2) How are the impacts of PMRV differentially distributed within local communities?; and 3) What is the relationship between tenure security and motivation to participate in PMRV?

40|$|The {{conservation}} of tropical forest carbon stocks offers {{the opportunity to}} curb climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and simultaneously conserve biodiversity. However, there has been considerable debate {{about the extent to}} which <b>carbon</b> stock <b>conservation</b> will provide benefits to biodiversity in part because whether forests that contain high carbon density in their aboveground biomass also contain high animal diversity is unknown. Here, we empirically examined medium to large bodied groundâ dwelling mammal and bird (hereafter â wildlifeâ) diversity and carbon stock levels within the tropics using camera trap and vegetation data from a pantropical network of sites. Specifically, we tested whether tropical forests that stored more carbon contained higher wildlife species richness, taxonomic diversity, and trait diversity. We found that carbon stocks were not a significant predictor for any of these three measures of diversity, which suggests that benefits for wildlife diversity will not be maximized unless wildlife diversity is explicitly taken into account; prioritizing carbon stocks alone will not necessarily meet biodiversity conservation goals. We recommend conservation planning that considers both objectives because there is the potential for more wildlife diversity and <b>carbon</b> stock <b>conservation</b> to be achieved for the same total budget if both objectives are pursued in tandem rather than independently. Tropical forests with low elevation variability and low tree density supported significantly higher wildlife diversity.

In this study, data was collected and analyzed from four typical sorts of Melaleuca forests in Australia including: primary Melaleuca forests subject to continuous water inundation; primary Melaleuca forests not inundated by water; degraded Melaleuca forests subject to continuous water inundation; and regenerating Melaleuca forests subject to continuous water inundation. The carbon stocks of these typical Melaleuca forests were 381; 278; 210; and 241 t ha of carbon, respectively.

40|$|Buildings are {{responsible}} {{for a total of}} 40 % energy consumption and cause 32 % of total carbon emissions in the European Union. The emissions caused by the building sector are partly responsible for the increasing global temperature over the last decades. A reduction of emissions related to buildings has the potential to mitigate climate change. Historical buildings play an important role and should be included to reach this goal. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify retrofitting measures which are the most optimal within the frame of carbon emissions and economic concerns by taking into account the impact on the heritage value of a historical building. For this purpose, an energy building simulation was conducted as a case study for a historical building in Utrecht the Netherlands. First a literature review was executed to determine which retrofits are the most appropriate to conserve the inherent value of a building in the Netherlands. The outcome shows that a variety of options are able to preserve the building’s character. The best options for the case study were interior insulation for walls, roofs and floors, replacement of the lighting system, the application of a groundwater or ground heat pump, photovoltaics, and construction overhauls. The next step was to test the previously identified options. Data concerning building envelope, technical installations and building schedules was collected to determine the energy demand for heating, cooling, and electricity. The total annual energy demand of the old train workshop is 2454 GJ. After the initial simulation as the base case, several measures and packaged measures were tested to conclude which <b>carbon</b> <b>conservation</b> techniques are the most effective. Each simulation is followed by a cost analysis to show the simple payback period, the costs per unit of conserved carbon and a sensitivity analysis with regards to important parameters. The results showed a great potential for several retrofitting measures. The individual measures with the best outcomes were roof insulation, LED lighting, groundwater heat pump, and photovoltaics. The percentages of potential <b>carbon</b> <b>conservation</b> were 11. 61 %, 15. 84 %, 28. 46 %, and 48. 53 % respectively. An assemblage of the aforementioned individual measures to a retrofitting package can lower the energy demand by 85. 50 % and the emitted carbon emissions by 68. 65 %.
