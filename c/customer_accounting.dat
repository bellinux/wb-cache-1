The framework by Lind and Strömsten (2006) where different <b>customer</b> <b>accounting</b> techniques are related to a typology over customer relationships is evaluated and further elaborated on in this thesis. The empirical findings both confirm the reasoning behind the framework and cause development potential. The relation of <b>customer</b> <b>accounting</b> techniques to different types of customer relationships is mainly confirmed by the study. Regarding the customer typology, the empirical findings bring forth proposed improvements; a grading of the technical and organizational interfaces of the customer relationship types is suggested...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the joint influence of early product adoption and bank <b>customer</b> <b>accounting</b> in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach – In-depth interviews at three Hong Kong banks provided the basis for designing a survey instrument, which was used to collect data from 35 local and overseas banks. Performance data were collected from the financial statements published by the banks Findings – Findings revealed significant interactive influences of early product adoption and <b>customer</b> <b>accounting</b> practices on bank performance. That is, performance would be enhanced if <b>customer</b> <b>accounting</b> practices were used to a greater extent in those banks that were early in adopting a greater range of products. The evidence shows that bank performance in an intensely competitive market such as Hong Kong is driven by the fit between <b>customer</b> <b>accounting</b> practices and early product adoption strategies. Research limitations/implications – This paper is subject to small sample size and the use of a cross-sectional sample setting. Originality/value – The evidence that is provided in this study adds {{to the understanding of the}} relationship between management accounting and organisational strategy. The topic is of interest given the recent deregulation of the banking industry in Hong Kong and the expansion of products that have been offered by banks during the last five years...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Two prior survey {{papers on}} the use and {{perceived}} merit of <b>customer</b> <b>accounting</b> practices, one in Australia and one in New Zealand, disclosed contrasting results with confusing elements. This survey replicates and extends the previous research to update and clarify {{our understanding of the}} use and perceived merit of <b>Customer</b> <b>Accounting</b> (CA) practices in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach – A mail questionnaire survey was sent to 136 companies quoted on the New Zealand Stock Exchange, resulting in 44 useable responses (32. 4 %). Findings – This survey finds that mean scores for the usage and perceived merit of CA practices in New Zealand in 2009 are similar to those found in Australia in 2002, and much higher than those found in New Zealand in 2007. Also, a relationship between the use of activity-based costing (ABC) and the perceived merit of CA practices was found, but no relationship with actual CA usage. The research also found a strong positive relationship between the adoption of the customer concept of marketing management and the usage of customer profitability analysis at an individual customer level. Research limitations/implications – The survey method prevents follow-up questions and clarification of ambiguities, but the survey results point to several areas warranting further research. Originality/value – This survey provides academic researchers, teachers, and firms using, or considering the use of CA practices, improved understanding of the extent of current usage and perceived managerial merit of CA practices in New Zealand companies.

40|$|Despite being {{economically}} and socially important to Malaysia, {{little has been}} done to study the innovations in the administration of service organizations to maintain the survival of such organizations in the globalization era. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the use of strategic management accounting (SMA), as an administrative innovation, by the service organizations operating in Malaysia. The literature suggested that business strategy is an important factor affecting the use of SMA techniques and, as a result, the use of SMA will differ with different strategic priorities. The SMA techniques studied are costing, competitor accounting and <b>customer</b> <b>accounting,</b> while business strategy includes cost leadership and differentiation strategies. Survey questionnaires were administered to managers yielding 62 usable responses. Using ANOVA, the present study finds that service organizations pursuing differentiation strategies place higher emphasis on competitor and <b>customer</b> <b>accounting</b> compared to service organizations pursuing cost leadership strategies. The results also reveal that the highest emphasis on all SMA techniques is found in service organizations that place high emphasis on both strategies. The study provides evidence regarding practices that place high emphasis on strategic issues that lead to a high usage of innovative information systems...|$|E
