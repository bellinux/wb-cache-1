30|$|Sake yeasts {{belong to}} the budding yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have high {{fermentation}} activity and ethanol production. Although the traditional <b>crossbreeding</b> <b>of</b> sake yeasts is a time-consuming and inefficient process due to the low sporulation rates and spore viability of these strains, considerable effort {{has been devoted to}} the development of hybrid strains with superior brewing characteristics. In the present work, we describe a growth selection system for a- and α-type cells aimed at the <b>crossbreeding</b> <b>of</b> industrial yeasts, and performed hybridizations with sake yeast strains Kyokai No. 6, No. 7 and No. 9 to examine the feasibility of this approach. We successfully generated both a- and α-type strains from all parental strains, and acquired six types of hybrids by outcrossing. One of these hybrid strains was subjected to continuous crossbreeding, yielding the multi-hybrid strain, which inherited the genetic characteristics of Kyokai No. 6, No. 7 and No. 9. Notably, because all of the genetic modifications of the yeast cells were introduced using plasmids, these traits can be easily removed. The approach described here has the potential to markedly accelerate the <b>crossbreeding</b> <b>of</b> industrial yeast strains with desirable properties.|$|R

In various diving systems, there are many different methods in case <b>of</b> <b>diver</b> missing and physical sudden problems <b>of</b> the <b>divers.</b> Based on the rapid progress of science and existing risks and problems for divers, in this paper, we present a new method for safety <b>of</b> <b>divers</b> in order to have a safe and reliable diving that is more convenient than the existing methods. In proposed method, there is a special sensor, which is put on the lower arm <b>of</b> <b>diver,</b> and it has some advantages. Finally, we discuss different cases to demonstrate the advantages of the presented method...|$|R

40|$|<b>Crossbreeding</b> <b>of</b> goats in {{traditional}} subsistence flocks had been promoted in selected villages of eastern Ethiopian highlands {{as a means}} to quick genetic progress based on the thesis that crossbreeding can increase the net contribution of goats. Observations on flock dynamics patterns of smallholder flocks with crossbred goats showed that the desirable attributes <b>of</b> <b>crossbreeding</b> had not been maintained after the promotion phase because: 1) the pool of crossbred goats was too small to maintain 50 % exotic blood level in the crossbreeds; 2) shortages of crossbred breeding males also led to gradual back crossing of the does, resulting in an increasingly mosaic mix of crossbreeds; 3) the small size of flocks as well as their rapid turnover limited the scope for any selective breeding and the maintenance of superior breeding animals; and 4) losses control on the breeding of various classes of crosses with indigenous goats posed undesirable dissemination of introduced genes into the indigenous genetic pool. Therefore it was concluded that <b>crossbreeding</b> <b>of</b> indigenous goats with exotic breeds, as a technology for genetic improvement of smallholder goat flocks of Ethiopian highlands, is not sustainable under, subsistence mode of production...|$|R
