40|$|Abstract – About 1 % of {{the total}} storage {{capacity}} in the world’s reservoirs is lost annually due to sedimentation. Sediments can also block intakes in reservoirs and damage tunnels or turbines. One {{of the most effective}} techniques to remove these sediments is flushing, whereby water level is lowered sufficiently to re-erode deposits and flush them through the intakes. Outflow sediment discharge may well be related to the parameters such as the sediment characteristics in the reservoir, during flushing and geometry of <b>flushing</b> <b>channel.</b> In this study, laboratory experiments were performed on a 1 -D reservoir model in a flume in the hydraulics laboratory of Shiraz University to investigate the flushing operation processes by using polymer particles. The polymer particles were lightweight and non-cohesive with an average grain size of about 2. 40 mm and density of 1065. 3 (kg/m 3). The model was installed in a flume; 30 m long, 1 m wide and 0. 75 m height. The length of the test section was 11. 5 m, and sediments were placed at a length of 4. 8 m long upstream from the dam position. Experimental runs have been performed for two flow conditions; 0. 0004678 m 3 /s and 0. 000628 m 3 /s. The very low inflow discharge helped for better monitoring and measuring of the effective parameters. A sluice gate was placed at the central bottom of the dam (as the bottom outlet) and was opened at a constant rate to make the complete drawdown. Results showed that the rate of sediment flushing is strongly associated with outflow rate, water surface gradient with the dam section and the width of the <b>flushing</b> <b>channel.</b> The results from this study were in agreement with that in the literature.

40|$|Objective-Nicotinic acid (also {{known as}} niacin or vitamin B 3), widely {{used to treat}} dyslipidemias, {{represents}} an effective and safe means {{to reduce the risk}} of mortality from cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, a substantial fraction of patients discontinue treatment because of a strong side effect of cutaneous vasodilation, commonly termed flushing. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that nicotinic acid causes flushing partially by activating the capsaicin receptor TRPV 1, a polymodal cellular sensor that mediates the flushing response on consumption of spicy food. Approach and Results-We observed that the nicotinic acid-induced increase in blood flow was substantially reduced in Trpv 1 knockout mice, indicating involvement of the <b>channel</b> in <b>flushing</b> response. Using exogenously expressed TRPV 1, we confirmed that nicotinic acid at submillimolar to millimolar concentrations directly and potently activates TRPV 1 from the intracellular side. Binding of nicotinic acid to TRPV 1 lowers its activation threshold for heat, causing channel opening at physiological temperatures. The activation of TRPV 1 by voltage or ligands (capsaicin and 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate) is also potentiated by nicotinic acid. We further demonstrated that nicotinic acid does not compete directly with capsaicin but may activate TRPV 1 through the 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate activation pathway. Using live-cell fluorescence imaging, we observed that nicotinic acid can quickly enter the cell through a transporter-mediated pathway to activate TRPV 1. Conclusions-Direct activation of TRPV 1 by nicotinic acid may lead to cutaneous vasodilation that contributes to flushing, suggesting a potential novel pathway to inhibit flushing and to improve compliance...|$|R

The working channel of the endoscope can potentially be contaminated by cancer cells derived from the luminal surface of esophageal cancer during EUS-guided FNA, which may result in false-positive cytology results of EUS-guided ENA of celiac lymph nodes. Objective: To determine whether passing an endoscope through intraluminal esophageal cancer can lead to contamination of the working channel with tumor cells. Design: An ex vivo assessment of contamination of endoscope working channels. Setting: University hospital. Patients: This study, involved 13 patients with esophageal cancer.

40|$|Abstract. Adaptive {{assessment}} of a riverine system is a continual learning process and probably never reaches a state of full knowledge. Adaptive assessment also includes the principle that continuous adaptation of improved knowledge to the work at hand is the normal state of affairs. The application of adaptive assessment {{presented in this paper}} is a first step in an adaptive process that uses readily available discharge measurement summary data available for some gaging stations to determine the flushing flow needs of a river. The process presented is useful 1) when little money is available for a flushing flow study and 2) in guiding more extensive studies that might be done later in the adaptive process when additional or more detailed information may be needed. In this paper, discharge measurement summary data and limited field data were used to develop a relation between a substrate movement parameter and the discharge for a USGS gage on the Poudre River above Boxelder Creek just downstream from Fort Collins, Colorado. The relation substrate movement parameter was combined with a value of the substrate movement parameter critical for movement of sand and fines known from other studies to find the discharge in the Poudre River in the Fort Collins reach required to flush sand and fines from the river. The discharge- sediment transport parameter relation determined from the analysis is β = 0. 000320 Q ^ 0. 549 where Q is the discharge and β is the substrate movement parameter. From previous studies, the critical value of the substrate movement parameter is 0. 021, resulting in a flushing flow calculated to be 2050 cfs.

40|$|The {{microbead}} packing is {{the critical}} element required {{in the success of}} on-chip microfabrication of critical microfluidic components for in-situ analysis and detection of chiral amino acids. In order for microliquid chromatography to occur, there must be a stationary phase medium within the microchannel that interacts with the analytes present within flowing fluid. The stationary phase media are the microbeads packed by the process discussed in this work. The purpose of the microliquid chromatography is to provide a lightweight, low-volume, and low-power element to separate amino acids and their chiral partners efficiently to understand better the origin of life. In order to densely pack microbeads into the microchannels, a liquid slurry of microbeads was created. Microbeads were extracted from a commercially available high-performance liquid chromatography column. The silica beads extracted were 5 microns in diameter, and had surface coating of phenyl-hexyl. These microbeads were mixed with a 200 - proof ethanol solution to create a microbead slurry with the right viscosity for packing. A microfilter is placed at the outlet via of the microchannel and the slurry is injected, then withdrawn across a filter using modified syringes. After each injection, the <b>channel</b> is <b>flushed</b> with ethanol to enhance packing. This cycle is repeated numerous times to allow for a tightly packed channel of microbeads. Typical microbead packing occurs in the macroscale into tubes or channels by using highly pressurized systems. Moreover, these channels are typically long and straight without any turns or curves. On the other hand, this method of microbead packing is completed within a microchannel 75 micrometers in diameter. Moreover, the microbead packing is completed into a serpentine type microchannel, such that it maximizes microchannel length within a microchip. Doing so enhances the interactions of the analytes with the microbeads to separate efficiently amino acids and amino acid enantiomers...|$|R
40|$|The Langmann {{reservoir}} {{is part of}} the hydropower {{system in}} the river Teigitsch and in the reservoir loss of storage volume occurs. The reservoir was therefore flushed, but recently no permission is granted. The reason is the high sediment concentrations that have negative effects on the downstream region. An optimization of the flushing operations that reduces the negative effects and recovers most of the storage volume is required. Hence, insight in the flushing operations and identification of the key processes that determine the flushing efficiency are required. The reservoir is flushed by creating a riverine flow. The key processes that occur during flushing are classified as progressive erosion, retrogressive erosion and bank erosion. The flushing operations are in the maintenance phase; a channel is already formed and only recently deposited sediments are flushed out of the channel. A large peak in the sediment concentration at the transition of drawdown to riverine flow occurs. The Delft 3 D software is able to simulate the processes except for bank erosion. Bank erosion can be added to the model through an application that is under development. The model is very sensitive to the grid cell size, due to the small dimensions of the <b>flushing</b> <b>channel.</b> It is advised to decrease the grid cell size and to confine the grid to the <b>flushing</b> <b>channel</b> and the near surroundings as most erosion occurs within this area. The model also experiences problems in the water balance. The problems are caused by the rapid changes in water level, discharge and bottom level, but can be solved by adding and subtracting water to the model. The amount of sediment removed from the reservoir is underestimated. Data for calibration and verification are missing and therefore only the sensitivity to parameters that might increase the erosion is investigated. A measurement plan is set up in order to obtain the required data. The peak concentration is not shown in the model and so the model can not be used properly yet, to simulate different strategies that are implemented to minimize the sediment concentrations. Even though the model does not fully simulate the observed hydrological and morphological changes, it is felt that an important first step is taken in simulating the flushing operations. For the optimisation of the flushing operations a tube system combined with auxiliary channels that drain laterally is recommended. It is desirable to optimize the sediment management of the whole hydropower system in the river Teigitsch and make separate models of the three reservoirs.

Blocking prostaglandins in humans reduces but does not consistently eliminate flushing, indicating additional mechanisms may contribute to flushing. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) channel, when activated, causes cutaneous vasodilation and undergoes tachyphylaxis similar to that seen with niacin. Using a murine model, early phase niacin-induced flushing was examined and TRPV 1 channel involvement demonstrated using pharmacologic blockade, desensitization, and genetic knockouts (TRPV 1 KO). The TRPV 1 antagonist AMG 9810 reduced {{the magnitude of the}} initial and secondary peaks and the rapidity of the vasodilatory response (slope). TRPV 1 desensitization by chronic capsaicin reduced the initial peak and slope. TRPV 1 KO mice had a lower initial peak, secondary peak, and slope compared with wild-type mice. Chronic niacin reduced the initial peak, secondary peak, and slope in wild-type mice but had no effect in knockout mice. Furthermore, chronic niacin diminished the response to capsaicin in wild-type mice.

The lake and {{surrounding}} watersheds are positioned {{at the base of the}} foothills of the Cascade mountain range to the east and the Pacific Coastal mountain range to the west. The lake is part of the Willamette Valley ecoregion, which extends south into Oregon. Size and Morphology Vancouver Lake is one of several large, shallow lakes in the lower Columbia River floodplain. It may have been formed by a series of Missoula Floods coursing through the Columbia River channel, and then further worked by the river itself with seasonal inundation. Historically, the lake was connected to the Columbia River through Mulligan Slough to the south and Lake River to the north. Diking and filling along the south and west lake shoreline and along the Columbia River shoreline led to the eventual separation of the lake and the river. Major tributaries to the lake include Burnt Bridge Creek, small tributaries along the eastern shore, and intermittently, Lake River, which can flow in or out depending on water levels in the lake relative to the Columbia River. When Lake River flows into the lake it potentially carries water from the Whipple, Salmon, and Flume Creek watersheds.

40|$|A field-oriented {{sedimentation}} {{study was}} conducted at Blind Pass Florida, shortly after the last channel dredging {{in the summer of}} 2000. Blind Pass is a wave-dominated tidal inlet that has been migrating southward for over 3, 000 meters before it was stabilized by a series of hard-engineering structures since 1937. Thereafter, the inlet has been maintained by frequent dredging. The dredged material was typically used to nourish the adjacent beaches, especially the downdrift Upham Beach. T ime-series measurements of tidal currents and bathymetry were conducted in the inlet channel. The ebb-dominated main channel, roughly 6 m deep, extends along the southern side, where peak ebb current approached 150 cm/s. Along the northern side of the inlet, the ebb curre nts are much weaker, as compared to both the flood current and ebb current in the main channel. Shortly after the 2000 dredging, rapid sedimentation was measured along the northern side of the inlet. This accumulation is likely resulted from the predominant southward longshore sand transport, bypassi ng the north jetty. The northern part of the inlet is dominated by flood-directed current and the weak ebb current is not adequate to flush the bypassed sediment out of the inlet. Along the southern side with the deep <b>channel,</b> active sediment <b>flushing</b> is evident as indicated by the coarse, shelly lag deposit on the bottom. Roughly 28 months after the channel dredging, the northern side near the entrance has become shallow enough to induce wave breaking over the shoal. Distinctive seasonal patterns of sedimentation are measured thereafter in the inlet channel, influenced by the seasonal wave climate...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{capacitive}} deionization (MCDI) is a {{water desalination}} technology based on applying a cell voltage between two oppositely placed porous electrodes sandwiching a spacer channel that transports {{the water to}} be desalinated. In the salt removal step, ions are adsorbed at the carbon–water interface within the micropores inside the porous electrodes. After the electrodes reach a certain adsorption capacity, the cell voltage is reduced or even reversed, which leads to ion release from the electrodes and a concentrated salt solution in the spacer <b>channel,</b> which is <b>flushed</b> out, after which the cycle can start over again. Ion-exchange membranes are positioned {{in front of each}} porous electrode, which has the advantage of preventing the co-ions from leaving the electrode region during ion adsorption, while also allowing for ion desorption at reversed voltage. Both effects significantly increase the salt removal capacity of the system per cycle. The classical operational mode of MCDI at a constant cell voltage results in an effluent stream of desalinated water of which the salt concentration varies with time. In this paper, we propose a different operational mode for MCDI, whereby desalination is driven by a constant electrical current, which leads to a constant salt concentration in the desalinated stream over long periods of time. Furthermore, we show how the salt concentration of the desalinated stream can be accurately adjusted to a certain setpoint, by either varying the electrical current level and/or the water flow rate. Finally, we present an extensive dataset for the energy requirements of MCDI, both for operation at constant voltage and at constant current, and in both cases also for the related technology in which membranes are not included (CDI). We find consistently that in MCDI the energy consumption per mole of salt removed is lower than that in CDI. Within the range 10 – 200 mM ionic strength of the water to be treated, we find for MCDI a constant energy consumption of 22 kT per ion removed. Results in this work are an essential tool to evaluate the economic viability of MCDI for the treatment of saltwater...|$|R
40|$|Bedrock {{channels}} {{represent a}} hydraulic environment {{quite different from}} that of alluvial channels, but currently, little is known about bedrock channel hydraulics and whether they differ in any fundamental sense from those of alluvial channels. A series of dye dilution experiments was carried out over a range of discharges in a straight reach of a bedrock channel (Birk Beck, U. K.), and an aggregated dead zone (ADZ) model for longitudinal solute transport and dispersion applied to the resulting time–concentration curves. The results of the experiments indicate the existence of two significant threshold discharges, Q 1 and Q 2. The dispersive fraction parameter of the ADZ model is found to decrease with increasing discharge, levelling off at a value close to zero for moderate to high discharges in excess of Q 1. At these discharges, the flow behaves almost as plug flow with very little dispersion taking place. At high discharges (greater than Q 2), the stage–discharge relationship deviates from a power law and discharge increases more slowly with increasing stage. In addition, area-weighted and momentum-weighted mean velocity values diverge strongly, as do estimates of reach volume derived from survey and from discharge and mean travel times. Celerity estimated from the slope of the stage–discharge relationship is found to peak at moderate discharges and to fall below momentum-weighted mean velocity estimates at a discharge equal to Q 2. Two hypotheses, the Macroturbulent Mixing Hypothesis and the Decoupled Dead Zone Hypothesis, are advanced to account for these observations. The fall in dispersive fraction to near zero at discharges above Q 1 is best explained {{as the result of a}} combination of increasing flow uniformity and effective lateral mixing across the whole channel cross section due to high turbulence intensities and large turbulent length scales. This means that potential dead zones in the bed and margins of the <b>channel</b> become well <b>flushed</b> and do not act as temporary storage zones for solute. The changes in bulk flow parameters observed at discharges in excess of Q 2 indicate that a significant portion of the channel cross section is acting only as storage and is not contributing to the discharge of the channel. This can be explained by the presence of a central core flow decoupled from marginal slack water and from dead zones in the margins. The results show that the study reach behaves differently from channels from which dispersive fraction values have previously been reported for a range of discharges...|$|R
40|$|Generally {{the waters}} of the Ria Formosa Lagoon, Portugal have a short {{residence}} time, in the order of 0. 5 days (Tett, P., Gilpin, L., Svendsen, H., Erlandsson, C. P., Larsson, U., Kratzer, S., Fouilland, E., Janzen, C., Lee, J., Grenz, C., Newton, A., Ferreira, J. G., Fernandes, T., Scory, S., 2003. Eutrophication and some European waters of restricted exchange. Continental Shelf Research 23, 1635 e 1671). This estimation is based on the measurements of currents and the modelling of water exchange at the outlets to the ocean. However, observations of the temperature and salinity in the inner channels imply that residence time is greater in these regions of the lagoon. To resolve this apparent contradiction, spatial measurements of the temperature and salinity were made with a meter for conductivity, temperature and depth along the principal channels of the western portion of the lagoon, with a sampling frequency of two per second. Evaporation rates of 5. 4 mm day 1 were measured in a salt extraction pond adjacent to the lagoon and used to determine the residence time through salinity differences with the incoming seawater. In June 2004, the water flooding in from the ocean had an average salinity of 36. 07 which contrasted with a maximum of 37. 82 at mid ebb on a spring tide, corresponding to a residence time of > 7 days; the mean residence time was 2. 4 days. As the tide flooded into the channels, the existing water was advected back into the lagoon. Although there was a small amount of mixing with water from another inlet, the water body from the inner lagoon essentially remained distinct with respect to temperature and salinity characteristics. The residence time of the water was further prolonged at the junction between the main channels, where distinct boundaries were observed between the different water masses. As the water ebbed out, the shallow Western Channel was essentially isolated {{from the rest of the}} outer lagoon, and the water from this channel was forced down the Ramalhete Channel, from where it was unable to exit the lagoon in one tidal cycle due to the extensive path length of w 14 km to the sea. Although the overall exchange rate of water is short in the outer lagoon, this study emphasizes that management models should take into account additional complexities that might arise from the much longer exchange rates of the inner lagoon. For example, the principal sewage discharge for the urban area of Faro is into the section of the Ramalhete <b>Channel</b> where efficient <b>flushing</b> is impeded by the relatively high residence times of the water body in this channel. The implementation of the techniques used for this study are a quick and relatively cost effective approach to testing assumptions about water quality and exchange in shallow coastal systems...|$|R

Downstream {{migration}} of European eel at three German hydropower stations. NINA Report 1355 : 53 pages, including appendix. Background and methods The {{aim of this}} study was to examine migration behaviour and losses of European silver eel when passing three run-of-the river hydropower stations in Germany. These were the Unkelmühle power station in the Sieg, the power station in Gengenbach in the Kinzig (both tributaries to the Rhine), and Kuhlemühle power station in the Diemel (tributary to the Weser). The Unkelmühle power station is designed with several bypass routes where fish can pass outside the turbines. At the power station in Gengenbach, the position of a movable turbine can be adjusted to let downstream migrating fish pass above or under the turbine. Narrowly spaced bar racks have been installed in front of the turbine intakes at both Unkelmühle, River Sieg (10 mm), and Gengenbach, River Kinzig (15 mm), to prevent fish from entering the turbines. At the Kuhlemühle power station, River Diemel, an Archimedes screw turbine is installed without a bar rack in front of its entrance. Archimedes screws are regarded as being fish-friendly turbines, but few studies have tested this assumption. The study was performed during 2014 to 2016 by tagging 542 European silver eels with radio transmitters. Their migration in the river and past the power stations was recorded. Results and conclusions Overall, we recorded low mortality for downstream migrating silver eels at these power stations. However, there are uncertainties linked to the survival estimates, particularly at Gengenbach and Kuhlemühle. The mortality of eels when they passed the Unkelmühle power station was 0 - 4 % and 0 - 8 % in the two consecutive study years. This shows that it is possible to obtain low mortalities for downstream migrating eels at run-of-the-river power stations with special protection measures to facilitate migration and reduce mortality. No direct turbine mortality occurred, as no eel slipped through the bar racks in front of the turbines, as expected due to the narrow bar spacing. The reason that we give mortality estimates as a range (0 - 4 % and 0 - 8 %), is that the fate of some tagged eels after passing the Unkelmühle power station is unknown, which makes it difficult to determine if they were alive or dead after passing. Further, three individuals showed movements indicating that they were taken by birds, but it is not known whether they were dead at the power station and taken by bird predators, injured by passing the power station and therefore taken by predators, or whether they were uninjured but taken by predators anyway. The estimates given as ranges take this uncertainty into account, and imply that the mortality at the Unkelmühle power station could have been zero in both study years, but the mortality could also have been up to 4 % in the first study year and up to 8 % in the second year. If there was some mortality linked to passing Unkelmühle power station, this must have been due to injuries occurring in the bypass routes, or increased predation at the power station area. Increased predation may occur if fish are injured and thereby easier prey. It is also possible that presence of injured fish of different species at power stations attracts predators, such that the likelihood of being taken by a predator increases also for uninjured fish. None of the tagged eels became stationary at the power station, indicative of being dead, neither at Gengenbach or Kuhlemühle. However, there are uncertainties for the survival estimates at these power stations, because eels may drift downstream after they are dead. Release of tagged dead eels showed that eels that potentially died when passing Gengenbach or Kuhlemühle could have drifted several kilometers and out of the monitored area below the power stations. Hence, mortality at the power station is in such cases not necessarily detected. The survival estimates at Unkelmühle were more certain, because the fish were tracked over a longer distance below the power station, and implicitly there were fewer individuals with an uncertain fate. Some eels became stationary on river stretches below Gengenbach and Kuhlemühle power stations, and might be dead (14 % and 23 % of the eels that passed the Gengenbach and Kuhlemühle, respectively). However, eels may cease migration and migrate downstream another year, so an eel becoming stationary may not necessarily be dead. Eels mainly used migration routes with a large proportion of the water flow when passing the power stations. At Unkelmühle, most of the downstream migrating eels used the spillway gate, or the bypass route leading fish from the bar racks in front of the turbines into the <b>flushing</b> <b>channel</b> and back to the river via a route outside the turbines. Only two eels used the custom-made side bypasses for eels, and only a small proportion of the eels (< 10 %) used the custom-made bottom bypass at Unkelmühle. At Gengenbach, the largest proportion of eels passed through the section where the moveable turbine was installed, and at Kuhlemühle, the largest proportion passed through the Archimedes screw turbine. A potential negative effect by Archimedes screw turbines may be migration delays. However, most eels migrated fast through the Archimedes screw turbine, and did not hesitate or stop the migration either upstream or downstream of the turbine. In fact, eels migrating through the Archimedes screw turbine or over the dam passed the power station area faster than eels using the other routes. Hence, eels were not markedly delayed in their downstream migration by using the Archimedes screw. However, there was large individual variation, and some individuals spent a long time in passing the power station...|$|R
