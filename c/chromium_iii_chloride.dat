Among various plateable selective coatings, black-chrome processes have been adopted industrially because of good optical properties coupled with long term durability. However, the conventional black chrome process suffers because of its toxic effluent, containing hexavalent chromium, which needs a rigorous wastewater treatment. Hence, the authors have worked out a pollution-free trivalent chromium electrolyte for black chrome deposition. A typical electrolyte and conditions consist of: <b>chromium</b> <b>III</b> <b>chloride,</b> 200 g/l; ammonium chloride, 30 g/l; oxalic acid, 3 g/l; pH 2. 5 - 3. 0; temperature 23 +- 2 deg.

40|$|One of {{the leading}} roles in {{treating}} diabetes mellitus belongs to chrome ions therapy (III), especially in the complex with selenium (IV). Currently selenium is obtained from unicellular algae, which contain biologically active substances and which are capable of accumulating exogenous microelements. By incubating unicellular algae Chlorella vulgaris Biej. in the conditions of aquaculture with sodium selenite (IV) and <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> <b>chloride,</b> we obtained a biologically active lipid substance which contains selenium and chromium. The substance was tested for the impact on energy metabolism of animals exposed to experimentally induced diabetes mellitus. The diabetes was caused by modeling obesity of the animals with further injection of streptozotocin {{in the amount of}} 65 mg/kg and nicotinamide at the dose of 230 mg/kg. The rats were intragastrically injected with 1 ml of 1 % starch solution which contained a selenium-chrome-lipid complex extracted from the Chlorella containing 0. 6 µg of selenium, 1. 05 µg of chrome and 0. 5 mg of lipids for prophylactic, therapeutic and prophylactic-therapeutic purposes; the other group of rats for therapeutic purposes was injected with starch solution with the same composition of microelements in inorganic form – sodium selenite (IV) and chromium chloride (III). This paper presents the results of our study of the impact of organic and inorganic compounds of chrome and selenium on the energetic metabolism of rats exposed to experimental diabetes mellitus. The analysis determined that in the rats’ organism, the selenium-chrome-lipid complex from the Chlorella improved the indicators of the energetic metabolism – in the group of rats which received it for therapeutic purposes, we observed an up to 7. 5 fold increase in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase compared to the rats which did not receive therapeutic treatment. The increase in the activity of succinate dehydrogenase corresponded to the increase in the activity of cytochrome c oxidase to 17. 2 % – in the group of rats injected with the substance for therapeutic purposes. Also, the selenium-chrome-lipid complex activated NADPH-glutamatedehydrogenase in groups of rats which received it for prophylactic and therapeutic-prophylactic purposes. A decrease in NADPH-GDH was observed in all groups of rats which were injected with the Chlorella complex, and its activation was observed only in the group of rats injected with inorganic forms of selenium and chrome. In rats injected with the Chlorella complex, we observed change in the ratio of NAD and NADPH-GDH towards increase. This indicates the intensification of the energy metabolism in the animals’ liver by using aminoacids as energetic substances. In the conditions of injecting inorganic forms of selenium and chrome, the ratio of NAD/NADPH decreased. Therefore, the results allow us to consider the algal complex obtained from Chlorella to be effective for regulating the energetic metabolism of subjects suffering from diabetis mellitus compared to the use of inorganic forms of chrome and selenium...|$|E

The {{aim of the}} present investigation was to study the reduction of chromium (VI) to <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> and then removing it {{with the help of}} weathered basalt andesite products. Reduction of the chromium (VI) to <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> by hydrazinium sulfate was investigated. The influence of hydronium ion concentration, contact time, hydrazinium sulphate dosage and temperature has been tested in batch runs. The process was found to be acid, temperature and concentration dependent. The suitability of weathered basalt andesite products as a potential sorbent was assessed for the removal of <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> following batch mode of operation. The effect of various parameters such as hydronium ion concentration, shaking time, sorbent dose, initial metal ion concentration and temperature on the removal of <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> from aqueous solution was studied.

Current disposal and treatment methods, such as ion exchange resins, are costly and pose a great health risk to the public. A more environmentally sound and cost-effective method of phytofiltration using alfalfa biomass may be a plausible solution. Previous studies have shown alfalfa {{to have a high}} affinity for chromium(III) at pH 5 and 6 under single-metal and mixed-metal conditions. Flow studies performed using silica-immobilized alfalfa biomass were conducted and X-ray microfluorescence (XRMF) was used to show conclusive evidence of chromium(III) binding. Studies performed using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) provided direct evidence that alfalfa biomass reduces chromium(VI) to <b>chromium</b> (<b>III).</b> Time and temperature studies conducted at pH 2 and 5 were also utilized to study the reduction process of chromium(VI) to <b>chromium</b> (<b>III).</b> Temperature experiments showed that <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> binding increased as the temperature increased under single-and mixed-metal conditions. However, chromium(VI) binding does not follow the same temperature-dependent trend. This information will lead to the development of an environmentally friendly and cost-effective phytofiltration system using alfalfa biomass...|$|R
40|$|The term “eco {{friendly}} ” leather {{meant the}} “chrome free ” leather. Around 80 % of leather is tanned using chromium. The chromium {{used in the}} tannery {{may be in the}} form of <b>chromium</b> <b>III,</b> IV and <b>chromium</b> VI compounds. The chromium tanned leathers use <b>chromium</b> <b>III</b> salts (Trivalent <b>chromium)</b> in the form of chromium sulfate. This form of chromium is found naturally in the environment and is necessary nutrient for the human body. However the <b>chromium</b> <b>III</b> oxidizes to <b>chromium</b> VI (Hexavalent chromium) in the presence of oxygen combined with other factors, such as extremes in pH. This happens during the tanning process. The hexavalent chromium produces allergic reaction and easily moves across the membranes such as skin, and it is a major cause for many diseases. This research work suggests using silicate tanning process by eliminating the chrome tanning process to make eco friendly leather. The present tanneries which use chrome tanning process can be modified in to silicate tanning process to make pollution free tanneries and the future generations can be protected from very dangerous environmental impacts caused by chromium compounds...|$|R
