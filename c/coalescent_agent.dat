The influence of the Zn-containing LDH composition was studied by measuring the thermal stability and the DBHP anti-migration ability when dispersed into polypropylene (PP). The overall crystallinity of α-PP is found to remain similar with the dispersion of DBHP-LDH particles, but shaper diffraction peaks indicate the presence of larger crystallized domains, most probably arising from an anisotropic connection of smaller coherent PP domains {{with the help of}} PP chains diffusing inside the layered inorganic structure. The latter is acting as a <b>coalescent</b> <b>agent</b> yielding an intercalated PP nanocomposite structure with extended interfaces inducing a shift in the glass transition temperature to a higher temperature. The radical-scavenging activity of DBHP when interleaved between LDH layers is found to be conserved while an optimized cation composition for MgZnAl–DBHP is found for the thermo-oxidative stability in association with a lower DBHP migration among the PP nanocomposite series, making the resulting PP nanocomposite a highly promising candidate for possible applications...|$|E
