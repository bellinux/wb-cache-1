5|$|Cantor {{extended}} {{his work on}} the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the <b>cardinality</b> of every infinite set is an aleph. First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. He used this inconsistent multiplicity to prove the aleph theorem. In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{difficulties}} involved {{in defining the}} <b>cardinalities</b> of fuzzy sets, the research on this subject has been advancing very slowly. In an earlier paper, we gave a much more appropriate definition. Thus, we not only obtained most of the results {{with respect to the}} <b>cardinalities</b> in Cantor′s set theory, but also succeeded in obtaining many new properties of the <b>cardinalities</b> of fuzzy sets. In this paper, the operations of the <b>cardinalities</b> of fuzzy sets, including the sum, the product, and the power, are discussed in detail...|$|R
5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what later {{came to be known as}} the continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the <b>cardinality</b> of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or <b>cardinality</b> (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E
5|$|Then if V'i = V {{for each}} i, the {{resulting}} direct sum {{can be written}} in exponential notation as V⊕N, or simply VN {{with the understanding that}} the direct sum is the default. We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get V'n, although without choosing a specific standard set with <b>cardinality</b> n, this is defined only up to isomorphism. Taking V to be the field R of real numbers (thought of as a vector space over itself) and n to be some natural number, we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra, the real vector space Rn.|$|E

40|$|Feature {{modeling}} {{is widely}} used to capture and manage commonalities and variabilities in software product lines. Cardinality-based feature models are used when variability applies {{not only to the}} selection or exclusion of features but also to the number of times a feature can be included in a product. Feature <b>cardinalities</b> are usually considered to apply in local or global scope. However, through our work in managing variability in cloud computing providers, we have identified cases where these interpretations are insufficient to capture the variability of the cloud environment. In this paper, we redefine cardinality-based feature models to allow multiple relative <b>cardinalities</b> between features and discuss the effects of relative <b>cardinalities</b> on cross-tree constraints. To evaluate our approach we conducted an analysis of relative <b>cardinalities</b> in four cloud computing providers. In addition, we developed tools for reasoning on feature models with relative <b>cardinalities</b> and performed experiments to verify the performance and scalability of the approach.

25|$|<b>Cardinality</b> {{is defined}} in terms of {{bijective}} functions. Two sets have the same <b>cardinality</b> if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the elements of the two sets. In the case of finite sets, this agrees with the intuitive notion of size. In the case of infinite sets, the behavior is more complex. A fundamental theorem due to Georg Cantor shows that it is possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities, and in particular the <b>cardinality</b> of the set of real numbers is greater than the <b>cardinality</b> of the set of natural numbers. It is also possible for a proper subset of an infinite set to have the same <b>cardinality</b> as the original set, something that cannot happen with proper subsets of finite sets.|$|E

25|$|A {{consequence}} of the continuum hypothesis is that every infinite subset of the real numbers either has the same <b>cardinality</b> as the integers or the same <b>cardinality</b> as the entire set of the reals.|$|E
25|$|The reals are uncountable; that is: {{there are}} {{strictly}} more real numbers than natural numbers, {{even though both}} sets are infinite. In fact, the <b>cardinality</b> of the reals equals that of the set of subsets (i.e. the power set) of the natural numbers, and Cantor's diagonal argument states that the latter set's <b>cardinality</b> is strictly greater than the <b>cardinality</b> of N. Since the set of algebraic numbers is countable, almost all real numbers are transcendental. The non-existence of {{a subset of the}} reals with <b>cardinality</b> strictly between that of the integers and the reals is known as the continuum hypothesis.
