2500|$|Figure3 shows a bipolar <b>current</b> <b>mirror</b> with emitter {{resistors}} {{to increase}} its output resistance.. That is, the resistors RE cause negative feedback that opposes change in current. In particular, any change in output voltage results in less change in current than without this feedback, which means the output resistance of the mirror has increased. [...] Transistor Q1 is diode connected, {{which is to say}} its collector-base voltage is zero. Figure4 shows the small-signal circuit equivalent to Figure3. Transistor Q1 is represented by its emitter resistance rE ≈ VT/IE (VT = thermal voltage, IE = Q-point emitter current), a simplification made possible because the dependent current source in the hybrid-pi model for Q1 draws the same current as a resistor 1/gm connected across r.

2500|$|This {{portion of}} the op amp cleverly changes a {{differential}} signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal {{at the base of}} Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on <b>current</b> <b>mirror</b> Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise.|$|E
