50|$|Although land {{reclamation}} {{has been an}} important factor for salt marsh loss in the UK in the past (Allen 1992) the majority of current salt marsh loss in the UK is believed to be due to erosion (Morris et al. 2004). This erosion may involve <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze,</b> where protective sea walls prevent the landward migration of salt marsh in response to sea level rise when sediment supply is limited (Hulme 2005; Morris et al. 2004). Salt marshes are protected under the EU Habitats Directive as well as providing habitat for a number of species protected by the Birds Directive (see Natura 2000). Following this guidance, the UK’s biodiversity action plan aims to prevent net losses to the area of salt marsh present in 1992. It is therefore a legal requirement that all losses in marsh area must be compensated by replacement habitat with equivalent biological characteristics (Crooks et al. 2001). This equates to the need to restore approximately 1.4 km² of salt marsh habitat per year in the UK.|$|E
40|$|<b>Coastal</b> <b>squeeze</b> is the {{reduction}} in the space of coastal habitats to operate (Phan et al, 2014) and an important cause for coastline retreat, increase in flood risk, salinity intrusion etc. Land use changes, such as deforestation and urbanization, reduce the space of natural habitats, such as mangrove forests, and cause deterioration of these habitats, that leads to reduction of their natural protective and provisioning functions.

40|$|As {{disturbance}} frequencies, intensities, {{and types}} have changed {{and continue to}} change in response to changing climate and land-use patterns, coastal communities undergo shifts in both species composition and dominant vegetation type. Over the past 100 years, fire suppression throughout the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast has resulted in shifts towards woody species dominance {{at the expense of}} marsh cover. Over the next 100 years, sea levels will rise and tropical storm activity is projected to increase; resultant changes in salinity could reduce cover of salt-intolerant fresh marsh species. Together, the effects of fire suppression upslope and rising salinities downslope could 2 ̆ 2 squeeze 2 ̆ 2 fresh marsh species, reducing cover and potentially threatening persistence. To mitigate the effects of fire suppression, the use of prescribed fire as a management tool to mimic historic conditions is becoming increasingly widespread and will likely gain further popularity during the 21 st century. Ecological shifts that will result from changing disturbance regimes are unknown. It was hypothesized that two recent hurricanes, Ivan and Katrina in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and a prescribed fire, in 2010, differentially affected species along the estuarine gradient and drove overall shifts away from woody dominance. Overall community composition did not change significantly in the intermediate and fresh marsh zones. However, significant changes occurred in the salt and brackish marshes and in the woody-dominated fresh marsh-scrub ecotone zones. Relative to 2004, woody species abundance decreased significantly in all zones in 2006, following Hurricanes Ivan and Katrina, and 2012, following the hurricanes and fire, though woody species regeneration in the marsh-scrub ecotone had begun to occur by 2012.

The coastal zone inMyanmar is subject to urbanization, extreme weather conditions (cyclones), increase in agri- and aquaculture and (illegal) felling of mangroves.

Our research is a scoping study to investigate how remote sensing analysis (using freely available Landsat imagery) can contribute to early recognition of <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze.</b> This is applied on a case study of the lower Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar, a crucial agricultural zone nicknamed the ‘Rice Bowl of Myanmar’. Analysis of Landsat imagery has been done to create a series of land use maps and determine coastline changes. This analysis has led to varying results. The use of recent Landsat imagery combined with data gathered by fieldwork has promising results to accurately calculate land use for large areas. Unfortunately this technique loses accuracy rapidly when applied to imagery from the past.

However, in many places, this development has been mismanaged and is within the littoral active zone, too close to the beach. Coastlines normally retreat landwards as sea levels rise, but with current development trends, beaches are now trapped in a <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze.</b> We aimed to determine the effect of sea-level rise on sandy beaches in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, using a GIS-based coastal recession model that we derived from Bruun’s rule. All analyses were calculated for a high, medium and low scenario of both sea-level rise and development. We also tested the efficacy of a proposed 10 -m contour setback line. Unconstrained beaches in northern KZN showed the greatest predicted retreat because they tended to be dissipative. However, no beach loss was predicted because the beaches could respond naturally by retreating landwards. More developed coastal sections showed a greater predicted loss of beach area, particularly where development was very close to the beach, or was protected by sea walls. The magnitude of the predicted retreat, development at risk of damage, and beach loss all increased with both increasing development and sea-level rise, indicating that development scenarios are as important as the climate change scenarios. Further, a 10 -m contour was not completely effective as a setback line, even for a low sea-level rise scenario. The loss of beach predicted by this model has a number of negative ecological implications which suggest that <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze</b> not only threatens to compromise the resilience of the coastal ecosystem, but that it also carries negative socio-economic implications because beaches are key draw-cards for tourism.

40|$|The Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment Wetland Change Model (DIVA_WCM) {{comprises}} a dataset {{of contemporary}} global coastal wetland stocks (estimated at 756 × 103 km 2 (in 2011)), mapped to a one-dimensional global database, {{and a model}} of the macro-scale controls on wetland response to sea-level rise. Three key drivers of wetland response to sea-level rise are considered: 1) rate of sea-level rise relative to tidal range; 2) lateral accommodation space; and 3) sediment supply. The model is tuned by expert knowledge, parameterised with quantitative data where possible, and validated against mapping associated with two large-scale mangrove and saltmarsh vulnerability studies. It is applied across 12, 148 coastal segments (mean length 85 km) to the year 2100. The model provides better-informed macro-scale projections of likely patterns of future coastal wetland losses across a range of sea-level rise scenarios and varying assumptions about the construction of coastal dikes to prevent sea flooding (as dikes limit lateral accommodation space and cause <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze).</b> With 50 cm of sea-level rise by 2100, the model predicts a loss of 46 – 59 % of global coastal wetland stocks. A global coastal wetland loss of 78 % is estimated under high sea-level rise (110 cm by 2100) accompanied by maximum dike construction. The primary driver for high vulnerability of coastal wetlands to sea-level rise is <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze,</b> a consequence of long-term coastal protection strategies. Under low sea-level rise (29 cm by 2100) losses do not exceed ca. 50 % of the total stock, even for the same adverse dike construction assumptions. The model results confirm that the widespread paradigm that wetlands subject to a micro-tidal regime {{are likely to be more}} vulnerable to loss than macro-tidal environments. Countering these potential losses will require both climate mitigation (a global response) to minimise sea-level rise and maximisation of accommodation space and sediment supply (a regional response) on low-lying coasts...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville, 2008. The {{aesthetic}} {{appeal of}} beaches has made coastal properties prime sites for development. However, this {{development has been}} mismanaged and is within the littoral active zone. Beaches retreat landwards as sea levels rise, but with current development trends, beaches are trapped in a <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze.</b> Climate-change predictions include an increase in frequency and heightened intensity of storms, which can cause significant erosion. This study aimed to determine the ecological implications of sea-level rise and storms for beaches in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), using geographic information systems (GIS) and beach sampling methods. The beaches were mapped in terms of physical and biological attributes. Spatial trends in these attributes showed that the coastline can be split into three – the northern, central and southern regions. Although 25 % of the coastline is protected by marine reserves, these {{are located in the}} Delagoa bioregion: 28 macrofauna species in the Natal bioregion are not protected. Storm impacts for beaches can be heterogeneous, depending on local coastal features, e. g., nearshore reef and sand dunes, and represented a temporary disturbance to macrofauna communities. A GIS-based coastal recession model was derived from Bruun’s rule, and applied for different scenarios of sea-level rise and coastal development. <b>Coastal</b> <b>squeeze</b> is concern, particularly in the southern region. Further, the 10 -m elevation contour was not completely effective as a setback line, even for a low sea-level rise scenario. The coastal recession model was validated using data from a real event in KZN, where sea level rose temporarily by ~ 1. 0 m. The model performed well, although the calibration possibly did not span a wide enough range of beach morphodynamic types, and under-predicted retreat for dissipative beaches. It was concluded that the Natal bioregion needs marine reserves, and that higher resolution spatial data are required for accurate beach modeling and the south coast railway line should be relocated proactively. Guidelines for sandy beach systematic conservation planning were outlined, and seated in a conceptual framework of managing beaches for resilience. Application of the proposed recommendations and frameworks could aid in determining a way forward in integrated coastal zone management for KZN, {{in the face of the}} uncertainties associated with climate change...|$|E

In terms of the four components of costs considered in FUND, protection seems to dominate, with substantial costs from wetland loss under some scenarios. The regional distribution of costs shows that a few regions experience most of the costs, especially East Asia, North America, Europe and South Asia.

This comparative study of England's and Germany's approaches to managed realignment sought to explore similarities and differences and hence provide insights on its future use. Although consideration of managed realignment is widely perceived as a positive development, important and sometimes surprising differences were found concerning its application. This reflects various factors ranging from the physical landscape and the state of coastal defences to cultural factors. Existing schemes are mostly concentrated on the coasts of eastern England and the German federal states of Lower Saxony and Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania. Managed realignment in England, and to some extent on Germany's Baltic Sea coast, seems driven by longer term factors, such as the desire to create more sustainable flood defences and to provide new intertidal habitats, although these are often combined with the more immediate need to upgrade defences. On Germany's well-defended North Sea coast, managed realignment has only been undertaken for specific compensation reasons, although broader conservation concerns might become an important future driver for managed realignment in summer polders. Thus managed realignment is now firmly on the agenda in both countries, reflecting a radical departure from the recent past, in which protection was the only possible response. However, application is likely to differ significantly both between and within these countries...|$|E

However, its long-term consequences for macroinvertebrate fauna, critical to most ecosystem services of sandy coasts, are still unknown. Seventeen sandy beaches - nourished and controls - were sampled along a chronosequence to investigate the abundance of four dominant macrofauna species and their relations with nourishment year and relevant coastal environmental variables. Dean's parameter and latitude significantly explained the abundance of the spionid polychaete Scolelepis squamata, Beach Index (BI), sand skewness, beach slope and latitude explained the abundance of the amphipod Haustorius arenarius and Relative Tide Range (RTR), recreation and sand sorting explained the abundance of Bathyporeia sarsi. For Eurydice pulchra, no environmental variable explained its abundance. For H. arenarius, E. pulchra and B. sarsi, there was no relation with nourishment year, indicating that recovery took place within a year after nourishment. Scolelepis squamata initially profited from the nourishment with "over-recolonisation" This confirms its role as an opportunistic species, thereby altering the initial community structure on a beach after nourishment.

Using participatory methods we elicited perceptions of stressors and their sources, impacts and consequences held by coastal communities in eastern Africa (Mtwara in Tanzania and Maputo in Mozambique). Respondent-informed timelines suggest wars, economic policies and natural increase have led to natural resource-dependent populations in marginal, previously little-inhabited lowland coastal areas. Respondents (n = 91) in interviews and focus groups rank climate stressors (temperature rise/erratic rain) highest amongst human/natural stressors having negative impacts on livelihoods and wellbeing (e. g., cross-scale cost of living increases including food and fuel prices). Sources of stress and impacts were mixed in time and space, complicating objective identification of causal chains. Some appeared to be specific to coastal areas. Respondents reported farms failing and rising dependence on stressed marine resources, food and fuel prices and related dependence on traders and credit shrunk by negative global market trends.

Given the global scale of marsh loss due {{to climate change}} and <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze,</b> there is a pressing need to identify the critical extrinsic (wind exposure and foreshore morphology) and intrinsic factors (soil and vegetation properties) affecting the erosion of salt marsh edges. In this study, we quantified rates of cliff lateral retreat (i. e., the eroding edge of a salt marsh plateau) using a time series of aerial photographs taken over four salt marsh sites in the Westerschelde estuary, the Netherlands. In addition, we experimentally quantified the erodibility of sediment cores collected from the marsh edge of these four marshes using wave tanks. Our results revealed the following: (i) at the large scale, wind exposure {{and the presence of}} pioneer vegetation in front of the cliff were the key factors governing cliff retreat rates; (ii) at the intermediate scale, foreshore morphology was partially related to cliff retreat; (iii) at the local scale, the erodibility of the sediment itself at the marsh edge played a large role in determining the cliff retreat rate; and (iv) at the mesocosm scale, cliff erodibility was determined by soil properties and belowground root biomass. Thus, both extrinsic and intrinsic factors determined the fate of the salt marsh but at different scales. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the scale dependence of the factors driving the evolution of salt marsh landscapes...|$|E
40|$|PhDOver {{the last}} half century, the saltmarshes of south east England have {{undergone}} an extensive decline, especially the pioneer zone vegetation. These losses have generally been blamed on <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze</b> resulting from sea level rising against sea walls. There is little evidence to support this hypothesis however, and an alternative hypothesis, based on infaunal invertebrates preventing the establishment of saltmarsh plants was tested. In the managed realignment site at Tollesbury, and the other sites examined, the mudflat fauna was dominated by Nereis (= Hediste) diversicolor and Hydrobia ulvae. In laboratory experiments N. diversicolor and H. ulvae reduced the production of seedlings from seeds of Salicornia europaea agg [...] Conversely the presence of S. europaea agg. significantly reduced the normal burrowing activity of N. diversicolor. Invertebrate exclusion experiments established at five sites in south east England facilitated colonisation by saltmarsh plants at some sites (Orplands, the Blythe Estuary, Wallasea Island and Maldon), by excluding large (> 3 cm) N. diversicolor. However, at the Tollesbury realignment site, {{the high rate of}} sediment deposition and the relatively long distance to a source of seeds prevented plant colonisation. This study supports the hypothesis that establishment of saltmarsh vegetation is prevented by infaunal invertebrates,particularly N. diversicolor, which exclude plants through bioturbation, herbivory and granivory. These interactions may help explain the loss of saltmarshes and will reduce the success of future managed realignment schemes which depend upon the colonisation of new intertidal areas by saltmarsh vegetation. Further management of realignment sites will be necessary to encourage saltmarsh development...|$|E
40|$|Sandy beaches are the {{dominant}} feature {{of most of}} the world’s ice-free coastlines, they are increasingly threatened by <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze</b> and they are relatively poorly understood. Even though it is clear that management intervention is required for the persistence of beaches, especially on urbanised coastlines, it is not particularly apparent how much their demise as functional systems would impact ecological processes in the coastal zone at regional scales. Here, we take the first step in addressing this issue using a case study conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Following a simple mass-balance approach, we assess the total rate of carbon turnover through various coastal habitats, including sandy beaches, rocky shores, estuaries and mangroves. On a per-unit-area basis, sandy beaches turn carbon over relatively slowly in comparison with the other systems. However, when aggregated over the entire study domain, the importance of the role of sandy beaches in this process at regional levels is emphasised. This is particularly true if photosynthesis is omitted from the calculations to provide an estimate of organic carbon consumed by the systems. The facts that beaches are fuelled by allochthonous production and that they do not aggregate organic matter support the intuitive notion that beaches are filters of coastal waters, with much production exported to adjacent systems. The fact that the spatial dominance of beaches means that they cycle comparatively large amounts of allochthonous carbon confirms that this is likely a very important process at regional scales. These results suggest that coherent and integrated conservation strategies are needed for entire coastlines and those beaches should be treated as important ecological components within these plans...|$|E
40|$|Intertidal {{mangrove}} forests {{exist in}} a dynamic coastal environment that is increasingly impacted by human interference, leading to habitat fragmentation, reduced habitat quality and changing hydrodynamic and geomorphological conditions. Biophysical feedback mechanisms are essential to maintain mangrove ecosystems under such changing conditions, for example by facilitating sediment deposition during periods of tidal flooding to allow for long-term coastal accretion. However, human interferences affect these biophysical interactions. This study investigated the consequences of two widespread anthropogenic intervention scenarios on biophysical interactions in mangroves: sediment starvation (reduced sediment supply) and <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze</b> (limited landward accommodation space). Field observations of hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics were conducted in Mandai mangrove fringing the sheltered northern shore of Singapore. A process-based numerical model (Delft 3 D) of this field site was set-up, providing accurate approximations of the observed flow velocities and deposition rates. This model was used for a scenario analysis of the initial response of the sediment trapping capacity in the mangrove system to instantaneous changes related to anthropogenic interventions. This analysis showed increased deposition rates in major parts of the mangrove when sediment supplies increased (up to three times more deposition after 1 tide) or when the landward accommodation space of the mangrove was extended (+ 17 % deposition). A comparison of the outcomes of these scenarios with {{the current state of}} the mangrove underlined a lack of short-term sediment trapping capacity, affecting the (longer-term) adaptive capacity of the system. Thus, at present Mandai mangrove is potentially affected by reduced sediment supply and limited landward accommodation space. Importantly, actions to reduce this anthropogenic influence could enhance mangroves' sediment trapping capacity, facilitating increased resilience to future projected changes such as sea-level rise. Understanding this influence of anthropogenic interventions on mangrove resilience is essential if we are aiming to maintain coastal ecosystem stability, especially along rapidly changing and urbanizing tropical shorelines...|$|E

While an abundance of literature documents environmental inequalities such as toxic sites, air pollution, and access to greenspace in North America and Europe, few researchers investigate coastal flooding {{as a result of}} sea level rise and storm tides. Flooding, coastal and fluvial, are the most common natural disasters in the world; and considering sea level rise and <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze,</b> will likely become more devastating. The impacts of coastal flooding will vary between populations and often those who are vulnerable will bear the brunt of the adverse effects. This research assesses the socio-spatial distribution of sea level rise in combination with storm tides in New Zealand, taking into account factors such as gender, age, income, ethnicity, and deprivation. Results display that the distribution of risk to coastal flooding is disproportionately higher in environmentally vulnerable places, such as coastal urban low-lying areas, and among socially vulnerable populations, such as Pacific peoples, people aged 65 and over, and people of low-income and high deprivation. Research also exhibits variations for each region in New Zealand. Discussion of the results are placed into context with the existing social, income, and health inequalities in New Zealand and the areas where inequality to coastal flooding in the highest. Furthermore, the results are discussed in relation to the policy framework in New Zealand including the New Zealand Health Strategy 2000 and the Resource Management Act 1991.

40|$|Changing climate {{threatens the}} {{structure}} and function of saltmarshes, which are often severely degraded by other human perturbations. Along the Mediterranean coastline, increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall have been hypothesised to trigger habitat shifts from perennial grasses to annual succulents in fragile saltmarsh ecosystems, such as those fringing the North Adriatic coastline. We used manipulative field experiments to investigate the effects of increased temperature, decreased precipitation and increased inundation period associated with rising sea levels on the dominant species in the lower marsh, the perennial grass Spartina spp. and the annual succulent Salicornia veneta. At ambient inundation, the combined effects of increased temperature and decreased precipitation enhanced soil temperature and decreased soil moisture, resulting in an increased number of plants, height and live biomass of S. veneta, as well as greater dead biomass of Spartina spp. compared with current conditions. Increased inundation reduced the soil redox potential, and resulted in losses of both Spartina spp. and S. veneta, but these negative effects were much more pronounced for S. veneta. An inundation tolerance test confirmed that S. veneta is significantly more vulnerable to rapid increases in inundation than Spartina spp. We conclude that at current inundation, the increasing drought conditions in the North Adriatic Sea are favouring {{the spread of the}} annual succulent S. veneta. The increasing spread of these succulents could reduce the future capability of the system to respond to projected increasing sea levels, as S. veneta is highly vulnerable to increased inundation. Synthesis. Our results highlight the complex interactions between different components of changing climate.

Thus, the only way to ensure their protection and continued provision of their valuable services, especially in a period of rapid global change, will be to apply knowledge generated from sound science in beach conservation and management. Here we aim to (1) identify and outline the broad ecological paradigms in sandy beach science; (2) report on a citation analysis of the published literature of the past 63 years (1950 – 2013) to provide context regarding the topics and location of research, the size and institutional composition of the research teams; and (3) investigate whether beach ecology can and has been incorporated into integrated coastal zone management practices. Past research was framed by specific paradigms (chiefly the Swash Exclusion Hypothesis, and derivatives), which can be identified with distinct principles and concepts unique to beaches. Most of the sandy beach literature comes from only a few countries (dominated by USA, South Africa, Brazil and Italy), published by small research teams (less than 4 authors), mostly from single institutes. The field has yet to establish large multi-disciplinary teams to undertake rigorous experimental science in order to contribute to general ecological theory. Despite the constraints, beach science is responding to new challenges, with increasing use of the latest techniques. However, research in conservation and management specifically remains limited, with stronger focus on anthropogenic impacts, in turn leading to management of people on beaches rather than conservation of the ecosystem itself. We conclude with a look to the future for sandy beach science, and a summary of the contributions to this Special Issue...|$|E
40|$|Ecophysiology {{studies are}} needed to predict plant {{responses}} in relation to climate change. Variations in salinity and inundation are expected to influence the survival and distribution of salt marsh. The following species were chosen to study as they occur in most South African salt marshes and are representative of different tidal ranges; namely Triglochin buchenaui (lower intertidal), Bassia diffusa (upper intertidal succulent) and Limonium linifolium (upper intertidal non-succulent). To simulate climate change conditions as predicted for South Africa, a 3 x 5 controlled experiment of three inundation levels (tidal, submerged and drought) and five salinity levels (0, 8, 18, 35, 45 ppt) was conducted for each species. This resulted in 15 treatments per species. Plant responses were measured over a three month period. Triglochin buchenaui showed significant variation in height (7. 57 ± 0. 5 to 29 ± 1. 55 cm, p 7 days) but could survive submergence of short duration (< 7 days) through continuous underwater photosynthesis, accumulation of osmolytes such as oxalic acid and carotenoid, and maintenance of relative water content and succulence within control levels. When considered together, results showed that the two upper intertidal species were sensitive to waterlogging and would not survive complete submergence, whereas the lower intertidal species could in addition to its natural range, thrive in conditions typical of the upper intertidal range, namely prolonged dry conditions and high sediment salinity. These results have important implications for the future management of salt marshes under predicted climate change conditions. In permanently open South African estuaries, a landward migration of salt marsh will be possible if <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze</b> is limited and the rate of landward recruitment is on par with sea level rise. In this case salt marsh species would retain their current zonation while shifting inland. Increased sea storms and saltwater intrusion could lead to high salinity concentration in the sediment and significantly reduce growth of salt-sensitive plants. In estuaries that are temporarily open to the sea, reduced freshwater inflow will result in an increase in mouth closure, high water levels, prolonged submergence, and consequently die back of salt marsh vegetation. On the other hand increased abstraction and drought would result in low water levels and high sediment salinity which would decrease growth and survival of salt marsh. This research has provided new knowledge on the ecophysiology of salt marsh plants which can be used to predict the responses of plants to climate chang...|$|E
40|$|Sites {{of special}} {{scientific}} interest (SSSIs) cover just under 7 % of England, around 12 % of Wales and around 13 % of Scotland. In recent years, investments {{have been made}} to bring the habitats and species that SSSIs were designated for into ‘favourable’ condition. However, some SSSIs and other protected areas (PAs) are under direct physical threat from inundation following sea level rise, and changes in climate will affect the species and habitats that are present on most PAs. This report summarises these threats and considers options for changing the way that the protected area network is managed. The following impacts of climate change have already been detected on PAs;  Saltmarshes have been lost to <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze,</b> and coastal freshwater habitats including grazing marsh and lowland raised bog are at risk of inundation by seawater under current conditions  Northern species have decreased in density, whilst southern species have increased in density. Whilst most evidence for this occurring on PAs comes from outside the UK, there is evidence that these patterns are occurring within the UK as well  Southern species in the UK have used PAs to facilitate their northwards expansion In addition, the following impacts of climate change have been predicted to occur in future;  The composition of flora and fauna on each PA will change – high confidence (medium evidence, high agreement)  Cold adapted species of high latitudes and altitudes will tend to decrease on PAs, whilst warm adapted species will tend to increase – medium confidence (medium evidence, medium agreement)  PAs in the North of the UK will gain plant species overall, whilst PAs in the south are likely to lose plant species. This pattern is reversed for UK breeding birds – low confidence (medium evidence, low agreement)  Species with lower dispersal capacities and those for which urban areas are a barrier to dispersal will be unable to colonize PAs that become climatically suitable – low confidence (limited evidence, medium agreement)  Work in Africa predicted that some Important Bird Areas (IBAs) may lose all the species for which they were designated by 2085, although for around 90 % of species at least one currently occupied IBA should remain suitable. In Europe, species turnover is predicted to be faster than in Africa – medium confidence (medium evidence, medium agreement)  Increasing range mismatching of interacting species, such as butterflies and their host plants, might mean that more management is necessary on PAs to preserve species that interact with each other – low confidence (limited evidence, medium agreement)  Hotspots of bird diversity in Finland and Norway may no longer coincide geographically with PA boundaries – low confidence (limited evidence, medium agreement) Integrating consideration of climate change into management plans for the PA network is likely to result in more effective (and cost-effective) conservation solutions. In order to facilitate this integration, monitoring of climate change impacts and management actions should be carried out to enable adaptive decision making...|$|E
40|$|Mangroves are tidal trees {{commonly}} observed {{along the}} sheltered shorelines of most tropical (from equator to 23. 5 ° North and South latitude) and few subtropical (23. 5 ° to 40 ° North and South latitude) countries. These plants are adapted to loose wet soils, saline habitats and periodic tidal submergence. With more attention paid into {{the approach of}} building with nature, natural coastal defence strategies are gaining more importance as an asset in addressing the <b>coastal</b> <b>squeeze</b> that is prevalent not only in urban areas, but also in agriculture and industrial areas that are located along the coastline. Mangroves are receiving more attention due to their coastal protective role against wave and hydrodynamic forcings {{as well as their}} ability to adapt to sea level rise. Mangrove vegetation attenuates and damps the hydrodynamics forcings by providing obstacles to the flows and creating drag. To date and to the knowledge of the author, no study has been conducted on interaction of the wave-induced currents with mangrove vegetation. This lack of relevant studies {{may be due to the}} fact that mangrove forests and the foreshore in front of the mangroves are usually of very gently sloping bed (varying in order of 1 : 300 to 1 : 1500). This means that in order to conduct physical model experiments to study wave-induced current within a mangrove forest, a very large wave basin is required in order to conduct modelling without using a very large scale factor difference between prototype and model. This is to ensure that the relevant processes are representing prototype as closely as possible, as well as to be measureable. Numerical modelling of the interaction of wave-induced current with mangrove vegetation is yet to be conducted due to the lack of measured data for validation, both field as well as experimental measurements. An experiment by Hulsbergen (1973) was selected as validation data for current study. The main objective of the study is to understand the difference of nearshore processes for (stationary) tidal gradient-driven and oblique wave-driven current for both with and without mimic mangrove vegetation. The scope of the study involves desktop analysis of the main validation data and other relevant and similar experiments, assessment of reliability of Delft 3 D for the study, validation against measured data, and simulation of various hydraulic conditions for condition with mangrove forest. Among questions answered in this study are the extent of wave-induced longshore current damping within mangrove forest, the significance of wave-induced longshore current within mangrove forest, the effects of bed slope and mangrove density on wave-induced current and the extent of model’s reliability for current study. It was shown that the damping of wave-induced longshore current is more than 80 % and the contribution of waveinduced current to the total velocity can be more than 70 %. Of course, both of the above was specific to the bathymetry, mangrove properties and hydraulic conditions specified within current study. Furthermore, it was shown that bed slope and mangrove density affect wave-induced longshore current within the mangrove forest. It was also found that current model setup has its limitations.
