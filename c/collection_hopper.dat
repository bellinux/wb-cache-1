25|$|Fly ash is {{captured}} and {{removed from the}} flue gas by electrostatic precipitators or fabric bag filters (or sometimes both) located at the outlet of the furnace and before the induced draft fan. The fly ash is periodically removed from the <b>collection</b> <b>hoppers</b> below the precipitators or bag filters. Generally, the fly ash is pneumatically transported to storage silos for subsequent transport by trucks or railroad cars.|$|R
50|$|Early spark arrestors {{were simply}} iron wire screens {{installed}} within the stack. This screen reduced {{the rate at}} which smoke and steam could escape from the boiler. Embers caught upon the screen further reduced available space for passing steam and smoke and heat generated by these burning embers rapidly melted the restraining wire screen. Chimney top diameters enlarged to increase screen surface area and reduce smoke velocity through the screen so embers might fall away from the screen into <b>collection</b> <b>hoppers.</b> Baldwin Locomotive Works compiled a diagram illustrating 57 different spark arresting chimney designs in response to an 1857 patent infringement claim.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} design was a bonnet chimney. The bonnet was a funnel-shaped sheet metal cone fitted over a {{conventional}} cylindrical chimney. The lower, small-diameter {{portion of the}} cone served as a <b>collection</b> <b>hopper</b> for falling embers. The upper portion of the cone concealed an inner cone {{at the top of}} the cylindrical chimney which deflected escaping steam, smoke and embers outward against the inner walls of the outer cone. The heavier embers were expected to fall into the hopper below while the lighter steam and smoke passed upward through a wire screen over the upper, large-diameter end of the outer cone. Deflection of the embers typically lengthened screen life to three or four weeks. Some of these chimneys had provisions dropping collected embers into a portion of the smokebox called the subtreasury. Sophisticated designs like the Radley & Hunter included various centrifugal separation baffles into the bonnet. As coal replaced wood fuel, the bonnet was reduced into a simple diamond stack housing the inner deflecting cone (with or without the upper wire screen) but without any <b>collection</b> <b>hopper.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{member of}} staff at Baxter's Fochabers {{manufacturing}} plant {{had to have}} his left foot amputated on-site after getting trapped in a vegetable auger during January 2014. The victim was trapped in the machine for an hour as emergency services, including two orthopaedic surgeons from Dr Gray’s Hospital in Elgin attempted to free him. He was later flown by air ambulance to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. Following a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation, Elgin Sherriff Court heard in October 2015 that an improvised method of pushing remaining vegetables into an auger was regularly used. Baxters management were not aware that staff regularly used a ladder to climb on to the conveyor then used a squeegee to push vegetables towards the auger. The victim was injured when his left foot slipped from the belt into the <b>collection</b> <b>hopper</b> and was pulled into the auger.

50|$|They {{are often}} {{employed}} in primary water treatment {{in place of}} conventional settling tanks. They are used in industrial water treatment. Unlike conventional clarifiers they use a series of inclined plates. These inclined plates provide a large effective settling area for a small footprint.

40|$|This {{research}} program {{focused on the}} development of fly ash derived sorbents to capture CO{sub 2 } from power plant flue gas emissions. The fly ash derived sorbents developed represent an affordable alternative to existing methods using specialized activated carbons and molecular sieves, that tend to be very expensive and hinder the viability of the CO{sub 2 } sorption process due to economic constraints. Under Task 1 'Procurement and characterization of a suite of fly ashes', 10 fly ash samples, named FAS- 1 to - 10, were collected from different combustors with different feedstocks, including bituminous coal, PRB coal and biomass. These samples presented a wide range of LOI value from 0. 66 - 84. 0 %, and different burn-off profiles. The samples also spanned a wide range of total specific surface area and pore volume. These variations reflect the difference in the feedstock, types of combustors, <b>collection</b> <b>hopper,</b> and the beneficiation technologies the different fly ashes underwent. Under Task 2 'Preparation of fly ash derived sorbents', the fly ash samples were activated by steam. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were used to characterize the resultant activated samples. The cost-saving one-step activation process applied was successfully used to increase the surface area and pore volume of all the fly ash samples. The activated samples present very different surface areas and pore volumes due to the range in physical and chemical properties of their precursors. Furthermore, one activated fly ash sample, FAS- 4, was loaded with amine-containing chemicals (MEA, DEA, AMP, and MDEA). The impregnation significantly decreased the surface area and pore volume of the parent activated fly ash sample. Under Task 3 'Capture of CO{sub 2 } by fly ash derived sorbents', sample FAS- 10 and its deashed counterpart before and after impregnation of chemical PEI were used for the CO{sub 2 } adsorption at different temperatures. The sample FAS- 10 exhibited a CO{sub 2 } adsorption capacity of 17. 5 mg/g at 30 C, and decreases to 10. 25 mg/g at 75 C, while those for de-ashed counterpart are 43. 5 mg/g and 22. 0 mg/g at 30 C and 75 C, respectively. After loading PEI, the CO{sub 2 } adsorption capacity increased to 93. 6 mg/g at 75 C for de-ashed sample and 62. 1 mg/g at 75 C for raw fly ash sample. The activated fly ash, FAS- 4, and its chemical loaded counterparts were tested for CO{sub 2 } capture capacity. The activated carbon exhibited a CO{sub 2 } adsorption capacity of 40. 3 mg/g at 30 C that decreased to 18. 5 mg/g at 70 C and 7. 7 mg/g at 120 C. The CO{sub 2 } adsorption capacity profiles changed significantly after impregnation. For the MEA loaded sample the capacity increased to 68. 6 mg/g at 30 C. The loading of MDEA and DEA initially decreased the CO{sub 2 } adsorption capacity at 30 C compared to the parent sample but increased to 40. 6 and 37. 1 mg/g, respectively, when the temperature increased to 70 C. The loading of AMP decrease the CO{sub 2 } adsorption capacity compared to the parent sample under all the studied temperatures. Under Task 4 'Comparison of the CO{sub 2 } capture by fly ash derived sorbents with commercial sorbents', the CO{sub 2 } adsorption capacities of selected activated fly ash carbons were compared to commercial activated carbons. The CO{sub 2 } adsorption capacity of fly ash derived activated carbon, FAS- 4, and its chemical loaded counterpart presented CO{sub 2 } capture capacities close to 7 wt%, which are comparable to, and even better than, the published values of 3 - 4 %...|$|E

40|$|Auster contributed {{an extract}} from Moon Palace to the <b>collection</b> “Edward <b>Hopper</b> and the American Imagination, ” {{and it is}} clear that Hopper’s images of alienated {{individuals}} have had a profound resonance for him. This paper employs two main ideas to compare them. First, a pivotal moment in American literature: the hotel room drama watched by Coverdale in Hawthorne’s Blithedale Romance. Secondly, Aby Warburg’s concept of the “pathos formula ” in art, which bypasses the problematic issue of influence, choosing instead to posit sets of inherited cultural memories. It therefore allows discussion of the re-emergence of Hawthorne’s puritan tropes of paranoid specularity and transcendence in the work of Hopper and Auster. I was never able to paint what I set out to paint. (Edward Hopper, quoted in O’Doherty 77) Words are transparent for him, great windows that stand between him and the world, and until now they have never impeded his view, have never even seemed to be there.

25|$|Hopper {{began working}} as a painter and a poet {{as well as a}} {{collector}} of art in the 1960s as well, particularly Pop Art. Over his lifetime he amassed a formidable array of 20th- and 21st-century art, including many of Julian Schnabel's works (such as a shattered-plate portrait of Hopper); numerous works from his early cohorts, such as Ed Ruscha, Edward Kienholz, Roy Lichtenstein (Sinking Sun, 1964), and Warhol (Double Mona Lisa, 1963); and pieces by contemporary artists such as Damien Hirst and Robin Rhode. He was involved in L.A.'s Virginia Dwan and Ferus galleries of the 1960s, and he was a longtime friend and supporter to New York dealer Tony Shafrazi. One of the first art works Hopper owned was an early print of Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans bought for US$75. Hopper also once owned Andy Warhol's Mao which he shot one evening in a fit of paranoia, the 2 bullet holes possibly adding to the print's value. The print sold at Christie's, New York, for US$302,500 in January 2011. The proceeds of the two-day sale of some 300 pieces from <b>Hopper's</b> <b>collection</b> at Christie's went to his four children.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the feasibility of recovering a very fine fraction of fly ash, that is 5 microns in diameter or less and examining the characteristics of these materials in new or at least less traditional applications. These applications included as a polymer filler or as a 'super' pozzolanic concrete additive. As part of the effort the ash from 6 power plants was investigated and characterized. This work included <b>collection</b> from ESP <b>Hoppers</b> and ponds. The ash was thoroughly characterized chemically and physically. Froth flotation was used to reduce the carbon and testing showed that flotation could effectively reduce carbon to acceptable levels (i. e. 0. 5 % LOI) for most of the substrates tested. in order to enable eventual use as fillers. Hydraulic classification was used in the separation of the fine ash from the coarse ash. Hydraulic classification requires the ash to be dispersed to be effective and a range of dispersants were tested for adsorption as well as sedimentation rate. A wide range of dosages were required (0. 3 to 10 g/kg). In general the ponded ash required less dispersant. A model was developed for hydraulic classification. A pilot-scale hydraulic classifier was also designed and operated for the project. Product yields of up to 21 % of feed solids were achieved with recoveries of < 5 {micro}m particles as high as 64 %. Mean particle sizes (D{sub 50 }) of the ultra fine ash (UFA) products varied from 3. 7 to 10 {micro}m. A patent was filed on the classifier design. A conceptual design of a Process Demonstration Unit (PDU) with a feed rate of 2 tons of raw ash feed per hour was also completed. Pozzolanic activity was determined for the UFA ashes in mortars. In general the overall strength index was excellent with values of 90 % achieved in 3 days and {approx} 100 % in 7 days. Three types of thermoplastic polymers were evaluated with the UFA as a filler: high density polyethylene, thermoplastic elastomer and polyethylene terphthalate filled polymers were prepared and subjected to SEM analysis to verify that the UFA was well dispersed. The addition of fillers increased the modulus of the HDPE composite, but decreased both the offset yield stress and offset yield strain, showing that the fillers essentially made the composite stiffer but the transition to plastic deformation occurred earlier in filled HDPE as stress was applied. Similar results were obtained with TPE, however, the decrease in either stress or strain at offset yield were not as significant. Dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA) were also completed and showed that although there were some alterations in the properties of the HDPE and TPE, the alterations are small, and more importantly, transition temperatures are not altered. The UFA materials were also tested in expanded urethanes, were improvements were made in the composites strength and stiffness, particularly for lighter weight materials. The results of limited flammability and fire safety testing were encouraging. A flowsheet was developed to produce an Ultra-Fine Ash (UFA) product from reclaimed coal-fired utility pond ash. The flowsheet is for an entry level product development scenario and additional production can be accommodated by increasing operating hours and/or installing replicate circuits. Unit process design was based on experimental results obtained throughout the project and cost estimates were derived from single vendor quotes. The installation cost of this plant is estimated to be $ 2. 1 M...|$|R
