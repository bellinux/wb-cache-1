5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to <b>cool</b> <b>it.</b> The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
25|$|The {{cabin is}} {{pressurized}} with bleed air tapped from the jet engine's compressor sections, which are {{prior to the}} combustion sections.

25|$|The early mammals {{had lower}} body {{temperatures}} and thus their testes worked efficiently within their body. However {{it is argued}} that boreotherian mammals have higher body temperatures than the other mammals and had to develop external testes to keep them <b>cool.</b> <b>It</b> is argued that those mammals with internal testes, such as the monotremes, armadillos, sloths, elephants, and rhinoceroses, have a lower core body temperatures than those mammals with external testes.|$|E

25|$|Bacon fat liquefies {{and becomes}} bacon {{dripping}} {{when it is}} heated. Once <b>cool,</b> <b>it</b> firms into lard if from uncured meat, or rendered bacon fat if from cured meat. Bacon fat is flavourful and is used for various cooking purposes.

25|$|Turner's {{college career}} {{was a rather}} {{turbulent}} one. He first played with Orange County Community College but his brash, flash style didn't enamour him to his coach. On one road trip, Turner and a teammate got into a scuffle after that player knocked Turner's tray in a fast-food joint. The coach told Turner to <b>cool</b> <b>it</b> but once they got back on campus, Turner exacted retribution. The next day when the coach saw that teammate sporting a black eye, he summoned Turner to his office and kicked him off the team.|$|E
25|$|A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a {{multistage}} evaporative cooler. The air {{is passed}} through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to <b>cool</b> <b>it,</b> then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, {{and that can be}} done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50°F (28°C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.|$|E
25|$|Hawker and Grieves {{finally took}} off from St John's on 18 May 1919. (other sources: from Mount Pearl) During the night, however, the aircraft's engine started to overheat, {{possibly}} because of a blocked filter in the cooling system. After making several attempts to clear the blockage by diving the aircraft and stopping and restarting the engine to attempt to <b>cool</b> <b>it,</b> with the engine still overheating and heavy weather ahead, they turned south {{to seek out the}} shipping lanes, and on encountering the Danish steamer SS Mary, ditched the Atlantic and were rescued, 1130mi 1,820km) from St Mary's and 750mi (1,210km) from Ireland.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the results}} of the Michelson–Morley {{experiment}} in 1887 were the first strong evidence that the then-prevalent aether theories were seriously flawed, and initiated a line of research that eventually led to special relativity, which ruled out the idea of a stationary aether altogether. To scientists of the period, it seemed that a true vacuum in space might be completely eliminated by cooling thus eliminating all radiation or energy. From this idea evolved the second concept of achieving a real vacuum: <b>cool</b> <b>it</b> down to absolute zero temperature after evacuation. Absolute zero was technically impossible to achieve in the 19th century, so the debate remained unsolved.|$|E
25|$|Bayer located Arcturus {{above the}} herdsman's left knee in his Uranometria. Nearby Eta Boötis, or Muphrid, is the {{uppermost}} star denoting the left leg. It is a 2.68-magnitude star 37 light-years distant with a spectral class of G0IV, indicating {{it has just}} exhausted its core hydrogen and is beginning to expand and <b>cool.</b> <b>It</b> is 9 times as luminous as the Sun and has 2.7 times its diameter. Analysis of its spectrum reveals {{that it is a}} spectroscopic binary. Muphrid and Arcturus lie only 3.3 light-years away from each other. Viewed from Arcturus, Muphrid would have a visual magnitude of -2½, while Arcturus would be around visual magnitude -4½ when seen from Muphrid.|$|E
25|$|One key {{advance in}} the Kestrel {{was the use of}} a {{pressurised}} cooling system. Water boils at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure, but this temperature decreases with altitude. Since the amount of heat carried out of the engine is a function of coolant temperature and volume, the coolant has to be kept below boiling point and an increasing amount of fluid has to be used, along with an increasingly large radiator to <b>cool</b> <b>it.</b> The solution was to pressurise the entire cooling system, thereby not only preventing the decrease in cooling performance with altitude, but in fact increasing the boiling point even on the ground. The Kestrel was built to maintain enough pressure to keep the boiling point at about 150°C.|$|E

25|$|Liquid {{hydrogen}} or slush hydrogen may be used, {{as in the}} Space Shuttle. However {{liquid hydrogen}} requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (−252.882°C or −423.188°F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to <b>cool</b> <b>it</b> down to that temperature). The tanks must also be well insulated to prevent boil off but adding insulation increases cost. Liquid hydrogen has less energy density by volume than hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline by approximately a factor of four. This highlights the density problem for pure hydrogen: there is actually about 64% more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline (116grams hydrogen) than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen (71grams hydrogen). The carbon in the gasoline also contributes to the energy of combustion.|$|E
25|$|Heat stroke {{can occur}} in dogs, {{especially}} in flat-faced breeds such as the Bulldog or in giant breeds. Breed, lack of water, exercise, and high ambient temperature predispose dogs to heat stroke. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, difficulty breathing, and body temperature approaching 42°C to 43°C. Treatment includes cooling the dogs with wet towels and fans, intravenous fluid therapy, and other supportive care. If a dog's temperature begin to drop to around 40°C, stop the cooling process. Once a dog’s body begins to <b>cool,</b> <b>it</b> can drop quickly and getting them too cool can create different problems. Allow the dog {{only a couple of}} laps of water until their temperature begins to drop to a more normal level. Do not allow a dog to gulp large quantities of water. If a dog is panting excessively and then drinks a lot of water, he will swallow large amounts of air with the water and this can cause an equally life-threatening case of gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) in their stomach.|$|E
