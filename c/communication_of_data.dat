5000|$|The {{history of}} PROFIBUS {{goes back to}} a {{publicly}} promoted plan for an association which started in Germany in 1986 and for which 21 companies and institutes devised a master project plan called [...] "fieldbus". The goal was to implement and spread {{the use of a}} bit-serial field bus based on the basic requirements of the field device interfaces. For this purpose, member companies agreed to support a common technical concept for production (i.e. discrete or factory automation) and process automation. First, the complex communication protocol Profibus FMS (Field bus Message Specification), which was tailored for demanding communication tasks, was specified. Subsequently in 1993, the specification for the simpler and thus considerably faster protocol PROFIBUS DP (Decentralised Peripherals) was completed. Profibus FMS is used for (non-deterministic) <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> between Profibus Masters. Profibus DP is a protocol made for (deterministic) communication between Profibus masters and their remote I/O slaves.|$|E

40|$|An interprocess {{communication}} (IPC) mechanism {{has been developed}} that enables lowlatency <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> structured <b>data.</b> This is becoming more important for such applications as distributed query processing of object-oriented databases (OODB) and hyper-text world-wide web (WWW) pages. In these applications, a sender typically creates structured data and sends them to a receiver. The main obstacle to achieve highperformance IPC with this pattern <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> is the latency of the receiver, which is caused by network latency and the different data processing order between the sender and the receiver. The IPC mechanism uses three key techniques: memory mapping, typed prefetching and controlling the data-sending order. A prototype IPC mechanism, implemented as a library on DECstation 5000 running Mach 3. 0, demonstrated that this IPC mechanism reduces latency in the <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> structured <b>data</b> compared with update-based and request-driven IPC mechanisms. 1 INTRODUCTION Many ne [...] ...|$|R
