5|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Williams Institute, nine million Americans, or roughly 3.4% of the adult population identify themselves as homosexual, bisexual, or transgender. A 2016 Gallup poll also concluded that 4.1% of adult Americans identified as LGBT. The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%. In a 2013 survey, the Centers for Disease <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prevention</b> found that 96.6% of Americans identify as straight, while 1.6% identify as gay or lesbian, and 0.7% identify as being bisexual.|$|E

5|$|At the episode's conclusion, Jenner {{purposely}} {{calls for}} the self-destruction of the building, which ultimately explodes shortly thereafter. A plate was installed on set, which hovered over pyrotechnics. The plate was turned upside down to create an optical effect where the flame travels across the panel.

Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The last {{cases of}} {{smallpox}} {{in the world}} occurred in an outbreak of two cases (one of which was fatal) in Birmingham, UK in 1978. A medical photographer, Janet Parker, contracted the disease at the University of Birmingham Medical School and died on September 11, 1978, after which Professor Henry Bedson, the scientist responsible for smallpox research at the university, committed suicide. All known stocks of smallpox were subsequently destroyed or transferred to two WHO-designated reference laboratories with BSL-4 facilities—the United States' Centers for Disease <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prevention</b> and Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{affected}} a large {{region of}} the northeastern United States from West Virginia to Massachusetts with heavy snowfall, sleet, rain, and high winds. The Centers for Disease <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prevention</b> attributed four deaths to the nor'easter, but only included those directly related; the agency did not include storm-induced traffic accidents or heart attacks. The National Climatic Data Center reported 19deaths related to the nor'easter, although news reports shortly after the storm reported 20deaths. Overall damage was estimated between $12billion (1992USD), mostly in New England.|$|E
5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prevention</b> (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak.

A cooperative agreement between the U.S. Centers for Disease <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prevention</b> and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project, with one of their aims being to promote sleep hygiene awareness.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prevention</b> recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E
