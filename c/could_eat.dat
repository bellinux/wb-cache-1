5|$|In February 1307, Bruce reappeared {{and started}} {{gathering}} men, and in May he defeated Aymer de Valence at the Battle of Loudoun Hill. Edward, who had rallied somewhat, now moved north himself. On the way, however, he developed dysentery, and his condition deteriorated. On 6July he encamped at Burgh by Sands, {{just south of}} the Scottish border. When his servants came the next morning to lift him up so that he <b>could</b> <b>eat,</b> he died in their arms.|$|E
5|$|In the fall, Hazen leveled {{charges of}} {{corruption}} and mismanagement against Isaac Tichenor, the deputy commissioner of purchases at Coös, General Bayley, the deputy quartermaster-general, and Matthew Lyons, the deputy commissioner of issues. His regiment were poorly supplied the whole summer at Coös, supplies of beef arrived spoiled, and Hazen had to send his men into the fields {{to help with the}} harvest so they <b>could</b> <b>eat.</b> Courts-martial were later held.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Tarrare {{had a huge}} {{appetite}} and by his teens <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> {{a quarter of a}} bullock, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home. For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food, before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling charlatan. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other. He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of snake meat.|$|E
500|$|The Myrmecoleon was {{a mythical}} ant-lion hybrid written {{about in the}} 2nd century AD Physiologus, where animal {{descriptions}} were paired with Christian morals. The ant-lion as described was said to starve to death because of its dual nature – the lion nature of the father <b>could</b> only <b>eat</b> meat, but the ant half from the mother <b>could</b> only <b>eat</b> grain chaff, thus the offspring <b>could</b> not <b>eat</b> either and would starve. It was paired with the Biblical verse [...] The fictional ant-lion of Physiologus is probably derived from a misreading of Job 4:11.|$|R
60|$|They {{waited for}} some two hours, unmolested; and, true to their policy of seeming recklessness, shifted and dried {{themselves}} {{as well as}} they <b>could,</b> <b>ate</b> what provisions were unspoilt by the salt water, and, broaching the last barrel of ale, drank healths {{to each other and to}} the Flemings on shore.|$|R

5|$|This {{was added}} to the south of the Great Hall in the early 16th century to provide a small {{intimate}} room where the family <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> in private away from the servants. Above it is the small Oriel Bedroom, probably originally a dressing room for the Great Chamber as its only entrance is via that room. At {{the same time that the}} oriel room and bedroom were added, rooms were added or remodeled to the south of the Great Hall: the Great Parlour with Great Chamber above, and the Little Parlour with Little Parlour above. John Lyte, the builder, placed his coat of arms on the outside of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{offense to}} the Chinese was the supposed kidnapping of children by the Portuguese so they <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> them. In reality, Simão had earned the Portuguese {{a bad reputation}} for buying young Chinese slaves, presumably {{some of whom were}} kidnapped after Simão offered local Chinese huge sums of money for child slaves. In fact, some boys and girls from wealthy Chinese families were later found by Portuguese authorities at Diu in western India. However, there were no official reports of Simão's abuses, even though he stayed until September 1520; yet rumors of his behavior (which became associated with all Portuguese) no doubt reached as far as the court of Beijing, which would soon condemn the Portuguese for this and other reasons.|$|E
5|$|The skull was {{structured}} {{in such a}} way that as it closed, the bones holding the teeth in the upper jaw would bow out. This would cause the lower surfaces of the upper jaw teeth to rub against the upper surface of the lower jaw's teeth, grinding anything caught in between and providing an action that is the rough equivalent of mammalian chewing. Because the teeth were always replaced, the animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life, and <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> tough plant material. Additionally, the front ends of the animal's jaws were toothless and tipped with bony nodes, both upper and lower, providing a rough margin that was likely covered and lengthened by a keratinous material to form a cropping beak for biting off twigs and shoots. Its food gathering would have been aided by its flexible little finger, which could have been used to manipulate objects, unlike the other fingers.|$|E

25|$|As in {{some other}} Papuan societies, the Urapmin people engaged in {{cannibalism}} in war. Notably, the Urapmin also had a system of food taboos wherein dogs <b>could</b> not be <b>eaten</b> {{and they had to}} be kept from breathing on food, unlike humans who <b>could</b> be <b>eaten</b> and with whom food could be shared.|$|R

25|$|One may not {{conclude}} the Passover meal with dainties. If {{some of the}} party fell asleep, they <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> when they awoke, but if all fell asleep, they were not permitted to eat. Rabbi Jose said that if they slept only lightly, they <b>could</b> <b>eat,</b> but if they fell fast asleep, they were not permitted to eat.|$|E
25|$|Meat {{that touched}} {{anything}} unclean {{could not be}} eaten; {{it had to be}} burned. And only a person who was unclean could not eat meat from peace offerings, at pain of exile. One <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> no fat or blood, at pain of exile.|$|E

25|$|AIPC {{grew out}} of an idea from its founder, Rick Barsness. When Barsness was a hockey player in high school, his team reached the state championships, but his father never {{attended}} a game. His father's absence nurtured a boyhood dream of a place where families <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> and have fun together. This {{was the type of}} place Barsness wished he could have spent time with his father.|$|E
25|$|Jumping spiders can leap up to 50times {{their own}} length by powerfully {{extending}} {{the third or}} fourth pairs of legs, with the longer forelimbs extended to grasp the prey. P.clarus, a relatively large salticid, takes prey up to the size of an adult earwig. In an experiment, P.clarus was offered as many fruit flies as it <b>could</b> <b>eat,</b> and in four-hour sessions individuals took 17flies on average – while one took 41.|$|E

McCloy recovered almost fully after months of physical therapy, but he stated he still suffered from some vision and hearing impairment as well as weakness {{on the right side of}} his body.|$|E
5000|$|Today the sushi dish {{internationally known}} as [...] "sushi" [...] (nigiri zushi; Kantō variety) is a fast food invented by Hanaya Yohei (華屋与兵衛; 1799-1858) in today's Tokyo (Edo).

25|$|P. clarus, {{which is}} large by the {{standards}} of salticids, takes prey up to the size of an adult earwig. In an experiment, the jumping spider was offered as many fruit flies as it <b>could</b> <b>eat,</b> and in 4-hour sessions specimens took 17flies on averagewhile one took 41. When the courtship display of wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata combines visual signals with vibrations, P. clarus responds to its wolf spider prey more quickly than when the wolf spider presents only one of the types of signal.|$|E
25|$|Isaac became {{blind in}} his old age and decided to bestow {{the blessing of the}} firstborn upon Esau. According to the Midrash, Isaac had reached the age of 132, five years past the age his mother, Sarah, had been at her death. According to Genesis, Isaac had reached the age of 137. At this time, the Sages state that one should begin to think he might not exceed the age of {{whichever}} parent died first. Isaac therefore sent Esau out to the fields to trap and cook a piece of savory game for him, so that he <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> it and bless Esau before he died.|$|E
25|$|Many {{sellers of}} {{religious}} goods, named Paternostrari or Coronari (rosary makers) had their shops here. At {{the edge of}} the quarter, in Vicolo degli ombrellari, a small lane near Borgo Pio, were the shops of the Roman umbrella makers, gathered there because of the bad smell coming from the oiled silk. In Borgo Vecchio several small foundries were active, where artistic objects made of bronze were cast. Particularly characteristic was the making of bells: the last foundry, located in Vicolo del Farinone, closed around 1995, after an activity lasted about 450 years. In the Borgo were also located many famous osterie, where Romans and pilgrims <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> and drink wine.|$|E

25|$|Amundsen {{had used}} the {{opportunity}} of learning from the Inuit while on his Gjøa North West passage expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To {{make the most of}} the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey, and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> seals and penguins hunted in the Antarctic while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that Elasmosaurus and its kin stalked schools of fish, concealing themselves below and moving the head slowly up as they approached. The eyes of the animal were located {{at the top of}} the head and allowed them to see directly upward. This stereoscopic vision would help it find small prey. Hunting from below would also have helped by silhouetting the prey in the sunlight while concealing Elasmosaurus in the dark waters below. Elasmosaurids probably ate small bony fish and marine invertebrates, as their small, non-kinetic skulls would have limited the prey they <b>could</b> <b>eat.</b> The long, slender teeth were adapted for seizing prey and not tearing, and hence it was swallowed whole. It swallowed small stones to aid its digestion.|$|E
25|$|During the Medieval Warm Period (the period {{prior to}} 1300), the {{population}} of Europe exploded compared to prior eras, reaching levels that were not matched again in some places until the nineteenth century – indeed parts of rural France today are less populous than {{at the beginning of}} the fourteenth century. However, the yield ratios of wheat, the number of seeds one <b>could</b> <b>eat</b> per seed planted, had been dropping since 1280, and food prices had been climbing. After favourable harvests, the ratio could be as high as 7:1, but after unfavourable harvests it was as low as 2:1 – that is, for every seed planted, two seeds were harvested, one for next year's seed, and one for food. By comparison, modern farming has ratios of 30:1 or more (see agricultural productivity).|$|E
