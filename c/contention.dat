40|$|Locks {{have been}} widely used as an {{effective}} synchroniza-tion mechanism among processes and threads. However, we observe {{that a large number of}} false inter-thread depen-dencies (i. e., unnecessary lock <b>contentions)</b> exist during the program execution on multicore processors, thereby incur-ring significant performance overhead. This paper presents a performance debugging framework, PERFPLAY, to facil-itate a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the performance impact of unnecessary lock <b>contentions.</b> The core technique of our debugging framework is trace re-play. Specifically, PERFPLAY records the program execution trace, on the basis of which the unnecessary lock <b>contentions</b> can be identified through trace analysis. We then propose a novel technique of trace transformation to transform these identified unnecessary lock <b>contentions</b> in the original trace into the correct pattern as a new trace free of unnecessary lock <b>contentions.</b> Through replaying both traces, PERFPLAY can quantify the performance impact of unnecessary lock <b>contentions.</b> To demonstrate the effectiveness of our de-bugging framework, we study five real-world programs and PARSEC benchmarks. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant performance overhead of unnecessary lock <b>contentions,</b> and the effectiveness of PERFPLAY in identify-ing the performance critical unnecessary lock <b>contentions</b> in real applications. 1...|$|R

5|$|New York {{played the}} Cleveland Browns a week later. In a meeting before the game, Ryan told his players that he {{expected}} to be fired {{at the end of}} the year. The Jets defeated Cleveland, 24–13, and despite the uncertainty, the players and coaches were in high spirits. Several players including Antonio Cromartie, Calvin Pace, and Willie Colon went on to publicly express their support for Ryan to return as coach. In the season finale, the Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins 20–7, eliminating them from playoff <b>contention.</b> In the locker room after the game, owner Woody Johnson and Idzik announced Ryan would return for the 2014 season much to the delight of the players. Ryan was praised for keeping his team competitive after being eliminated from playoff <b>contention</b> and keeping their spirits high throughout the year despite their inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Piłsudski's {{government}} depended more on his {{charismatic authority}} than on rational-legal authority.

5|$|Qualifying {{got under}} way on Saturday {{afternoon}} with new rules in place. Just as in years before, the qualifying procedure was divided into three parts, with the first part (Q1) running for 16 minutes and {{the second and third}} parts (Q2 and Q3) being 15 and 14 minutes long respectively. All twenty-two cars contested the first part, with seven drivers eliminated from further <b>contention</b> in each of the first two parts of qualifying, leaving eight drivers to compete for pole position in Q3. However, in a change of rules, drivers were now eliminated during the session, with the slowest runner at a given point being taken out from <b>contention</b> every ninety seconds, beginning seven minutes into Q1, six minutes into Q2 and five minutes into Q3.|$|E

5|$|The Queensland Rams {{were the}} first team to be {{eliminated}} from <b>contention</b> for the finals, after being swept four games to nil by the Victoria Aces in round 8. The following round saw South Australia clinch a position in the finals, despite finishing the round in second position. It was not until the final round that the last two spots in the finals were decided: the Aces clinched top spot by sweeping the Perth Heat, which combined with the New South Wales Patriots sweep of the Rams eliminated Perth from <b>contention</b> and secured the last finals spot for the Patriots.|$|E

5000|$|This {{style of}} debate {{generally}} centers on three main <b>contentions,</b> although a team can occasionally use two or four. In {{order for the}} affirmative side to win, all of the negative <b>contentions</b> must be defeated, {{and all of the}} affirmative <b>contentions</b> must be left standing. Most of the information presented in the debate must be tied in to support one of these <b>contentions,</b> or [...] "signposted". Much of extemporaneous speaking is similar to the forms known as policy debate and Student Congress Debate. One main difference with both of them, however, is that extemporaneous speech focuses less on the implementation of the resolution. Also, Extemporaneous Speech is considered in more areas, especially in the United States, as a form of Speech, which is considered separate from debate, or itself a form of debate with several types of events.|$|R

5|$|The loss {{dropped the}} Bears to 5–9 and officially {{eliminated}} them from playoff <b>contention.</b> Cutler's {{touchdown pass to}} Jeffery was his 200th career touchdown pass, while the onside kick attempted {{at the start of}} the third quarter was Gould's first successful kick in his eleven-year career with the Bears.|$|E
5|$|Through {{their first}} nine {{games of the}} year, the Jets went 5–4 and earned Ryan some early Coach of the Year consideration. The team {{proceeded}} to lose their next three contests as the rookie Smith committed eight turnovers while failing to score during that stretch. This prompted speculation by analysts {{as to whether or}} not Ryan would be fired. The Jets broke their losing streak with a 37–27 win over the Raiders that kept them in playoff <b>contention.</b> The following week, the Jets played the Carolina Panthers and trailed by three points heading into the fourth quarter. In the span of five minutes, the Panthers scored twice and the Jets were unable to complete a comeback attempt, losing 20–30. The loss eliminated the Jets from playoff <b>contention.</b>|$|E

5|$|A bone of <b>contention,</b> however, arose {{over the}} Queen's {{inheritance}} and dowry. Duke Rinaldo refused {{to release the}} former, and left the latter £15,000 in arrears. In 1700, five years later, the Duke finally paid the Queen her dowry; her inheritance, however, remained sequestered, and relations with Modena worsened again when Rinaldo allied himself with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. Leopold was an enemy of Louis XIV, James and Mary's patron.|$|E
5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus <b>contention</b> prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{that a certain}} class of side-channel attacks is feasible due to unintentional cache <b>contentions</b> between code segments in cryptographic applications. These inadvertent <b>contentions</b> {{should be considered as}} a flaw in the implementation of cryptographic applications, which necessitates a software analysis framework to identify their primary cause and check the effectiveness of proposed countermeasures. We present an approach to detect code segments in cryptographic applications that are in cache <b>contentions</b> with each other, thus leaking information that can be exploited in side-channel attacks to extract secret keys. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a series of experiments by using the well-known Bernstein's attack. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the primary source of exploitable information leakage in the Bernstein's AES server, rendering the attack a success, is the unintentional cache <b>contentions</b> between the parts of the OS kernel that handle network communications and the AES encryption code...|$|R
