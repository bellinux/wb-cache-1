50|$|Tamil Nadu is {{the largest}} textile hub of India. The textile {{industry}} {{plays a significant role}} in the Indian economy by providing direct employment to an estimated 35 million people, and thereby contributing 4% of GDP and 35% of gross export earnings. The textile sector contributes to 14% of the manufacturing sector. From Spinning to garment manufacturing, entire textile production chain facilities are in Tamil Nadu. About half of India's total spinning mill capacity is in Tamil Nadu. The western part of Tamil Nadu comprising Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode, Dindigul and Karur has the majority of spinning mills manufacturing cotton/polyester/blended yarn, open end yarn and silk yarn used by garment units in Tamil Nadu, Maharastra etc. Yarn is also exported to China, Bangladesh etc. Tirupur city knitted garment units have been exporting garments for about 3 decades with 2015-16 exports in the range of USD 3 Billion. Erode and Karur are home textile (<b>Curtain</b> <b>cloth,</b> bed linens, kitchen linens, toilet linens, table linens, wall hangings etc.) manufacturing hubs. Madras (Chennai) has a large presence of woven garments (shirts/pants) manufacturing units. Madurai and Kanchipuram are famous for handloom sarees exported / sold all over India. LMW, one of the three major textile machinery manufacturing companies in the world is located in Coimbatore. Savio also has a factory in Coimbatore. Many textile component manufacturers are in Coimbatore and some export to the Europe etc.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that the monastery was reputed all over Byzantium for its lavish decoration, liberally applied to all surfaces. Apart from revetment, carving, gold and silver plate, murals, and mosaics (especially imposing on curving surfaces), the interior featured a choice assortment of icons, chandeliers, silk <b>curtains,</b> and altar <b>cloths.</b> Only a fraction of these items are still in situ, most notably colored marble facings and window grilles.

500|$|Sheeran {{believes}} that Peake's creativity waned into conservatism, his talent [...] "dampened by mass production". He describes Peake's Cambridge portrait, Prince Charles, as Duke of York as poorly drawn, with a lifeless pose, in a stereotyped composition that [...] "confirms the artist's reliance {{on a much}} repeated formula in his later years". Art historian and curator Karen Hearn, on the other hand, praises the work as [...] "magnificent" [...] and {{draws attention to the}} naturalistically rendered note pinned to the curtain. Peake painted the portrait to mark Charles’s visit to Cambridge on 3 and 4 March 1613, during which he was awarded an M.A.—four months {{after the death of his}} brother. Depicting Prince Charles wearing the Garter and Lesser George, Peake here reverts to a more formal, traditional style of portraiture. The note pinned to a <b>curtain</b> of <b>cloth</b> of gold, painted in trompe-l'œil fashion, commemorates Charles’s visit in Latin. X-rays of the portrait reveal that Peake painted it over another portrait. Pentimenti, or signs of alteration, can be detected: for example, Charles’s right hand originally rested on his waist.|$|R

But you see, they had chosen to do a foolish thing just once too often; so, by the laws of Mrs. Bedonebyasyoudid, they had to go on doing it whether they chose or not, till the coming of the Cocqcigrues.|$|R
50|$|The {{focal-plane shutter}} {{operates}} {{as close to}} the film plane as possible and consists of <b>cloth</b> <b>curtains</b> that are pulled across the film plane with a carefully determined gap between the two curtains (typically running horizontally) or consisting of a series of metal plates (typically moving vertically) {{just in front of the}} film plane. The focal-plane shutter is primarily associated with the single lens reflex type of cameras, since covering the film rather than blocking light passing through the lens allows the photographer to view through the lens at all times except during the exposure itself. Covering the film also facilitates removing the lens from a loaded camera (many SLRs have interchangeable lenses).|$|R

50|$|Even when {{mixed with}} the {{numerous}} examples of Dutch Baroque painting, Vermeer’s works are very distinctive. Painted in the mid-1600s, this particular piece had a very common theme. A woman at “her toilet” was popular among Dutch painters.Vermeer was uniquely talented. He specially used a unique version of toning in which he used shades of browns and grays to line out his work. He most likely then used more structured colors like red, yellows, and blues (his favorites) as glazed tones to add texture to certain aspects of this painting. Some historians speculate that Vermeer used camera obscura to create this artwork. If this hypothesis is true, {{he could have been}} able to use perspective lighting to create the piece.Vermeer most likely used the pigment Lapis Lazuli to make his works distinctive. Very expensive material, Lapis Lazuli was used in tiny amounts to create distinctive pigment for most of his works.Additionally, as mentioned before, Vermeer used a cadre of special features in his domestic works. Those include lighting from {{the left side of the}} painting, domestic tools, the pigment yellow and blue, Women, expressive faces, framed windows, mirrors, or walls, and large draped <b>curtains</b> or table <b>cloths.</b>|$|R

It shows that a common set of standards defining methodologies, specifications and best practices for various smart textiles applications and products is needed. The concerns of being user friendly and easy to handle are very important for both technological and social factors. This signifies {{that there is a need}} to develop the related factors of smart textiles products including reliability, energy efficiency, and usability of technical devices even for "non-technical" people, configuration, human friendly and very simple communication protocols. All these show the needs of better development in smart home textiles, especially the light emitting textile for fashion and textile related products. The practice-based research methodology was adopted in this research study. This study combined the theories of colour-changing and weaving technologies, practical concept development in creating high value interior home textiles products including "smart sofa <b>cloth,</b> <b>curtain,</b> dining table <b>cloth,</b> glass mat and lamp cover" that could fit into the current interior and home textiles market. The research design of this study was divided into five major stages: the "research stage", "analysis stage", "design of initial prototypes", "evaluation stage", and "detail design" in order to create the high value colour-changing smart home textiles prototypes that could correspond to both human and environmental factors. The theoretical design process model of colour-changing smart home textiles was developed and based on the concept of French's design process model as well as the adoption of product development process and engineering approach to industrial design. The main process was detailed as follows: a) identifying needs; b) analysis of problem; conceptual design; embodiment of schemes; c) detailing. The final colour changing smart home textiles prototypes were then created according to the developed design process model. From this study, the knowledge of colour-changing smart home textiles from the aesthetic and functional perspectives can be enhanced and provide novelty in the contemporary textile design industry. The proposed design process model of colour-changing smart home textiles is able to illustrate the innovative design development for contemporary interior home textiles. The developed high value colour-changing smart home textiles prototypes are able to br utilises in different types of textiles products so as to meet the challenging needs of future lifestyle and consumer requirements. Both of the textile design industry and, fashion and textile design education can be profited because of the theoretical and practical contributions made in this study.

40|$|Background/Aims: A {{multimodal}} {{approach was}} required to manage a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus outbreak on an oncology ward in a tertiary hospital in north Queensland. One component of the approach was to trial antimicrobial disposable curtains, since {{it is known that}} <b>cloth</b> <b>curtains</b> harbor micro-organisms. The aim {{of this study was to}} trial antimicrobial disposable curtains in the oncology ward and a medical ward over a 12 -month period from June 2012 to May 2013. Methods: Disposable curtains were installed in June 2012. Samples were taken to test microbial growth at three, six, nine and 12 months. The 'control' was a sample curtain that had not been hung in a hospital ward. Results: There was no growth of either methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant enterococcus on any of the curtains. Since the trial, the disposable curtains have been installed in 17 inpatient and outpatient areas of the hospital. Not having to change curtains after an infectious patient is discharged saves 50 minutes, which equates to 1. 65 full-time staff per annum. There has also been a 61, 590 saving in laundry costs. However, the rate of multi-resistant organism colonization has increased slightly. Conclusion: It is acknowledged that poor hand hygiene, poor cleaning practices and poor compliance with standard precautions also contribute to transmission of infections. However, this study has demonstrated that disposable curtains are a worthwhile tool to use in the complicated fight against multiresistant organism transmission...|$|R

It surrounds a small lake, studded by three or four gaudy barques, fastened to the land by silken cords. The colonnade terminates towards the water by a very noble marble balustrade, the top of which is covered with groups of various kinds of fish in high relief. At each angle of the colonnade the balustrade gives way to a flight of steps which are guarded by crocodiles of immense size, admirably sculptured in white marble.

60|$|It was {{the first}} day of the January thaw. The snow lay deep upon the house-tops, but was rapidly {{dissolving}} into millions of water-drops, which sparkled downwards through the sunshine, with the noise of a summer shower beneath the eaves. Along the street, the trodden snow was as hard and solid as a pavement of white marble, and had not yet grown moist in the spring-like temperature. But when Peter thrust forth his head, he saw that the inhabitants, if not the town, were already thawed out by this warm day, after two or three weeks of winter weather. It gladdened him --a gladness with a sigh breathing through it--to see the stream of ladies, gliding along the slippery sidewalks, with their red cheeks set off by quilted hoods, boas, and sable capes, like roses amidst a new kind of foliage. The sleigh-bells jingled to and fro continually: sometimes announcing the arrival of a sleigh from Vermont, laden with the frozen bodies of porkers, or sheep, and perhaps a deer or two; sometimes of a regular market-man, with chickens, geese, and turkeys, comprising the whole colony of a barn yard; and sometimes of a farmer and his dame, who had come to town partly for the ride, partly to go a-shopping, and partly for the sale of some eggs and butter. This couple rode in an old-fashioned square sleigh, which had served them twenty winters, and stood twenty summers in the sun beside their door. Now, a gentleman and lady skimmed the snow in an elegant car, shaped somewhat like a cockle-shell. Now, a stage-sleigh, with its <b>cloth</b> <b>curtains</b> thrust aside to admit the sun, dashed rapidly down the street, whirling in and out among the vehicles that obstructed its passage. Now came, round a corner, the similitude of Noah's ark on runners, being an immense open sleigh with seats for fifty people, and drawn by a dozen horses. This spacious receptacle was populous with merry maids and merry bachelors, merry girls and boys, and merry old folks, all alive with fun, and grinning to the full width of their mouths. They kept up a buzz of babbling voices and low laughter, and sometimes burst into a deep, joyous shout, which the spectators answered with three cheers, while a gang of roguish boys let drive their snowballs right among the pleasure party. The sleigh passed on, and, when concealed by a bend of the street, was still audible by a distant cry of merriment.|$|R

Here, we report a micro-cable power textile for simultaneously harvesting energy from ambient sunshine and mechanical movement. Solar cells fabricated from lightweight polymer fibres into micro cables are then woven via a shuttle-flying process with fibre-based triboelectric nanogenerators to create a smart fabric. A single layer of such fabric is 320 [*]μm thick and can be integrated into various <b>cloths,</b> <b>curtains,</b> tents and so on. This hybrid power textile, fabricated with a size of 4 [*]cm by 5 [*]cm, was demonstrated to charge a 2 [*]mF commercial capacitor up to 2 [*]V in 1 [*]min under ambient sunlight in the presence of mechanical excitation, such as human motion and wind blowing. The textile could continuously power an electronic watch, directly charge a cell phone and drive water splitting reactions. In light of concerns about global warming and energy crises, searching for renewable energy resources that are not detrimental to the environment {{is one of the most}} urgent challenges to the sustainable development of human civilization 1, 2, 3. Generating electricity from natural forces provides a superior solution to alleviate expanding energy needs on a sustainable basis 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. With the rapid advancement of modern technologies, developing lightweight, flexible, sustainable and stable power sources remains both highly desirable and a challenge 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Solar irradiance and mechanical motion are clean and renewable energy sources 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Fabric-based materials are most common for humans and fibre-based textiles can effectively accommodate the complex deformations induced by body motion 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. A smart textile that generates electrical power from absorbed solar irradiance and mechanical motion could be an important step towards next-generation wearable electronics. Here, we present a foldable and sustainable power source by fabricating an all-solid hybrid power textile with economically viable materials and scalable fabrication technologies. Based on lightweight and low-cost polymer fibres, the reported hybrid power textile introduces a new module fabrication strategy by weaving it in a staggered way on an industrial weaving machine via a shuttle-flying process. Colourful textile modules with arbitrary size and various weaving patterns are demonstrated. Featuring decent breathability and robustness, the hybrid power textile was demonstrated to harvest energy simultaneously from ambient sunshine and human biomechanical movement in a wearable manner with or without encapsulation. The hybrid power textile is highly deformable in response to human motion. Mixed with colourful wool fibres, the hybrid power textile with a size of 4 [*]cm by 5 [*]cm is capable of stably delivering an output power of 0. 5 [*]mW with a wide range of loading resistances from 10 [*]KΩ to 10 [*]MΩ for a human walking under sunlight of intensity 80 [*]mW[*]cm− 2. More importantly, the power textile can be also adopted for large-area application such as curtains and tents. Under ambient sunlight with movement of a car or wind blowing, the textile delivered sufficient power to charge a 2 [*]mF commercial capacitor up to 2 [*]V in 1 [*]min, continuously drive an electronic watch, directly charge a cell phone, as well as drive the water splitting reactions...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and <b>cloth</b> <b>curtains</b> are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the take-up spool in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting control cam) has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not disengage. To drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two twist-lock cams that turn and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for lining-up of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the frame count and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing frame spacing issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame counter system, tied to the counter roller, operates the automatic reset of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|R
