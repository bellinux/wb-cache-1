5|$|Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. {{was born}} in Quincy, Illinois, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he {{was five years old}} the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa's capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a {{confections}} wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. One day his mother agreed to pay one dollar to get him into an airplane at the local carnival. In 1927, when he was 12 years old, he flew in a plane piloted by barnstormer Doug Davis, dropping <b>candy</b> <b>bars</b> with tiny parachutes to the crowd of people attending the races at the Hialeah Park Race Track.|$|E

There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, <b>candy</b> <b>bars,</b> ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on the counters and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs.

50|$|The ZERO <b>candy</b> <b>bar,</b> {{introduced}} in 1920, is a <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> {{composed of a}} combination of caramel, peanut and almond nougat covered with a layer of white fudge (a.k.a. white chocolate fudge). Its outwardly white color, an unusual color for a <b>candy</b> <b>bar,</b> has become its trademark.|$|R
50|$|Rising {{demand for}} peanuts {{in the early}} 20th century was due to a {{shortage}} of plant oils during World War I and {{the growing popularity of}} peanut butter, roasted peanuts, and peanut candies. Peanut products originating around the early 20th century include many brands still sold today such as Cracker Jack (1893), Planters peanuts (1906), Oh Henry! <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> (1920), Baby Ruth <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> (1920), Butterfinger <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> (1923), Mr. Goodbar <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> (1925), Reese's Peanut Butter Cup (1925), and Peter Pan (peanut butter) (1928).|$|R

5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with <b>candy</b> <b>bars</b> and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
25|$|The McFlurry is a soft-serve {{ice cream}} dessert that has pieces of candy or cookies mixed into it. The McFlurry was first {{integrated}} into the menu at a Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada franchisee in 1995 and in the United States in 1998.

Also in Malaysia, a unique flavor called FuseofmyLife is offered to customers.

One of their most {{important}} jobs were to answer questions, including those surrounding the canteen and the basics of the North Platte and Nebraska. Another important job was to tend to those on the hospital trains who were unable to enter the building. The men on the trains were naturally treated the same as those who went inside. Magazines, religious literature, and decks of cards were also distributed to the servicemen on the trains. If they were unable to disembark from the cars, women would walk {{up and down the aisles}} distributing goods or hand up materials from the ground to the windows.|$|E

500|$|Halvorsen did {{not want}} to merely re-enact the candy drop to {{countries}} no longer plagued by war. In later years he advocated using candy drops to lift spirits and promote goodwill in other nations. In 1994 he persuaded the air force to let him drop hundreds of <b>candy</b> <b>bars</b> over Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of Operation Provide Promise. Another, larger drop was planned and executed by Halvorsen over Kosovo in 1999. Additional candy drops have been enacted in Japan, Guam, Albania, and across the United States. In 2003 and 2004, he advocated a similar series of candy drops over Baghdad as a humanitarian mission to be a [...] "ray of hope, a symbol that somebody in America cares."

[...] Lisa would occasionally advertise it too. Matt Groening would later say that the Butterfinger advertising campaign was {{a large part of}} the reason why Fox decided to pick up the half-hour show. The campaign was discontinued in 2001, much to the disappointment of Cartwright. Bart has also appeared in commercials for Burger King and Ramada Inn. In 2001, Kellogg's launched a brand of cereal called [...] "Bart Simpson Peanut Butter Chocolate Crunch", which was available for a limited time. Before the half-hour series went on the air, Matt Groening pitched Bart as a spokesperson for Jell-O. He wanted Bart to sing [...] "J-E-L-L-O", then burp the letter O. His belief was that kids would try to do it the next day, but he was rejected.|$|E

500|$|Bartholomew JoJo [...] "Bart" [...] Simpson, {{voiced by}} Nancy Cartwright, is the eldest child and only {{son in the}} family‚Äîat age 10. Bart's most {{prominent}} character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness, disrespect for authority and sharp wit. During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's main character. The name [...] "Bart" [...] is an anagram of the word [...] "brat". Groening conceived Bart as an extreme version of the typical misbehaving child character, merging all of the extreme traits of characters such as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn into one person. Groening's older brother Mark provided most of the inspiration for Bart. Bart's catchphrase [...] "Eat My Shorts" [...] was an ad-lib by Cartwright {{in one of the}} original table readings, harking back to an incident when she was at college. In 1998, Time magazine selected Bart as 46th of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, and the only fictional character to make the list. He had previously appeared {{on the cover of the}} December 31, 1990 edition. Bart is rebellious and frequently escapes without punishment, which lead some parents' groups and conservative spokespeople to believe he provided a poor role model for children. This prompted George H. W. Bush to rally, [...] "We're going to keep trying to strengthen the American family. To make them more like the Waltons and less like the Simpsons."

Among the Dunder Mifflin branches Michael visits is Nashua, New Hampshire, where Holly works, and Utica, New York, where Karen works.
