5|$|Earlier, the <b>caracal</b> was {{classified}} under the genera Felis or Lynx. However, a 2006 phylogenetic {{study showed that}} the <b>caracal</b> evolved nearly a million years before the lynx appeared. The <b>caracal</b> is most {{closely related to the}} African golden cat (Profelis aurata, often considered a species of <b>Caracal).</b> These two species, together with the serval (Leptailurus serval), form one of the eight lineages of Felidae. The <b>Caracal</b> lineage came into existence 8.5 mya, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5–5.6 mya.|$|E
5|$|The <b>caracal</b> {{appears to}} have been religiously {{significant}} in the ancient Egyptian culture. It occurs in paintings and as bronze figurines; sculptures were believed to guard the tombs of pharaohs. Embalmed caracals have also been discovered. <b>Caracal</b> ear tufts have been elaborately depicted in some tombs, and referred to as umm risha't ("mother of feathers").|$|E
5|$|The <b>caracal</b> {{is often}} {{confused}} with the lynx, as both cats have tufted ears. However, a notable point of {{difference between the two}} is that the lynx is spotted and blotched, while the <b>caracal</b> shows no such markings on the coat. The African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal's, but is darker and lacks the ear tufts. The sympatric serval can be told apart from the <b>caracal</b> by the former's lack of ear tufts, white spots behind the ears, spotted coat, longer legs, longer tail and smaller footprints.|$|E
50|$|Other cats can be found, such as <b>caracals.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Caracals</b> {{have been}} tamed {{and used for}} hunting {{since the time of}} ancient Egypt.|$|R
5|$|<b>Caracals</b> possess {{distinctive}} black {{markings on}} their faces, and some individuals may have pronounced 'eyebrow' markings.|$|R
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the serval {{have remained in}} dispute; in 1997, palaeontologists M.C. McKenna and S.K. Bell classified Leptailurus as a subgenus of Felis, while others like O.R.P. Bininda-Edmonds (of the Technical University of Munich) have grouped it with Felis, Lynx and <b>Caracal.</b> Studies in the 2000s and the 2010s show that the serval, along with the <b>caracal</b> and the African golden cat, forms {{one of the eight}} lineages of Felidae. According to a 2006 genetic study, the <b>Caracal</b> lineage came into existence 8.5mya, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5–5.6mya.|$|E
5|$|Several {{wild boars}} (Sus scrofa) are {{native to the}} park. They are often found near the beaches where they feed on scraps and trash dropped by visitors. Further within the forests of the peninsula, other mammals can be spotted, such as golden jackals (Canis aureus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), and even several striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) and caracals (<b>Caracal</b> <b>caracal),</b> among many others usually not native to such areas.|$|E
5|$|The Children's Trail lets {{children}} {{get close to}} many small mammals from around the world, including emus, an ocelot, a <b>caracal,</b> siamang gibbons, and golden-mantled tamarins.|$|E
5|$|Its predators {{include all}} larger {{carnivores}} such as leopards, <b>caracals,</b> African wildcats, snakes, and birds of prey.|$|R
5|$|Ahmedabad's Kamla Nehru Zoological Park {{houses a}} number of {{endangered}} species including flamingoes, <b>caracals,</b> Asiatic wolves and chinkara.|$|R
50|$|Indigenous animals include porcupines, <b>caracals,</b> small grey mongoose, rock hyraxes (also {{known as}} dassies), and {{many species of}} bird.|$|R
5|$|The coat of the <b>caracal</b> is used {{in making}} fur coats, while its skin does not have much {{economic}} significance.|$|E
5|$|The serval {{is similar}} to the {{sympatric}} <b>caracal,</b> but has a narrower spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The African golden cat is darker, with different cranial features. It resembles the cheetah in its build and coat pattern, though not in size. The serval shares its adaptations to its marshy habitat with the jungle cat; both cats have large and sharp ears that help in locating the prey efficiently, and their long legs raise them above muddy ground and water.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionary {{executive}} left Islaz at {{the head}} of a gathering of soldiers and various others, and, after passing through <b>Caracal,</b> triumphantly entered Craiova without meeting resistance from local forces. According to one account, the gathering comprised as many as 150,000 armed civilians. As these events were unfolding, Bibescu was shot at in Bucharest by Alexandru or Iancu Paleologu (the father of French diplomat Maurice Paléologue) and his co-conspirators, whose bullets only managed to tear one of the Prince's epaulettes. Over the following hours, police forces clamped down of Frăția, arresting Rosetti and a few other members, but failing to capture most of them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Caracals</b> are {{sometimes}} used as hunting animals {{in some parts}} of the Middle East, although they are normally kept as pets.|$|R
50|$|Golden jackals {{have been}} {{observed}} regularly at the site. Striped hyenas and <b>caracals</b> were reported by local people near the lake edge.|$|R
50|$|In Israel, sand cats {{were thought}} to be {{endangered}} by predation of larger carnivores such as <b>caracals,</b> wolves and, of those who venture close to human settlements, dogs.|$|R
5|$|A carnivore, the <b>caracal</b> {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion of}} the diet. They will feed from a variety of sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{nearly two}} to three months, {{following}} which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvark and porcupines. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws non-retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around {{the same time the}} kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens start moving about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them everyday. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the <b>caracal</b> in captivity is nearly 16 years.|$|E
25|$|A combat {{option for}} women is the <b>Caracal</b> Battalion, which is a light {{infantry}} force that {{is made up of}} 70 percent female soldiers. The unit undergoes training like any combat infantry. The IDF commando K9 unit, Oketz, also drafts females as combat soldiers.|$|E
50|$|In September 2014, Wellington Zoo {{opened their}} newest exhibit, Grassland Cats, {{home to the}} zoo's servals and brand new <b>caracals,</b> the first ones {{in the country for}} a long time.|$|R
50|$|Tera {{and its environs}} are {{furthermore}} {{noted for}} a variety of wildlife, including chinkaras, blue bulls, wild boars, hyenas, great Indian bustards, peacocks, black partridges, desert foxes, Indian wolves and <b>caracals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like other hares, {{they run}} fast. The only {{predator}} which {{is capable of}} outrunning them is the cheetah. All other predators are ambush and/or opportunistic hunters; examples of these are leopards, <b>caracals,</b> and black-backed jackals.|$|R
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the <b>caracal</b> (<b>Caracal</b> <b>caracal)</b> and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|E
25|$|In October 2012 the IDF {{promoted}} Mona Abdo {{to become}} the first female Christian Arab to the rank of combat commander. Abdo had voluntarily enlisted in the IDF, which her family had encouraged, and transferred from the Ordnance Corps to the <b>Caracal</b> Battalion, a mixed-gender unit with both Jewish and Arab soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Rîmaru's parents {{married in}} <b>Caracal</b> and had three sons, Ion being their eldest child. His father, Florea, would beat his mother daily; the couple {{eventually}} separated {{and his father}} moved to Bucharest, taking {{a job as a}} night tram driver. After his death years later, Florea was discovered to have been a serial killer (see below).|$|E
50|$|The Jonkershoek {{mountains}} {{are home to}} Leopards, <b>Caracals,</b> Klipspringer, Baboons, Honey Badgers and Mongooses, however, all but the baboons are very secretive. Birdlife includes kingfishers, black eagles, fish eagles, spotted eagle owls, sugarbirds, orange-breasted sunbirds and protea seed eaters.|$|R
50|$|Prior to <b>Caracal's</b> {{formation}} in 2000, women {{were barred from}} serving in direct combat. The unit has since been tasked with patrolling the Israeli-Egyptian border. It took part in Israel's unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip {{in the summer of}} 2005.|$|R
5|$|Due to its slow movements, the addax is an {{easy target}} for predators such as lions, humans, African hunting dogs, cheetahs and leopards. <b>Caracals,</b> hyenas and servals attack calves. The addax are {{normally}} not aggressive, though individuals may charge if they are disturbed.|$|R
25|$|In Dubai, {{both male}} and female police {{officers}} carry semi-automatic handguns such as the <b>Caracal</b> and SIG Sauer pistols, while Special Emergency Units (SWAT) gain a varied arsenal of weapons such as the Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun, Glock 17 pistols, Ithaca 37 shotguns, M4 and Colt M16 variants, X26 tazers, flash grenades and other weapons depending on the situation encountered.|$|E
25|$|Burkina Faso has {{a larger}} number of {{elephants}} than many countries in West Africa. Lions, leopards and buffalo can also be found here, including the dwarf or red buffalo, a smaller reddish-brown animal which looks like a fierce kind of short-legged cow. Other large predators live in Burkina Faso, such as the cheetah, the <b>caracal</b> or African lynx, the spotted hyena and the African wild dog, one of the continent’s most endangered species.|$|E
25|$|The species {{frequently}} scavenges {{from the}} kills of felids such as tigers, leopards, cheetahs and caracals. A <b>caracal</b> can drive a subadult hyena from a carcass. The hyena usually wins in one-to-one disputes over carcasses with leopards, cheetahs and tiger cubs, but {{is dominated by}} adult tigers. In addition, the hyena is sympatric with the Asiatic lion in Gir Forest National Park, and the sloth bear in Balaram Ambaji Wildlife Sanctuary, in the Indian State of Gujarat.|$|E
50|$|Dik-diks are hunted {{primarily}} by leopards, <b>caracals,</b> lions, hyenas, wild dogs and humans. Other predators include monitor lizards, cheetahs, jackals, baboons, eagles, hawks and pythons. Dik-diks' adaptations to predation include excellent eyesight {{and the ability}} to reach speeds up to 42 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the nearby}} Thar Desert the Indus Valley desert has little farming or grazing {{due to its}} hard climate and {{therefore}} the natural habitats are almost intact. However hunting still goes on and {{is a threat to}} <b>caracals,</b> wolves and other mammals.|$|R
50|$|The {{endangered}} houbara bustard, {{a species}} of wader, breeds in the wild only at sites in the sanctuary. Other species found here include the largest wild population of the endangered Arabian gazelle, as well as Nubian ibex, Arabian wolves, honey badgers, and <b>caracals.</b>|$|R
