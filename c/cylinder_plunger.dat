5000|$|If {{bleeding}} brakes {{because of}} master cylinder replacement the master cylinder is usually [...] "bench bled" [...] before installation. Typically by securing {{it on the}} bench, filling it with fluid, connecting fittings and hoses to route fluid from the outlet ports on the master cylinder back to its reservoir, and repeatedly depressing the master <b>cylinder</b> <b>plunger</b> until bubbles are no longer seen coming from the hoses.|$|E
40|$|Session : Bases biologiques de la qualité et génétique/génomiqueAmong fish quality traits, flesh texture is an {{important}} sensory quality trait for consumer but also for processing plant during filleting or slicing. 35 fish upon 700 were selected as "soft" (M) or "firmed" (F) based on the mechanical resistance of the fillet using a penetrometric test with a <b>cylinder</b> <b>plunger.</b> No difference was measured between M and F fish for body weight and global or muscle adiposity. Fillet lightness was higher for F fish (p< 0, 05). Muscle pH, measured immediately after slaughter, was higher (p< 0, 001) for F fillet. Difference in fillet firmness, the selective trait at slaughter, was still significant at 48 h post-mortem (pm). No difference between M and F was measured for ultimate pH (48 h pm) or white muscle fibre mean diameter. Muscle transcriptome analysis revealed, between M and F, differences in the expression of genes coding for structural components, especially for connective tissue and enzymes (metabolic and proteolytic) ...|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} cylinder without a piston {{or with a}} piston without seals is called a <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinder</b> can only {{be used as a}} pushing cylinder; the maximum force is piston rod area multiplied by pressure. This means that a <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinder</b> in general has a relatively thick piston rod.|$|R

40|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{tool for}} safely separating one multipin electrical connector from another is presented. The separation tool {{consists of a}} master cylinder which operates a pair of slave cylinders. Each slave cylinder has a corresponding operative shaft and an extraction tab. The slave cylinders are spaced apart from one another {{so that they may}} be positioned on either side of mated connector pairs of different sizes and so that their extraction tabs may be slid between the connectors. When the master <b>cylinder's</b> <b>plunger</b> is operated, its operation is hydraulically transmitted to the operative shafts of the slave cylinders which extend outward and, once pressed against a substrate, causes the slave cylinders and corresponding extractor tabs to move away and separate one connector from the other. A second preferred separation tool includes an additional pair of extractor tabs, one {{at the end of each}} operative shaft, so that the tool can be used to separate a mated connector pair hanging in free space...|$|R
50|$|In {{case the}} {{retracted}} {{length of the}} cylinder is too long for the cylinder {{to be built in}} the structure, Telescopic cylinder can be used. One has to realize that for simple pushing applications telescopic cylinders might be easily available; for higher forces and/or double acting cylinders, they must be designed especially and are very expensive. If hydraulic cylinders are only used for pushing and the piston rod is brought in again by other means, one can also use <b>Plunger</b> <b>cylinders.</b> <b>Plunger</b> <b>cylinders</b> have no sealing over the piston, if the piston even exists. This means that only one oil connection is necessary. In general the diameter of the plunger is rather large compared with a normal piston cylinder, whereas a hydraulic motor will always leak oil. A hydraulic cylinder does not have a leakage over the piston nor over the cylinder head sealing so that {{there is no need for}} a mechanical brake.|$|R
50|$|The S tube should swing over {{rapidly and}} not suffer undue wear. This is {{effected}} with two large-sized <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinders</b> and a so-called spectacle plate (so named from its shape) including seal rings.|$|R

(15.2 cm) path, vacuum plate, Mylar film, cut from roll of approximately 2 – 3 in. 2 area, metal <b>cylinder,</b> metal <b>plunger,</b> metal base with a smooth top, hydraulic press, HunterLab and BYK colorimeter and laboratory larox (Labox).|$|R
50|$|Plunger pumps {{component}} {{materials are}} chosen for wear and {{contact with the}} media type. Component materials include bronze, brass, steel, stainless steel, iron, nickel alloy, or other material. For example, plunger pumps that function in general service or oil service applications often have an iron <b>cylinder</b> and <b>plunger.</b> The plunger, discharge valves, and suction valves {{come in contact with}} the media type transferred, and material choices are based on the fluid transferred. In power applications where continuous duty plunger pumps are needed, solid ceramic plungers may be used when in contact with water and oil, but may not be compatible for use with highly acidic media types.|$|R
50|$|A cookie {{press is}} a device for making pressed cookies such as spritzgebäck. It {{consists}} of a <b>cylinder</b> with a <b>plunger</b> on one end, {{which is used to}} extrude cookie dough through a small hole at the other end. Typically the cookie press has interchangeable perforated plates with holes in different shapes, such as a star shape or a narrow slit to extrude the dough in ribbons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} motion compensator is {{the anchor}} chain of a ship. Not {{only does the}} anchor prevent the ship from drifting, but the chain itself dampens {{the movement of the}} ship due to undulating motion of the waves. Generally, motion compensators are implemented as springs. For very large forces (dozens to hundreds of tonnes), the springs are implemented as gas springs: hydropneumatic devices [...] - [...] a <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinder</b> buffered by a volume of gas.|$|R
50|$|These {{consist of}} a {{cylinder}} with a reciprocating plunger. The suction and discharge valves are mounted in {{the head of the}} cylinder. In the suction stroke the plunger retracts and the suction valves open causing suction of fluid into the cylinder. In the forward stroke the plunger pushes the liquid out of the discharge valve.Efficiency and common problems: With only one <b>cylinder</b> in <b>plunger</b> pumps, the fluid flow varies between maximum flow when the plunger moves through the middle positions, and zero flow when the plunger is at the end positions. A lot of energy is wasted when the fluid is accelerated in the piping system. Vibration and water hammer may be a serious problem. In general the problems are compensated for by using two or more cylinders not working in phase with each other.|$|R
50|$|A {{differential}} cylinder {{acts like a}} normal cylinder when pulling. If the cylinder however has to push, the oil from the piston rod side of the cylinder is not returned to the reservoir, but goes to the bottom side of the cylinder. In such a way, the cylinder goes much faster, but the maximum force the cylinder can give is like a <b>plunger</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A {{differential cylinder}} can be manufactured like a normal cylinder, and only a special control is added.|$|R
50|$|Inertance has {{the same}} units as mass (kilograms in the SI system) and the name {{indicates}} its relationship to inertia. Smith did not just define a network theoretic element, he also suggested a construction for a real mechanical component and made a small prototype. Smith's inerter consists of a plunger able to slide {{in or out of}} a <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>plunger</b> is connected to a rack and pinion gear which drives a flywheel inside the cylinder. There can be two counter-rotating flywheels in order to prevent a torque developing. Energy provided in pushing the plunger in will be returned when the plunger moves in the opposite direction, hence the device stores energy rather than dissipates it just like a block of mass. However, the actual mass of the inerter can be very small, an ideal inerter has no mass.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{deals with the}} {{development}} of a high-pressure <b>cylinder</b> with oscillating <b>plunger</b> as used in high-pressure pumps, very high-pressure pumps and process pumps for pressure processing (up to 2, 500 bar). The present pressure cylinder is a metal design in which a bronze sleeve (low coefficient of sliding friction) is rolled into a steel sleeve. One investigated in how far the steel sleeve shrink compound can be replaced by a plastic sleeve with a high-strength carbon-fiber reinforcement. One has developed a hybrid Br/CFRP pressure cylinder, the structure, design and use of which under operating conditions is described here. (orig.)

50|$|The {{basic type}} {{consists}} of a steel <b>cylinder</b> body, a <b>plunger</b> on the top, a spring, a pair of step-cut locks, and a spreader bar. A special type of pliers are used to push in the spring-loaded plunger. This pushes down on the step-cut locks, which pushes {{them away from the}} spreader bars and allows them to come together. This allows the user to slip the locking jaws through a hole made through multiple sheets of material. When the plunger is released the spring pulls the locking jaws back towards the spreader bar, which separates the two jaws. The material sheets are then squeezed in between the step-cut area and the steel cylinder. This keeps the holes in the separate sheets aligned.|$|R
50|$|A cafetière, or French press, is a tall, narrow <b>cylinder</b> with a <b>plunger</b> that {{includes}} a metal or nylon fine mesh filter. The grounds are placed in the cylinder, and off-the-boil water is then poured into it. The coffee and hot water are left in the cylinder {{for a few minutes}} (typically 4-7 minutes) and then the plunger is gently pushed down, leaving the filter immediately above the grounds, allowing the coffee to be poured out while the filter retains the grounds. Depending on the type of filter, it is important {{to pay attention to the}} grind of the coffee beans, though a rather coarse grind is almost always called for. A plain glass cylinder may be used, or a vacuum flask arrangement to keep the coffee hot; this is not to be confused with a vacuum brewer—see below.|$|R
50|$|Most present-day {{diesel engines}} use a {{mechanical}} single plunger high-pressure fuel pump {{driven by the}} engine crankshaft. For each engine <b>cylinder,</b> the corresponding <b>plunger</b> in the fuel pump measures out the correct amount of fuel and determines the timing of each injection. These engines use injectors that are very precise spring-loaded valves that open and close at a specific fuel pressure. Separate high-pressure fuel lines connect the fuel pump with each cylinder. Fuel volume for each single combustion is controlled by a slanted groove in the plunger which rotates only a few degrees releasing the pressure and is controlled by a mechanical governor, consisting of weights rotating at engine speed constrained by springs and a lever. The injectors are held open by the fuel pressure. On high-speed engines the plunger pumps are together in one unit. The length of fuel lines from the pump to each injector is normally the same for each cylinder {{in order to obtain}} the same pressure delay.|$|R

50|$|A pipette {{consists}} of a long thin tubular tip connected to a hollow <b>cylinder</b> containing a <b>plunger.</b> Pipettes are the simplest, smallest, and in their basic forms, the least expensive type of media dispenser, and are also pulse-free. However, they can only effectively transport one or two fills at a time, and, unless filled from the rear, the tube tip must constantly be reinserted into the source vessel {{in order to be}} refilled which creates a repeated opportunity for contamination. They also require the user to do more work than any other type of dispenser both in terms of time to fill a receptacle and energy necessary to make sure each fill is precise and accurate (digital pipette models may work faster and require less work per fill from the user than manual ones, though these are then subject to the availability of electricity and the possibility of mechanical failure). On the plus side, the simple pipette has few moving parts, rarely or never breaks down, and is capable of moving thick or thin media including those containing abrasives with relative ease.|$|R
50|$|A vacuum {{variable}} capacitor uses {{a set of}} plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid {{in or out of}} an opposing set of <b>cylinders</b> (sleeve and <b>plunger).</b> These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio as well as high powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient since the elements are under a vacuum the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced.|$|R
40|$|The paper presets flow {{characteristics}} of a hydraulic unit {{made up of a}} <b>cylinder</b> and a <b>plunger,</b> which is typical for most of precision pairs, as a function of contamination content in the working fluid. The consideration cover typical cases, including flow of contaminated fluid via an interstice (positive allowance), when the manifold plunger (spool) is in its initial position and the flow rate Qz of the working fluid at the manifold inlet is higher than the flow rate Q via the interstice, the manifold plunger (spool) is in its initial position and the flow rate Qz of the working fluid at the manifold inlet is lower than the flow rate Q via the interstice and when the manifold plunger moves against the manifold cylinder (body). Mathematical relationships, determined for all the above cases, define the following characteristics: volume of contaminants captured upstream the interstice, volume of contaminants captured in the interstice, volume of contaminants that flow out downstream the interstice, flow rate of the working flow downstream the interstice as a function of time, average velocity for the working fluid that flows out of the interstice as well as time interval that is necessary to fill in the interstice. Distribution of contaminants along the interstice length is described as well. The determined relationships served as a basis to find out interconnections between volumes of fluid that flows via an interstice and duration of the flow process...|$|R
