40|$|AbstractPublic {{procurement}} of goods, {{services and}} products {{has become a}} cornerstone in recent European policies on innovation. With regard to construction, clients are often promoted as change agents that can foster {{a higher degree of}} innovation in construction through appropriate design of their procurement procedures. With the new European service procurement directive, a number of changes are underway. Among these are less restrictive procedures for using the more flexible procurement forms like <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue.</b> Based on a literature review and European statistics, this paper will 1) review the historical changes of European procurement rules, 2) quantify the application of <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> as procurement procedure, and 3) discuss lessons learned from selected European countrieson promoting and managing change in construction through <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue.</b> This paper will conclude that <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> seems to have a low potential as driver of innovation in a quantitative sense due to the stable but small number of applications, while the effects on innovation in a qualitative sense needs to be studied further...|$|E
40|$|The <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> is a {{procedure}} used by Rijkswaterstaat {{to obtain the}} most economically -effective contract available for ‘particularly complex’ projects. The procedure entails a dialogue, which may be phased, {{with the aim of}} developing one or more suitable alternatives capable of meeting its requirements. Due to changing legislation several issues will influence the policy for the application of the <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue.</b> This changing legislation {{takes the form of a}} proposal for a new Directive on public procurement by the European Commission and a new Dutch procurement law. This anticipatory research poses the question: To what extent is the <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> implementable in an economically viable manner? To answer this question the research analyses the aforementioned changing legislation. In addition, the current policy of Rijkswaterstaat is reviewed and a cross comparison with the new legislation is performed to see what policy adjustments must be made. The research finds several chances for improvement on the implementation of the <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> procedure. These chances are translated into scenarios and their effect is analyzed using a Multi Criteria Analysis. Finally, these effects are measured against cases where the <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> has already been implemented. The report concludes that the <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> procedure is economically viable under the current form of implementation by Rijkswaterstaat because it leads to the expected value on a project’s Critical Success Factors. When the new Dutch procurement law comes into effect the current form of implementation of the <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> procedure remains economically viable because very little policy adjustments are necessary. However, in both the current and upcoming legislation there is room for improving the cost-effectiveness of the procedure by limiting the gold-plating effect, this effect is the addition of burdens by national legislation or policy in contrast to the minimum demands stemming from European guidelines.

40|$|The PhD {{research}} {{is concerned with}} how EU procurement regulation impacts upon the procurement process for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. The process followed to award the contract and to set {{the terms of the}} agreement in the procurement of a PPP project (invariably highly sophisticated arrangements) is crucial for value for money. Prior to 2004 the process was regulated by EU legislation designed in the 1970 s, which failed to adequately cater for modem procurement methods, like PPPs. Thus new legislation in 2004 introduced a new procedure for these projects: <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue.</b> However, commentators have identified possible problems with <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> and there are numerous legal grey areas. The research examines {{the way in which the}} new legal framework for <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> is applied to PPPs in the UK, and actors' perceptions of the framework. It seeks to identify perceived positive aspects of <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> in facilitating best practice; perceived problems, including any legal uncertainty and constraints on best practice; strategies to conduct the process within the constraints; and the factors that influence compliance and approach to legal risk. The research adopts a socio-Iegal approach, combining analysis of the legal rules, with a study of the literature on theories of regulation and enforcement, and qualitative interviews with legal advisors, procurement officers, and policymakers.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{has a bad}} image. There seems a lack of quality in construction works {{at the time of}} delivery, and estimates of time and costs seem to be exceeded structurally, especially in public projects. Partially, {{this has to do with}} the increased complexity of construction projects. Therefore, procuring agencies and contractors feel the need to discuss all aspects of the project before closing a contract. Changes in pre-contractual negotiations were to decrease post-contractual renegotiations and to improve mutual commitment. With the <b>Competitive</b> <b>Dialogue</b> procedure, a public procurement method that was introduced in 2004, this need was met. Yet, the procedure is not proven effective. This dissertation addresses the question how inter-organisational negotiations and commitments are interrelated, and what the effect is of using the <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> procedure. Based on a survey, a multiple-case study and an in-depth single case study, the author shows that understanding is the most important determinant for the development of negotiations and commitments in inter-organisational projects. Investment in creation of mutual understanding in early stages of project negotiations is likely to prevent renegotiations in later stages. The <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> could have a positive influence on the creation of mutual understanding, yet the research shows how several mechanisms of the procedure are currently counterproductive in realising that.

40|$|The <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> {{procedure}} {{is a new}} public procurement award procedure first introduced by the Directive 2004118 for the tender of particularly complex contracts, when contracting authorities consider {{that the use of}} the open or restricted procedures do not allow for the contract to be tendered. It is not intended to be adopted freely as the open or restricted procedures, but contracting authorities may use it only when the need arises and specific grounds for its use are fulfilled. The procedure was introduced with the stated objective of increasing the flexibility of procurement, which had been already identified as a shortcoming of previous existing EU procurement framework. This thesis studies how the <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> has been implemented in Portugal and Spain.

40|$|Purpose – The <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> (CD) aims {{to align}} complex demands of {{principals}} with possible solutions that contractors have to offer. It is, however, unclear how {{formal and informal}} structures and processes in the CD are interrelated. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide insights in to the development of and the relationship between interaction processes during negotiations and commitments in terms of formal and informal contracts during a CD-procured project. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a case study of a complex construction project, an event-driven explanation is provided of the sequence in which a discrete set of critical events occur. Findings – Critical events show that problems of understanding are caused by differences between the formal legal and the informal psychological contract of one of the parties involved. During all phases of a project, the parties involved oscillate between negotiations and commitments, depending on whether there is understanding or not. Negotiations and commitments act as substitutes. The formal legal contract and the informal psychological contract are complementary. Practical implications – The <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> develops less promisingly than hoped for due to risk aversion actions by at least one of the parties involved.

40|$|In 2004 the <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> (CD) was {{introduced}} by the European Parliament and the Council. It was presented as a public sector procurement procedure for particularly complex contracts. The purpose of CD is to provide the public client with a flexible procedure to enable a discussion concerning {{all aspects of the}} contract with several contenders - to identify and define the means best suited to meeting its objectives - in an intervening stage between the tender announcement and the submission of final tenders. The discussions during the drafting of the CD procedure pivoted around transparent trust based collaboration, preserving fair competition and providing stimulus for innovation. This paper presents the first results of an evaluation study of 15 CD projects (partly still ongoing) in the realm of construction. The findings indicate that clients as well as contenders struggle with a number of practical issues related to the organisation of the dialogue. Furthermore, both struggle with the dynamics of risk avoidance pushing them towards detailing and high transaction costs. The research indicates that the <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> is an ambivalent procedure: both parties involved in the procedure balance between the wish to cooperate and the sensed need of keeping information to themselves because of competition. Nevertheless both see the potential of the CD procedure. Further research is needed to find out how the two principles of cooperation and competition during the CD procedure are related...|$|E

40|$|The <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> (CD) {{procurement}} procedure aims to structure and facilitate public-private interaction in procurement. In {{this article we}} examine the CD procedures of four complex Dutch road infrastructure projects and explore how the mix in public-private interaction between the three governance strategies of cooperation, competition, and coordination is conditioned by various external influences. We found that public authorities' strict legal coordination can structure the CD process, but may divert attention from the required interaction on project-specific complexities. Combined with private contractors' focus on competition, this does not stimulate public-private cooperation. We conclude that CD is a promising tool for facilitating public-private interaction, but, in practice, the optimal mix of governance strategies is not achieved. We recommend strengthening cooperation by encouraging public and private tender organizations to collaboratively search for opportunities to deal with complexity in planning. ...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{concerns}} regarding sustainability {{have led the}} construction sector to adopt various policy instruments for reducing the impacts caused by construction activities. One such policy instrument includes impact assessment, which enables the construction sector to evaluate the environmental consequences of proposed developments at project (environmental impact assessment) and strategic (strategic environmental assessment) level. In recent years, the construction sector has also adopted green public procurement, which is a process whereby contracting authorities aim to procure services and products that meet environmental requirements. In certain contexts, green public procurement has extended to sustainable public procurement, which involves the incorporation of both environmental and social considerations in the procurement of services and products. Promoting sustainability in the constructor sector is a significant challenge. This challenge is primarily due to the requirement of high levels of cooperation among project stakeholders, on the one hand, {{and a lack of}} coordination between project planning and implementation on the other hand. Therefore, procurement plays a significant role as it establishes the tone for the interaction between contracting authorities and contractors. The overall aim of this thesis is to bolster the knowledge of promoting sustainability in the construction sector, with the specific aim of analysing the ways in which policy instruments such as environmental impact assessment and green public procurement can be reinforced to improve the coordination between planning and the implementation of sustainability considerations. This thesis conceptualises an inter-link between impact assessment and green public procurement, and identifies the opportunities to develop the inter-link. It is appropriate to plan for green public procurement at the pre-decision phase of an environmental impact assessment. The inter-link can be strengthened by involving contractors in planning for green and sustainable public procurement. One way to involve contractors is with the aid of <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> procedure, which is a procurement procedure that allows contracting authorities to hold discussions with contractors regarding the authority’s requirements. This study strengthens the conceptualisation that <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> procedure can facilitate green and sustainable public procurement. The various elements in a <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> procedure can enable the contracting authorities to ensure the consistency between the weight for environmental considerations in contract award criteria and the relevant preferences. This thesis also discusses key concerns for progress towards sustainable public procurement, which includes among others the incorporation of sustainability values in procurement decisions. In addition, this study identified certain discourses on future trends for green and sustainable public procurement. The discourses provide an opportunity for reflection, and thereby indicate that analytical support is required to develop criteria in a way that enables the evaluation of sustainable public procurement against the background of sustainability and justice regarding natural capital. Innovation must be promoted with a focus on sustainability values. Moreover, green or sustainable public procurement must be discussed between contracting authorities and contractors in light of its contribution to sustainability. QC 20140509 </p...|$|E

40|$|DBFMO The {{past decade}} the Dutch {{government}} has increasingly employed DBFM(O) - contracts (Design-Build-Finance-Maintain-Operate) for {{the realization of}} major public works and buildings. In a DBFM(O) -contract the government specifies the output and service level for the service or the construction, puts the project from design to operation up for tender by private parties and pays a fee during the contractual period of up to 30 years for availability of the service to the winning consortium (Ministerie van Financiën (MoF), 2014). A DBFM(O) essentially delivers a service and seeks to provide better public service against lower life cycle costs. The 3 -C Governance model The tender phase of a DBFMO contract is dominated by a so-called <b>Competitive</b> <b>Dialogue.</b> In this <b>Competitive</b> <b>Dialogue</b> shortlisted tenderers {{compete with each other}} to design a construction that best suits the output specifications of the client. A model proposed for understanding the mechanisms in the <b>Competitive</b> <b>Dialogue</b> phase of the DBFM(O) contracting process, is the Competition, Cooperation and Coordination-model (3 C or CCC-model) (Lenferink et al, 2013). Lenferink relates three governance strategies to this model: competition to the market model, cooperation to the network model, and coordination to the hierarchical model (Lenferink, 2013). The CCC-model is attractive, because a governance mix of cooperation, competition and coordination seems to adequately suit all phases of a DBFM(O) and holds the promise to leave room for adapting the mix according to the characteristics of the separate DBFM(O) stages. The aim {{of this study is to}} research whether the CCC-governance model can be employed in a wider context than the DBFM(O) Design phase, viz, in the Maintain & Operate-phase (M&O) of both Building and Infrastructural projects. The research question then is: What is governance with the CCC-model in the (DBF-) M&O phase? Methodology Lenferink uses a constructivist approach for his research and formulates the results ex post. In this research the question is whether the findings can be corroborated in other phases and contexts and has a more positivist approach. On basis of literature, propositions will be formulated, which will be tested in a case study of Dutch DBFMO contracts. The empirical research will have an explorative nature and a qualitative methodological framework, in which the Dutch DBFM(O) contracts are the research domain, the individual actor at client or constructor’s side is the unit of analysis and data will be collected in semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Governance with the 3 -C model Lenferink uses four groups of complexities for describing the CD-phase, viz Organizational Issues; Technical complexity; Financial complexity. Combining the four complexities with the 3 -C governance framework results in hypotheses over the governance structure in the Maintain and Operate phase. Results In general Cooperation appears by far the preferred governance strategy in the M&O phase. The 3 -C model describes and explains mechanisms for both CD and M&O, but at the same time is too broad in scope for application in the M&O only. Additional complexity factors suggested by the interviewed (project context; operational availability; Innovation) appear on scrutiny to be covered in the existing four groups already. Learning however is an aspect that is present everywhere and should have been included in the research. It is suggested that future studies might look into learning, the relation between governance and complexity and the mechanisms of cooperation...|$|E

In most of the events observed, aspects of the project context are behind the development of problems of understanding. Practical implications – Negotiations develop in either positive or negative cycles. If managers of both the procuring authorities and the contractors are aware of these cycles, they might be able to influence and use them to their mutual benefit. Originality/value – By studying the dynamics in interaction processes between principal and contractor during the procurement stage obstacles and preconditions for an effective CD are show...|$|E
40|$|The European public {{procurement}} regulation {{has been described}} as a restrictive force on PPP projects, especially in countries which employ a strict interpretation of the directives. One major limitation brought forward has been the restrictions on negotiations during the procurement procedure. In the literature it has been suggested that the negotiation would improve PPP performance because it allows for a clarification of the contract and enables alignment of the parties’ goals. Two propositions are used to examine if the regulations are a hindrance to PPP performance by comparing the current doctrine and European case law on {{public procurement}} to those two propositions. The perspectives are the regulation of the different procedures available in the directives: <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue,</b> the negotiated procedure, and the open and restricted procedures and the possibility of early involvement before the formal procedure has begun. The conclusion is that, while the directives limit the procuring authorities’ abilities to exchange information and negotiate provisions, the information which need to be transferred, and negotiations which needs to be conducted, can in most cases be carried out within the current procurement framework. Thus, the public procurement legislation does not present any substantial limitations on PPP performance...|$|E
40|$|After a {{parliamentary}} enquiry into construction industry malpractice, changes occurred in collaborative practices between clients and contractors in megaprojects within the Dutch construction sector. The enquiry meant that both clients and contractors {{were forced to}} acknowledge illegal practices of collusion and fraud. For those engaged in public-private relationships, a process followed of attempting to change collaborative practices. Three interventions in collaborative practices are recounted: (1) organizing personal networks between clients and contractors; (2) a <b>competitive</b> <b>dialogue</b> procedure; and (3) the right of withdrawal. These three interventions helped to change first order practice, such as increasing mutual trust between client and contractor, supporting a mutual understanding of role positioning and dilemmas, and creating {{an understanding of the}} nature of the conflict but failed to change second order practices. Two contributions to the understanding of project management are provided. New empirical data are presented on the challenges that public and private partners face in their attempt to implement new collaborative practices. It is shown how power is entangled in the emerging of new collaborative practices. The findings are based on a longitudinal ethnographic study of public-private collaboration in the Dutch construction industry in the period 2006 - 11. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|E
