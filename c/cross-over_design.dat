40|$|<b>Cross-over</b> <b>designs</b> {{balanced}} {{for simple}} carry-over effects are commonly applied in clinical studies for {{the comparison of}} treatments for chronic conditions such as hypertension or asthma. Uniform-balanced <b>cross-over</b> <b>designs</b> have the desirable property that the treatment sequences are arranged so that, in the full design, each treatment is followed by every other treatment equally often. Such designs for an even number of treatments and {{the same number of}} sequences and periods are readily constructed using suitable cyclic Latin squares. For an odd number of treatments, pairs of squares may be combined to give uniform-balanced designs. Recently, computer search techniques have been used to find nearly-balanced Latin squares which may be combined in pairs or in sets of three to produce designs with the overall properties of uniformity and balance.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionIn this study, {{a serial}} day rapid {{kindling}} protocol {{was used to}} fully kindle rats {{in a matter of}} days. Subsequently, the anticonvulsant profile of a relatively new anti-epileptic drug, topiramate, was evaluated in a <b>cross-over</b> <b>design</b> to further validate this rapid kindling model. MethodsRats were kindled during three consecutive days, according to the serial day rapid kindling protocol. Topiramate was tested at a dose of 100 mg/kg, i. p., over the next 2 days using a <b>cross-over</b> <b>design.</b> The stability of the kindled state was evaluated in all rats during two retest paradigms. During the drug-testing procedure, rats received a single i. p. injection of either topiramate or verhicle. Starting 1 h later the rats received additional kindling stimulations during which their response was measured. ResultsSerial day rapid kindling induced a long lasting and stable fully kindled state that allowed for the anti-epileptic drug screening procedure. Topiramate reduced both the afterdischarge duration and ameliorated seizure semiology in the kindled rats. DiscussionSerial day rapid kindling provided a tool to rapidly kindle rats in 3 days. Using a <b>cross-over</b> <b>design,</b> clear indications on anti-epileptic activity of a given drug can be determined using few laboratory animals...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, as more {{generic drug}} {{products}} become available, it {{is a concern}} not only whether generic drug products that have been approved based on the regulation of average bioequivalence {{will have the same}} quality, safety and e 9 cacy as that of the brand-name drug product, but also whether the approved generic drug products can be used interchangeably. In its recent draft guidance, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that individual bioequivalence (IBE) be assessed using the method proposed by Hyslop, Hsuan, and Holder to address drug switchability. The FDA suggests that a 2 × 4 <b>cross-over</b> <b>design</b> be considered for assessment of IBE, while a 2 × 3 <b>cross-over</b> <b>design</b> may be used as an alternative design to reduce the length and cost of the study. Little or no information regarding the statistical procedures under 2 × 3 cross-over designs is discussed in the guidance. In this paper, a detailed statistical procedure for assessment of IBE under 2 × 3 cross-over designs is derived. The main purpose of this paper, however, is to derive an IBE test under an alternative 2 × 3 design and show that the resulting IBE test is better than that under a 2 × 3 <b>cross-over</b> <b>design</b> and is comparable to or even better than that under a 2 × 4 <b>cross-over</b> <b>design.</b> Our conclusions are supported by theoretical considerations and empirical results. Furthermore, a method of determining the sample sizes required for IBE tests to reach a given level of power is proposed. Copyright? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|Many people regard {{infertility}} as an unsuitable {{condition in}} which to run <b>cross-over</b> <b>designs.</b> Because if treatments are successful, then some women will become pregnant {{in the first period}} of treatment and if they become pregnant in the first period they are very unlikely to be treated in the second period. If data from only one period are available, then it will not be possible to perform the within-patient comparison. Hence, it could be argued, such designs are inherently unsuitable since they have a built-in tendency to produce missing data. To sum up this point of view, <b>cross-over</b> <b>designs</b> in infertility are likely to produce fewer data than one would wish and should be avoided. We see things differently, however. Suppose a parallel design is employed. If a couple is entered onto a parallel group design in infertility, they will have been allocated to one or the other treatment only. If the woman fails to achieve pregnancy, having been given that treatment, what could then be more natural than to offer the couple the chance of trying another? If another treatment is tried, then will it not be appropriate to record the outcome? Hence, in the wors...|$|R

40|$|A {{mixed model}} {{approach}} {{is used to}} construct optimal <b>cross-over</b> <b>designs.</b> In a <b>cross-over</b> experiment the same subject is tested {{at different points in}} time. Consider as an example an experiment to investigate the influence of physical attributes of the work environment such as luminance, ambient temperature and relative humidity on human performance of acceptance inspection in quality assurance. In a mixed model context, the subject effects are assumed to be independent and normally distributed. Besides the induction of correlated observations within the same inspector, the mixed model approach also enables one to specify the covariance structure of the inspection data. Here, several covariance structures are considered either depending on the time variable or not. Unfortunately, a serious drawback of the inspection experiment is that the results may be influenced by an unknown time trend because of inspector fatigue due to monotony of the inspection task. In other circumstances, time trend effects can be caused by learning effects of the test subjects in behavioural and life sciences, heating or aging of material in prototype experiments, etc. An algorithm is presented to construct <b>cross-over</b> <b>designs</b> that are optimally balanced for time trend effects. The costs for using the subjects and for altering the factor levels between consecutive observations can also be taken into account.
