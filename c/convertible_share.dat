40|$|Multidimensional {{data sets}} often include {{categorical}} information. When most columns have categorical information, clustering {{the data set}} by similarity of categorical values can reveal interesting patterns in the data set. However, when the data set includes {{only a small number}} (one or two) of categorical columns, the categorical information is probably more useful as a way to partition the data set. For example, researchers might be interested in gene expression data for healthy vs. diseased patients or stock performance for common, preferred, or <b>convertible</b> <b>shares.</b> For these cases, we present a novel way to utilize the categorical information together with clustering algorithms. Instead of incorporating categorical information into the clustering process, we can partition the data set according to categorical information.

40|$|This paper uses {{in-depth}} interviews with Finance Directors from UK firms that have recently issued <b>convertible</b> preference <b>shares.</b> The study examines the particular circumstances {{that were taken}} into account into the decision to issue <b>convertible</b> preference <b>shares</b> rather than the more common instruments of pure debt or pure equity. The paper relates {{the findings from the}} interviews to three theories that have been suggested for the issuance of preference shares. These theories are Pecking Order, Taxation and Financial Distress. Pecking Order is a general capital structure theory and the Taxation and Financial Distress theories have been developed from the general static trade off theory for capital structure. This paper examines whether “local ” decision making for specific instruments can be related to global generalisations for capital structure theories. The comments from the interviews suggest that global capital structure theories for the use of pure debt and pure equity are not {{a major factor in the}} decision to issue convertibl...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} bonds convertible to raw materials {{in the context of}} ordinary bonds and bonds <b>convertible</b> to <b>shares.</b> The author of the publication decided to explore what kind of benefits an enterprise issuing bonds and a bondholder would receive as exemplified by a hypothetical investment, using various (aforementioned) sources of foreign capital. The article is composed of four parts. The introduction hereto outlines some general assumptions and the purpose of the study. The second part of the article includes the assumptions for the aforementioned comparative analysis. It was suggested that since such variables as the price of raw materials, shares and operating costs of a company are difficult to determine, they should be distributed so that on the basis thereof the final NPV may be established by applying the Monte Carlo method. The third part of the study focuses on the examination (comparison) of the bonds convertible to raw materials in the context of ordinary bonds and bonds <b>convertible</b> to <b>shares.</b> The result of such an analysis is the NPV histogram for particular sources of financing, a probability distribution defining the probability of occurring individual NPV values.

40|$|M. Comm. In {{the case}} of share {{purchase}} schemes, the employer assists the employee to buy shares through a trust. If the interest on the loan is at a rate lower than the standard rate for tax purposes, the employee will be taxed on {{the difference between the}} standard and actual rate charged. An alternative for buying ordinary shares is to buy <b>convertible</b> preference <b>shares</b> in the Company. A scheme involving convertible debentures has the same basic principles as <b>convertible</b> preference <b>shares,</b> but the South African Revenue Services might use section 8 A of the Act as it seems as if only a right to ordinary shares is offered to the employee. If the company does not have the means to administrate any of the schemes summarised above, they can make use of a phantom share scheme. With this scheme there is no actual buying or selling of shares, but "bonuses" are calculated with reference to the movement in the share price. These incentives are treated as normal bonuses for tax purposes {{in the hands of the}} employer and employee. To provide the employees with a tax effective scheme is just as important as providing a share incentive scheme. Companies, therefore, have to consider all the schemes available and the tax implications before implementing a share incentive scheme...|$|R
