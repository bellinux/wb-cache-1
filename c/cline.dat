5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but <b>Cline</b> received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, <b>Cline</b> made the decision that Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E
5|$|Between the Times and the Tides is {{the ninth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock musician Lee Ranaldo, released on March 20, 2012on Matador Records. His first release on Matador Records and since Sonic Youth's indefinite hiatus, the album features a more straightforward songwriting approach to his prior material and includes guest musicians such as Nels <b>Cline,</b> John Medeski and Leah Singer. The album was {{originally intended to}} be a minimalist acoustic album but its sound was developed by Ranaldo during its recording at Echo Canyon West in Hoboken, New Jersey during a seven-month period in early 2011.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{lost its}} second preseason game, played against the Baltimore Colts in 100-degree heat in Toledo, Ohio. Browns placekicker Lou Groza opened the scoring with an 18-yard field {{goal in the}} first quarter, and a {{touchdown}} by fullback Ollie <b>Cline</b> later in the period put the Browns up 10–0. Baltimore responded {{in the second quarter}} with a touchdown pass by quarterback Y. A. Tittle to receiver Jake Leicht. <b>Cline</b> ran for another touchdown soon thereafter, however, once more giving the Browns a 10-point lead. Colts receiver Lamar Davis caught a 25-yard touchdown pass {{at the end of the}} second quarter. Cleveland led 17–14 at halftime. Neither team scored again until the fourth quarter, when Baltimore's Bus Mertes ran for a 38-yard touchdown and secured the 21–17 win. A number of Cleveland players suffered injuries during the game. Graham hurt his hand, Motley strained his back and end Dante Lavelli suffered a broken leg. Lavelli's injury sidelined him for the first seven games of the regular season. During the game, Baltimore players Hub Bechtol and Lew Mayne, a former Brown, tapped a phone line that went from Cleveland's press box to its sideline. This allowed the Colts to listen in on coaches' conversations and anticipate the Browns' play-calling.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cline's</b> Church of the United Brethren in Christ, {{also known}} as <b>Cline's</b> United Methodist Church, is a {{historic}} Brethren church on <b>Cline's</b> Church Road, 0.5 miles south of PA 34 at Menallen Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1850, and is a one-story, plain rectangular limestone building with a low gable roof. It measures 35 feet wide and 46 feet deep. The interior is a single room with white plastered walls and ceiling. Located adjacent to the church is the <b>Cline's</b> Cemetery, with grave markers dated from the mid-1800s to the present.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{airplane}} crash that ended <b>Cline's</b> life, her version was never released on a studio album.

5|$|Kicking Television: Live in Chicago is a live album by Chicago {{alternative}} {{rock band}} Wilco, released on November 15, 2005 by Nonesuch Records. The album consists of material from four live shows at Chicago's Vic Theater recorded May 4, 2005 to May 7, 2005. Although the band filmed the concerts, they {{decided not to}} release the footage as a DVD. It was the band's first album with an expanded lineup featuring Nels <b>Cline</b> and Pat Sansone.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of A Ghost Is Born, Wilco's fifth studio album, multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band to pursue a career in theater production. To replace him, the band added jazz rock guitarist Nels <b>Cline</b> and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to their lineup. The lineup was {{expanded}} because lead singer Jeff Tweedy was concerned that the other members were multi-tasking on instruments. This made performing material live from Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot difficult. While touring in support of Ghost, Wilco decided to record their first live album.|$|E
50|$|Recording began November 16, 1960 at the Bradley Film and Recording Studios in Nashville, Tennessee {{over five}} {{sessions}}, ending August 25, 1961.

The recordings teamed her up with The Jordanaires, who recorded also on <b>Cline's</b> 1962 album on Decca. Legendary country producer Owen Bradley produced the album. Bradley helped smooth <b>Cline's</b> sound to develop her own style of the Nashville sound.|$|R
5000|$|The AllMusic review states [...] "Percussionist Alex <b>Cline's</b> {{first album}} as a {{composer}} demonstrates, {{right out of}} the gate, the man's knack for conjuring timeless, elemental music.

40|$|Two {{mechanisms}} are commonly invoked to explain geographic gradients in gene frequencies (<b>clines)</b> : gene flow and natural selection. Thus gene frequency <b>clines</b> in Europe {{have been attributed}} to gene flow because expanding Neolithic farmers from the Near East spread and absorbed resident foragers, a process Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues labeled demic diffusion. Alternatively, gradients in natural selection can produce the same genetic pattern. A third mechanism to explain European <b>clines</b> has recently been proposed by Barbujani et al. (1995). They found that European allele frequencies were consistent with distributions generated by a simple model of total replacement of foragers by expanding farmers. <b>Clines</b> were produced by repeated founder effects in colonizing farmer groups. Here, I present a simulation model using different population parameters to test the generality of the Barbujani model. Results of the simulation show that steep <b>clines</b> (measured by spatial autocorrelation statistics) can be produced by kin-structured founder effects. The implication of these findings is that several genetic {{mechanisms are}} consistent with the allele distributions in Europe. To discriminate among these alternatives, other information, such as better archeological and demographic characterization of interactions between farmers and foragers, is required. In any case, the mere presence of genetic <b>clines</b> does not necessarily validate the demic diffusion model...|$|R

5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Results May Vary track listing, Page Hamilton of Helmet and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer recorded songs with Limp Bizkit for the album; Al Jourgensen of Ministry also joined the band in the studio. Jourgensen claims that he convinced Fred Durst to strip naked and wear a cowboy hat while singing. The contributions of all three were omitted from the finished album. Bubba Sparxxx joined Durst in a Los Angeles studio, but his contributions also {{did not make the}} album. Durst wrote over 30 songs with Limp Bizkit drummer John Otto and the band's bassist, Sam Rivers. During production of Results May Vary, Durst listened to the Cure, Patsy <b>Cline,</b> Mazzy Star and classical music.|$|E

5|$|The {{rebirth of}} {{professional}} box lacrosse in the United States came on March 13, 1986, with {{the formation of}} the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League, which was incorporated by Russ <b>Cline</b> and Chris Fritz. The league originated with four teams: the Philadelphia Wings, New Jersey Saints, Washington Wave, and Baltimore Thunder, and unlike box lacrosse generally, was played during the winter. The league rebranded itself as the Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL) immediately after its second season, and in 1998 renamed itself again, this time to the NLL. In 1998, the NLL entered into the Canadian market {{for the first time with}} the Ontario Raiders. Although 5 of the league's 9 teams are based in American cities, more than two-thirds of the players are Canadian.|$|E
5|$|Wilco began touring {{in support}} of Ghost even before the album had been released. Multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band after the {{recording}} sessions to join a theater production, so Wilco added jazz rock guitarist Nels <b>Cline</b> and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone to replace him. Sansone had been playing with The Autumn Defense, a side project led by bassist John Stirratt. However, the tour to support the album had to be abridged. In May 2004, Tweedy checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago, Illinois due to chronic migraine headaches, anxiety attacks, and clinical depression. In the process of treating the ailments, Tweedy became addicted to prescription painkillers. His rehab led to the cancellation of the European stage of the tour and a delay in the album's release date. Intended for release on June 8, 2004, the album was officially released on June 22, 2004.|$|E
5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. <b>Cline</b> was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E
