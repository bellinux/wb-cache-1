50|$|The {{revisions}} to the UniSite main board were done to support a new option. Data I/O created the Mass Storage Module (MSM). This consisted of an additional circuit board containing a miniature hard disk drive (either a 2.5 inch PATA/IDE device or a PCMCIA Type III <b>card</b> <b>drive,</b> depending on revision level) and appropriate interface circuitry. All the programmer's operating software and device algorithms could {{be transferred to the}} MSM's drive in less than a half-hour, obsoleting floppy diskettes.|$|E
50|$|In practice, the USB {{drive is}} a {{standard}} mass storage device, so it will also work on any modern operating system which can use such devices, including Windows XP, Vista and 7, Mac OS X and Linux. The PC <b>card</b> <b>drive,</b> similarly, {{is a standard}} removable ATA device, so it also will typically function without any problems on modern operating systems including Windows XP. The problem on the latest operating systems is unavailability or incompatibility of the software used to operate the proprietary features of the drive, such as low-level formatting and the software write protection.|$|E

5000|$|A {{flurry of}} student {{initiated}} organizing activity {{took place at}} private universities {{in the wake of}} the 2000 NLRB decision. [...] By the end of 2001 there were active recognition campaigns taking place at many Ivy League schools, including UPenn. The Penn campaign started when a diverse group of graduate students began meeting in the fall of 2000 to discuss concerns related to their employment status. A group formed at UPenn and chose the name GET-UP. A vote was taken by the students and the decision was made to affiliate with the American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO. The new union began a certification <b>card</b> <b>drive,</b> and on December 27, 2001 GET-UP filed a petition to the NLRB for a union authorization election. A certification election was scheduled for February 26, 2003; however, the National Labor Relations Board overturned the decision to allow graduate students to unionize before the votes could be counted.|$|E

50|$|At this point, {{the master}} has {{gained access to}} the bus. To write data, the <b>card</b> <b>drives</b> an address, an address {{modifier}} and data onto the bus. It then drives the address strobe line and the two data strobe lines low, to indicate the data is ready, and drives the write pin to indicate the transfer direction. There are two data strobes and an *LWORD line, so the cards can indicate if the data width is 8, 16, or 32 bits (or 64 in VME64). The card at the bus address reads the data and pulls the data transfer acknowledge low line when the transfer can complete. If the transfer cannot complete, it can pull the bus error line low. Reading data {{is essentially the same}} but the controlling <b>card</b> <b>drives</b> the address bus, leaves the data bus tri-stated and drives the read pin. The slave <b>card</b> <b>drives</b> read data onto the data bus and drives the data strobe pins low when the data is ready. The signalling scheme is asynchronous, meaning that the transfer is not tied to the timing of a bus clock pin (unlike synchronous buses such as PCI).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} couple of years, several European {{countries}} have started projects which intend to provide their citizens with electronic identity <b>cards,</b> <b>driven</b> by the European Directive on Electronic Signatures. One can expect that within a few years, these smart cards will be used {{in a wide variety of}} applications. In this paper, we describe the common threats that can be identified when using security tokens such as smart cards in web applications. We illustrate each of these threats with a few attack scenarios. This paper is part of a series of papers, written by several academic teams. Each paper focuses on one particular technological building block for web applications. Key words: Smart card applications, security, threat modeling 1...|$|R
40|$|Computer Security System / {{technology}} {{have passed through}} several changes. The trends have been from what you know (e. g. password, PIN, etc) to what you have (ATM <b>card,</b> <b>Driving</b> License, etc) and presently to who you are (Biometry) or combinations {{of two or more}} of the trios. This technology (biometry) has come to solve the problems identified with knowledge-based and token-based authentication systems. It is possible to forget your password and what you have can as well be stolen. The security of determining who you are is referred to as BIOMETRIC. Biometric, in a nutshell, is the use of your body as password.

25|$|The {{most recent}} {{of the major}} types of board wargame, it {{was created by the}} game We the People {{published}} by Avalon Hill in 1994. In most aspects it is much like a typical board wargame (on the simpler side of the spectrum), but play is driven by a deck of cards that both players draw from. These cards control activation points, which allow the use of troops, as well as events that represent things outside the normal scope of the game. Newer <b>card</b> <b>driven</b> games have helped reinvigorate the war game genre as well as other differently themed games. Twilight Struggle, a game based on the Cold War, was ranked #1 on the website BoardGameGeek from December 2010 to January 2016. As of April 2017, it's ranked third.|$|R

This data acquisition system is designed to acquire and then records the signals from the different sensors that are used for measuring the different parameters of the PV system. These measurements of the different parameter include the incident solar radiation on the PV module, PV module surface temperature, load voltage, and load current.

5000|$|To simplify this task, {{a compass}} <b>card</b> <b>driven</b> by the aircraft's {{magnetic}} compass {{is added to}} the RBI to form a [...] "Radio Magnetic Indicator" [...] (RMI). The ADF needle is then referenced immediately to the aircraft's magnetic heading, which reduces the necessity for mental calculation. Many RMIs used for aviation also allow the device to display information from a second radio tuned to a VOR station; the aircraft can then fly directly between VOR stations (so-called [...] "Victor" [...] routes) while using the NDBs to triangulate their position along the radial, without the need for the VOR station to have a collocated DME. This display, along with the [...] "Omni Bearing Indicator" [...] for VOR/ILS information, was one of the primary radionavigation instruments prior to the introduction of the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) and subsequent digital displays used in glass cockpits.|$|R
