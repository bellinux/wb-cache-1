Multiple-description (MD) coding is a technique used to mitigate <b>channel</b> <b>failure</b> when retransmission is expensive or impossible. Multiple descriptions lattice vector quantization has become a popular choice for robust data transmission over unreliable network channels. In this paper, a new generic MD video coding scheme is proposed {{that is based on}} coinciding similar sublattices of the hexagonal lattice. The proposed video coding scheme has been exploited to form new MD video coding schemes: MDCLVQ-H. 264 /AVC and MDCLVQ-Motion JPEG 2000. The experimental results for several reference videos show that the encoding performance of the scheme improves, while the quality of the videos in terms of PSNR of the central decoder remains acceptable. Thus, the error resiliency of the scheme improves without a significant drop in the quality of the reconstruction...|$|E

The considered environment is Long Term Evolution (LTE) for Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) with sleeping cell caused by random access <b>channel</b> <b>failure.</b> Sleeping cell problem means unavailability of network service without triggered alarm. The proposed detection framework uses N-gram analysis for identification of abnormal behavior in sequences of network events.
