50|$|While {{a student}} at Hunter College, Guyton counted Robert Morris among his teachers. Guyton first {{got a job at}} St. Mark's Bookshop in the East Village and then worked at Dia:Chelsea as a guard.

50|$|Many renters {{have been}} evicted from their homes, often without notice, {{following}} foreclosures because their landlords had defaulted on loans. According to a January 2008 {{study by the}} Mortgage Bankers Association, {{one out of every}} seven Maryland homes that lenders began foreclosure proceedings on the preceding summer was not occupied by the owner. Foreclosure voids any lease agreement, and renters have no legal right to <b>continue</b> <b>renting.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} wage-hours contracts {{within a}} four-period rent sharing model that incorporates asymmetric information. Distinctions are made among (a) an investment period, (b) {{a period in}} which the parties may separate (quits or layoffs) or <b>continue</b> <b>rent</b> accumulation and sharing, (c) a post investment period and, (d) retirement. We establish that increases in both wage rates and hours of work in the post-investment period serve to minimise sub-optimal separations and, moreover that both wage and hours schedules are concave. Testing is based on 13 waves of British Household Panel Survey from 1991 to 2003...|$|R

40|$|Federal {{ownership}} {{and management of the}} public lands have created a rent-seeking frenzy, inflated rhetoric, wasted resources, and squandered investment opportunities. The primary commodity user groups, grazers and timber harvesters, have declined in importance whereas conservationists and recreationists have gained. Still, historical use preferences and <b>continued</b> <b>rent</b> seeking have produced use entitlements that seem impervious to changing costs and demands and thus result in large wealth losses to consumers and taxpayers. Privatization of the public lands is probably politically infeasible, but simulated market processes can be used to replace political allocations and improve efficiency. Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
50|$|In 1923, River {{moved to}} a new stadium in the Recoleta {{district}} of Buenos Aires. The stadium was placed in Alvear avenue and Tagle. River had previously signed a contract with the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway, owners of the land, for a term of 5 years. It stipulated a monthly rent of $ 500. The club <b>continued</b> <b>renting</b> the land through successive contracts until 1935 when River Plate signed the last for a term of 2 years. The amount had increased to $3.500 by then. Architects Bernardo Messina and Juan Vaggo led the construction of the stadium. The club would play its home games in Alvear y Tagle until 1938.|$|R

2500|$|Originally, the Wallowa County {{government}} rented {{office space}} {{on the second floor}} of a building on Main Street in Enterprise.

[...] Local citizens contribute $5,000 for construction of the courthouse, but refused to pay until construction reached the second story, ensuring that the courthouse would actually be built as promised by county officials. [...] The contributors also insisted that the total cost of the courthouse be at least $25,000 to ensure the structure would be a well-built landmark for the community.|$|R

The Schnorbach <b>continued</b> <b>renting</b> the house until 19230, when they purchased it from Smith. Philip Schnorbach died in 1945, and his wife continued to live there until 1956. In 1961, the housewas sold to Mrs. Alice M. Hunt Catlow, who sold it to her brother-in-law, John Noud Kelly, in 1963. Kelly lived in the house until 1994.

50|$|A full taking, however, extinguishes the lease, and excuses all rent {{from that}} point. The tenant {{will not be}} {{entitled}} to any portion of the condemnation award, unless {{the value of the}} lease was greater than the rent paid, in which case the tenant can recover the difference. Suppose in the above example that the market value of the land being leased was actually 1,200 a month, but the 1,000 per month rate represented a break given to the tenant by the landlord. Because the tenant is losing the ability to <b>continue</b> <b>renting</b> the land at this bargain rate (and probably must move to more expensive land), the tenant will be entitled to the difference between the lease rate and the market value200 per month for a total of 800.|$|R
50|$|After the U.S. Civil War, the Blair's Ferry Storehouse {{came into}} the {{possession}} of a local merchant named John West, who continued {{to use it as}} a general store. After West's death in 1883, the storehouse changed hands several times over subsequent decades. It was variously used as a dance hall, packing house, and as a temporary church. In the early 1900s, the second story was partitioned and modified for use as residential apartments. A grocer named W.B. Arp purchased the storehouse in the 1930s, and while he used the storehouse for a grocery store, he <b>continued</b> <b>renting</b> out the second story as a residence. Arp added the rear and side porches, and converted the basement into a residential apartment. A grocery store operated out of the first floor of the storehouse until the 1980s.|$|R

She continued scheming by telling Andy Sugden to evict Katie and Perdy from Butler's Farm. She called him in, telling him under his tenancy agreement, he could not sublet any part of the farm if he wanted to <b>continue</b> <b>renting</b> it. Andy told Katie and Perdy {{that they would have to}} find new premises and Rosemary told them they could use the stables at Home Farm in exchange for a 10% stake in the business. Perdy was furious at Rosemary muscling in but Katie was thrilled, seeing it as a chance to move up in the world.|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{a housing}} market with an {{existing}} tenant in each house {{and where the}} existing tenants initially rent their houses. The idea is to identify equilibrium prices for the housing market given the prerequisite that a tenant can buy any house on the housing market, including the one that he currently is possessing, or <b>continue</b> <b>renting</b> the house he currently is occupying. The main contribution is the identification of an individually rational, equilibrium selecting, and group non-manipulable price mechanism in a restricted preference domain that contains almost all preference profiles. In this restricted domain, the identified mechanism is the equilibrium selecting mechanism that transfers {{the maximum number of}} ownerships to the existing tenants. We also argue that the theoretical model represents an extension and an improvement of the U. K. Housing Act 1980 whose main objective is to transfer the ownership of the houses to the existing tenants...|$|R
