The study adopted longitudinal explanatory non-experimental research design applied to dynamic panel ARDL framework in analyzing the data. The results revealed that the <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> investment and financing policies have highly significant positive effects on returns to equity holders in the long-run. The empirical evidence suggests that conservative <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> investment policies increase firms return while conservative financing policies yields negative returns. The study therefore would enable finance managers to be able to fashion out the appropriate working capital management policies. A firm pursuing conservative <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> investment policy should balance it with aggressive <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> financing policy in order to enhance profitability and create value for their investors...|$|R

Though Studebaker's production and sales had been booming, the market collapsed and plans were laid for a new, small, low-cost car—the Rockne. However, times were too bad to sell even inexpensive cars. Within a year, the firm was cutting wages and laying off workers. Erskine maintained faith in the Rockne and rashly had the directors declare huge dividends in 1930 and 1931. He also acquired 95% of the White Motor Company's stock at an inflated price and in cash. By 1933, the banks were owed $6 million, though <b>current</b> <b>assets</b> exceeded that figure. On March 18, 1933, Studebaker entered receivership.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to empirically test one of Graham’s investment methods based on the net <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> value (NCAV). The NCAV is truly unique, and conservative, and commonly known as the net-net method.   The ratio of the net <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> value to market value (NCAV/MV) was employed in this study to test a stock’s performance comparing to the performance of S&P 500 as the market index. We used all stocks in Portfolio 123 whose raw data were supplied by Compustat, Standard & Poors, Capital IQ, and Reuters for the period of January 2, 1999 to August 31, 2012. The overall results show that the firms with high net <b>current</b> <b>asset</b> values outperform the market. These results are strong in the up market. It can be argued that the firms with a high NCAV/MV ratio are likely to move toward their fundamental value and generate high excess return because its stock prices are now undervalued. The implications of the study are: (a) a positive NCAV/MV ratio may be a good indicator of the underpriced security; (b) investing in the growth period and avoiding the downturn period leads investors to earn much higher returns from the firms with a high NCAV/MV ratio; and (c) The NCAV/MV strategy requires a longer holding period of the portfolio in order to generate excess returns...|$|R
