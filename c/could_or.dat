5|$|Before {{the start}} of the formal {{administration}} of Toraja villages by the Tana Toraja Regency, each Toraja village was autonomous. In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group; sometimes, villages would unite against other villages. Relationship between families was expressed through blood, marriage, and shared ancestral houses (tongkonan), practically signed by the exchange of water buffalo and pigs on ritual occasions. Such exchanges not only built political and cultural ties between families but defined each person's place in a social hierarchy: who poured palm wine, who wrapped a corpse and prepared offerings, where each person <b>could</b> <b>or</b> could not sit, what dishes should be used or avoided, and even what piece of meat constituted one's share.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the first}} months of the Second World War Norwegian {{neutrality}} was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February Altmark Incident in Jøssingfjorden. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the warring parties to the impression that Norway <b>could</b> <b>or</b> would not effectively protect her neutrality. Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E

25|$|The {{scope of}} the {{guarantee}} - whether it <b>could,</b> <b>or</b> should, have been limited or broad - was examined by an Oireachtas committee in 2010.

25|$|The Assyrian army's {{hierarchy}} {{was typical}} of the Mesopotamian armies at the time. The King whose rule was sanctioned by the gods, would be the commander of the entire army of the Empire.

25|$|If-then {{arguments}} posit logical sequences {{that sometimes}} include objects of the mind. For example, a counterfactual argument proposes a hypothetical or subjunctive possibility which <b>could</b> <b>or</b> would be true, but {{might not be}} false. Conditional sequences involving subjunctives use intensional language, which is studied by modal logic, whereas classical logic studies the extensional language of necessary and sufficient conditions.|$|E
25|$|Before Oshawa {{joined the}} OHA in 1908, {{it was part}} of the Midland Hockey League. Its games were played out of the Oshawa Curling Club located by the Oshawa Creek in the {{vicinity}} of present-day Valleyview Gardens, Kinsmen Stadium and Children's Arena. Since the curling club controlled its use and thus when games <b>could</b> <b>or</b> could not be played, a new location was sought.|$|E
25|$|The ministeriales {{were not}} legally free people, but held social rank. Legally, their liege lord {{determined}} whom they <b>could</b> <b>or</b> could not marry, {{and they were}} not able to transfer their lords' properties to heirs or spouses. They were, however, considered members of the nobility since that was a social designation, not a legal one. Ministeriales were trained knights, held military responsibilities and surrounded themselves with the trappings of knighthood, and so were accepted as noblemen.|$|E

She acted as mediator in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–79) between the German states of Prussia and Austria. In 1780, she established a League of Armed Neutrality, designed to defend neutral shipping from the British Royal Navy during the American Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The first metro proposal, from 2009, {{called for}} the line to be built as {{a branch of the}} Kolsås Line from Ullernåsen. Except for a short portion at the {{southern}} end, the entire line was proposed in a tunnel. After Ullernåsen the line would have only three stations, Lysaker, Telenor Arena and Fornebu Senter. However, additional stations were considered. Eight hourly services were proposed, which <b>could</b> <b>or</b> could not continue from Majorstuen through the Common Tunnel. Further plans called for an upgrade to allow a fly-over at Makrellbekken, on the Røa Line.|$|E

He firmly supported the actions undertaken by the U.S. and its allies in Afghanistan and Iraq, taking much criticism from the Icelandic Left. Since {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, there has been some uncertainty about whether the United States defence force <b>could</b> <b>or</b> should remain in Iceland, having been invited there in 1951, {{at the height of the}} Cold War. Davíð has not been enthusiastic about joining the European Union.|$|E

25|$|The medical treatises of Charaka and Sushruta mention {{wildlife}} {{from the}} point of view of the meats the forests yielded and their associated attributes. The stratification of Hindu society into the caste system saw the warrior caste or kshatriya setting itself apart on hereditary lines; one assertion of which was the right to eat certain animals. The treatises espoused rules as to when, and who <b>could</b> <b>or</b> could not eat flesh of particular animals; for example, the flesh of the lion and tiger were to be consumed solely by regents and that too on rare occasions.|$|E
25|$|The spacious margin allowed {{illuminated}} decoration to {{be added}} by hand. The amount of decoration presumably depended on how much each buyer <b>could</b> <b>or</b> would pay. Some copies were never decorated. The place of decoration can be known or inferred for about 30 of the surviving copies. It is possible that 13 of these copies received their decoration in Mainz, but others were worked on {{as far away as}} London. The vellum Bibles were more expensive, and perhaps for this reason tend to be more highly decorated, although the vellum copy in the British Library is completely undecorated.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Gillingham {{proposed}} {{replacing the}} current play-off system with one involving six clubs from each division and replacing the two-legged ties with one-off matches. If adopted, the two higher-placed {{clubs in the}} play-offs would have enjoyed first-round byes and home advantage in the semi-finals. It was a controversial proposal — some people did not believe a club finishing only in eighth position in the League <b>could</b> (<b>or</b> should) compete in the Premiership while others found the system too American for their liking. Although League chairmen initially voted in favour of the proposal, it was blocked by The FA and soon abandoned.|$|E

25|$|Should {{a bridge}} be built, the tunnel would be closed. Finalizing a {{proposal}} {{in time for}} completion by 2019 is regarded by the authorities as crucial, as by that time European Union regulations will be enforced, requiring the tunnel, because its location on a Trans-European Network, to have two tubes or a parallel evacuation tunnel. Alternatively, a new bridge could be built further south to replace the Moss–Horten Ferry. The latter would see the Oslofjord Tunnel remain open, and <b>could</b> <b>or</b> could not result in a second tube being built. The ministry has stated that planning of a bridge would not be completed before 2020.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} Spain's empire in the New World was {{accomplished}} from Seville, without the close {{direction of the}} leadership in Madrid. Charles I and Philip II were primarily concerned with their duties in Europe, and thus control of the Americas was handled by viceroys and colonial administrators who operated with virtual autonomy. The Habsburg kings regarded their colonies as feudal associations rather than integral parts of Spain. No Spanish king <b>could,</b> <b>or</b> did, visit the colonies, either. The Habsburgs, whose family had traditionally ruled over diverse, noncontiguous domains and {{had been forced to}} devolve autonomy to local administrators, replicated those feudal policies in Spain, particularly in the Basque country and Aragon.|$|E
25|$|Husserl never {{claimed that}} {{mathematics}} <b>could</b> <b>or</b> should be grounded in part-whole rather than set theory. Lesniewski consciously derived his mereology {{as an alternative}} to set theory as a foundation of mathematics, but did not work out the details. Goodman and Quine (1947) tried to develop the natural and real numbers using the calculus of individuals, but were mostly unsuccessful; Quine did not reprint that article in his Selected Logic Papers. In a series of chapters in the books he published in the last decade of his life, Richard Milton Martin set out to do what Goodman and Quine had abandoned 30 years prior. A recurring problem with attempts to ground mathematics in mereology is how to build up the theory of relations while abstaining from set-theoretic definitions of the ordered pair. Martin argued that Eberle's (1970) theory of relational individuals solved this problem.|$|E
