2500|$|Springer {{was hired}} as a {{political}} reporter and commentator on Cincinnati's NBC affiliate, WLWT, which had, at the time, the lowest-rated news program. Later, having been named primary news anchor and Managing Editor, he needed a broadcast catchphrase in the model of other great newsmen. With the help of some others at WLWT, he created his signature line: [...] "Take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> and each other." [...] Within two years he was Cincinnati's number-one news anchor, along with partner Norma Rashid. For five years, he was the most popular one in the city, garnering ten local Emmy Awards for his nightly commentaries, which were frequently satirized by Cincinnati radio personality Gary Burbank. Those commentaries would eventually become his [...] "Final Thought" [...] on Springer. Springer would remain commentator at WLWT until January 1993. He resided in Loveland, Ohio, during this time.|$|E
2500|$|As Zhu was (outwardly) {{preparing}} to leave Jiangdu, Xu Zhixun went to bid him farewell. [...] Zhu held a feast for him, offered him wine, had Zhu's favorite concubine come outside to greet him and sing for him, and presented Zhu's favorite horse {{as a gift to}} him. [...] Zhu then invited him into the middle of Zhu's mansion, where Zhu's wife Lady Tao came out to greet him as well as a sign of respect. [...] Xu Zhixun was pleased and took no further precautions, while Zhu already had his elite guards surround the hall. [...] As Lady Tao bowed to Xu Zhixun and he bowed back, Zhu struck him and, as he fell to the ground, Zhu's elite soldiers entered and cut off his head. [...] After Zhu took the head and showed them to Xu Zhixun's soldiers, they all fled. [...] Zhu then entered the palace and showed the head to Yang, stating, [...] "I, your servant, have removed a harm to Your Majesty." [...] However, Yang, in fear of the consequences, fled and stated, [...] "You, Uncle, take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself!</b> [...] I know nothing about this." [...] (Yang referred to Zhu as uncle because Yang Xingmi's first wife Lady Zhu had the same surname, although she was unrelated to Zhu Jin.) [...] Shortly after, Zhu was cornered by soldiers under Xu Wen's associate Zhai Qian (翟虔), and committed suicide.|$|E

I learn that {{a few weeks ago}} a friend of yours, named Norton, secured the young man's release upon your promise to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him <b>yourself</b> in future.

6000|$|My dear Edgar,--In face of all probabilities the French fleet is [...] in sight. They will be {{here soon}} after it is dark. The city is in a [...] state of mid excitement. The captain of the 'Petrel' has just come [...] in, saying that the French are coming along the coast from the [...] west, and that I must be on board before it is dark. For some [...] reasons I regret {{that you are not}} with me, but I believe that you [...] will be quite safe with your Arab friends, and {{possibly}} this may be [...] more to your liking than a long stay in London.

The record of these meetings is done here with some theoretical tools with which we think can be a glimpse of contemporary clinical psychology written about these processes. A look that differs and deviates toward new {{ways of thinking about}} writing, especially, beyond representation. With concepts like body, ethos and self-authorship, we think these ways of thinking in contemporary writing. This can become a living space, a temporary abode for the storms of life, where it is possible the invention of the subject itself.

60|$|To this Duncan Campbell made a short, {{but a very}} {{significant}} reply in writing. May the heavens preserve you from a threatening danger <b>of</b> life. Take <b>care</b> only <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> great and mighty care; and if you outlive Friday next, you will yet be great and more fortunate than ever you was in all the height of your former most flourishing space of life. He coloured inordinately when Duncan Campbell said Friday, and conjured him to tell him as particularly as he could {{what he meant by}} Friday. He told him he could not particularise any farther, but that great danger threatened him that day; and that without extraordinary precaution it would prove fatal to him, even to death. He shook his head, and went away in a very sorrowful plight. Friday past, Saturday came, and on that very Saturday morning came likewise the joyful tidings, that what ventures of his were given over for lost at sea, were all come safe into the harbour. He came the moment he received those dispatches from his agent, to Mr. Duncan Campbell's apartment, embraced him tenderly, and saluted him with much gladness of heart, before a great roomful of ladies, where I happened to be present at that time; crying out in a loud voice, before he knew what he said, that Mr. Campbell had saved his life, that Friday was his birthday, and he had intended with a pistol to shoot himself that very day. The ladies thought him mad; and he, recovered from his ecstacy, said no more, but sat down, till Mr. Campbell dismissed all his clients; and then we three went to the tavern together, where he told me the whole little history or narrative, just as is above related.|$|R
60|$|THE CAPTAIN. No: {{that is part}} of {{my private}} pleasure. Your friend here is a humorist. I laughed at his telling you to think <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> to keep up your heart. I say, think <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> and burn the incense.|$|R
