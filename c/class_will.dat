5|$|The Visakhapatnam class (Project 15B) is a {{class of}} stealth guided missile destroyers under construction. An {{improved}} version of the Kolkata class and ordered in 2011, the first Visakhapatnam-class ship {{is expected to be}} completed in 2018. The <b>class</b> <b>will</b> have enhanced stealth characteristics and state-of-the-art weaponry and sensors, including the long-range Barak 8 surface-to-air missile. The first ship's keel was laid in October 2013. The Visakhapatnam <b>class</b> <b>will</b> be armed with a 127mm main gun and an AK-630 close-in anti-missile gun system.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the {{majority}} of the airline's fleet will be retrofitted with new Business and Economy Class seats. The seats are nearly identical to the new Regional Business Class and new Long-haul Economy Class products offered by parent company Cathay Pacific. Seats in both classes will be fitted with StudioKA (a rebranded version of the StudioCX inflight entertainment system on board Cathay Pacific aircraft), which features a 12.1-inch (Business Class) or 9-inch (Economy Class) touchscreen display, Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD), support for iOS devices, and a USB port for connectivity to other devices. In-seat power outlets will be available to all passengers. The new Business <b>Class</b> <b>will</b> feature a 21-inch wide recliner seat with 45 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 47 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch, while the new Economy <b>Class</b> <b>will</b> be 18.1 inches wide with 30 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 32 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch. The retrofitting process is expected to be complete by the end of 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Collins <b>class</b> <b>will</b> be {{replaced}} by the Future Submarine Program (SEA 1000) that is scheduled, according to the 2016 Defence White Paper, to begin entering service in the early 2030s with construction extending into the late 2040s to 2050. The Future Submarine Program will be based on the Shortfin Barracuda design by French company DCNS with twelve submarines to be acquired that will be built in Australia.|$|E

5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can {{be expanded}} (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations. By {{virtue of their}} similarity, each member of an equivalence <b>class</b> <b>will</b> have {{the same number of}} completions. Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number of solutions {{by the size of the}} equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, an {{accounting}} teacher arrives, believing demonstrations {{are being held}} to determine which <b>class</b> <b>will</b> be cut, much to the anger of Ron. He gives a very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him {{as to whether he}} enjoyed the party, to which he answers an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said it was to get an honest answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.|$|E
5|$|The story, told {{through the}} use of voiced and {{animated}} comic panels, centers on Angel, a heroine in a post-apocalyptic United States that travels from town to town protecting helpless survivors of the war from attacking gangs. Angel defends the towns using Gypsy, the name given to her armored car equipped with mounted machine guns. The game uses an overhead view as the player speeds around a small town using Gypsy's machine guns to repel enemy gangs known as Wastelanders. There are three types of Wastelanders and each one unleashes attacks in a different manner: The Slavers <b>class</b> <b>will</b> attempt to capture the townspeople, Killers will only attack the player, and Duals can take on either the role of attacking or capturing during a raid. When enemies are killed, they leave behind weapons for the player such as napalm, land mines, or Electromagnetic pulse bombs (EMPs); or they drop upgrades which improve the car's weapons or armor. The EMPs are used to temporarily disable all the enemies on the screen while the napalm and land mines can be set between waves as traps for unsuspecting Wastelanders. One weapon upgrade offers players incendiary ammunition for the car's machine guns which makes it easier to destroy enemies by lighting them on fire.|$|E

25|$|The Future Submarine Program (SEA 1000) is {{a future}} class of {{submarines}} for the Royal Australian Navy {{based on the}} Shortfin Barracuda proposal by French shipbuilder DCNS to replace the Collins-class submarines. The <b>class</b> <b>will</b> enter service in the early 2030s with construction extending into the late 2040s to 2050. The Program is estimated to cost $50billion and will be the largest, and most complex, defence acquisition project in Australian history.|$|E
25|$|Choice-based {{sampling}} {{is one of}} the stratified sampling strategies. In choice-based sampling, {{the data}} are stratified on the target and a sample is taken from each stratum so that the rare target <b>class</b> <b>will</b> be more represented in the sample. The model is then built on this biased sample. The effects of the input variables on the target are often estimated with more precision with the choice-based sample even when a smaller overall sample size is taken, compared to a random sample. The results usually must be adjusted to correct for the oversampling.|$|E
25|$|On 21 June 2008, the Navy christened , {{the first}} Block II submarine. This boat was {{delivered}} eight months {{ahead of schedule}} and $54million under budget. BlockII boats are built in four sections, compared to the ten sections of the Block I boats. This enables a cost saving of about $300 million per boat, reducing the overall cost to $2 billion per boat {{and the construction of}} two new boats per year. Beginning in 2010, new submarines of this <b>class</b> <b>will</b> include a software system that can monitor and reduce their electromagnetic signatures when needed.|$|E

25|$|In {{all classes}} and skill levels racers also {{receive the same}} number of points {{depending}} on how many are in their class and age group. These are called participant points. For instance if eight riders participate in 17-18 Intermediate class, all those who make the mains will get 8 points, including the last place finisher. If the class has 15 racers, all who make the main will get 15 points. So the winner of the Intermediate <b>class</b> <b>will</b> get 15 points for the fifteen racers in that class on top of the 50 points for winning for a total of 65 points.|$|E
25|$|Primary education, or Volksschule, {{lasts for}} four years, {{starting}} at age six. The maximum class size is 30, {{but may be}} as low as 15. It is generally expected that a <b>class</b> <b>will</b> be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child's well-being. The 3Rs (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no streaming.|$|E
25|$|A {{vote on the}} Trident renewal {{programme}} {{was held}} in the House of Commons on 18 July 2016, and determined that the UK should proceed with construction of the next generation of submarines. The motion passed with a significant majority of 472 MPs voting in favour and 117 against. The MoD put the cost of building, testing and commissioning the replacement vessels at £31billion (plus a contingency fund of £10billion) over 35 years, or about 0.2percent of government spending, or 6percent of defence spending, every year. It is expected the new fleet of submarines will come into operation starting 2028 at the earliest and certainly by the 2030s. The Dreadnought <b>class</b> <b>will</b> extend the life of the Trident programme until at least the 2060s.|$|E

25|$|The {{nature of}} {{elections}} also varies between nations. In the United States, negative campaigning and character attacks {{are more common}} than elsewhere, potentially suppressing turnouts. The focus placed on {{get out the vote}} efforts and mass-marketing can have important effects on turnout. Partisanship is an important impetus to turnout, with the highly partisan more likely to vote. Turnout tends to be higher in nations where political allegiance is closely linked to class, ethnic, linguistic, or religious loyalties. Countries where multiparty systems have developed also tend to have higher turnouts. Nations with a party specifically geared towards the working <b>class</b> <b>will</b> tend to have higher turnouts among that class than in countries where voters have only big tent parties, which try to appeal to all the voters, to choose from.|$|E
500|$|This Dragon Quest, {{similar to}} Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest VII, has a class system. Once the party gets to Alltrades Abbey, {{they have the}} option of {{becoming}} one of several starter classes. Each class has eight levels, which are gained by winning a specific number of battles (unlike character levels, which are gained by earning experience points), and advancing in level teaches a character new spells and / or skills, which are retained across class changes. Once a character has mastered a specific set of two or three starter classes, they can change into a hybrid class which builds on their themes; for example, mastering Warrior and Martial Artist unlocks the Gladiator Class, which learns powerful physical attacks, and mastering certain hybrid classes unlocks the Hero class. Some of the classes give special bonuses beyond their stats and abilities such as the Merchant who gives a small bonus to the party's income after every battle, or the Sage who receives a discount to MP costs. To master a class, the character must fight a set number of battles as that class. Once certain hybrid classes are mastered, a stat relating to that <b>class</b> <b>will</b> permanently go up. There are two secret classes as well, Dragon (Hackasaurus) and Liquid Metal Slime, which are unlockable through consumable books. Dragon Quest VI was the first game in the series to include [...] (special attacks and other techniques which are not spells and usually do not cost MP) for human party members. These special techniques were added to the remakes of III, IV and V later on.|$|E
