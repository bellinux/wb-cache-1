50|$|Anthrenus (Anthrenus) scrophulariae, {{also known}} as the <b>common</b> <b>carpet</b> beetle, is a species of beetle found in Europe, the Middle East and the Nearctic. In Europe, it is found in almost every country. The beetle may {{frequently}} be found on Euphorbia cyparissias.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>carpet</b> or white-banded toothed carpet (Epirrhoe alternata) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is found {{throughout}} the Palearctic and the Near East. In North America it ranges across the northern tier of the United States plus every province and territory of Canada.|$|E

50|$|The <b>common</b> marbled <b>carpet</b> (Dysstroma truncata) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is {{sometimes}} placed in the genus Chloroclysta. It is very common throughout the Palearctic region and the Near East.|$|R
5000|$|During its adult {{lifespan}} of 30 to 60 days, {{the female}} beetle lays up to 100 white eggs. The eggs are visible {{but less than}} one millimeter long. The larvae emerge in one to three weeks. The larva is oval or [...] "carrot-shaped" [...] and about 5 millimeters long at its final stage. It varies in color according to diet and it is coated in long, brown hairs. The larva of this species can be distinguished from that of its relative, the <b>common</b> <b>carpet</b> beetle (Anthrenus scrophulariae), {{by the presence of}} a bundle of hairs on the posterior end which is constantly vibrating. This bundle, located just above the anus, is called the supra-anal organ. All instar stages of the larva have the organ, and there is a specific number of hairs in it at each instar. The vibration of the organ is an antipredator adaptation that helps to repel predators such as pseudoscorpions (Chelifer sp.) and the parasitoid wasp Laelius pedatus.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} the residual effects of pig slurry (PS) applied to <b>common</b> <b>carpet</b> grass pasture (Axonopus affinis) for two years (September 2008 -March 2010) on dry matter yield and forage-nitrogen uptake from October 2010 -May 2011. A field experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The treatments were 102, 204, 306, 408, and 510 m 3 ha- 1 pig slurry applied for two years; one mineral nitrogen rate (1, 250 kg ha- 1 ammonium nitrate) for two years; and no nitrogen fertilization (control). The pasture was cut at intervals of 48, 34, 43 and 69 days, which corresponded to 266, 300, 343, and 412 days after the last fertilizer application, respectively. Dry matter yield increased by 398 kg ha- 1 for each 100 m 3 of PS applied, the equivalent of 317 and 564 kg ha- 1 for each 100 kg ha- 1 of inorganic and organic N applied, respectively. The residual effect of PS on dry matter yield and forage-nitrogen uptake ranged from 11 - 45 % and 8 - 40 %, respectively, indicating a gradual release and availability of N in PS, which can help reduce the amounts of nitrogen applied to pasture...|$|E

50|$|The scenery {{in spring}} is graced by wood anemones (Anemone nemorosa) and yellow anemones (Anemone ranunculoides), hollowroot (Corydalis cava), spring vetchling (Lathyrus vernus), kidneywort (Hepatica nobilis) and alternate-leaved golden saxifrage (Chrysosplenium alternifolium), which grows on stream banks, but also covers scree slopes like a <b>carpet.</b> <b>Common</b> toothwort (Lathraea squamaria) and spring {{snowflake}} (Leucojum vernum) also occur here and there.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{carpeting}} raises hygiene concerns {{although it}} is the accepted flooring option. Therefore it is <b>common</b> for the <b>carpet</b> to be loose rather than fitted, {{so that it can}} be removed and cleaned. The carpet also does not usually cover the whole floor area; a strip of flooring, usually wooden parquet, is left exposed around the edges of the room. Parquet flooring is not the most suitable option because its cavities may harbour dust and pests.|$|R
25|$|Unlike woven carpets, {{embroidery}} carpets' are not {{formed on}} a loom. Their pattern is {{established by the}} application of stitches to a cloth (often linen) base. The tent stitch and the cross stitch {{are two of the}} most <b>common.</b> Embroidered <b>carpets</b> were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and linen weaving improved in the 16th century. Mary, Queen of Scots, is known to have been an avid embroiderer. 16th century designs usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the Bradford carpet). They often incorporate animal heraldry and the coat of arms of the maker. Production continued through the 19th century. Victorian embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers. Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called Berlin wool work, were introduced in Germany in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other features such as a pattern of shapes, or they can even tell a story.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Work-related {{musculoskeletal}} disorders {{in the neck}} and shoulder regions are <b>common</b> among <b>carpet</b> weavers. Working for prolonged hours in a static and awkward posture could result in an increased muscle activity and may lead to {{musculoskeletal disorders}}. Ergonomic workstation improvements can reduce muscle fatigue {{and the risk of}} musculoskeletal disorders. Material and Methods: The aim {{of this study is to}} assess and to compare upper trapezius and middle deltoid muscle activity in 2 traditional and improved design carpet weaving workstations. These 2 workstations were simulated in a laboratory and 12 women carpet weavers worked for 3 h. Electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded during work in bilateral upper trapezius and bilateral middle deltoid. The root mean square (RMS) and median frequency (MF) values were calculated and used to assess muscle load and fatigue. Repeated measure ANOVA was performed to assess the effect of independent variables on muscular activity and fatigue. The participants were asked to report shoulder region fatigue on the Borg’s Category-Ratio scale (Borg CR- 10). Results: Root mean square values in workstation A are significantly higher than in workstation B. Furthermore, EMG amplitude was higher in bilateral trapezius than in bilateral deltoid. However, muscle fatigue was not observed in any of the workstations. Conclusions: The results of the study revealed that muscle load in a traditional workstation was high, but fatigue was not observed. Further studies investigating other muscles involved in carpet weaving tasks are recommended...|$|R
2500|$|With {{administrative}} change occurring, the construction project progressed. The project ultimately {{resulted in a}} middle school wing, a middle school gymnasium, a renovated Instructional Media Center (library), new {{middle school and high}} school main offices, a 450-seat auditorium, a new front walkway and entrance, a renovated commons area, and high school classroom renovation. In addition to expansion of the building, in order to meet state fire codes, the construction also resulted in traditional, four-walled, closed classrooms. By removing wall-less classrooms, the new classroom setup left some interior rooms windowless. In addition, the <b>Commons</b> had its <b>carpet</b> removed and new, artistic walls were installed. These walls were often poked fun at and seemed very silly in the eyes of students, with statements of [...] "This is a school, not an art museum!" [...] pushing a backlash against the walls. Many wanted the walls removed, though that wouldn't happen until Blind Brook went through a second wave of construction. The new auditorium was also criticized as it was too small and could not fit the entire high school and its faculty in the facility at the same time. In addition, the end-of-the-year graduation would not be able to be held in the new facility as it lacked necessary seating for guests. Graduations are held in the gym as it can accommodate the larger number of guests.|$|R
40|$|Background: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} (MSDs) are a <b>common</b> problem among <b>carpet</b> weavers. This {{study was}} undertaken to introduce affecting personal and occupational factors {{in developing the}} number of MSDs among carpet weavers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among 862 weavers in seven towns with regard to workhouse location in urban or rural regions. Data were collected by using questionnaires that contain personal, workplace, and information tools and the modified Nordic MSDs questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed by applying Poisson and negative binomial mixed models using a full Bayesian hierarchical approach. The deviance information criterion was used for comparison between models and model selection. Results: The majority of weavers (72 %) were female and carpet weaving was the main job of 85. 2 % of workers. The negative binomial mixed model with lowest deviance information criterion {{was selected as the}} best model. The criteria showed the convergence of chains. Based on 95 % Bayesian credible interval, the main job and weaving type variables statistically affected the number of MSDs, but variables age, sex, weaving comb, work experience, and carpet weaving looms were not significant. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it can be concluded that occupational factors are associated with the number of MSDs developing among carpet weavers. Thus, using standard tools and decreasing hours of work per day can reduce frequency of MSDs among carpet weavers...|$|R

60|$|The jolliest {{indoor games}} {{for boys and}} girls demand a floor, and the home that has no floor upon which games may be played falls so far short of happiness. It must be a floor covered with {{linoleum}} or cork carpet, so that toy soldiers and such-like will stand up upon it, and of a color and surface that will take and show chalk marks; the <b>common</b> green-colored cork <b>carpet</b> without a pattern is the best of all. It must be no highway to other rooms, and well lit and airy. Occasionally, alas! it must be scrubbed--and then a truce to Floor Games. Upon such a floor may be made an infinitude of imaginative games, not only keeping boys and girls happy for days together, but building up a framework of spacious and inspiring ideas in them for after life. The men of tomorrow will gain new strength from nursery floors. I am going to tell of some of these games and what is most needed to play them; I have tried them all and a score of others like them with my sons, and all of the games here illustrated have been set out by us. I am going to tell of them here because I think what we have done will interest other fathers and mothers, and perhaps be of use to them (and to uncles and such-like tributary sub-species of humanity) in buying presents for their own and other people's children.|$|R
40|$|Background: Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} {{is a common}} mono-neuropathy with various causes. This study aimed at evaluating the epidemiology of patients with the carpal {{tunnel syndrome}} referred to Sina Hospital in Hamedan City, Iran. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-cross sectional study, 300 patients (600 hands) suffering from paresthesia, pain and weakness {{of the first to}} third finger were studied. Diagnosis and severity of the disease was evaluated according to history, examination and electro-diagnostic studies. Afterall the data were collected. Results: This study was conducted on 230 (76. 7) females and 70 (23. 3) males with the mean ages of 47. 3 ± 17. 4 and 49. 1 ± 20. 2 years, respectively (P= 0. 224). Sixteen of them were left-handed and the rest were right-handed. Also, 113 of the patients had risk factors such as diabetes with the prevalence of 18. 1 and hypothyroidism with 6. 4 as the most common ones. The most <b>common</b> occupations were <b>carpet</b> weaving and milking with prevalence rates of 19. 4 and 13. 3, respectively. In electro-diagnostic findings, 57 of the patients had moderate involvement and 16. 6 had severe involvement. The Phalen and Tinel test was positive in 32. 2 of the patients and negative in 32. 2 of the cases. There was a relationship between the severity of involvement and probability of a positive Phalen and Tinel test. Conclusion: Considering that 76 of the cases were women and among jobs, after housekeeping, carpet weaving and milking are the most common ones, paying more attention to these people and designing the proper work tools (especially carpet weaving and milking tools) as well as training of the housewives are recommended to prevent this syndrome...|$|R
