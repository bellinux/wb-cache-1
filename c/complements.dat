When {{the wind is}} blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate.

5|$|As {{with other}} forms {{with a long}} history in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a number of major Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form.

Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Helgoland was {{assigned}} to the I Division, I Battle Squadron. Helgoland was stationed off the heavily fortified island of Wangerooge on 9 August. Minefields and picket lines of cruisers, torpedo boats, and submarines were also emplaced there to defend Wilhelmshaven. Helgolands engines were kept running for the entirety of her deployment, so that she would be ready to respond at a moment's notice. Four days later, on 13 August, Helgoland returned to Wilhelmshaven to refuel.

50|$|A {{class is}} said to be closed under <b>complement</b> if the <b>complement</b> of any problem in the class is still in the class.

For instance, in a circle graph, the neighborhood of each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found by applying the permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood. Similarly, in a unit disk graph (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on applying the algorithm for <b>complements</b> of bipartite graphs to shared neighborhoods of pairs of vertices.|$|E

5|$|Just {{over half}} of the French {{infantry}} were regulars of the old Royal Army, as were nearly all of the cavalry and, most importantly, the artillery, which were widely regarded as the best in Europe at the time. These veterans provided a professional core to steady the enthusiastic volunteer battalions. Combined, Dumouriez' Army of the North and Kellermann's Army of the Centre totalled approximately 54,000 troops. Heading towards them was Brunswick's coalition army of about 84,000, all veteran Prussian and Austrian troops augmented by large <b>complements</b> of Hessians and the French royalist Army of Cond√©.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>complement</b> {{system is}} {{composed}} of soluble factors in plasma that enhance or ‚Äúcomplement‚Äù immune-mediated killing through innate and adaptive mechanisms. Activation of <b>complement</b> causes recruitment of immune cells; opsonization of coated cells; and direct killing of affected cells through a membrane attack complex (MAC). Tumor cells up-regulate <b>complement</b> inhibitory factors ‚Äì one of several strategies to evade the immune system. In many cases as the tumor progresses, dramatic increases in <b>complement</b> inhibitory factors are found on these cells. This review focuses on the classic <b>complement</b> pathway {{and the role of}} major <b>complement</b> inhibitory factors in cancer immune evasion as well as on how current protein engineering efforts are being employed to increase <b>complement</b> fixing or to reverse <b>complement</b> resistance leading to better therapeutic outcomes in oncology. Strategies discussed include engineering of antibodies to enhance <b>complement</b> fixation, antibodies that neutralize <b>complement</b> inhibitory proteins as well as engineered constructs that specifically target inhibition of the <b>complement</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Is <b>complement</b> {{a target}} for therapy in renal disease? <b>Complement</b> {{deposition}} in the injured kidney is common, especially in glomerulonephritis. The precise role of the <b>complement</b> system in the mediation of tissue injury in the kidney has been defined in recent years, and this has assumed extra importance with the recent development of specific forms of therapy directed at the <b>complement</b> pathway. As well as the induction of cell lysis, <b>complement</b> has many subtle effects on cell biology, particularly on endothelial cells. <b>Complement</b> components are produced locally in the kidney. Detailed studies of certain rare forms of nephritis have provided evidence that <b>complement</b> activation can directly cause tissue injury. Appreciation {{of the importance of}} <b>complement</b> in hyperacute rejection of xenotransplants has given new impetus to the development of <b>complement</b> inhibitors. A narrative review is provided, with a brief overview of the <b>complement</b> pathway and its regulatory mechanisms, mechanisms of complement-induced tissue injury, local <b>complement</b> production, and the renal consequences of <b>complement</b> dysregulation. Currently available forms of therapy aimed at the <b>complement</b> system are reviewed, and possible future therapeutic strategies are suggested. The <b>complement</b> system plays a direct causal role in tissue injury in certain forms of renal disease. Specific forms of therapy are becoming available that can selectively interrupt <b>complement</b> activation or promote its regulation. Much of the drive for the development of these therapies comes from the field of xenotransplantation, but these forms of therapy should also be tested in various primary renal diseases...|$|R
