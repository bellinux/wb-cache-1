500|$|The {{complex is}} found in {{cellular}} regions characterized by dynamic actin filament activity: in macropinocytic cups, in {{the leading edge of}} motile cells (lamellipodia), and in motile actin patches in yeast. In mammals and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum [...] it is required for phagocytosis. The complex has also been shown {{to be involved in the}} establishment of cell polarity and the migration of fibroblast monolayers in a wound-healing model. In mammalian oocytes, the Arp2/3 complex is involved in oocyte asymmetric division and polar body emission, which result from the failure of spindle migration (a unique feature of oocyte division) and cytokinesis. Moreover, enteropathogenic organisms like Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella use the Arp2/3 complex for actin-polymerization- dependent rocketing movements. The Arp2/3 complex also regulates the intracellular motility [...] of endosomes, lysosomes, pinocytic vesicles, and mitochondria. Moreover, recent studies show that the Arp2/3 complex is essential for proper polar <b>cell</b> <b>expansion</b> in plants. Arp2/3 mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana result in abnormal filament organization, which in turn affects the expansion of trichomes, pavement cells, hypocotyl cells, and root hair cells.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} several reports have {{suggested}} that T cells may {{have a role in}} systemic sclerosis (SSc). The aim of our study was to investigate the dynamics of T cell repertoire in early SSc disease analysing a target organ, the skin, and the peripheral blood. To date, indeed, it is not clear if T <b>cell</b> <b>expansions</b> found in SSc reflect a general activation or result from specific antigen stimulation in the target organs. This is an important point to assess in order to characterize the role of T cells in the development of SSc. To address these questions we studied T cell repertoire by CDR 3 length analysis in skin biopsies and peripheral blood obtained from patients affected by SSc and we found that a skewed T cell repertoire was present only in the biopsies. In order to characterize more effectively the meaning of these data, we performed co-cultures using fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from SSc patients. These experiments showed that same T <b>cell</b> <b>expansions</b> were detectable in the skin of SSc patients and in the cultures of PBMCs and autologous fibroblasts of the patients but not in their peripheral blood. Taken together, these data suggest that fibroblasts trigger specific T <b>cell</b> <b>expansions</b> in the early phase of SSc...|$|R

T lymphocytes are {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of WG, since they {{have been found to}} infiltrate affected organs, and sIL- 2 R correlates with disease activity. To elucidate further the role of T cells in necrotizing vasculitis, we have used a panel of 12 TCR V-specific MoAbs to investigate the number of cells expressing certain V alpha and V beta gene segments in the CD 4 + and CD 8 + subsets of altogether 11 patients with WG or PAN. In the group of patients, we found abnormal <b>expansions</b> of T <b>cells</b> using particular TCR V alpha or V beta gene products.

40|$|International audienceIn {{a patient}} with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus {{infection}} associated with vasculitis and fulminant CD 4 + T cell lymphoproliferative disorder, we probed the {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) for the presence of an EBV-specific T cell repertoire and tested the possible relationship between the lymphocytic infiltrate and the EBV-specific T cell response. Our results give credence to the presence of an apparently normal EBV-specific memory T cell response after in vitro reactivation of the patient's PBMC with autologous infected B lymphoblastoid cell lines. In keeping with the characterization of the vasculitis, certain T cell subsets were detected after expansion of skin lesion-infiltrating lymphocytes and were found to be infected with EBV. These particular T <b>cell</b> <b>expansions</b> were neither the effectors nor the targets of the in vitro reactivated EBV-specific T cells, thus excluding a simple relationship between EBV, the skin lesions, and the T <b>cell</b> <b>expansions</b> frequently observed in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to study whether CD 4 + or CD 8 + T cells expressing particular T cell receptors (TCR) would accumulate in the lungs of patients with allergic asthma following allergen exposure. We thus analysed the TCR Vα and Vβ gene usage of CD 4 + and CD 8 +lung and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of eight patients with allergic asthma before and 4 days after inhalation challenge with the relevant allergen. Lung cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and paired PBL samples were analysed by flow cytometry using a panel of anti-TCR V-specific monoclonal antibodies that encompass ≈ 50 % of the T cell repertoire. Lung-limited T <b>cell</b> <b>expansions</b> were recorded in both the CD 4 + and the CD 8 + subsets. In BAL CD 8 +, {{out of a total}} of 126 analyses, the number of T <b>cell</b> <b>expansions</b> increased from two to 11 after challenge, some of them dramatic. In BAL CD 4 + the frequency of expansions was moderately increased already before challenge, but remained unchanged. A few expansions that tended to persist were noted in PBL CD 8 +. When analysing the overall change in TCR V gene usage the largest changes were also recorded in the BAL CD 8 + subset. Specific interactions between T cells and antigens may lead to an increased frequency of T cells using selected TCR V gene segments. In this study we demonstrate that following allergen bronchoprovocation in allergic asthmatic subjects, T <b>cell</b> <b>expansions</b> preferentially emerge in the lung CD 8 + T cell subset...|$|R

The molecular basis underlying compensatory β <b>cell</b> mass <b>expansion</b> is largely unknown.

In isolated pancreatic islets, we recapitulated the decreased miR- 338 - 3 p level observed in gestation and obesity by activating the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR 30 and the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP 1) receptor. Blockade of miR- 338 - 3 p in β cells using specific anti-miR molecules mimicked gene expression changes occurring during β <b>cell</b> mass <b>expansion</b> and resulted in increased proliferation and improved survival both in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|Adaptive natural killer (NK) cell {{responses}} to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection {{are characterized by}} the expansion of NKG 2 C+ NK cells expressing self-specific inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). Here, {{we set out to}} study the HLA class I-dependency of such NKG 2 C+ NK <b>cell</b> <b>expansions.</b> We demonstrate expansion of NKG 2 C+ NK cells in patients with transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) -deficiency, whom express less than 10 % of normal HLA class I levels. In contrast to normal individuals, expanded NKG 2 C+ NK cell populations in TAP-deficient patients display a polyclonal KIR-profile and remain hyporesponsive to HLA class I-negative target cells. Nonetheless, agonistic stimulation of NKG 2 C on NK cells from TAP-deficient patients yielded significant responses in terms of degranulation and cytokine production. Thus, while interactions with self-HLA class I molecules likely shape the KIR-repertoire of expanding NKG 2 C+ NK cells during adaptive NK cell responses in normal individuals, they are not a prerequisite for NKG 2 C+ NK <b>cell</b> <b>expansions</b> to occur. Thus, the emergence of NKG 2 C-responsive adaptive NK cells in TAP-deficient patients may contribute to anti-viral immunity and potentially explain these patients’ low incidence of severe viral infections...|$|R

The signals that control this recall response remain unclear. We show that CD 40 L production by memory CD 8 + T cells themselves is an essential catalyst for secondary expansion when systemic inflammation is limited. Secondary immunization accompanied by high levels of systemic inflammation results in CD 8 + T <b>cell</b> secondary <b>expansion</b> independent of CD 4 + T cells and CD 40 -CD 40 L signaling. Conversely, when the inflammatory response is limited, memory CD 8 + T <b>cell</b> secondary <b>expansion</b> requires CD 40 L-producing cells, and memory CD 8 + T cells can provide this signal. These results demonstrate that vaccination regimens differ in their dependence on CD 40 L-expressing CD 8 + T <b>cells</b> for secondary <b>expansion,</b> and propose that CD 40 L-expression by CD 8 + T cells is a fail-safe mechanism that can promote memory CD 8 + T <b>cell</b> secondary <b>expansion</b> when inflammation is limited...|$|R

40|$|In Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), {{a form of}} {{autoimmune}} systemic vasculitis, chronic carriage of Staphylococcus aureus {{constitutes a}} risk factor for the development of exacerbations. Circulating T cells in this disease are persistently activated, suggesting the presence of a chronic stimulus. A causal link between chronic carriage of S. aureus and chronic T cell activation in WG is conceivable, because S. aureus produces superantigens (SAg), which are potent T cell stimulators. Superantigenic stimulation of T <b>cells</b> results in <b>expansion</b> of T <b>cell</b> subsets expressing SAg-binding T cell receptor V-beta (Vbeta) chains. In the present study we hypothesized that in WG the presence of staphylococcal SAg is accompanied by expansion of SAg-reacting T cell subsets. We tested our hypothesis in a cross-sectional and a longitudinal study in which the association between seven staphylococcal SAg genes [typed by poplymerase chain reaction (PCR) ], eight SAg-binding Vbeta chains and four SAg-non-binding Vbeta chains (assessed by flow-cytometry) was assessed.
