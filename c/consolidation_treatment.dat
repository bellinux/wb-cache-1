40|$|Conservation and {{restoration}} of archaeological sites developed {{significantly in the}} second half of the twentieth century, with greater emphasis in recent decades, which has led to a considerable number of interventions. Methodology of intervention has changed significantly since more interventionist measures are performed against the current criteria of minimum intervention, although what actually occurs today is a difficult balance between innovation (experimental application of new techniques and products) and minimum intervention. The debate, in the case of archaeological sites, has focused on the actions traditionally more aggressive: cleaning, consolidation or reintegration, as this is where most notable has been the restorative action throughout history. The restoration, like everything else, has been subject of trends, in relation to the appearance of new products and technologies, and today remains a discipline that widely develops experimental practice. It certainly brings great benefits and constant renewal of criteria and methodologies, but also risks by introducing new compounds that may interact negatively with original substrate, although their effects cannot be checked in the short or medium term. The lack of knowledge of the causes of decay arising from previous interventions has generated a series of continuous protection and <b>consolidation</b> <b>treatments</b> at different periods.

40|$|The present work {{describes}} a thoroughly analytical {{study of the}} chemical changes produced in waterlogged woods collected from different different archaeological sites. This study {{is very important in}} order to develop appropriate measures for the conservation of historical wooden artifacts. The chemical changes produced in the waterlogged woods were studied by different pyrolytic techniques: direct exposure electron ionization-mass spectrometry (DE-MS), pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and Py-GC/MS in the presence of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) as a derivatising agent. The study concluded that the main structural changes occurring in waterlogged woods are the removal of carbohydrates.

RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 18. 2 mo (range: 5. 1 - 47. 5 mo) after cessation of antiviral treatment, the cumulative serological recurrence rate was 15 % at 12 mo. The median duration between the cessation of antiviral treatment and serologic recurrence was 7. 2 mo (range: 1. 2 - 10. 9 mo). Of the 48 patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis, 20 (41. 6 %) showed virological recurrence. The cumulative virologic recurrence rates at 12 mo after discontinuing the antiviral agent were 41 %. The median duration between off-treatment and virologic recurrence was 7. 6 mo (range: 4. 3 - 27. 1 mo). The {{mean age of the}} virological recurrence group was older than that of the non-recurrence group (46. 7 1; 12. 1 years vs 38. 8 1; 12. 7 years, respectively; P = 0. 022).

The main {{purpose of the present}} study was to analyze the changes of physical properties in freshly quarried and in deteriorated stone, after a <b>consolidation</b> <b>treatment</b> with tetraethoxysilane. For this purpose we performed measurements of sorption (absorption of water and adsorption of solid particles on the stone surface), gas adsorption and ultrasonic velocity. The study implies that a <b>consolidation</b> <b>treatment</b> will improve the physical properties of deteriorated stone and have a satisfactory effect, if that treatment is performed in a correct way and the stone is allowed to absorb consolidation liquid until saturation. For badly deteriorated stone two consolidation treatments seem to be sufficient; a third application probably does not improve the physical properties of the stone. It was observed that treatments carried out 10 to 15 years ago still have the intended strengthening effect on the stone. In most cases, if stone remains exposed to water, the consolidating treatment ensures only a 5 to 10 years protecting effect; after that the treatment needs to be repeated. However, the long-term effects and efficacy of periodically repeated consolidation treatments of stone need to be studied further, before such a procedure can be recommended as standard procedure.

According with this, the aim is to quantify the success rate of workover operations. The average completion efficiencies were calculated using the arithmetic mean for wells in different reservoirs and fields having the same completion type. The analysis of the results from the workover operation showed that some operations were successful while others are not and no field had all operations completely successful. Those that were adjudged successful are fields were enhanced production due to the operations was able to offset low productions from failed operations. However, it was observed in some fields that there was complete failure in the operations as all post-operation productions are lower than the pre-operation productions. The operations where failure occurred are due to loss of completion fluids into the formations, resulting to formation damage. Hence, chemical <b>consolidation</b> <b>treatments</b> must be handled with caution as they seem to be more susceptible to damage than other completion types...|$|R
