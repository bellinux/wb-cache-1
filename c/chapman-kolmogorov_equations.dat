This Markov chain is described implicitly using a formalism that allows for a compact description of chains with an exponentially high number of states. Using this approach, we present an application in power estimation of sequential circuits {{that takes into account}} all the temporal and spatial correlations between the primary inputs and the internal signals.

The convergence of the scheme is then obtained in the space of continuous functions with respect to the time variable, valued in the set of probability measures on R-d.

40|$|The Bradley–Terry model (BT) is {{commonly}} used for evaluation of choice preferences by paired comparison data in various areas of applied psychology, advertising, and marketing research. The estimation of BT parameters of preference is usually achieved in an iterative procedure based on the maximum likelihood approach. In this paper an easier way of finding these parameters via an eigenproblem is considered. This approach corresponds to solving a Chapman–Kolmogorov system of equations to estimate the steady-state probabilities of the compared items. Both techniques produce very similar results, but the eigenvector solution is simpler for applications and suggests an interpretation of BT preferences as the choice probabilities. The suggested approach can facilitate the paired comparison estimations and be utilized in various practical aims of managerial decision making.

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of digital circuits, to study testability estimation measures, dissipated power and electromagnetic inference,it is crucial to obtain with precision the switching probability of the circuit internal nodes. By solving the <b>Chapman-Kolmogorov</b> <b>equations</b> that describe the steady state behaviour of the circuit, we can calculate the probability associated with each state of the MC that represents the underlying FSM [6][7]. By supervising the behaviour of the MC, the allowed events, associated with a transition probability, will conduct the MC to the states where we obtain higher levels of controllability/observability for the internal variables. If we model the problem as a Markov decision process (Controlled Markov Chain), we can solve it using Dynamic Programming Methods (DP). This way, the transition probability between states will follow, not a fixed distribution, but instead some controllable distribution using a set of control actions...|$|E

By associating both an additive and a multiplicative weight with the edges, FEVBDDs {{can be used}} to represent a wider range of functions concisely.
