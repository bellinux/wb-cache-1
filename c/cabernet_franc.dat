5|$|Carménère {{has also}} been {{established}} in small amounts in New Zealand. DNA testing confirmed in 2006 that plantings of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> in the Matakana region were in fact Carménère.|$|E
5|$|Carménère is {{produced}} in wineries either as a single-variety wine (sometimes called a varietal wine), or as a blend usually with Cabernet Sauvignon, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc</b> or Merlot.|$|E
5|$|The grape's true origins were {{discovered}} in 1996 {{with the use of}} DNA typing at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology, by a team led by Dr. Carole Meredith. The DNA evidence determined that Cabernet Sauvignon was the offspring of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc</b> and Sauvignon blanc and was most likely a chance crossing that occurred in the 17th century. Prior to this discovery, this origin had been suspected from the similarity of the grapes' names and the fact that Cabernet Sauvignon shares similar aromas with both grapes—such as the blackcurrant and pencil box aromas of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc</b> and the grassiness of Sauvignon blanc. In 2016 scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole genome of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing grape to be sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Other {{varieties}} {{with significant}} production by harvested acres in 2016 are Syrah, Merlot, Tempranillo, Pinot blanc, Gewürztraminer, Viognier, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc,</b> Müller-Thurgau, Sauvignon blanc, and Zinfandel, V. vinifera based wines produced in smaller quantities include Arneis, Baco noir, Black Muscat, Chenin blanc, Dolcetto, Gamay noir, Grenache, Marechal Foch, Malbec, Muscat, Nebbiolo, Petite Syrah, Sangiovese, and Sémillon. The state also produces fruit wine, sparkling wine, late harvest wine, ice wine, and dessert wine.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{evidence}} has shown Cabernet Sauvignon {{is the result}} of the crossing of two other Bordeaux grape varieties— <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc</b> and Sauvignon blanc— which has led grapevine historians, or ampelographers, to believe that the grape originated in Bordeaux. Early records indicate that the grape was a popular planting in the Médoc region during the 18th century. The loose berry clusters and thick skins of the grape provided a good resistance to rot in the sometimes wet maritime climate of Bordeaux. The grape continued to grow in popularity until the Powdery mildew epidemic of 1852 exposed Cabernet Sauvignon's sensitivity to that grape disease. With vineyards severely ravaged or lost, many Bordeaux wine growers turned to Merlot, increasing its plantings to where it soon became the most widely planted grape in Bordeaux. As the region's winemakers started to better understand the area's terroir and how the different grape varieties performed in different region, Cabernet Sauvignon increased in plantings all along the Left Bank region of the Gironde river in the Médoc as well as Graves region, where it became the dominant variety in the wine blends. In the Right bank regions of Saint-Émilion and Pomerol, Cabernet is a distant third in plantings behind Merlot & <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sauvignon blanc grape traces {{its origins}} to western France in the Loire Valley and Bordeaux Regions. As noted above, {{it is not}} clear that the vine {{originated}} in western France. Ongoing research suggests it may have descended from Savagnin. It has also been associated with the Carmenere family. At some point in the 18th century, the vine paired with <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> to parent the Cabernet Sauvignon vine in Bordeaux. In the 19th century, plantings in Bordeaux were often interspersed with Sauvignon vert (In Chile, known as Sauvignonasse) as well as the Sauvignon blanc pink mutation Sauvignon gris. Prior to the phylloxera epidemic, the insect plague which devastated French vineyards in the 19th century, these interspersed cuttings were transported to Chile where the field blends are still common today. Despite the similarity in names, Sauvignon blanc has no known relation to the Sauvignon rosé mutation found in the Loire Valley of France.|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc)</b> and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc</b> - first planted as an {{experimental}} block with Dr. Clore in the 1970s. Commercial planting in 1985. Columbia's 1991 Red Willow <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> {{was the first}} varietal bottling of this grape variety in Washington.|$|E
25|$|In Washington State, {{the first}} plantings of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> were {{cultivated}} in experimental blocks by Washington State University in the Columbia Valley during the 1970s. In 1985, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> was {{planted in the}} Red Willow Vineyard for use in Bordeaux style blends. The first varietal <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> in Washington was released in 1991 by Columbia Winery followed by Chateau Ste Michelle in 1992 with grapes planted from their Cold Creek Vineyard. In the 1990s, Chinook Winery introduced the state's first <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> rosé. Today it is the fourth most widely planted grape in the state behind Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah. Washington <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> is distinctive for its fruit forward style with blueberry and raspberry fruit. The characteristic vegetal notes are toned down in Washington, with the wines tending to show more notes of ground coffee and olives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> shares many of {{the same}} {{phenolic}} and aroma compounds as Cabernet Sauvignon but with some noticeable differences. <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> tends to be more lightly pigmented and produces wines with the same level of intensity and richness. <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> tends to have a more pronounced perfume with notes of raspberries, blackcurrants, violets and graphite. It is often characterized by a green, vegetal strike that can range from leaves to green bell peppers. It has slightly less tannins than Cabernet Sauvignon and tends to produce a wine with a smoother mouthfeel. New World examples of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> tend to emphasize the fruit more and may delay harvesting the grapes to try to minimize the green leafy notes.|$|E
25|$|Records of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> in Bordeaux {{go back to}} the end of the 18th century, {{although}} it was planted in Loire long before that time. DNA analysis indicates that <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> is one of two parents of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Carménère.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being found in Villány and Szekszárd, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> is also present in Eger, and in South Balaton and Sopron vineyards, to a lesser extent. <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> often complements Bordeaux-style blends from these regions and occasionally {{plays a role in}} rosé production.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, as Pomerol's {{transition}} to a red wine producing district was completed, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> was the dominant grape variety. However, an early spring frost in 1956 killed {{a large portion of}} the <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> plantings and many estates took this event as an opportunity to replant with the higher yielding and earlier ripening Merlot. Despite Merlot's tendency to suffer from coulure if the weather is cold and rainy during flowering, the grape quickly rose to prominence in Pomerol and has become the grape most closely associated with the region. Nevertheless, very few Pomerols are pure Merlot and <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> is still valued for the tannic structure and acidity it gives, which can add longevity and aging potential to the wines. In fact, as the trend of the late 20th and early 21st century towards harvesting Merlot later and at increasingly higher sugar levels has continued, the role of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> in balancing the opulent but potentially flabby nature of over ripe Merlot has become even more appreciated by Pomerol winemakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{area around}} Chinon, Bourgueil and Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil {{produces}} {{the majority of}} the Loire Valley's red wine based on the <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc</b> grapeknown in this areas as Breton. The wines of the Chinon area are the softest and rich expression of the grape while the Bourgueil area produces more tannic and firm wines. The St-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil area produces the lightest colored wines. In the 19th century, the wines of the Chinon area were compared favorably by critics to the wines of Château Margaux and even today is considered some of the best expression of the <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc</b> grape. The wines from this region can achieve a nice purple color with notes of raspberry fruit and graphite. Unlike <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc</b> from warmer climates, Chinon are typically served slightly cooler than most red wine.|$|E
25|$|Across {{the world}} <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> {{is one of}} the twenty most widely planted grape varieties. Plantings are found {{throughout}} Europe, in the New World, China and Kazakhstan. In many regions, it is planted as a component of a Bordeaux-style blend such as Meritage, playing secondary role to Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. In parts of northeast Italy, Anjou-Saumur, Touraine and the right bank region of Bordeaux, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> both plays a more prominent role in blends and is vinted as a varietal.|$|E
25|$|Barbera is also {{a parent}} variety behind Ervi (crossed with Croatina), Incrocio Terezi I (with <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc),</b> Nigra (with Merlot) and Prodest (also with Merlot).|$|E
25|$|Peninsula Estate on Hakaimango Point {{was planted}} in 1986/87. These {{original}} plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc,</b> Merlot and Malbec, also now include Chardonnay and Syrah.|$|E
25|$|Crémants de Loire (sparking wines {{produced}} {{using traditional}} methods): {{a blend of}} Chenin blanc and Chardonnay {{with the addition of}} small amounts of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> and Pinot noir.|$|E
25|$|In Bordeaux, rosé {{production}} is permitted in most AOC {{using the same}} varieties as the region's well known reds—Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>franc,</b> Malbec, Petit Verdot and Carmenere.|$|E
25|$|In general, Merlot {{tends to}} be planted on {{predominantly}} clay soils while <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> {{is more likely to}} be on limestone outcroppings and Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec planted in the more gravelly soils.|$|E
25|$|Jurassic Ridge – Jurassic Ridge is a small, family-owned {{vineyard}} and winery, {{named for}} the surrounding geology. It produces hand-crafted Syrah, Montepulciano, Pinot gris and <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc.</b> Jurassic greywacke is a major feature of the terroir.|$|E
25|$|The Carmignano {{region was}} one of the first Tuscan regions to be {{permitted}} to use Cabernet Sauvignon and <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> in their DOC wines since those varieties had a long history of being grown in the region.|$|E
25|$|Anjou Mousseux AOC Sparkling wine AOC {{produced}} {{according to}} the traditional method. Most vineyards in the appellation overlap with those of Saumur, making {{the appearance of the}} Anjou Mousseux AOC on wine labels rare as producers favor using the more recognizable and marketable Saumur AOC designation. Both white and rosé sparkling wines are produced in this region with sweetness levels ranging from brut to demi-sec. The white sparkling wines must be composed of a minimum 60% Chenin blanc with <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc,</b> Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Grolleau, Malbec and Pineau d'Aunis permitted to fill out the remaining 40%. Rosé sparklers are made from a blend of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc,</b> Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Grolleau, Malbec and Pineau d'Aunis.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} {{red wine}} grapes include Barbera, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc,</b> Carignan, Grenache, Malbec, Mourvèdre, Petite Sirah, Petit Verdot, Sangiovese, and Tannat. Important white wine varietals include Chenin blanc, French Colombard, Gewürztraminer, Marsanne, Muscat Canelli, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Riesling, Roussane, Sémillon, Trousseau gris, and Viognier.|$|E
25|$|Red Bordeaux is {{generally}} {{made from a}} blend of grapes. Permitted grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc,</b> Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and rarely Carménère. Today Carménère is rarely used, with Château Clerc Milon, a fifth growth Bordeaux, {{being one of the}} few to still retain Carménère vines.|$|E
25|$|Saint Nicolas de Bourgueil {{produces}} both {{red wine}} and rosé wines though rosés usually account for only about 2% of the production. The main variety of the AOC is <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> (locally called Breton), which is allowed to be supplemented with up to 10% Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|E
25|$|Both red {{and white}} wines are made in Bordeaux. Red Bordeaux is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are {{generally}} made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc,</b> Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carménère.|$|E
25|$|The Lone Tree microbrewery, {{established}} in 2010, {{is located in}} Alon Shvut. In 2007, the Gush Etzion winery, a modern facility {{on the road to}} Alon Shvut, won a gold medal for its <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> in the annual Mediterranean International Wine and Spirit Challenge, also known as Terravino.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand red {{wines are}} {{typically}} {{made from a}} blend of varietals (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and much less often <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc,</b> Petit Verdot and Malbec), or Pinot noir. Recently, in Hawkes Bay, there have been wines made from Syrah, either solely or blends, as well as Tempranillo, Montepulciano and Sangiovese.|$|E
25|$|Pomerol is {{exclusively}} a {{red wine}} {{with the only}} permitted grape varieties for AOC wine being Merlot, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> (Bouchet), Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec (Pressac). Harvest yields are restricted {{to a maximum of}} 42 hectoliters/hectare (≈ 2.2 tons/acre) with the finished wine needing to attain a minimum alcohol level of at least 10.5%.|$|E
25|$|Broke Fordwich {{accounts}} for around 14% {{of all the}} Hunter Valley's plantings. More than third-quarter of the vineyard land in the area is dedicated to Chardonnay, Semillon, Verdelho, Shiraz, Pinot noir and Merlot. Other varieties grown in the area include Cabernet Sauvignon, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc,</b> Chambourcin, Malbec, Traminer, Barbera, Trebbiano, Viognier, Sangiovese, Tempranillo and Dolcetto.|$|E
25|$|Anjou-Villages AOC The {{boundaries}} of this red wine only AOC was first delimited in 1986 {{but did not}} go into effect until the 1991 harvest. Made entirely from <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> and/or Cabernet Sauvignon, these wines have an aging potential of 2–6 years after harvest. There are 46 communes in the appellation allowed to produce grapes for this AOC.|$|E
25|$|Besides Pinot Noir, {{the area}} is known for {{producing}} good Merlot wines as well as white wines (mostly Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc). Recently, however, the area has gained traction because of its promising <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> red wines, which have added to the diversity of Argentine wine with their hint of red fruit, elegant tannins and peppery taste.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{reliable}} statistics that break down grape production by variety. It {{is believed that}} the most widely planted variety is Sultana, also known as Thompson Seedless, with at least 3,600km2 (880,000 acres) dedicated to it. The second most common variety is Airén. Other popular varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon blanc, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc,</b> Merlot, Grenache, Tempranillo, Riesling, and Chardonnay.|$|E
25|$|For wines to be {{labelled}} {{under the}} Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil AOC designation, the grapes must {{be limited to}} a harvest yield no greater than 55 hl/ha (approximately 3 tons/acre). The blend must be made primarily from <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> with Cabernet Sauvignon limited to making up no more than 10% of the blend. The finished wine must contain at least 9.5% alcohol by volume.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cabernet</b> <b>Franc</b> {{can adapt}} {{to a wide variety}} of {{vineyard}} soil types but seems to thrive in sandy, chalk soils, producing heavier, more full bodied wines there. In the Loire Valley, terroir based differences can be perceived between wines made from grapes grown in gravel terraces versus tuffeau slopes. The grape is highly yield sensitive, with over-cropping producing wines with more green, vegetal notes.|$|E
