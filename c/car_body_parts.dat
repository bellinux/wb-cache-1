The thesis has been performed at Chalmers University of Technology in cooperation with CEVT AB, a development centre for future cars of the Geely Group. Companies active in the car industry uses different methods when fastening plastic exterior <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> and standardized solution is yet to be found. Previous research of development is limited in this area and the issue comes and goes in accordance to automotive trends. Instead, current fastening methods are based mostly on practical experience and knowledge. On behalf of CEVT, an evaluation is made regarding which fastening method is preferable to use for attaching exterior <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> with respect to cost, quality, productivity and ergonomics. This area is therefore of great interest to the car manufacturing industry in addition to its suppliers and customers. Hence, this thesis delivers: • A complete analysis of the fastening methods used in car manufacturing of exterior <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> • An evaluation matrix that treats qualitative data • A cost model tool designed to help CEVT compare investments and return rate of the fastening methods • Guidelines regarding design aspects and common quality issues for the fastening methods The course of this thesis is based on interviews with suppliers and experts in combination with study visits at Volvo Car’s production plant as well as technical workshops. The results of this thesis shows that a majority of today’s car manufacturers uses mechanical attachments for joining exterior <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> and only a minority group of pioneers combines mechanical attachments with adhesive tape for wheel fender flare extensions. The process mapping and time studies shows that adhesive taping is a more complex and time demanding process in production when compared to snap-fit fasteners. The study has shown that it is not about what fastening method to use, it is about how to design for the right application. The use of immature methods is a symptom of a larger, organizational problem caused by late changes, which should be further explored...|$|E

In case of indirect hot stamping processes, producing <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> with tailored properties, cooling paths occur causing diffusionless and diffusion controlled phase transformations. The volume expansion caused by the phase transformation of face-centred cubic (fcc) into body-centred cubic (bcc) and the martensitic formation of body-centred tetragonal (bct) leads to transformation induced strains that are important for the calculation of overall stresses in hot stamped <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts.</b> To calculate the strain and stress state correctly, {{it is necessary to}} model the diffusionless and diffusion controlled phase transformation phenomena, taking into account the boundary conditions of indirect hot stamping processes. The existing material models are analysed and extended in order to improve their prediction accuracy in calculating the amount and distribution of ferrite, perlite, bainite and martensite during the whole process of annealing.
