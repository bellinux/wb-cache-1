5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the <b>crossover</b> <b>point</b> to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E
5|$|During {{the process}} of meiotic cell division, an event called genetic {{recombination}} or crossing-over can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one chromatid is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles. The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together; genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a <b>crossover</b> <b>point</b> will occur between them. This is known as genetic linkage.|$|E

The <b>crossover</b> <b>points</b> in the data here can therefore be interpreted in this way, as points at which the correlations in the sequences change. It is important to understand that these <b>crossover</b> <b>points</b> (and box sizes in general) relate to the sequence length. For example, a box size of 10 indicates detrending across 10 consecutive IAIs. As the IAIs themselves can be of variable length the box size does not relate to a particular simulation time. Future investigation is needed to determine the relationship between the model and <b>crossover</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R

40|$|We use {{molecular}} dynamics simulations in explicit water and salt $(Na^+) $ {{to determine the}} effect of varying the number of <b>crossover</b> <b>points</b> onthe structure and stability of the PX 65 paranemic crossover DNA molecule and its JXM topoisomers (M denotes the number of missing <b>crossover</b> <b>points),</b> recently synthesized by the Seeman group at New York University. We find that PX 65, with six <b>crossover</b> <b>points,</b> is the most stable, and that the stability decreases monotonically with the number of <b>crossover</b> <b>points</b> PX 65 > JX 1 > JX 2 > JX 3 > JX 4, with 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2 <b>crossover</b> <b>points,</b> respectively. Thus, for PX 65 /JX 1, the strain energy is ~ 3 kcal/mol/bp, while it is ~ 13 kcal/mol/bp forJX 2, JX 3 and JX 4. Another measure of the stability is the change in the structure from the minimum energy structure to the equilibrium structure at 300 K, denoted as root-mean-square deviation incoordinates (CRMSD). We find that CRMSD is ~ 3. 5 Å for PX 65, increases to 6 Å for JX 1 and increases to 10 Å forJX 2 /JX 3 /JX 4. As the number of <b>crossover</b> <b>points</b> decreases, the distance between the two double helical domains of the PX/JX molecules increases from similar to 20 Å for PX 65 to 23 Å for JX 4. This indicates that JX 2, JX 3 and JX 4 are less likely to form, at least in with $Na^+$. However, in all the cases, the two double helical domains have average helicoidal parameters similar to a typical B-DNA of similar length and base sequence...|$|R

500|$|Further, poorly {{designed}} systems often leave everything below about 120Hz (or even higher) to the subwoofer, {{meaning that}} the subwoofer handles frequencies which the ear can use for sound source localization, thus introducing an undesirable subwoofer [...] "localization effect". This is usually due to poor crossover designs or choices (too high <b>crossover</b> <b>point</b> or insufficient crossover slope) used in many computer and home theater systems; localization also comes from port noise and from typically large amounts of harmonic distortion in the subwoofer design. Home subwoofers sold individually usually include crossover circuitry to assist integration into an existing system.|$|E

500|$|The {{complexes}} {{constructed in}} structural DNA nanotechnology use topologically branched nucleic acid structures containing junctions. (In contrast, most biological DNA exists as an unbranched double helix.) One {{of the simplest}} branched structures is a four-arm junction that consists of four individual DNA strands, portions of which are complementary in a specific pattern. Unlike in natural Holliday junctions, each arm in the artificial immobile four-arm junction has a different base sequence, causing the junction point to be fixed at a certain position. [...] Multiple junctions can be combined in the same complex, {{such as in the}} widely used double-crossover (DX) structural motif, which contains two parallel double helical domains with individual strands crossing between the domains at two crossover points. Each <b>crossover</b> <b>point</b> is, topologically, a four-arm junction, but is constrained to one orientation, in contrast to the flexible single four-arm junction, providing a rigidity that makes the DX motif suitable as a structural building block for larger DNA complexes.|$|E

2500|$|In typical installations, subwoofers are {{physically}} {{separated from the}} rest of the speaker cabinets. [...] Because of propagation delay, their output may be somewhat out of phase from another subwoofer (on another channel) or slightly out of phase with the rest of the sound. [...] Consequently, a subwoofer's power amp often has a phase-delay adjustment (approximately 1 ms of delay is required for each additional foot of separation from the listener) which may improve performance of the system as a whole at subwoofer frequencies (and perhaps an octave or so above the <b>crossover</b> <b>point).</b> [...] However, the influence of room resonances (sometimes called standing waves) is typically so large that such issues are secondary in practice. Subwoofers are widely used in large concert and mid-sized venue sound reinforcement systems. Subwoofer cabinets are often built with a bass reflex port (i.e., a hole cut into the cabinet with a tube attached to it), a design feature which if properly engineered improves bass performance and increases efficiency.|$|E
