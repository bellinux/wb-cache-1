Since 2001, eLab researchers have leveraged use of a diverse international <b>consumer</b> <b>panel</b> to conduct cutting-edge research through robust web-based experiments and surveys. Led by Associate Professor of Marketing Jennifer Escalas, eLab's studies address a wide range of industry-relevant topics concerning online consumer behavior and its implications for business, government, and individual practice.|$|E
25|$|Tasting {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the sensory analysis (also referred to as organoleptic analysis) of wine. Employing a trained or <b>consumer</b> <b>panel,</b> oenologists may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. Difference tests are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.|$|E
500|$|Researchers at the University of Maine have {{actively}} {{been developing}} value-added green crab products, {{with the goals}} of driving business interest, stimulating a commercial green crab fishery, and alleviating predation effects. Specifically, one study evaluated the consumer acceptability of empanadas (fried, stuffed pastries) which contained varying amounts of green crab mince meat. It was reported that the empanadas were rated between [...] "like slightly" [...] and [...] "like moderately" [...] for overall acceptability by a <b>consumer</b> <b>panel</b> (n=87). Furthermore, about two-thirds of the panelists would [...] "probably" [...] or [...] "definitely" [...] buy the empanadas if available locally. [...] Additionally, the same researchers developed a patty product made from green crab mince meat using restructuring additives (transglutaminase, dried egg white, isolated soy protein). It was reported that although a successful green crab patty was developed, the restructuring additives may have had greater functionality in a raw crab meat system, as opposed to the fully cooked mince that was utilized in the present study. The results from both studies are considered promising, especially considering that these were initial rounds of green crab product development.|$|E

In France, Sofres acquired Secodip in 1992 and soon started planning the development of new <b>consumer</b> <b>panels</b> in Asia and Latin America. Both groups came together in 1997 when Taylor Nelson AGB and Sofres merged to create Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS). All <b>consumer</b> <b>panels</b> were then taken into a specific division that in 2003 started using the TNS Worldpanel brand.|$|R

40|$|To date, it is {{difficult}} to get reliable and detailed data on real consumer purchasing behaviour and market structure in general for the German organic food market.

Thus, the recent development of panel research on the organic food market is analysed in this paper.

40|$|Since food {{is one of}} {{the central}} {{elements}} of all human be-ings, a high interest exists in exploring temporal and spatial food and dietary patterns of humans. Predominantly, data for such investigations stem from <b>consumer</b> <b>panels</b> which continuously capture food consumption patterns from indi-viduals and households. In this work we leverage data from a large online recipe platform which is frequently used in the German speaking regions in Europe and explore (i) the association between geographic proximity and shared food preferences and (ii) to what extent temporal information helps to predict the food preferences of users. Our results reveal that online food preferences of geographically closer regions are more similar than those of distant ones and show that specific types of ingredients are more popular on specific days of the week. The observed patterns can successfully be mapped to known real-world patterns which suggests that existing methods for the investigation of dietary and food patterns (e. g., <b>consumer</b> <b>panels)</b> may benefit from incorpo-rating the vast amount of data generated by users browsing recipes on the Web...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} aimed thrrough the knowlidge of alimentary prefferance of some <b>consumer</b> <b>panels</b> upon studying of alimentary prefferance tests. The {{tests have}} been accomplished on 5 <b>panels</b> of 20 <b>consumers</b> taken by occurance. The global appreciation of each consumer was graded on a gustatory form from 1 to 9. The {{results of the}} organoleptic analysis tests permits a global estimation (average grade) given by the <b>consumer</b> <b>panels</b> {{in the case of}} the two experimental panels (conventional toamtoes and organic toamtoes. The treaty of the results was accomplished through a Sigmasat logicy which was used for parameter analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Tomatoes were harvested from 13 experimental polygons on the base of CBT method. The tomatoes were picked in the 8 - 10 coloration range (CBT Method) and kept 28 grades Celsius for 4 days to obtain a uniform pattern regarding the coloration rate and representative caliber of the studied variety. The pattern was finally chosen in the 11 - 12 coloration rate (CBT/Dutch method adopted by OCDE), the fruits being placed to outdoor temperatures for 6 - 8 hours before sampling and analysis.
