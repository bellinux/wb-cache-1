Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum <b>cutting</b> <b>velocity,</b> the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} plunge milling. The cutting force and machine stability both are influenced by machining parameters. Frequency domain model can be used to estimate the machining stability.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance evaluation {{of three different}} cutting fluids used in a minimal quantity lubrication (MQL) system. The MQL system, developed in-house at the University of Malaya, was capable of delivering high <b>velocity</b> <b>cutting</b> fluid in narrow pulsed jet forms {{at a rate of}} 2 ml/min and a pressure of 20 MPa. The three cutting fluids chosen were neat oil, soluble oil and semi-synthetic cutting fluids. The experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of the fluids at various <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> of 20, 40 and 60 m/min and feed rates of 0. 05, 0. 06 and 0. 07 mm/tooth. The results were measured in terms of the average surface roughness of the machined workpiece, the cutting forces and the maximum flank wear. In addition, the resultant chip formations were also observed. Analysis of the results has shown that in general, neat oil had performed the best in low <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> and feed rates. On the other hand, soluble oil gave the lowest cutting forces and flank wears at high <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> and feed rated as compared to neat oil and synthetic cutting fluid. It was observed that performance of soluble oil does not drastically change with variation to the <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> and feed rates. Thus, the choice of soluble oil would be most appropriate for general machining usage. With suitable machining parameter selection, water-mixed cutting fluids (soluble oil and semi synthetics) performed comparatively well to deliver low surface roughness results. Therefore, this can be an economical choice for use in industrial production processes...|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis:During robotic milling of the {{temporal}} bone, forces on the cutting burr may be lowered by choice of cutting parameters. Background: Robotic bone removal systems are used in or-thopedic procedures, but they are currently not accurate enough for safe use in otologic surgery. We propose {{the use of a}} bone-attached milling robot to achieve the required accuracy and speed. To design such a robot and plan its milling trajectories, it is necessary to predict the forces that the robot must exert and withstand under likely cutting conditions. Materials and Methods: We measured forces during bone re-moval for several surgical burr types, drill angles, depths of cut, <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities,</b> and bone types (cortical/surface bone and mastoid) on human temporal bone specimens. Results: Lower forces were observed for 5 -mm diameter burrs compared with 3 -mm burrs for a given bone removal rate. Higher linear <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> and greater <b>cutting</b> depths in-dependently resulted in higher forces. For combinations of velocities and depths that resulted in the same overall bone re-moval rate, lower forces were observed in parameter sets that combined higher <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> and shallower depths. Lower mean forces and higher variability were observed in the mastoid compared with cortical/surface bone. Conclusion: Forces during robotic milling of {{the temporal}} bone can be predicted from the parameter sets tested in this study. This information can be used to guide the design of a suffi-ciently rigid and powerful bone-attached milling robot and to plan efficient milling trajectories. To reduce the time of the surgical intervention without creating very large forces, high linear <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> may be combined with shallow depths of cut. Faster and deeper cuts may be used in mastoid bone compared with the cortical bone for a chosen force threshold...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} aimed at {{providing}} a comprehensive analysis of the contact problem in orthogonal cutting based on the simple assumption that contact is governed by a Coulomb law. Effects of the sliding friction coefficient and of the cutting conditions are analyzed in details. The problem is analyzed numerically by using an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian Finite Element technique. In parallel, analytical models are developed allowing us to interpret the numerical data and {{to make them more}} meaningful. Distributions along the tool–chip interface are analyzed for stresses, temperature and sliding velocities. The shear stress exerted along the sticking zone is found to be equal to the shear flow stress of the work-material. Of particular significance is the investigation of the interface heating as the chip temperature appears to be a key factor governing the contact regime. The increasing of the chip temperature along the tool rake face appears to be mainly controlled by the mean value of the shear stress on the rake face and the Péclet number taking into account the phenomena of advection and heat diffusion. At low values of the friction coefficient the contact is governed by chip–tool sliding for the whole range of cutting speeds considered here (1 ms- 1 ⩽V⩽ 50 ms- 1). For larger values of the sliding friction coefficient, a transition to a contact dominated by sticking is found when the cutting speed is increased. Then, contact variables appear to be mostly determined by the value of the flow stress of the work-material with a negligible effect of the sliding friction coefficient. Thermal softening of the flow stress of the work-material governs the relationship between cutting variables and cutting conditions. An asymptotic regime occurs at relatively high <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities</b> (larger than 10 m/s) and for values of the sliding friction coefficient larger than 0. 4. The analysis of the effects of cutting conditions on the morphology of the secondary shear zone reveals the existence of a boundary layer regime in the range of high <b>cutting</b> <b>velocities.</b> This is in keeping with the occurrence of the asymptotic regime mentioned above. Despite the simplicity of the contact model used, reasonable agreement is obtained with respect to experimental trends. The interplay between numerical and analytical approaches happens to be fruitful for understanding which are the main parameters influencing the contact variables, for checking the consistency of the numerical approach and for offering a route for future improvements of machining models...|$|R
