50|$|Copper(I) {{thiocyanate}} (or <b>cuprous</b> <b>thiocyanate)</b> is a coordination polymer with formula CuSCN. It is an air-stable, white solid used as {{a precursor}} for the preparation of other thiocyanate salts.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{estimation}} of faecal fat excretion using <b>cuprous</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> as a continuous marker is described. Results obtained from a single stool sample are {{in close agreement with}} those from a three-day collection using this technique. The method is simpler and more accurate than collections done without a marker...|$|E
40|$|The main {{technical}} {{difficulty in}} the use of insoluble markers for faeces such as chromium sesquioxide (Whitby and Lang, 1960) or barium sulphate (Dick, 1967) is in the solubilization of these very inert compounds. Digestions with perchloric acid or chelations with EDTA are time-consuming pro-cedures. Accordingly a search has been made for a compound which although insoluble under physio-logical conditions, could be decomposed by relatively mild chemical treatment. <b>Cuprous</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> (CuSCN) is a compound which has solubility characteristics in water rather similar to those of barium sulphate. In neutral or mildly alkaline conditions the solubility is about 0 5 mg % (BaSO 4 0. 25 mg%) and in 0 1 N HC...|$|E
40|$|The {{previous}} {{work on this}} subject, is considered, showing that no satisfactory methods have so far been produced. The application of monometallic electrode systems to precipitation and oxidation and reduction reactions and the method of conducting titrations are discussed. Bimetallic electrode systems are considered with special reference to a new method due to Foulk and Bawden. The following methods have been Investigated: (1) The precipitation of <b>cuprous</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> from a copper sulphate solution reduced by bisulphite (Muller and Rudolph's method) {{was found to be}} too easily influenced by the bisulphite concentration, time of titration and temperature to be practicable. (2) The precipitation of <b>cuprous</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> by excess standard potassium thiocyanate solution and back-titration with silver nitrate was found to give excellent results with copper sulphate concentrations greater than N/ 25 and in the presence of zinc and iron. (3) The reduction of copper sulphate in hydrochloric acid solution by stannous chloride gives a sharp end-point if the acid concentration is high but the results vary with this concentration and are always too high. (4) The titration of copper sulphate with sodium thiosulphate, potassium cyanide and iodide respectively. These methods are not satisfactory, no distinct end point being obtained. (5) The titration of the iodine liberated by the action of copper sulphate and potassium iodide with thiosulphate gives satisfactory end-points in acetic acid solution using a mono-metallic system of electrodes. Foulk and Bawden's method however gives far sharper end-points and is applicable to copper concentrations greater than N/ 250 and in the presence of many metals. Adaptations in the presence of ferric salts are discussed. Replacing thiosulphate with arsenlte solution is satisfactory with copper sulphate solutions more concentrated than N/ 50. Methods 3 L and 5 are recommended as satisfactory. <p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{thiocyanate}} ions on the corrosion of copper in 0. 1 M HClO 4 {{was investigated in}} the presence of various concentrations of thiocyanate ions using weight loss and polarization methods. The corrosion rate decreased markedly {{in the presence of}} thiocyanate ions and maximum percentage protection (93. 7 %) was obtained at 10 - 3 M thiocyanate ions. The drift of the corrosion potential in the less noble direction and the increase in the anodic Tafel slope are consistent with the inhibition by thiocyanate ions of both the anodic and the cathodic reactions of the corrosion process. The variation in the corrosion rate with the concentration of thiocyanate ions is attributed to the specific adsorption of thiocyanate ions and precipitation of <b>cuprous</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> on the copper surface.

40|$|<b>Cuprous</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> (CuSCN) {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} on ITO, spin-coated TiO 2 and glass substrates by successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method in ethylene glycol (EG) solution. Crystallinity, surface morphology and optical {{properties of the}} CuSCN thin films were characterized by XRD, scanning electron microscope and transmission spectra respectively. Results show that deposition of CuSCN is greatly affected by properties of substrates and solutions. CuSCN thin film deposited on ITO is dense and crystalline, while CuSCN thin film deposited on spin-coated TiO 2 is particulate and amorphous. Roughness of CuSCN thin film increases with increasing cycles, resulting in decrease of transmittance of CuSCN thin film. At optimal conditions (ITO substrate, 20 cycles), the CuSCN thin film is dense and uniform in surface morphology, transmittance of which in the visible range is about 60 %...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method for}} the {{indirect}} determination of sodium cefotaxime by the extraction-flotation of <b>cuprous</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> {{is described in}} this paper. The experiment indicated that the degradation of sodium cefotaxime {{took place in the}} presence of 0. 20 M sodium hydroxide in a boiling water bath for 40 min. At pH 4. 0, the thiol group (-SH) of the degradation product of sodium cefotaxime could reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) for the formation of the emulsion CuSCN precipitation in the presence of ammonium thiocyanate. By determining the residual amount of Cu(II) in the solution and calculating the flotation yield of CuSCN, the indirect determination of sodium cefotaxime can be achieved. When the concentration of Cu(II) was 5. 0 g mL- 1, a good linear relationship was obtained between the flotation yield of CuSCN and the amount of sodium cefotaxime in the range of 0. 50 ~ 20 g mL- 1. The linear equation is E = 1. 329 + 2. 654 C with a correlation coefficient r = 0. 9988. The detection limit of sodium cefotaxime of this proposed method eval-uated by calibration curve (3 /k) was found to be 0. 39 g mL- 1. Every parameter has been optimized and the reaction mechanism has been studied. This method has been successfully applied to the determination of sodium cefotaxime in pharmaceutical formulations, human serum, and urine samples, respectively. An-alytical results obtained with this novel method are satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|A new precise {{chemical}} method {{has been developed}} for the compositional analysis of carbon brush. The major chemical constituents of carbon brush are carbon (C), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and tin (Sn), while the minor constituents are silica (SiO 2), iron (Fe), and molybdenum (Me). The analytical techniques employed for graphitic carbon, Pb, Sn, and SiO 2 analysis were gravimetry (Loss in ignition, as PbSO 4. as metastannic acid, and as SiO 2, respectively) and titremetry for copper (lodimetry). Trace impurities of Fe and Mo were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). On the same sample, gravimetric methods as above have been compared for Cu (as <b>cuprous</b> <b>thiocyanate)</b> by gravimetry and for Pb and Sn by normal titremetry (EDTA with xylenol orange as indicator). XRD confirmed the presence of graphitic carbon in carbon brush. The major constituents (w/w %) of carbon brush for Cu. C, Pb, Sn, and SiO 2 {{were found to be}} 40. 5 +/- 0. 3, 39. 5 +/- 0. 25, 9. 5 +/- 0. 10, 10. 2 +/- 0. 13, and 0. 45 +/- 0. 07, respectively, and minor constituents Fe and Mo were found to be 4. 2 +/- 0. 21 and 1. 6 +/- 0. 2 mg kg(- 1), respectively. The titremetry Cu results obtained are comparable by gravimetry, which were 40. 8 +/- 0. 5. The gravimetric results obtained for Pb and Sn are comparable by titremetry and FAAS results of SiO 2, which were 9. 3 +/- 0. 30, 10. 1 +/- 0. 2, and 0. 25 +/- 0. 09 (w/w %), respectively. The comparability of the above gravimetric and titremetry methods for various constituents are in good agreement with the methods presented in this paper for carbon brush and {{have been found to be}} reproducible within an uncertainty of 1. 5 % RSD...|$|E
