2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and <b>cable</b> <b>steering</b> arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E

Such changes were usually made available as kits to enable existing owners to upgrade their own cars retrospectively.|$|E
5000|$|... ''''Brompton Caribou'''' is 28 feet 6 inches long, 7 feet 6 {{inches wide}} and has a depth of 2 feet 9 inches boat {{commonly}} known as a [...] "Gator Tug", or [...] "Winch boat" [...] made by the Russel-Hipwell Engines Company in 1955 and is hull number 1058. It is made with a welded 3/16" [...] steel hull in the clinker configuration and a cabin made of 18 gauge steel. It has a <b>cable</b> <b>steering</b> system with a plate steel rudder, 26" [...] diameter Propeller with a rather heavy duty shield around the prop made of round bar to shop logs and debris from damaging the propeller, English made Lister model FR4 4 cylinder water-cooled diesel engine producing 36 hp at 1,800 rpm and a Twin Disc model MG-61 reversing marine gearbox with a 3:1 gear ratio. This boat also originally had a Russel-Hipweel winch, model W-434 that was driven by a PTO {{on the front of}} the engine but it has since been removed. The standard models have a simple rectangle cabin with a large sliding windows on both the port and starboard sides, a smaller sliding window and a door that opens to the inside on the front, and a little sliding door on the back of the cabin. They usually have the exhaust pipe going out through the side of the hull approximately a foot below the bulwarks on an angle facing aft, but many have had the pipe removed and installed going up through the roof of the cabin.|$|E

50|$|The {{suspension}} is by half-elliptical {{springs in}} front and behind, those at the back being underhung. The front springs are flat-set, held out-of-centre and shackled forward. Dampers are fitted front and back. The four-wheel brakes are <b>cable</b> operated. <b>Steering</b> is by Marles cam and roller.|$|R

40|$|In the United States {{there are}} over 1. 4 million {{wheelchair}} users, roughly 25 % of whom have medical conditions that can result in the need for manual wheelchairs which can be operated by a single upper appendage. Few manual one-armed wheelchairs are currently available. Existing designs have poor maneuverability and require the user to have considerable strength, endurance, and cognitive ability. The team developed a design which utilizes <b>cable</b> <b>steering,</b> cantilever brakes, and a ratchet and pawl propulsion system, {{all of which can}} be controlled simultaneously with one arm. The design exhibits a high degree of maneuverability, intuitive steering, braking, and propulsion controls, and requires less strength to operate than devices currently on the market...|$|E
50|$|The Wheatland Ferry is a cable ferry {{that connects}} Marion County and Yamhill County across the Willamette River in the U.S. state of Oregon. The ferry travels {{approximately}} 580 feet (178 meters) across the river, {{depending on the}} height of the river, and is powered by two electric motors connected to an on-board diesel generator. The ferry is supported by two steel cables, one under water on the downriver side, and one overhead on the upriver side. The ferry also uses the overhead <b>cable</b> for <b>steering.</b>|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the turbulence caused the torque tube driving the port elevator to break; this would allow the port elevator to move freely, but the pilots would still retain approximately half of their attitude control. The aircraft also had a defective push–pull rod and worn <b>steering</b> <b>cables,</b> although it is not certain if this was part of the cause.|$|R
50|$|Their armor was {{inadequate}} in two respects: both {{the deck and}} the stern were uncovered. The lack of deck armor made them vulnerable to plunging fire, which they encountered most famously at the Battle of Fort Donelson. The gaps in the armor left the <b>steering</b> <b>cables</b> uncovered, so at Fort Donelson and other encounters, their steering was knocked out rather easily.|$|R
50|$|The chassis again had all {{independent}} suspension but now by coil springs fitted in oil tight cylinders {{with the oil}} acting as damper. The springs were horizontal at the front and vertical at the rear. The body was fabricated from aluminium. The braking system used a Bowden type <b>cable</b> operated system. <b>Steering</b> was by rack and pinion. The gear change lever was mounted horizontally just below the steering wheel.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} geared towards the {{redesign}} {{and implementation of}} a crimping tool {{for use in the}} manufacturing of catheters produced by Medtronic Inc. Catheters require two <b>steering</b> <b>cables</b> to maneuver the end of the catheter through the body. The <b>steering</b> <b>cables</b> have a sleeve that is crimped onto their end in order to hold the cable in place inside the catheter steering handle. The current crimping tool, designed by Astro Tool Corp, has a few problems associated with its design. Additionally we are {{trying to get rid of}} a step in the manufacturing process that involves the adhesive, cyanoacrylate, being placed inside the sleeve to be crimped. The cyanoacrylate is added to increase the strength of the crimp from three to four pounds of force in shear to around eighteen pounds. However to simplify the manufacturing process we will need to come up with a crimp style for our device that will increase the allowable axial force to eighteen pounds with a metal to metal crimp alone and eliminate the need for an adhesive. The redesigned crimping tool will need high tolerance fit for each crimp as well as a repeatability of crimps for each cycle...|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, Red Triangle {{negotiated}} the legal {{transfer of the}} Alvis car trademarks. The following year, the company announced that the 4.3 Litre Short Chassis tourer would once again be available. All Alvis' records remain intact at the company’s Kenilworth headquarters along with a large stock of period parts. One of the men to have worked on the very last Alvis car produced in 1967 is still retained by Red Triangle in a training capacity. Built to the original plans, the new car has been named the [...] "Continuation Series", to reflect the 73-year interruption in its production between 1937 and 2010. It differs only in detail from the pre-war examples: for emissions, the engine is governed by an {{electronic fuel injection system}} with electronic ignition, brakes are hydraulic rather than <b>cable,</b> the <b>steering</b> column collapsible and the rear light arrangement reconfigured to conform to modern standards.|$|R
25|$|The {{explosion}} {{punched a}} 50-cm (20-inch) {{hole on the}} left side of the fuselage. Investigators from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) concluded that no emergency procedures had been started in the cockpit. The cockpit voice recorder, located in the tail section of the aircraft, was found in a field by police searchers within 24 hours. There was no evidence of a distress signal; a 180-millisecond hissing noise could be heard as the explosion destroyed the aircraft's communications centre. Although the explosion was in the aircraft hold, the effect was magnified by the large difference in pressure between the aircraft's interior and exterior, i.e., uncontrolled decompression of the fuselage. The <b>steering</b> <b>cables</b> disrupted and the fuselage pitched downwards and to the left.|$|R
40|$|The “A. A. Augustus” {{was built}} in 1909 by the American Ship Building Co. of Lorain, Ohio. The steel {{propeller}} vessel was first owned by Pioneer Steamship Co. (Hutchinson & Co., Mgrs.) of Cleveland. In 1961, ownership and the vessel’s name changed as she was acquired by Hindman Transportation Co., Ltd. of Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada; she was renamed the “Howard Hindman” (Canada 302710). Ownership transferred again in 1969, and she became the property of Marine Salvage, Ltd. of Port Colborne, Ontario. In April 1969, her <b>steering</b> <b>cable</b> parted causing damage to the vessel. On June 5, 1969, she passed down Port Colborne {{on her way to}} Bilboa, Spain. The “Howard Hindman” arrived in Spain on September 6, 1969 and was scrapped...|$|R
50|$|In 1978 Moynihan won a {{gold medal}} coxing the British Lightweight VIII in the World Rowing Championships held in Copenhagen. In the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, he ignored {{pressure}} to boycott for political reasons. He was cox for the Great Britain men's rowing VIII winning a silver medal; during the race, the <b>steering</b> <b>cables</b> to the rudder broke and Moynihan had to reach behind him to grasp the rudder bar. In this unorthodox - and extremely difficult - manner, he steered the boat for most of the race. He did this so well, that most of the crew did not realise what had happened until after the race was over. In the 1981 Munich World Championships he coxed the British VIII to silver medal success.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{some control}} applications in electric power systems. The work {{consists of the}} four parts: interaction between DC <b>cables</b> and ship <b>steering</b> autopilots; frequency estimation; computer relaying; field tests using load switching to damp power oscillations. The first three parts are based on four papers that are given in Appendix A-D. The thesis presents supplementary text to these papers. The last chapter is more self contained and presents field tests from a small hydro power station. These tests show that load switching is an excellent method to damp power oscillations. A proof used in stochastic analysis of fault locators is presented in Appendix E. The first paper presents novel results on interaction of DC <b>cables</b> and ship <b>steering</b> autopilots. Simulations with a non-linear model show that a ship using steering autopilot with a magnetic compass can be captured by a DC cable, i. e, the ship tracks the cable. A full scale experimental study has been performed at the Kontiskan HVDC link. Good agreement was obtained between measurements and computer sinulations. The second paper presents a method for frequency estimation in power systems by demodulation of two complex signals. The third and fourth paper presents some improvements of the differential equation algorithm (DEA) {{that can be used}} for transmission line protection. The third paper uses the determinant to explain why isolated estimates from the DEA can be very poor. A median filter is proposed to reject these poor estimates. The fourth paper suggests the followinmg improvements to the DEA: fault classification; intermediate filtering and a new algorithm for three phase faults. Simulation results indicate a nominal operation time of 5 - 7 ms for three phase faults and slightly longer for other fault type...|$|R

5000|$|At 11:43 am, {{about an}} hour and a half from Tokyo, the bomb {{exploded}} while Flight 434 cruised on autopilot 33000 ft above the Japanese island of Minami Daitō (near Okinawa Island and approximately 260 miles (420 km) southwest of Tokyo). The explosion ripped the body of 24-year-old Haruki Ikegami (Ikegami Haruki) in half. He was a Japanese businessman occupying the seat where the bomb was placed. [...] Ten passengers sitting in the seats in front of and behind Ikegami were also injured. One needed urgent medical care. The bomb tore out a two square-foot (0.2 m2) portion of the cabin floor, revealing the cargo hold underneath, but leaving the fuselage of the plane intact. The explosion missed the center fuel tank, saving the airplane from a deadly fiery explosion. The rapid expansion of energy from the bomb caused the plane to expand vertically slightly, damaging <b>cables</b> to the <b>steering</b> and aileron controls. The bomb's orientation caused the energy to be mostly absorbed by Ikegami; he was killed but the other passengers and the plane were not catastrophically damaged.|$|R

Set {{two more}} world Records - Speed record across the Indian Ocean 57days 10hours 58 Minutes - {{with an average}} speed of 2.65 knots. Brown's {{original}} intention was to go for Durban, South Africa however early in the voyage a set of three storms knocked them too far North to make this landfall. They then changed course to head for Mombasa in Kenya but owing to rising terrorism the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office recommended no travel to Kenya. They then changed course and landed on the Seychelles. Brown had to evacuate Dr Shane Usher due to him being severely burned by boiling water mid ocean reducing the crew down to 6. A critical <b>Steering</b> <b>cable</b> broke on 'Avalon' which forced the crew to manually steer the boat which reduced the rowing deck down to two rowers per shift - half what {{it is meant to}} be. On the way into the Seychelles they had an incident with a suspected Pirate vessel. Brown bluffed that they were in fact a Royal Navy 'Q' boat and that they were rendezvousing with their Frigate in 30 mins. The suspected pirate vessel then fled. This was called his 'Captain Phillips' moment. Brown supported 'Save the Elephants' as a charity.|$|R
