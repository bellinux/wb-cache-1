5|$|On November 20, 2012, a melee {{occurred}} at a Newark City Council meeting attended by Booker. The nine-seat council was {{to vote on the}} successor to the seat vacated by newly elected U.S. Representative Donald M. Payne,Jr. Booker's opponents on the council, including Ras Baraka, sought to appoint John Sharpe James, son of the former mayor, while Booker and his supporters favored Shanique Speight. Booker attended the meeting to deal with the eventuality of the lack of a quorum or a tie vote, in which state law would allow him to cast a deciding vote. After Baraka was refused an opportunity to address the council by acting Council President Anibal Ramos,Jr., Baraka and two other council members walked away in protest. Booker cast the deciding vote for Speight. Supporters of James stormed the stage and were held back by riot police, who eventually used pepper spray on some members of the crowd. Baraka later blamed Booker for inciting the disturbance, while Booker refused <b>comment</b> <b>to</b> the media after the vote.|$|E
5|$|When Taylor was {{ten years}} old, several years before started the sport, her {{grandmother}} made a <b>comment</b> <b>to</b> her after having seen the game that Taylor could play and one day make the Paralympics. Only {{when she got to}} high school, in August 2009, did she start playing the sport. After only a month playing the sport, Taylor was selected for the New South Wales team that competed at the 2009 National Championships, where she was the second leading scorer in what was her first major competition. Playing again for New South Wales, she competed in the 2011 National Championships, and was named the tournament's MVP. At the 2012 Australian National Championships, her New South Wales team finished second, and she was awarded the Ladies' MVP and the Kenaghan Medal, which was awarded {{at the end of the}} tournament.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is {{tasked with}} winning the Scranton White Pages account. However, the CEO is a woman, and Dwight has trouble selling to women. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{and the women}} of the office teach him how to {{interact}} with women. The lesson, which is taught by Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), goes nowhere, and they give up. Pam goes with Dwight to the White Pages, only to find out that the buyer is Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin). Jan was expecting to meet with CEO David Wallace, and reprimands her assistant for the confusion. Pam quickly realizes that the meeting was just a ruse to take revenge on David for firing her five years prior. However, Dwight remains determined to make the sale, so he has Pam stall while he gets Clark (Clark Duke), intuiting that Jan has an attraction to underage men due to her rumored affair with her 17-year-old former assistant Hunter. After he introduces Clark to her, Jan says she will think about it, and tells everyone to leave her office except Clark. As Pam and Dwight leave, Dwight offers a sympathetic <b>comment</b> <b>to</b> Jan's assistant (a woman). Pam is pleased, seeing that some of the lessons they gave Dwight on women sunk in after all.|$|E

25|$|Australian wrestler Hassene Fkiri was {{ejected from}} the 96kg Greco-Roman {{competition}} and stripped of the silver medal after making an obscene gesture at the international FILA judges during the final. According to an Australian official, Fkiri was furious at his Indian rival Anil Kumar, who he accused of breaking the rules {{a number of times}} in the first period by holding Fkiri around the neck and head with two hands. The Australian received his first warning after he made a <b>comment</b> <b>to</b> the referee as he walked off the mat {{at the end of the}} two-minute period; when Kumar repeated the same move in the next round, Fkiri headbutted him and was issued a second warning. He then proceeded to swing his arms uncontrollably afterwards, which resulted in his third warning and eventual disqualification. After losing, Fkiri refused to shake hands with the victor.|$|E

Sivarak denied {{that he was a}} spy, and the Thai government claimed that he was innocent and that the incident was a Thaksin/Cambodian plot to further damage relations between the two countries. The Thai First Secretary was expelled from Cambodia. Sivarak demanded that former First Secretary Kamrob speak out and restore his damaged reputation by confirming he was not involved in a spy ring. Kamrob refused to provide <b>comment</b> <b>to</b> the press throughout the controversy, and Kasit's secretary, Chavanond Intarakomalyasut, insisted that although that there was no misconduct {{on the part of the}} First Secretary or Sivarak, there would be no statement from Kamrob.
